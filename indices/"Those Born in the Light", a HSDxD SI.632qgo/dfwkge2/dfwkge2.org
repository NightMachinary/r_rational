This may not be entirely rational of me, but whenever I see "self insert", I downvote.

SI characters in general are generally really bad, for two reasons:

1) They are the opposite of a rational character. They go into an illogical setting with knowledge and a (hopefully) logical approach to things, win a few battles easily by using pre-knowledge of the plot, and... That's it. No one ever really exploits this past "and then I helped best the boss early".

2) It's usually terrible writing, from a technical standpoint. If the SI isn't some flavor of Sue, then they're just an unnecessary added character who visits the stages of the canon regardless. Their addition changes a few minor details, but the overall scheme of things I'd unaffected.

If your SI is to have so little impact, why not just change one of the existing characters to better match what you want your SI to do?

And, for this specific work, good fucking luck making DxD rational. I actually tried this myself, with attempts at a Rational!Issei, which I had to scrap because I was changing literally everything about him, attempts at a Rational!DxD world with some OCs as new protagonists, which I had to scrap because I had to rewrite so much if the canon (seriously, fuck these 'balance breakers', fuck 'divine doubling/halving', fuck demon magic that just does whatever because I said so, and especially fuck 'divine doubling' because how the fuck does that even work and how has Issei not win everything by getting a hand grenade, hiding out in an alley, doubling it for a few days straight, pulling the pin, dropping it, and gating out as the landscape is reduced to loose particles from an explosion that would make the sub blush in envy).

I had to edit so many things that I had essentially filed off the serial numbers and was writing my own derivative fiction.
