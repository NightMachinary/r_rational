Precommitment to drinking wont work. What you need to do is commit to sit down at a computer with the comedtea easily within reach and look at a funny subreddit if and only if you didn't drink, and on a depressing subreddit if and only if you did drink. If you did it right, you can blackmail the universe to chose one of either a funny meme appearing on the sad reddit or a sad meme appearing on the funny reddit. Creepy, but not very useful.

So instead what you do is, you take any event in the world, that either already depends on true randomness, or you can make behave randomly by conditioning your actions on random.org output, and that has a decent chance of going the way you want - maybe 5%. Then you precomit to, if the outcome is not the way you want it to be, you'll roll a 100 sided dice on random.org, and if it's a nat100 you just let it go and do nothing (this is an IMPORTANT safety valve; otherwise you get 'Don't Mess With Time'), and otherwise you repeat the procedure in the above paragraph hundreds of times in rapid succession.

If you did everything correctly, your precommitments and technology and magic are strong enough, and nobody else is using similar techniques against you, you should find that the thing goes the way you want it 90% of the time instead of 5%, and the d100 comes up nat 100 all the times it doesn't (10%, ten times as often as it should).
