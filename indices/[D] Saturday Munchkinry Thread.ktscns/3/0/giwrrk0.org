One of the biggest problems here is [[https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Erwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/images/164/16459.png][atmospheric attenuation]] - essentially, air is not equally transparent to all wavelengths of light. Visible light is nearly unimpeded by air, while low-energy gamma rays will be halved every ~35m at sea level.

If it weren't for this, it would be trivial to just induce severe radiation poisoning and/or kill off parts of his brain via a thin and invisible beam of gamma rays. But this isn't possible from high altitudes without making the energy of the beam extremely high and extremely obvious.

You could also increase the energy of the gamma rays themselves, which decreases attenuation, but that also decreases attenuation in the /target/. I suspect that a beam that could penetrate kilometers of air and then induce radiation poisoning in a human-sized target would also severely irradiate anyone nearby, but I'd have to run some numbers to be sure, and a thin beam might not scatter enough to be a concern; anything that doesn't scatter would safely land inside the ground.

Another solution is a less energetic wavelength of light that does penetrate the atmosphere, like infrared. Burning a big hole would be extremely obvious, but a small hole could still potentially be effective. A needle-sized hole would likely self-cauterize without bleeding, but i'm not sure how much of a mark it would leave and doubtlessly it would /smell/ quite a bit. This is effectively laser surgery/laser cauterization on a more extreme scale, and those require ventilation to get rid of tissue smoke.

A slow induced heatstroke might work, but that's also similar to putting someone under a heat lamp, and that's probably pretty noticeable. If you're focusing on the head, then hair would also pose a problem.

Really the best solution here is probably subterfuge of some sort. A lot of assassinations are like this; for example, Georgi Markov's assassination via poisoned umbrella poke. Put on a wig and some sunglasses, sit on a park bench and wait for the target to walk by. Hit them with enough ionizing radiation to kill in days/hours/seconds depending on preference and surroundings and either make yourself scarce or act suitably concerned-bystander. If you do it precisely enough you could probably kill specific areas or target blood vessels to coagulate blood and make it look like a stroke, or make it an actual stroke. Still might not hold up to close scrutiny, though. This probably would not work from more than a few dozen/few hundred meters due to attenuation.
