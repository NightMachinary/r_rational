  If you did it right, you can blackmail the universe to chose one of either a funny meme appearing on the sad reddit or a sad meme appearing on the funny reddit. Creepy, but not very useful.

Or someone makes a joke on the funny reddit that isn't funny to you because it reminds you of some sad memory (such as when your dog died - maybe he choked on a tennis ball so you no longer find anything funny about tennis-ball jokes)
