This reminds me somewhat of the Turtle, from the Wild Cards universe - he's not super-strong in the conventional sense, but is rather a telekinetic. A /really/ powerful telekinetic, but with no defensive powers. His preferred way of handling fights is to float above the fight in a large metal cube, observing the area around him via cameras, and telekinetically manipulating stuff to attack. Anyone who wants to attack him back has to first /reach/ him, then get through some really tough armour plating...
