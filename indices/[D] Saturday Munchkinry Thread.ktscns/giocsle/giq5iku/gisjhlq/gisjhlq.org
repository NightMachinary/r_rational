Oh good catch with the blood. Speaking of which, once you have some form of engine, and steel, one thing you'll want to make is a high-powered centrifuge, for separating out all the myriad substances that are in everything and exponentially "zooming in" on them in enrichment. Lots of drugs can be made from almost any living cell, in theory you just need a single molecule of it to be in your sample and you'll get it /eventually/ with the centrifuge on high enough power. Also from just a drop of your own blood you can get infinite supplies off phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, flourine and zinc. Calcium from a shard of bone. Copper from a handful of soil. etc.

EDIT: Oh and some other tricks that might be handy: If you ever need clean water in an energency, not having fire handy to distill it, you can just duplicate and drink your own spit. Likewise, if you ever run out of food and cant find even the smallest insect, you can bite your own tungue and survive on drinking large amounts of your own blood.

Also, for clothing, ropes, and anything else you might need along those lines, just use spider silk, it's even sticky so attaching the strands into arbitrary length is trivial. This in general will replace everything you might normally use plant fibers for, and is stronger than kevlar or steel wires that we can make with our current technology for these purposes. For warmer clothing, you can duplicate your own body hair in an emergency, or take down from some small bird you find; presumably lots of more common birds have some down better than even eiderdown just in extremely small amounts and with no reasonable way to gather more than fractions of a gram.
