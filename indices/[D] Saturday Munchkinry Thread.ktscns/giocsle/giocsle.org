You are suddenly teleported onto a pristine, human free version of Earth. You are naked, unarmed, and alone. Luckily for you, it seems to be a nice, warm spring day. The wilderness reminds you of Canadian woodlands, a place known for harsh winters, bears, moose, wolves and .

You get a psychic message that informs you:

You must survive ten years. After that you will receive a chice to be teleported back to your world.

You get ONE minor superpower: you can copy any object. The object must fit through a ring between your index finger and a thumb: extra copy will appear out of thin air nearby in about 2-3 seconds.

How do you survive? How do you max the utility of your power to maximize the chances of survival?
