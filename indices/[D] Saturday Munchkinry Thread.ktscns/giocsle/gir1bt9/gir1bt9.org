Get a pointy stick, since the bears and wolves and such won't have learned their lesson about humans yet the way ours have. Hope you don't have to use it.

Look for: Nuts, berries, seeds, a running water source, dry moss, sticks of various thickness and dryness, clay, various fibrous plants, rocks that break with sharp edges, and a type of plant that grows large water-shedding leaves.

Duplicate and try some of the first nuts/berries/seeds you find, spacing trying new kinds out by several hours, so if something makes you sick you can narrow it down. You want to get on this early, before starvation makes your digestive system weird and makes it harder to figure out. You can put off looking for edible vegetables until later, since that's more hit and miss. Similarly, you'll want to rash test your fibrous plants.

Duplicate dry moss and small dry twigs to make a fire bed, then use the drill method to start a fire. This can be very hard so it's also something you want to do early while you're sharp. Once you have a fire going, duplicate larger sticks that'll burn slower and keep it going; better to never have to start a fire again if you can help it.

Duplicate ropes of clay to get more. If things go very quickly, try to make and fire a pot. If you succeed, you can boil water in it and drink that. If you get unbearably thirsty before that point, you'll have to risk drinking the water straight for a while.

Try various ways of disassembling/reassembling/twisting/braiding your fibrous plants until you find something that feels suitably strong for rope, and something that works for clothes. Duplicate ropes/threads/cords you like. Lash two pairs of long sticks into two A shapes dug into the ground, and another across, then lash your water-shedding leaf on top for shelter.

Once you have fire, food, water, and shelter, you can start improving your food source and shelter. For food you can try bugs, fishing (use a net), and working your way through potentially edible vegetables. For shelter you can start in on a wattle and daub hut, an excellent construction method that uses only long sticks and mud or clay, all of which you can duplicate.

Next up is making a bow and arrow, which can be duplicated, since they're long skinny objects (bow, string, arrow). Get good at that and kill a large animal like a deer. (They haven't learned about humans so you might be able to just shank one with a fire-hardened stick, but the animals will learn soon enough so get practicing.) Try to tan its hide with fire - I have no idea how this works and I bet you don't either, so expect it to take a few tries. Stock up on furs for clothing, blankets, wall hangings, and doors.

From here you're good until the winter. You'll want to upgrade your hut to have a twisted entry and maybe a fur door flap. A second layer of wall, if you can manage (it's Canada, after all). You have infinite firewood, and can duplicate and re-boil the same pot of water over and over again, so you're good on heat and water. Try a variety of schemes to preserve food (drying, smoking, making flour), but make sure you can hunt in case most of those spoil.

If you make it through one winter you can make it through ten. You don't really need to figure out agriculture with one person hunting and gathering in a pristine Earth, but you can try for convenience and something to do. Boredom, complacency, and routine risk taking would be your biggest risks from year two onwards.
