Survival is trivial. You have an infinite supply of wood for heating, cooking, and light. You can make an infinite supply of food. The real question is how close can you get to modern civilization in ten years.

[[/u/ArmokGoB]] has pointed out that getting clay would be trivial regardless of where you start. I'll add that once you have clay, you can easily start making kilns and then start making clay bricks, clay pottery, and clay piping.

Iron would also be fairly easy to make. You can use clay and wood to make charcoal. You can use your blood (or some other mammal's blood) as an initial source of iron. You can make an open-hearth furnace with a tall chimney so that the stack effect provides for a suitable intake air supply. Place the blood in a clay tube, copy repeatedly, get a large volume of it, then boil it all down to a solid cake. Copy the cake until you've got maybe 100 lbs. Put the mass of dried blood-cake into the furnace and get it extremely hot, enough for what little remains of it to become a white-hot mass of liquid - all other contaminants will be hot enough to be evaporated at that temperature, leaivng behind about 4-10 grams of mostly-iron. Use a clay ladle to scoop the slag off the surface, then let the iron cool, copy it, and start making iron of increasing purity. You can tinker with the iron chemistry by reducing or increasing silicon and carbon content until you have an iron or steel product that you're happy with.

You can use the clay to form molds and create an iron anvil. You can now start creating cast iron and wrought iron tools and parts. One of the initial big projects might be to make a furnace box and boiler for a steam engine to provide power for a metal roller so that you can start mass-producing sheet metal from your metal rods, allowing you to easily make various other components. This might be achievable within weeks after arrival - years is hard to imagine.
