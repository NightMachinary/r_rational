The 2-3 second limitation forces you to bundle really small items that you need a bunch of together into one “item” but other than that it is easy to work around. Duplicate one small item a few times, bind it to its copies into a bundle, duplicate the bundle, attach the bundles together end-to-end, repeat until you have a long bundle of convenient size.

In addition to general_obvious's ideas, you could do long strips of dried meat for food.

Once you've got one good piece of long, thin, smoothed, notched wood you are pretty set on basic building materials. If you planned your notches carefully and made them matching sizes you could make it so that you could interlock one piece of wood with duplicates of itself in useful ways that require a minimum of lashing, mortar, glue, or resin to hold together.

For advanced comforts... if you manage to find some native copper you'll be set on metal if you can get so much as a single piece. Even just a nugget would be good. For that matter, you could try panning for gold. Even a single speck of gold could be duplicated until they are a convenient number to smelt into a larger piece to be duplicated. Gold is a soft metal and thus easy to work and doesn't corrode easily.
