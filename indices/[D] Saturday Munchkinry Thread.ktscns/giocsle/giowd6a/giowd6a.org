Ok, let's see...

First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the environment will try to kill you, and you should try to tackle the most imminent murderous forces first. Your cheat-code is probably the only thing that can make survival possible.

Canadian woodlands means that the nights will be cold, warm day notwithstanding, and hypothermia will kill you. Since you can survive one day without drinking or eating, but not one night naked at below fifteen Celsius, that's your most urgent priority.

After that you will need water. Water means fire, because you need to boil it if you don't want to risk diarrhoea and hence a rather swift and unpleasant death. Boiling it entails (at minimum):

- firewood
- fire-starter
- a sharp and pointy stone wedge

Boiling will be a hassle because you won't have a suitable container, but we can make do.

Food and other necessities can be left for the morrow, or if you have time left after these two.

So, first thing first, try to find a fibrous plant, a weed would be best. Ideally something relatively dry, with a narrow, thin and flexible stalk that can be bundled and used as a simple string. Ferns and similar vegetation could also help, but you will need the weedy strings anyway. Take care to walk carefully and avoid cutting the sole of your feet, they're not callous yet and that could mean game over very quickly (and painfully).

As soon as you have one or a handful, copypaste it so that you can make bundles. Sheaves as thick around as your thumb-index ring shall suffice, and the length you should aim for is something between two and four feet (you can measure with your literal feet). You will want to tie the sheaves together at both ends and in the middle, but make them loose enough that you can estimate ten percent of their volume is air.

Keep one sheaf with you wherever you go, if you lose camp before night and you don't have one, you'll easily die.

Find a good spot to place your camp at. Ideal would be an empty and relatively shallow cave, but good luck finding one. Second best would be on a flat spot on the ground against a flat earth wall in a dry spot, and secluded as possible. In any case you should go for secluded first (for predators and weather), then flat (no running water in case of rain that can wash your bundles away), then dry (better insulation against the cold). Attempt to remove as much debris from the ground as possible.

Multiply your sheaves like there's no tomorrow if you want there to be one. Then look for a sturdy but breakable branch, copy-ring in radius, straight and possibly five/six feet long. If you can't break it look for something narrower, but thick is best (that's what she said). Take it back to camp and make a couple dozens of those. Reserve one for firewood.

What you should do is make a bed of sheaves in two to four layers, coffin-wide for easy entry and exit but also good for keeping the heat in, then line it with sheaves in a tent shape, that is, balanced against each other across all the length of the bed. Think house of cards. Try to go for two of more layers.

To prevent the roof of your shelter from falling at the first push, plant the branches in the ground all along the sides, so that they cross at the top like a tepee. Since you don't have resource limitations, try to make two sturdy and dense walls of bundles and wood.

In the unlikely case that you found a cave or an earthen nook, do the same but against the vertical wall, while planting the branches even more strongly.

Now, depending on your luck, this might have taken as little as four or five hours, or as long as the whole first day.

Anyway this comment is getting long, let me know if you care for more.
