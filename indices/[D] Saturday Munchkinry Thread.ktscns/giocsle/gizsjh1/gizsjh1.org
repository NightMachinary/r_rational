Does the object need to fit completely through? More specific, if I were to take a long stick could I only stick it partially through and duplicate the whole stick?

If so, this can be used to solve the biggest problem: loneliness and psychological health. I'd simply stick my other index finger through to generate a clone of myself and then I'd have someone to talk to so that I wouldn't go insane after six months or so.
