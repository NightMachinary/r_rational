Then more I shall post.

Remember, when you sleep, to fashion covers for the top and bottom of your small shelter, in order to keep the heat in. This might mean too much carbon monoxide in the air, but it's better than freezing. Leaving a small opening could help in this regard.

Ok, so either half a day or a whole day has gone by depending on your luck. You'll want to continue with the water quest or rest for the evening, or get on to it when you wake.

[Note here, if it's not as warm outside as it was the previous day, you might jump ahead to the making of emergency, temporary clothing.

To do this you will want thinner bundles of weed and possibly fern, a quarter of the diameter of the shelter bundles or less, shoulder to mid thigh in length. Make one and multiply, then bound them in two panels as wide as your torso (use some weeds to bind the bundles in a chain, one to the next, going through the middle, trying for a very tight rope ladder). Use even thinner, more flexible bundles to tie the "top" with multiple shoulder straps, two thirds of a foot between the two panels. Try it on.

Now use similar strips to connect the panels at your hip, leaving again a bit of play. Fold and crease the panels at the same height, so that they will leave you free to walk. If it's cold enough, you may want to add bundles on the sides.

This cover, should it be necessary, will last you long enough to start weaving in earnest later on. Also if you're efficient it can be built in under one hour, given you magical powers.]

Now for water. Counter-intuitively, the first thing you want to get in order to have drinkable water is a sharp rock. Look for a big rock, then find some smaller ones that are a bit larger than your fists. Not all rocks break the right way, you will need to find different kinds and try them.

Break the smaller rocks by throwing them on the large one, until one breaks in a wedge shape, then break some smaller fragments until you get one that is about as pointy as a chunky arrow tip.

{Now you'll need to find a fairly thick length of wood, better if it's a soft wood. You'll need to use the wedge rock against one end, so that the grain starts to split in the middle. Take care to split it as cleanly as possible, separating the wood grain by muscle power after it begins to split, then use some rock edge to carve as much of the core of the branch as possible, making two halves of a cup (a long cup). Later, when you're better prepared, you will be able to use resin as tar for sealing the two halves, but for now just go for the simple solution.

Use strings of weed to tie the two halves back together, and you got a very basic container for water. Keep the rocks and the container with you. If the container is thin enough, duplicate it to keep one in reserve, but this is not necessarily essential.}

[EDIT: I've thought about it, and the previous paragraphs are still worth remembering, but there's an even simpler and faster method for making an improvised bottle if you find the right materials.

Look for any kind of hollow stalk plants like cattail or horsetail, or with a very soft core that you can pierce with a thin twig, like wild fennel, or indeed any sort of straw-like plant, then string a handful of them together and use them as a simple cup.

I would suggest though to first drink a few sips and wait some half hour for adverse effects before you drink from them, just for safety.]

Now you need to find a source of water. Going downhill is the easiest way, as smaller rivulets and dew will converge there. Be careful not to lose base.

After you've found the source of water, here comes the hard part. Break another relatively thick branch in half with the stone wedge. If you feel confident enough in your crafting skills, try to split the half branch again to a small plank of wood. Using the pointy rock you made before, carve a small indent close to the edge of the "plank", by twisting clockwise and anticlockwise the stone point. Go from one face to the centre, then go from the other face to the same spot.

Making a fire is not easy, especially if you've never tried before and never saw it done. I'll write the procedure in a following post later.

Cheers.
