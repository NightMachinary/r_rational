A bit of delay, sorry.

I made a mistake before, don't drill the notch on the plank from both sides, but only on one side and then cut a small v-shape from the edge of the plank to the centre of the notch.

So, making fire. You carved a notch in the small plank of wood, and you need to find a straight stick with the same diameter as the notch. then you need a flat nonflammable surface, like a rock, green ferns, moss, or a large leaf to collect the embers.

If you make fire for boiling water, it's immensely easier, given your resources, to do so near a stream or river.

Prepare beforehand by gathering a handful of the driest twigs you can find (and multiply), some fluffy-dry tinder to place the embers in, and some progressively thicker twigs and branches. Some examples of tinder are cattail fluff, dandelion fluff, dry weeds, crushed dry leaves and smartphone applications. If you don't find anything fluffy and dry enough, you can make do with wood shavings to be obtained with a sharp edge of a rock, and then beating them between two rocks to reduce them to small bits.

Bundle the tinder in a bird nest shape, loose enough for a bit of air to blow through. You can put this nest in a further bundle of kindling, as it will have to go there eventually anyway. It's also easier to arrange the rest of the wood in a tent shape, with the thinnest wood on the inside and progressively more meaty branches on the outside. It also makes sense to surround the fire-pit in rocks, for safety and for keeping the burning coals all together.

Now for some exercise: place one end of the straight stick in the notch, place the nonflammable surface under the notch, place your palms in a prayer shape at the top-end of the stick, and spin back and forth. You can use a foot or both feet to keep the plank from wandering all over the place. You need to press down a little, which means that your hands will slide down, at which point you will put your arms back at the top and keep spinning without losing too much momentum.

You need to go as fast as possible while keeping in mind that it will take minutes. Your arms will burn and you hands will hurt. Keep going.

After a while, the place of contact will start to squeak like old wooden flooring. Keep going. You will notice some wood powder accumulating out of the v-shape onto the nonflammable surface. Keep going. You will start to get a bit of a burnt smell. Keep going, you're almost there. The wood powder will start to smoke a little. You're there.

[It's possible (or even likely) that your first try will fail, so keep that in mind and don't be discouraged.]

Now take the smoking embers and blow /gently/ on them, so that they start to glow and be consumed by a fire-less glow. Place the embers at the centre of you tinder nest, blow on it a bit until even more smoke comes out, gently close the nest around the embers, gently blow until even more smoke comes out, softly wrap the nest in the kindling and then in thin twigs and swipe the thing back and fort. A lot of smoke should come out, probably more than you would expect, which is perfect.

After a while of you doing this, the nest and twigs should hopefully catch on fire. Quickly but carefully place them under the wood tent that you prepared beforehand, and if everything goes well you'll have your own small bonfire. Achievement unlocked!

Multiply sticks and add them to the fire until it roars, being careful not to suffocate the flames. Multiply even more sticks for later, and add a couple of thicker logs to stabilise the fire.

Then comes the water part.
