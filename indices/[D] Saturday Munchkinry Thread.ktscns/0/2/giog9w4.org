You should not want for clothing or caloric intake, at least once you've produced the first few items of each. You can replicate wheat seeds in significant quantity by putting them in a narrow cylinder, though milling them would be an issue---maybe rice would be better, especially since it's less temperamental to grow. By the same idea you could replicate rolled-up textiles or leather, once produced, and you'd only need to spin a single thread to get started---and once woven, you could replicate the finished fabric as much as you want.

You might also be able to replicate things like arrows, if you could figure out how to make an effective bow. Almost certainly you'd have a surplus of rudimentary spears, tent-pegs, and rope, again conditional on you actually figuring out how to make those things, which is absolutely not a given.
