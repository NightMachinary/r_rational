  maybe rice would be better, especially since it's less temperamental to grow

One big issue is that a pristine Earth lacks most of the carefully cultivated crops we're used to. Even the early agriculture versions were much easier and more productive than their wild variants. You /might/ be able to find [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_rice][wild rice]] (which despite its name isn't strictly rice), but it's not a given. Most of your grains will be tough, weedy grasses that take a lot of work and aren't super palatable.

On the plus side, animal sources should get easier. Fish sticks should be much more plentiful with rivers and lakes unpolluted and undepleted. Large game will be more common and lacking wariness of how dangerous a human can be with a bow or spear. (Which aren't trivial to make from scratch, but still quite doable)

Also, there are issues with preservation and spoilage. Perfect duplication means everything goes bad at the same rate. You're dumped into spring luckily, but making it through the first winter will still present serious challenges.
