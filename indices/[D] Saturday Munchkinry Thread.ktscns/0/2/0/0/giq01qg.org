  Also, there are issues with preservation and spoilage. Perfect duplication means everything goes bad at the same rate. You're dumped into spring luckily, but making it through the first winter will still present serious challenges.

Winter should actually make everything easier since you'll have access to ice for food preservation. You could build an ice house and then fill it after finding the first decent icicle you come across, then restocking it as needed throughout the remainder of your stay. The bigger the icehouse and the better you insulate it, the longer the ice will last and the less you'll need to work on restocking it. For insulation, you could either use a hair or a down feather and then copy it until you're copying entire wads of insulation to stuff into the gap between the inner and outer walls, floor, and ceiling of the ice house.

If you make the floor of the ice house out of wood poles covered with melted beeswax, and give it a gentle slope, you could also drain the meltwater into a cistern to be used as a supply for irrigation, washing, and potable drinking water for three seasons per year.

You could build your home on a hill or slope to avoid flooding, to manage standing water and rainwater drainage (especially if you build a basement), and to easily drain sewage away from your home. You could build the ice house (or else a rainwater cistern) up the slope from your home. This would allow you to set up a pressurized water source for taking showers. Pipes and pipe fittings could be made with fired clay pipe sections, bored-out poles of wood, or semi-flexible tubes of beeswax wrapped with a leather support, or woven support made of natural fibers.

If you want hot water, you could simply make a long coil of fired clay piping and run it through a clay firebox. While showering, you could control the water temperature by diluting the hot water with more or less cold water. The cold water could be run through a semi-flexible tube of wrapped beeswax (possibly blended with tree resin or tallow to make it more pliable), and you could place a tray to hold rocks on top of the tube. More rocks would increase the pressure constricting the tube resulting in less flow so the blended water coming out of the shower would becomes hotter.

Your sewage system could also divert the water in different directions, so used shower and sink water might be used to irrigate any plants you're trying to cultivate, while toilet water could be directed to a niter bed so that you could procure potassium nitrate and, after about a year, you could start making gunpowder.
