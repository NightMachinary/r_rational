If I understand this correctly, this superpower is not so minor, basically doubling any glandular or fluid material with a 3 second doubling time. If you have a sand grains worth, and duplicate it for 1 minute, you got slightly less than a solid cubic meter of the stuff.

If you take some random insect, and find a single palatable organ - the liver is a good bet - you can eat yourself just as fat as if you had unlimited money on McDonalds. Find a single berry and duplicate it for unlimited fruit and juice to drink. If you don't like insect meat you just need to find or capture a single dead mouse or sparrow. For flour, you can crush just a single random grass seed - the choice of wheat and moren breeds is just for larger yields and being easy to farm - between two rocks thoroughly /once/, and you can duplicate the finished product with no further labor. You probably don't need to walk even 5 meters from your spawning point to find ALL of these, and it's not een particularly difficult in the winter. I expect the resulting diet would be superior in quality and variety to what most people can afford in the modern day.

For energy via fire, experiment with animal fats from insects, pollen, seed oils, from whatever you can reach without even needing to get up from where you sat on the ground. No need to know what it is or think; it's just a few minutes of experimentation to find the best combination in terms of ease to handle and not being gross, all the possibilities will have more than enough energy, and if it turns out to store badly you can just do it again. So you have an extremely flammable sludge, by the cubic meter. Copious amounts of this together with random plant bits will let you make a massive bonfire every night that stays lit until morning, although it might need a few nights of practice. You don't even need a house for winter you could just brute force it with infinite energy making bigger fires. If you manage to make ANY steam engine; not an industrial revolution one, the absurdly inefficient ancient greek one - you've got infinite labor and energy. Efficiency doesn't matter. If you find a chunk of magnetite and wrap a gold wire around it a handful of times, you can have a hundreds of those going at once to get as much electricity as you need. Not that you'll need any.

For building you'll probably want clay. Grab a handful of random dirt, a flat rock, and mix it with water. you can make really shitty clay by washing it, just a few grains. dupe that up and mess around with it like a 3 year old during recess, no thought or knowledge required, and you'll eventually have some of the component grain types act differently and change relative concentration. Keep duping the best ones up, and after not to long you'll have magnified the singular ideal grain that was in that dirt, at a concentration that if you didn't have the power you'd have to sift through a many cubic meters to find a single grain, and made high quality clay. Since you can optimize for grain shape, and grind and crush identical duplicated grains into non-identical ones and repeat this, with a bit of work you might even get weird nano and metamaterial properties in your ceramics we even with modern tech can only make small amounts of in the lab.

From this, you can make legos. Again, you have unlimited supplies and zero time pressure, so you can experiment with different design and practice to get good - the sculpting of clay is one thing you'll ant to get really good at. Make sun dried ones to test, then when you've decided on your standard you dupe a bunch of wet ones and throw them into the fire. Now, a fire is not a clay baking kiln, you normally need the temperature to be right, a proper environment, something for the clay to rest on, etc... but if you throw in HUNDREDS of the things 99 times they'll crack and shatter, but you only need ONE to come out successful. I recommend a design around 4x4x50 cm, using a standard stick to poke holes on one end and add clay cylinders on the other.

Or if you feel like it you can skip clay, and try panning for gold. No need far a pan, good technique, or anything else; you only need 1 grain, and even if it takes 100 times as long as if you had those things to just use your bare hands it's not with the time investment. Then you infinidupe it, and you can make your lego from solid gold. And then build your entire house out. of. 100%. solid. gold.

Regardless of if you use gold or clay, you just start building. You can dupe the parts as fast as you can place them down, and there's no need to even lift them since you dupe them already at a height above where you're going to place them. You COULD make a quick survival hut like this, but it's literally as easy as playing minecraft and you have all of your needs seen to, so you might as well make it a giant castle.

I could go on forever with this, but I think I've made my point. Also, note that most of this does not need a skilled survivalist or a scientist, most of it is stuff a 5 year old would probably figure out faster than both those adults. Your only REAL problems would be boredom and loneliness... but you can probably with a bit of experimentation to figure out the exact rules and definitions, and spending MONTHS thinking about the problem rather than the 5 minutes I have, figure out how to cheat in larger things, and then /duplicate yourself/ for a copy-clan of company and labor.
