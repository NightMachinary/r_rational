I'm guessing either this will either never occur to you or something else prevents you from doing so (if nothing funny were to actually happen) since timelines in universe seem to be self consistent. I think about it like trying to kill your own mother before you were born. If you exist in the same timeline you are sure to fail.

Another idea which is still compatible with the above is that you laugh at ideas which are generated at the moment you drink.
