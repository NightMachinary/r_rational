There are three obvious paths that come to mind, which can work on just about any sidewalk:

1. Drop something heavy on him, by breaking it off with heat vision. This has the obvious problems of not being guaranteed to kill him, and being likely to be noticed as your activity, especially if people are aware of your activity
2. cook his brain. Use wide-angle heat vision on his entire body, but especially his head. If you heat him up slowly, he might not notice until it is too late. Eventually, he would go into heat stroke and eventually die if untreated. If he notices, he can take cover of course and likely be safe. If done properly, people will confuse this with natural causes until an autopsy reveals that there was nothing to cause the body to overheat like that
3. laser his brain through his ears. You would need to tune the wavelength of light emitted by supermans' eyes carefully such that it has sufficient penetration to get to his brain, but not so much penetration as to go out the other side. You would have to test and calculate this carefully. Then, you would need to position yourself so that you could see straight down the Target's ear-hole. This would be noticeable the astute observer, especially if they were suspicious of you and knew where you were at the time.
