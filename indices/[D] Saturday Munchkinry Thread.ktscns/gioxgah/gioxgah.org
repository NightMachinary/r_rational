You are Superman. You want to kill someone on the ground from high above in the sky using your “heat vision”. Your heat vision is actually a ray of radiation that can transmit at energy level, from infrared to gamma ray. You can make it as narrow as you want. The challenge is to kill a man on the ground from the sky without anyone noticing you using your heat vision/ death ray or being harmed. Preferably you want to kill him by exposing his brain to such a lethal amount of radiation that he dies instantly or within minutes. Is there any such way to do this kind of spot radiation assassination? If not would it have to just be through microscopic heat vision burning a small hole in his brain? Thanks.
