There's no way to do that. Because even if he fell over from a heart attack, right now, by sheer coincidence that has /nothing/ to do with you... then Batman would /suspect/.

But if you'll be happy with a state where Batman can't /prove/ anything... then, when it comes to superspeed, well, Batman just needs to /blink/.

...the other option is to keep a very close eye on the Joker. And then hit him while neither you nor Batman are anywhere /close/ to him. (Midnight is good). And if you can kill him via a bullet to the head - well. No-one will suspect /that/ coming from /Superman/. They'll all be looking for a gun. Which won't exist. (At least, not ten seconds after the bullet is delivered). And who would ever believe that /Superman/ would use a /gun?/
