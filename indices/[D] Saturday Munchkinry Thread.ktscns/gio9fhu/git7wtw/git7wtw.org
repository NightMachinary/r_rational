Minor question, but can you turn the strength on and off like a switch or is it permanent? Because that'd change the way you have to get by on a day to day basis. Also, if its permanent but changeable is it "focus to use strength" or "focus to not use strength" because inebriation and other losses of control (other people's powers?) would be a potential problem?
