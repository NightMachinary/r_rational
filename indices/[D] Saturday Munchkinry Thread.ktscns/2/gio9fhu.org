I have some CYOAs I am working on. I am having a hard time balancing one of them. It features a super inventor power set: [[https://imgur.com/a/kfd4qZc]]

I wanted to avoid allowing the player to invent anything, but still leave it open ended enough. So I organized it around various advanced materials, components, super senses, and minor super powers. But how far can you get out of a good synergy of these minor capabilities?

On an unrelated note how far can you get with super strength with no secondary powers to support it? (I.e. no tactile telekinesis, no enhanced frictional force, equal and opposite reactions whenever you push something, etc.). At what point does increased super strength stop being useful because you have no way of leveraging/applying it? Also, how much increased movement speed do you get out of super strength?

Oh and the other CYOAs if anyone is interested: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/knjbza/return_of_magic_2020_reset_overview_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]]
