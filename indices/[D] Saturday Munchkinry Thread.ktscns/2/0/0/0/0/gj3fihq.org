Print novel series: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Cards]]

The actual identity of the Turtle is a subject of some debate in-universe (you just /try/ getting him out of that cube of his) but he is human, merely affected by the Wild Card virus (90% of people who get the virus die quickly, and sometimes horribly; 90% of the survivors end up with merely some sort of hideous mutation and/or minor powers; the remainder end up with superpowers). He's named after his strategy.
