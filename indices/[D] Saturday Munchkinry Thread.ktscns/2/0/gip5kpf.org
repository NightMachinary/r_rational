I had a superhero concept character with the super strength as their power, called Tungsten Man or Tungsten Knight. The idea is, one of the absolute biggest advantages of such a power, especially without invulnerability, is that you can wear MUCH heavier armor than even the strongest human-sized vehicles could wear, and that extra weight on it is actually an /advantage/ since it literally doesn't slow you down. Further, wearing such armor actually solves a lot of the other problems - you have much better grip to use with pushing, much greater energy in your punches before the acceleration gforce will liquify the tissue of your hands, can spread force across a much larger area both on the outside on things you're lifting and on the inside using special padding, can jump much further without air resistance slowing you down to terminal velocity, etc.

It also synergizes way with two other main overlooked advantages of super strength: you can carry a gun normally far to heavy and with far to much recoil for a human to use - in my characters case a rotary autocannon normally mounted on aircraft - and you can carry a comically oversized backpack full of ammo and gadgetry.

Commissioning such a suit, it's a good idea to include lots of gadgetry, and make it also function as hazmat and diving suit and carry its own air supply (so basically, a space suit), making you immune to many of the dangers like toxins and drowning that even favourable superheroes are vulnerable to. It might also be a good idea to ad dynamos to the joints, creating elecricity to power the suit from your movements.

The end result capabilities and looks are a lot like extremely heavy power armor, think 40k space marine - except it can be done with modern realistic tech and doesn't need the power source which is normally the biggest issue with such designs since /you/ are the powersource.
