I'm not sure exactly what you mean by how far could you get? What's the goal we're trying to get to? :)

If the goal is a comfortable life I'd use the super strength to make myself into a one woman power plant, the generated energy could be sold and used to fund a needlessly luxurious lifestyle. In terms of at what point would it stop being useful, if you had an alien invasion occurring I guess the useful limit would be when waste heat energy is enough to ignite the atmosphere, assuming you were chucking rocks at the UFOs. Sorry if that's a little weird or different from what you were asking!
