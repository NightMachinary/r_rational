I've been torn between recommending this because the Dark Age of Technology faction makes many rational fic style decisions and because the idea of a faction of DAOT survivors encountering the 40k universe is super interesting, and disliking it due to 100k words of extreme grimdarkness and unending war against chaos.

The story is still updating and has recently reached the "current" 40k universe.
