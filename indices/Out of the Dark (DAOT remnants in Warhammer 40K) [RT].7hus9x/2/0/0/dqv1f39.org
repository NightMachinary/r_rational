The budding Dark Eldar completely failing to give a shit about anyone else but themselves is a pretty sensible reason for GRIMDARK.

  The sun had gone. The Eldar masters of the Galaxy using the ancient construction of the Old Ones had removed the star to be placed in their webway. Providing light to the great port city of Commoragh the nexus of the labyrinth dimension that granted them swift and easy traversal of the Galaxy. Without the suns warmth or the grip of gravity the planet spun out of control through the void. Descending into a winter that ended only when the remnants of the atmosphere itself froze over. Whether the eldar had bothered noticing the planet was inhabited or just hadn't cared was a mystery and completely irrelevant to the poor creatures who had spent their last moments huddled around fires lit by their own burning libraries.
