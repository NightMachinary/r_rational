Well, this /is/ a setting that started out as a parody of grimdarkness. Still that's hardly an excuse for fanfic authors to keep it going. I saw this a while ago and dropped it early because I wasn't sure I liked where it was going- it seemed that the DaoT humans were going to be the standard mary sue op humans that beat up the aliens who have done X to make the audience angry (the transcendent humanity formula, stars I hate that fic)- but if that's not the case I might pick it up again.
