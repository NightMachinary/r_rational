There is more of that than I'd like. That said, it is less that the bad things don't make sense, because the actions always make sense to the characters in context for a greater good of some sort, but the mechanics/rules of the universe are designed to be a bit sadistic.

My specific issue was with the use of torture to turn demons back into people. Why choose that in particular as the way to do it? The author comments about this being justified by the results but it is justified because the author decided this is how the setting works.

To be fair to the author, the actual warhammer 40k setting has tons of this too, where the only way to accomplish things is by being awful on a massive scale. For example the emperor's throne/ the astronomicon basically eating psykers as sacrifices to keep him alive, and a massive inquisition that purges "heresy", new technologies, and free thought being the primary defense against chaos, and the DAOT faction ends up looking good in comparison.
