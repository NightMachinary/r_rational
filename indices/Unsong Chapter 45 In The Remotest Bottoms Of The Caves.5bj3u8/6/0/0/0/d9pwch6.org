Strong enough that uriel's young (even factoring in her immortality, shes probably around Aaron's age) protégé can literally snap her strings on the instant without using mundane kaballa. Sarah may be the most horrifying collection of names, ability to speak them flawlessly in fractions of a second and a dangerous mental instability, but she's still on level 1 of the kaballa ladder. Sohu accidentally started messing with 4 just to prove she could. Sarah is nothing to Uriel, bot in terms of power and his professed meanglessness of having a soul. To him, shes a computer with an ego and some misgotten divine light. To Sohu, shes a loud but minor annoyance.
