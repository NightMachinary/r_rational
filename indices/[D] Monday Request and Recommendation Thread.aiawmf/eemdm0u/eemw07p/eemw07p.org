Would 40k fit your criteria? The Imperium of Man is beset on all sides by monstrous creatures that are either radically non-human (tyranid, demons) or have been horrifically mutated away from the baseline standard (Chaos Space Marines). Bonus points for the "civilized" races of the galaxy having declared an unofficial truce at the current time in the setting to avoid being overwhelmed by all the monsters.

There's The Day of the Triffids, in which humanity is beset by giant carnivorous plants that move.

There's season 5 of Angel (the TV show), which is about the sheer impossibility of human beings standing up to the absurd number of extra-dimensional monsters waiting to gobble us all up. I don't want to spoil the finale, but it's probably the single best resolution to any TV show I've ever seen. Also [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WufQYZYzJk][the previous season contains my all time favourite TV speech]]

Mass Effect is about the species of the galaxy uniting to fight off the eldritch horror of the reapers.

Dragon Age Origins is about uniting the species of the land against the blight, a mutating corruption that warps anyone it touches into twisted freaks.
