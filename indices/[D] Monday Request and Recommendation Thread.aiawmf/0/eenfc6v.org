I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost /designed/ to mainly have all those qualities, /sigh/. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate.

Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.

Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-/Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure/.

Naruto Self-Inserts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize][Sanitize-]] Female SI, professional doctor reincarnated in the ninja warring clans era. Has no knowledge of Naruto. Very Slow updates.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10531500][Kaleidoscope-]] Male SI, reincarnated as an Uchiha. He knows the culling is coming for him and his clan he must do everything to survive it. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12794658/1/Son-of-Gato][Son of Gato-]] Male Villain SI, reincarnated with the gamer powers. It has NSFW harem/wish fulfillment but does a really good job showing power levels. I am rooting for the canon characters to shut the SI down in this fanfic. Slow updates.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon][Walk on Moon-]] Female SI, Reincarnated as the yamanaka heir. Mixed feelings with this one but I felt like it deserves a recommendation because it's one of the few SIs that strive to become a S class ninja. Hiatus.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wilted-irises-naruto-si.52403/][Wilted Irises-]] Male SI, reincarnated as the hyuga heir. It is very new with only 20k words but so far it is well-written with a constant goal in mind. Reading this you feel like you yourself are a hyuga in the self-insert's shoes. Fast updates.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/][Sleight Advantage-]] Male SI, reincarnated as an average civilian. Joining the ninja academy he must make due with his below average chakra coils so he specializes in magic misdirection. Dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264082/1/What-Doesn-t-Kill-You][What doesn't Kill you-]] Female SI, reincarnated as Orichimaru's supposed daughter. Has one of the most realistic and amazing Root induction scenes out there. I highly recommend just for this arc. Dead.

Worm Self-Inserts.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/stealing-fire-worm-si.31344/][Stealing Fire-]] Male SI, transmigrated into brockton bay and triggered as a human biology tinker. SI makes logical decisions given the circumstances. Hiatus.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/tyrant-of-the-bay-worm-cyoa.14472/][Tyrant of the Bay-]]Reincarnated and later triggered as an overpowered alexandria. Has alot of wish fulfilment and fix-it but it builds up to it and doesn't come out of nowhere. Dead.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-going-native.17415/][Going Native-]] Male SI, reincarnated and later triggered with the power to rewind time a couple of seconds. Very fun shard and makes a point to rationally avoid taylor to not butterfly the plot to earth bet's doom. Dead.

Young Justice/Dc comic self inserts.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With this Ring-]] Male SI, transmigrated to the moon orbiting earth with an orange power ring. He proceeds to munchkin and deconstruct the dc universe. Fast updates.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blink-and-youll-miss-it-young-justice-si.648947/][Blink and you'll miss it.-]] Male Villain SI, transmigrated to gotham with a teleportation powerset from the movie, Jumper. Makes a name for himself. Hiatus.

Game of Thrones Self-inserts.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-lion-beyond-death-au-got-si.663742/][A lion beyond death-]] Male SI, bodyswapped into Jaime Lannister during the day of Mad king Aerys death. The SI does everything he can as the heir to the westerlands to prepare for the long night. Dead.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12875401/1/A-Fish-Out-of-Water-ASOIAF-SI][A fish out of the water-]] Male SI, body swapped into Edmure Tully during king Jeoffry's Rule. Has no memories of Edmure so he has to improvise names of his closest friends not covered in the show. Truly a fish out of the water.Slow updates.

Harry Potter Self-inserts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me][Magical Me-]] Male SI body swapped into Professor Lockhart. With the knowledge of the future the SI strives to become an actually useful defense against the dark arts profesor. Dead.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff][Whats Her Name in Hufflepuff]] Female SI transmigrated into a 10 year old version herself in the HP universe. There isn't really any outright characteristic that makes this self insert stand out. It is just everything I was looking for of what would someone logically do being transmigrated to the HP universe. She rationalizes her decisions and she even delves into the topic of childishly arguing with her fellow preteen classmates, being a 30 year old woman, because of her now young hormonal body. Slow updates.
