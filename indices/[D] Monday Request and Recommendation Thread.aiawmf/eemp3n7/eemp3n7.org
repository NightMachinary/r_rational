I'm in the middle of reading "Dread Nation", a story where people started turning into zombies during the american civil war. I would highly reccommend it; it's not an apocalypse story, and does its best to examine the kind of society we e'd see afterwards. (With some concessions to the fact that it's YA, of course.)
