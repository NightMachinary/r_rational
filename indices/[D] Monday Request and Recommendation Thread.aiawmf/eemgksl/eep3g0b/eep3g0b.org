There are more chapters in the alternate history forum version but it requires a login. I haven't read recent updates but many chapters are written as history books.

Expect the Spanish Inquisition to be involved. The SI comes across as competent and introduces/exploits some modern inventions but also creates secret police, oppresses subjects, starts burning people who rebel against him alive. Maybe historical since during Spanish inquisition but still seems unnecessary. Actually this might fit both your alternate history and edgy/amoral requests...
