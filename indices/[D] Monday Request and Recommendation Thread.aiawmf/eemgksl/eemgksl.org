I'm seeking alternate-history stories written as history textbooks (or, at the very least, newspaper stories) rather than as stories focusing on individual protagonists. Examples include /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966.The_Shape_of_Things_to_Come][The Shape of Things to Come]]/ (excerpts from a single textbook), /[[https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/157898][Look to the West]]/ (excerpts from many textbooks), and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/57707][The Great War of 189---: A Forecast]]/ (articles from several journalists).

--------------

In related news, I'm also seeking stories that feature amoral/immoral/edgy protagonists. For example, if an edgy protagonist gets isekaied from the 21st century United States to a generic fantasy world, and he's informed that the servant girl who's waiting on him is actually a slave, rather than instantly erupting in abolitionist fury*, he asks his host about the details of thise particular fantasy world's peculiar institution. After further study, he may eventually come to the conclusion that this world's slavery is wasteful and he wants to abolish it after taking over the world---but he'll come to a conclusion after checking the economics, rather than instantly discarding it as an option. Even if he thinks it's bad in the long term, he may exploit it in the short term as a tool in his rise to power.

*I most recently saw this happen in /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53546][The Reluctant Swordsman]]/, but I'm pretty sure I've seen it many times before (though I can't recall any other examples at this time). See also Harry's reaction to Draco's rape comment in /HPMoR/.
