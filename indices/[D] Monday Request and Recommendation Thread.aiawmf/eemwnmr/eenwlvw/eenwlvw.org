The Traitor Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson - very rational protagonist and antagonists. This story gripped me from the first page. I found the prose amazing.

A story about a gifted girl of a small island nation that is taken over by a massive empire. Imagine a pre-gunpowder empire that is supremely competent, that builds free schools in neighboring nations as the first step before invasion/assimilation, for indoctrination and recruitment of geniuses. It also worships a twisted version of science that studies psychology and genetics and eugenics with a religious fervor.

Master Assassins by Roberts VS Reddick - the main protagonist is pretty rational, and the world feels very well crafted.

Great fantasy with a terribly mismatched title and cover. A story of two brothers trying to desert from a theocratic army, but with more layers beneath that than an onion. The worldbuilding and characterization are the real treats in the story. It starts slow, but it just keeps building more and more momentum until you're knocked over by the quality.
