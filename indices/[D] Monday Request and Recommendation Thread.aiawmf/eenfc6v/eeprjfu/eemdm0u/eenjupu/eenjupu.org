Ender's Game pretty much fits the description.

Bloom, by Wil McCarthy - the titular Bloom is grey goo, basically, nanotechnology that makes more of itself, and it's capable of adapting to survive attempts to destroy or contain it, and has devoured most of the inner planets. The remaining human civilization lives in the outer solar system, where it doesn't spread as easily since there's less available energy. It's been quite a while since I read it, but I think there was some infighting but it the plot didn't center around it. It was a pretty good book, as I recall (although not half as good as his later novels).

Uprooted, by Naomi Novik, is set in a nation bordering the Wood - a magical forest that is sapient, totally hostile to humans, and gradually expanding. There are monsters in the Wood, and people who spend too long there, or eat anything from inside, may be controlled by the Wood. The protagonist is from a small village not far outside it, and is sent to be a servant of one of the wizards whose job it is to keep the Wood from spreading. It certainly feels like the kind of story you mean, though it doesn't /quite/ fit on either count. There is a significant amount of conflict between humans, but nearly all of it is due to the Wood influencing people, Simurgh-style.

The first few chapters are fairly cliched, but I enjoyed it quite a bit over all.

None of these are perfect examples, but I think there all at least as close to what you want as War of the Worlds is, if not closer. I think I've read some others like this, but can't remember what right now. Might be back with more recommendations later.

Edit: capitalization fixes.
