I'm reminded of at least one /Subnormality/ comic, "[[http://www.viruscomix.com/page593.html][I Can Hear You]]".

To stretch "any medium", the premise as described kind of reminds me of the tabletop storytelling game /[[http://cavalrygames.com/ten-candles/][Ten Candles]]/, or at least the way I've seen it the couple of times I've seen it played. (There are apparently many examples of play on Youtube.) The basic skeleton of the game is that the world has gone dark, "They" have come, and all player characters will have died by the end of the game.
