  Would 40k fit your criteria? The Imperium of Man is beset on all sides by monstrous creatures that are either radically non-human (tyranid, demons) or have been horrifically mutated away from the baseline standard (Chaos Space Marines). Bonus points for the "civilized" races of the galaxy having declared an unofficial truce at the current time in the setting to avoid being overwhelmed by all the monsters.

The problem with 40k is that the imperium of man is beset by all sides-- including /inside./ So it fails point one pretty conclusively.
