*Request:*

Stories about humanity in a losing war against an outside threat, or, alternatively, about humanity trying to survive in an especially deadly world. Clarifications:

1. Preferably without infighting among the humans. /Definitely/ without dumb infighting which ends up overshadowing the outside threat itself.

2. There should be no possibility of negotiation with the threat --- or, at least, no /obvious/ one. (The threat shouldn't consists of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Zkzzjg3h7hW5Z36hK/humans-in-funny-suits][humans in funny suits]] pretending to be aliens. If they're aliens, they should be too alien for conventional diplomacy.)

3. Any medium: books, web serials, anime, video games, fanfiction, films, TV series...

I've consumed several stories based around this concept, but most fail either Point 1 or Point 2 (e. g., [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaywardPines][/Wayward Pines/]], [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan][/Attack on Titan/]], [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KabaneriOfTheIronFortress][/Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress/]]). Honestly, the best examples I know of are probably Wells' /The War of the Worlds/, and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][/Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest/]] (don't mind the name), which probably says something.

*Recommendation:*

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontypool_(film)][/Pontypool/]] is a very interesting horror film. It follows a group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town, who start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts.

This is one of these rare horror movies where the characters aren't complete idiots, and it features one of the best examples of a memetic threat I've seen outside of text-based fiction.
