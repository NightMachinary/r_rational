A couple of recommendations that I haven't seen on here recently, along with brief reviews. Both by the same author:

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/][Hope And Silence In The Hive]]: A 40k speculative fic about a warp creature who represents a very.... /different/ sort of emotion. Complete, illustrated. Not /particularly/ rational, but pretty reasonable for 40k fic. The author does an amazing job of conveying alien perspectives while staying pretty true to the general grimdark tone of 40k. The actual writing could be a little bit hard to follow at times- it's unclear if the author is an ESL speaker or just not much of an editor. But I found that the point always got communicated in the end, and the concepts underlying the story were interesting enough to keep me reading to the extremely over-the-top end. There is a sequel in the works, currently incomplete.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.616857/][Onward To Providence]]: An original sci-fi story, set in an astonishingly complex and intricate universe. The author clearly loves playing with unconventional physics and depicting unusual alien biology/psychology, and it really shows- some of the most high-concept creative fiction I've read in the last couple years. At times /too/ creative, alien and "spirit" segments can be extremely hard to follow and I found myself reading and re-reading sections like they were dense prose just to try and catch what the author was getting at. Handily illustrated which helped to clear up some confusion, and the author notes also proved invaluable. Ongoing and probably nowhere near complete. It's just such a treat to read an author who isn't afraid to tackle a world where the aliens are weird to /each other/ as well as to the humans.
