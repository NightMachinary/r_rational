[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/conference-call-multi-cross-worm-naruto-homestuck-mother-of-learning.682117/][Conference Call]] is a very interesting Mother of Learning/Worm/Homestuck/Naruto crossover fic. Yeah, you read those right.

Great characterization, very unique concept, literally unique crossover and some interesting applications of them. The only flaws I can find are a somewhat slow update rate (at least before recently) and a lack of crossover conflict as of yet.

The premise is simple. Certain side characters of those properties (and the main character of MoL) get connected by a mysterious interdimensional chat run by a moderator who goes by "Thunder". The chat eventually branches out into deeper connections between universes, like being able to use each other's magic systems, and the more the worlds cross over the better synergies they get. They also quickly figure out ways to munchkin the chat system so they can replicate mental abilities like an eidetic memory.

Highly recommended to anyone even vaguely interested in crossover fiction experiments, munchkinry and character development. Knowledge of the source materials is probably not required, though I think someone who hasn't read Worm would be pretty confused.
