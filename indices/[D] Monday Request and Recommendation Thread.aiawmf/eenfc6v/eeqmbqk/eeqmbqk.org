[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896][Hear the Silence]] is an amazing Naruto SI, that I recommend whenever SI recs are mentioned. Definitely the best Naruto SI I've read, and I've read a lot of them (though many come close). It's the only hurt/comfort fic that I've ever liked, and does it well.

Kyo, the main character, is reincarnated. While she does remember some Naruto, she remembers far from all of it. Except that that fact doesn't really even matter, because she's born way before canon (before Kakashi even), and it's clear that the world is way scarier and deadly than the one she knows from the Naruto manga.

Although a prodigy, she acts like and /is/ an actual kid, unlike almost all Naruto reincarnation SIs who are miniature adults who remember birth and yadayada. This fic is much better than that.

The original characters and canon characters are perfectly balanced in this fic: very few canon characters come into play, and the way all the characters get developed feel like it could've been a quality novel (fitting for this subreddit) all on its own. No hamfisting OCs or canon characters in; it's all natural and makes sense. (It's like we're in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] or something, huh.)

There was more compliments for it, that I probably forgot to put here, but whatever. Definitely put it on your list.

I know I've made comments like this before, so I'll dig through and find some of the other SI fics that I like in a bit. There is another recent Naruto SI that I like a lot (that I also put in a similar rec within the past few months), and another amazing Naruto SI that was especially notable because in that fic, Naruto the manga never existed, and it treated the SI differently in what it meant to be reincarnated (also balanced/underdog, despite being shippuden level powerful). I'll get those for you soon, plus a few others.

Also, some of those Naruto SIs are not like the others in quality. Sanitize is far above in quality than the others, and although Wilted Irises is good for a Hyuuga SI, it's not nearly as good as a few others on your list. The only one on your list that I haven't read is Son of Gato, for reasons you put right in its description. There is only one true Gamer Naruto SI (for me), and it's the one by Fulcon. All others I've tried are trash in some manner, even if they are readable (sometimes).

I'll get you some more in a bit, including a few non Naruto ones (since there are fewer non Naruto ones and consequently few amazing ones). At some point, I really need to make a huge rec list of all the SIs I've read, so that I can post a link to it on every rec thread...
