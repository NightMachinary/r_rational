I disagree that it reads like the typical saturated female SI. Kyo's a kid, so there is /zero/ gushing and Minato is really more of a friend/side character. It is /far/ from focusing on him; it's really more about OCs and Kyo's relationship with everybody in Konoha and how bad the war is.

It is less actiony than some other fics, but for me, it's just balanced. There is still a ton of action, even though Kyo's not throwing around tons of giant jutsu. The Uzushio arc was full of action, but terrifying at the same time.

While there is some slice of life, it's definitely not the boring shit I usually think of when I think about that genre. Slice of life to me is everyday boring shit. Slice of life, here, is character development, so that you feel awful when people die or get hurt, or even when they're simply in danger.

  Slice of life and gushing how hot minato is gets very old especially *when you are a guy and can't relate*.

I am a guy. The point of this fic is that it's an inversion of tons of bad cliches you see in bad female Naruto fanfiction. It's not focusing on sexy characters or romance. It's not focusing on how nice people are, or how powerful the SI is. It's not focusing on the SI changing shit.

This fic is more like an OC living in a brutal terrible world, with family and friends under the constant threat of death. Nobody cares she's been reincarnated, Kyo's trying to make sure she doesn't fucking die.

Tbh, you might be remembering a different fic than I am. I hate romance, so I'm ecstatic there's none of that here. Whatever you just mentioned or are thinking of, that's not this fic.

This fic is more in line with Sanitize -- but with more character development -- in how it subverts the typical female SI.
