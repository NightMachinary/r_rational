[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple][The Dragon King's Temple]] is a rather excellent SG1/ATLA crossover.

The Toph, Zuko, Carter, and Dr. Frasier get abducted by a Goa'ould and end up cooperating to escape back to Earth, where the SGC stars working on a way to get the benders home. This is made more difficult by the language barrier and the fact that, while Toph and Zuko /look/ human, there are some important differences.

As an added bonus, it's even a completed story.
