  You might be able to get away with a world of magical singletons whose magic operates such that it is never empirically verifiable.

I'm pretty sure you can't really do that in rat fic. In a connected world, covering every single measurable axis of the aggregate effect would pretty much require it to have no measurable aggregate effect, wouldn't it? And if individual magic users know exactly what those effects are, and they still can't find any way to measure them? It boggles the mind to think that such a world could be self-consistent.
