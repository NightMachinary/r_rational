If you read some SCP foundation fiction, on one hand there are a massive contingent of people supposedly maintaining the masquerade. On the other hand, there are nonetheless communities and organizations operating outside the veil, such as AWCY or the GOC, even in contact with the common people, in the form of small weirdnesses.

The real reason the Masquerade exists in the end is to justify the reader's disbelief. But perhaps, really, the reader Nd the whole world believed all along, and were lying to themselves in a form of apparently rational doublethink.
