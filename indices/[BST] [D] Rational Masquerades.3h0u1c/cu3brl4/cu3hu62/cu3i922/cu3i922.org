On the other hand, you could introduce the main character to magic through an unreliable third party. In that case, you could have part of the story revolve around whether or not the magic is even real, and how it can be rationally accounted for. The story might be about balancing Bayesian reasoning and the implications of magic or the lack thereof on ethical decisions.

I do agree that magic not starting off as powerful will be an inherent component of the story. I do think that makes it more challenging and fun to make efficient, though.
