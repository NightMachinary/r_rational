Another set of possibilities involve making the masquerade explicitly magical. You can have a setting where non-magical people can't be affected by or see magic, one where they can be affected by it, but are cursed to immediately forget it, or only remember a non-magical explanation, or where they slip into a dream-like state when confronted by magic, unless they experience something strong enough to "wake them up".

This could be the result of a naturally double-sided reality, of a curse placed on humanity by a god of order or a cabal of idealistic pro-technology sorcerers, of a magical parasite that feeds on magic directed at it's hosts before it can affect them, or even of a slowly dissolving reality, where magic represents reality breaking down, and the masquerade is part of the universe's immune system.

An interesting consequence of that sort of setting is that the magic doesn't actually need to be small or hidden. In the most extreme case, you could have a modern world where magic is absolutely everywhere- where the U.S. President is a dragon, and Manhattan is a flying island running on Atlantien techno-magic, but where a few rare people (including, by implication, the reader) are magically cursed to be unaware of it.
