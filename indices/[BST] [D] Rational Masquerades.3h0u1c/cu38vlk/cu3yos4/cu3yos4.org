Certainly coercion is possible. That would be a suboptimal solution that the OP mentioned. The problem is that now the benefits must still outweigh the costs, but the costs include the people who do not want to lose their secrecy. It also includes the people who want to lose it.

Harry Potter is such a society in which the government requires secrecy and threatens those who want to remove it with jail. It also wipes memories. Yet such a society will still have people who will benefit from a loss of secrecy. Healing your relatives with magic is valuable enough (benefit) to outweigh the cost of jail at least for some people. Furthermore, the stronger the coercion, the greater the reason to destroy the government. If the government required me to give myself daily electroshocks, I would be very motivated to destroy them.

Finally, yes, there might be some healthy societies that would not benefit from a loss of secrecy. Such societies would be very different from Harry Potter and almost all masquerades I can think of.
