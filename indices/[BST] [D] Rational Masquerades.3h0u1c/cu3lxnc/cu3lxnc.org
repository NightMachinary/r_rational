Good writeup. It's something I've thought about a lot, since it concerns the major project that I work on when I'm not writing Pokemon: a novel that approaches a modern masquerade in a rational way, and goes through how the masquerade eventually falls apart.

Currently the story is only focusing on supernatural monsters, such as vampires, but magic will show up eventually too, and the main thing that keeps it secret is that it's almost entirely a taught skill, not an innate one. So no one is "born" with magic, accidentally vanishing glass or leaping onto rooftops as an untrained youth.

Everyone who knows how to do magic also knows to keep it secret, and teaches those they pass the secrets down to to do the same, for fear of the consequences of the "muggles" finding out and hunting them down. The magic itself is much more subtle than HP or the Dresden Files: you /could/ theoretically throw a fireball at someone you want to kill, but there's very little reason to when you can just burst a few blood vessels in their brain.

Personally I've always disliked the "people are too rational to believe in real magic" spin that stories like the Dresden Files does. Much as I love the series, it always seemed really like a copout, a handwave to avoid having to deal with the realistic consequences of riding an undead T-Rex through a city. Ultimately, I hope there's some conspiracy that gets revealed to be going around keeping things hushed, because as you say, in the real world people /don't/ disbelieve in magic. By and large, more people believe in the supernatural than disbelieve, even without any evidence.
