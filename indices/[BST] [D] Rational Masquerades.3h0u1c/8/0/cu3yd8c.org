That is very similar to the World of Darkness setting. The magic is very real, but human minds are too weak (with a few exceptions) to experience the reality of that magic. It is not that knowledge is impossible. Ordinary people can believe in magic just fine. The problem is that actually experiencing the magic causes direct psychological damage. Most people construct fantasies to avoid further damage. That is why you can have a war between vampires and werewolves covered up as a gang war.

As far as technology goes, the magic of that universe interferes with technology unless the technology is magically protected.
