One hypothetical way of going about this (not the way I would do it, but one possibility) would be to have each magical event be identifiable by a magically educated person, but immediately dissipate after being interacted with, preventing replication or empirical verification of effects by society as a whole. Magical events might in turn only appear at random - magicians might guess at to what causes them, but only with about 50% accuracy. The inexplicability of magic might be explainable in a rational fiction as caused by the inability to gather a large enough data sample. At the same time, there would definitely be anecdotal and traditional accounts of magic for a protagonist to find and cautiously rely on.

Ruling out empirical verification does not mean netting zero aggregate effect. It might simply mean the lack of resources and application of appropriate expertise/mindsets/theories. Plus, a rat fic might be about figuring out why the effect had not been fully observable in the past, and making it so.
