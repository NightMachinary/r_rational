Interesting idea. It does shape your story in a pretty fundamental way, though. Your main character is going to have stumbled through discovering magic and its use all by themselves, and is probably not going to be able to use it very powerfully. I feel like the interesting stories in that world are going to be able the current state of affairs becoming less and less so, perhaps as magic is scientifically tested or becomes stronger.
