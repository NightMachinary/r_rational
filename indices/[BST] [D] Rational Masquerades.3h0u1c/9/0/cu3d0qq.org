Along those lines, in the real world, a lot of magic is said to be fueled /by believing in it/, which requires a strange little bit of mental gymnastics and is couched in all sorts of weird stuff like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind][quantum consciousness]] theory.

This also has the innate benefit of being very difficult to falsify since it vanishes when you try to test for it. There's also an idea that everyone's beliefs have a certain power and they can cancel out and amplify one another. That's where certain ideas like slenderman arise from, where believing he exists means he gets you. Widely followed religions might create fuzzy semi-real deities comprised of human thought.

I think there's a tvtrope for this actually...

...oh there's a few actually!
