I've been trying to imagine a world in possibility 4. You might be able to get away with a world of magical singletons whose magic operates such that it is never empirically verifiable.

This prevents established authorities from confirming the existence of magic, but also means that many people will have anecdotal exposure to magical phenomena (and be labeled conspiracy theorists) There is no masquerade because everyone believes in magic: in love at first sight, in the zodiac, in the curse of black cats, and in bad karma.

Instead, real magicians blend into wiccans, goths, and occultists. They believe in the reality of their powers, but don't understand them well enough to pass empirical trials, though they attempt to (as they do in the real world)
