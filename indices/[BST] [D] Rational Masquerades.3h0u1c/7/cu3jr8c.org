There's an episode of Babylon 5 where a scientist invents an immortality potion, but it requires killing someone get it to work. At the end of the ep, the Vorlons destroy the invention because they predict the younger races will destroy their civilizations trying to murder each other to live forever.

This is the best masquerade I think: We cannot tell the muggles because attempting to generalize our lifestyle would induce social breakdown due to its infeasibility.

So vampires: a few million super predators feasting on 7 billion is sustainable, 7 billion predators and no prey is not.

Wizards: Every wizard has the power of a nuclear weapon in his wand. A few million running rogue is awful, 7 billion almost assures the extinction of humanity.

Werewolves: I don't even need to get into this one I think.

This is, incidentally, why I hate the modern trend of letting vampires drink animal blood. If they can do that, there's no reason to not turn everyone into a vampire and just have society conduct business during evening hours.
