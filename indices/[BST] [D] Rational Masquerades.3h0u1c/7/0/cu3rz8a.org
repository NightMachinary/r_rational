  There's an episode of Babylon 5 where a scientist invents an immortality potion, but it requires killing someone get it to work. At the end of the ep, the Vorlons destroy the invention because they predict the younger races will destroy their civilizations trying to murder each other to live forever.

Silly Vorlons. People could have just sacrificed people in hospital just before they would have died anyway and reach general immortality within a generation or two.
