*Possibility 5: Magic does not work if it is witnessed by a human or recorded in any way.*

This would allow an incredibly powerful magic system that wouldn't be given away. I suppose one of the biggest plot points would be the increasing problem of a Big Brother society where everything is recorded or measured. Perhaps 50 years ago you could have done major feats, transformed whole landscapes, but now it wouldn't work because we have sensors everywhere and satellites watching everything.
