The problem with this idea is that "measurement" is just another word for "effect"; whether humans count it as a measurement is arbitrary. If you heal twenty people while they're asleep, and they don't go to a doctor to verify that they couldn't have spontaneously healed, is that okay because it's not measured? What happens if someone does a statistical survey 15 years later showing that the expected rate of death from some disease has a blip 15 years in the past, is that now a measurement, and do the people retroactively die? Or does the magic only let you heal 10 people because it knows that if you heal 20, the change in death rate will be statistically significant when someone looks at historical death records in the future?

What happens if you cause a loud sound far enough away that the speed of sound becoms significant? Does the magic know whether someone's going to be coming out of his house five seconds in the future so it knows whether the sound will be witnessed by someone? For that matter, what happens if you use the magic to make a clearly anomalous thing and bury it and it gets found 500 years later?

Can you use magic to dig a hole? Engrave a message on a wall? Engrave a message on a piece of vinyl? Engrave it as a microscopic track and play it in a record player? Can you engrave it on a broken record or does the possibility that someone will invent a new computer scanning technology that lets you retrieve sounds from broken records means it still doesn't count? What if you precommit to burn the record so no future computer geeks can scan it? What if you precommit to burn the record with probability 90% based on a die roll?
