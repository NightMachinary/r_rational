I have a couple thoughts (though I agree with pretty much all of what you said):

#+begin_quote
  Possibility 1: Consider the effects of magic on technology
#+end_quote

Instead of making magic interfere with technology, you can set the story in a time before widespread technology. I have a story on the backburner (one of the furthest back) which is set in 1983 and involves the wizarding government's reaction to the invention of the Betacam and the imminent arrival of home video recording. The Masquerade is much, much easier to deal with when people have to go get their film developed.

#+begin_quote
  Possibility 2: Magic must be rare.
#+end_quote

This assumes magic is randomly distributed. You can make magic much more plausible by having an induction process, or having magic pass on through genetics. This is pretty much standard; you don't see wizards, because wizards keep themselves isolated from the rest of the population. They have their own special schools where they won't interact with normies on a daily basis, they have their own houses, etc.

#+begin_quote
  Possibility 3: For those who have magic, the benefits of secrecy must outweigh the costs.
#+end_quote

Incentives can propagate. If there's a benefit to you in revealing your magic to the world, and a malus to me, I can coerce you in various ways, especially if I have more power. This is especially the case with certain sorts of magic, like a geas. This /doesn't/ necessarily mean that our society is suboptimal, it's just that no one person acts in a vacuum. A healthy society might have some people who would benefit from the removal of secrecy, but have them be stopped by those who would not benefit.
