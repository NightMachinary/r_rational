Great to have you back; I love this story and am delighted to get more of it. Do you have any idea of an update schedule?

As to the attack: it's a scam. I predict that there is no attack going on and this is just part of the exam. My current best guess is that the test is "will you obey orders instead of running off to do your own thing?" That seems too simple though, but it's what I've got based on current information. I'll look forward to the next chapter so I can see the answer.
