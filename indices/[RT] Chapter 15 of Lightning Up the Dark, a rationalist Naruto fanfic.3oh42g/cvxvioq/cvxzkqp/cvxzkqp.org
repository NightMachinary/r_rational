Already replied directly, but for those reading here:

After too many occasions of stating an update schedule and then abjectly failing to live up to it (planning fallacy FTW), I am hesitant to do so in the future. All I can say is that for now, I have several chapters at various stages of editing and beta reading, and I intend to publish those at a weekly rate until I run out and have to slow down again.
