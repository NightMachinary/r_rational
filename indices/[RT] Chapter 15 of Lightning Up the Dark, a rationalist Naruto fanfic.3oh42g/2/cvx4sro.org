And here I was, thinking halfway through the chapter, "I wonder how they're going to handle the Chuunin Exams." In fact, I was even citing Yudkowsky's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2269863/Less-Wrong][second rule of fanfiction]] in my head, hoping that you would do entirely different tasks instead of the usual twisty test, forest of death, tournament format.

And then you go and change up everything. Way to actually take me by surprise.

Liked the chapter. Excited to see you writing again.
