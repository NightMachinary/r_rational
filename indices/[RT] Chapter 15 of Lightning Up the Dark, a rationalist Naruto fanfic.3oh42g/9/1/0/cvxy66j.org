Yeah. You do /not/ want me to try to draw a cover image, for roughly the same reason you do not want to have liquid oxygen poured into your eye sockets.

Maybe one day if my work is popular enough I could imitate HPMOR in yet another way, and call a fan art contest. Probably no cameos, though, unless there's a lot of people with Asian or plausibly Asian names. I have a feeling that having a ninja team composed of, say, Kagami Ametatsu, FÅ«ma Ginpachi and Lord Sparklehooves would not go down well with the general readership.
