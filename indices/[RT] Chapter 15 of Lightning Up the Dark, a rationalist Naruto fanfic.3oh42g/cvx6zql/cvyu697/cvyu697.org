  Naruto considered what he'd been told. Then he considered it some more. It did not seem to fit anything in his understanding of how human behaviour worked.

  "Just so we don't have any more misunderstandings... this is that dinner you promised me for being a good friend during your time in hospital?" Hinata asked cautiously.

  Naruto shook his head. "This is me asking you out on a date after hearing the most amazing thing I've ever heard a girl say in my life."
