Hm. I read to the point where they enter Hogwarts. Still have complaints with the writing style, and especially with Tom's voice.

There are also... lots of holes, I suppose you might call them, that are not impossible for me to fill but cause me to wonder whether the explanations I'm coming up with were actually intended by the author or if they're legit oversights that I just happen to be able to explain away.

I can see where the appeal is for some people, but it just isn't my cup of tea.
