My personal favorite is duodecimal/dozenal. Divides evenly into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 pieces, with only two more digits than usual; which also makes more of the rational numbers have short +decimal+ place-value representations. You can even count to 12 with one hand: place your thumb on the 12 segments of your four fingers. Overflow to your other hand and count to 144 = 100b12.
