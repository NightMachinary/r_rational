My guess would be [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in][Celestia Sleeps In]]. The author is extremely rigorous with his worldbuilding, after every chapter is posted he posts a blog about all the behind-the-scenes worldbuilding details such as analogous 18th century technology, social structures, and etc.

For one chapter IIRC the author actually made a real-life daffodil and daisy sandwich (a canon example of Equestrian cuisine) and ate it to see how it would taste to the human character.
