"By the way, C-378 and I'm assuming the Darjeeling loop was T-35, but if it's all the same to you I'd prefer we reset the numbering back to zero."

--------------

"Delta-2 T-25 C-11. How did you know the trigger?"

--------------

"We both know that with your voice trigger, you can reset faster than I can, so there's no reason to do anything rash. Hear me out."
