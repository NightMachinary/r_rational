Hell ya. another great chapter that evokes such vivid battles with good contours. I love how in the middle of the battle Zorion still has side thoughts and tangents on things which really add to his character and showcases quite subtly his multitasking and changing mental state.

No wonder Damien was a great adventurer when he can go up against some of the best mages in the world and survive longer than a moment. Though it has been shown previously that he was a badass. That time travel reveal to Damien is likely to bight Zorion in the ass later on. Simply revealing that information on a large scale would likely make any of Zorions plans severely crippled.

The fact Zorion had to work for the angels definitely makes it less of a literal deus ex machina.

Zach and Zorions class is likely to be decimated after all this to keep the stakes real.
