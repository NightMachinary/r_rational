True.

I also intrigue about Zorian technology, his golems are very advanced as noted by QI, surely broken golems still hold some mechanism, some mages who discover those golems most likely will try to reverse engineer to learn how to manufacture them, that also apply for Zorian magical rifle and magical bullet and any other broken devices he left in war zone area.

But by now Zorian is filthy rich with money that can finance a small country. If Eldemar force him to submit into authority Zorian can flee another country outside Eldemar influence. He's a Tony Stark equivalent of MoL LOL
