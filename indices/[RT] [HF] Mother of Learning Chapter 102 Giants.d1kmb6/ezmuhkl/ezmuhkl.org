Niceee this was a good chapter. Things are not looking good for Jornak and the others, Zorian seems to have it under control. The angel summoning went off without a hitch, it's nice to see Zorian's skill in golem making and spell formula is being put to good use. I was really worried about Daimen there for a second, thought he was gonna bite the dust in this chapter
