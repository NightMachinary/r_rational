Well, you didn't quote the part you were answering to...

And I'm pretty sure normal people don't communicate with the angels and they have priests and stuff for that. Like our religions have these holy dudes too pretty much for telling you what the higher-ups think.

So like I said, "I'm not sure how much information we have about their angels before this and if we know how much an average dude there knows about angels." That there are some priests who talk with angels doesn't mean average dude has any idea.

I did not ignore that part of your reply. I specifically said that what would be relevant is what the dudes who have communicated with them say about them.
