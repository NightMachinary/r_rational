Most of his exponential growth came from dangerous encounters with monsters whose abilities he could steal (princess, the soul plant, the Aranea, other things) and from using the time loop to steal secrets and make entire nations work for him.

His growth will be a lot slower now, and with more eyes on him it will be harder to mass produce golems. He's still a serious threat (there's a reason Eldemar has laws against making big golems) but he's not an exponential threat.

He's a major threat, but if you threw enough powerful mages at him you could crush him.

He intends to be more subtle anyway, not evil take over the worldy.
