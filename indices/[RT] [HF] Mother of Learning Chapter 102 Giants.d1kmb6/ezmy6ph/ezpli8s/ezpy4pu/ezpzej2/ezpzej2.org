Anyone could be a potential threat then. Suppose the school wizards learn new spells and become more dangerous. They are a threat now.

If I go to the grocery store, and someone is bigger and stronger than me, they are a threat and must be taken down.

Kind of ridiculous.

Would you classify your dad as a threat when you're 10 purely because he has the potential to kill you, even though he's never given any indication he would?

Being more powerful doesn't make someone a threat. Actual intent does. Consider Doc Oct from Spiderman. He didn't become a threat until he started hurting people. Before then he wasn't a threat even though he still had the same potential.
