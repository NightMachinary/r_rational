Ognji≈°te is a fireplace, oganj could be used for fire but not really (vatra is fire).

Dveri is also older name for castle, i have no idea what knazov is but sounds slavic. Zoran is quite common name.

Author english is fenomenal, and he rarely uses local words for fantazy names. He probably has an editor, but his english is still better then some american authors in web fiction.
