It is of course possible that the cube was merely drawing in ambient mana to power a built-in, pre-cast spell. That is standard for magic items; the first golem doll Zorian built for Kirielle relied on ambient mana. You just need an item tough enough to withstand the effects. It would only really be extraordinary if the summoning cube was casting a new spell.
