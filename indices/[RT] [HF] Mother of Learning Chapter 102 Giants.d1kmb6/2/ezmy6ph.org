At a certain point, you have to wonder if maybe the Angels are right about murdering all of the loopers. For the greater good and all that.

I don't know how many of you are familiar with Worm, but Zorian is gradually revealing himself as a classic [[https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/S-Class#cite_note-17][S-class threat]]. His combination of golem creation, warding ability, knowledge of the mind, and simulacrum expertise allows him to grow in power practically exponentially.

His only limit is his own relatively modest mana reserves. Unfortunately for the world, the best mana battery in existence is right in front of him.

In a lot of ways, he rivals the threat of the ancient necromancers that a war was fought over.
