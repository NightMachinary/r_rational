Nah, Thinker 6 or 7, or possibly 8 I would think. His mind reading with his range alone is 5. 6 with his mental calculator, clock and other upgrades. 7 or 8 depending on his abilities with divination. Considering he was able to search half a continent with a week of preparation, I would go with 8.

Tinker 7, with the golems and artifice abilities he's shown? Yeah, 7. Wards probably go under that one too.

Master 8, or 9. He is capable of complete rewrite of a mind, and is capable of controlling pretty much everything with a mind that isn't shielded. (Which on the PRT rating system is pretty much no one.) His Simulacrum also go under here, as well as being another boost to his Thinker rating.

Blaster 8 or 9. Dimensional blades and artillery magic are good enough for that.

Stranger 5 or 6, illusions and ectoplasmic shells capable of looking like anyone. Then he can use his mind control to prop up the category even more.

Honestly, Zorian has ratings in all the categories. So the simplest would just be calling him a Trump 8 or 9 or something. Which in PRT rating systems just means 'run for your lives'.
