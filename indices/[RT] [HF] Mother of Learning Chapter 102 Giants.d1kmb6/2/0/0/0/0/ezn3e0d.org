  Zorian has said he'll share some empathy stuff, but I doubt he'll share everything.

He totally will share his knowledge. He's bemoaned multiple times about the waste of knowledge when old mages die. He loves libraries. He wants to start a magic research facility. He funded Kael's alchemy research out of sheer altruism and hope for better world.

He's an idealist in this way. Lots of nerds are. He doesn't see the inherent danger of it.
