Imagine Zorian with the crown and 25 simulacra that work in unison. He could get out of control rather quickly.

Within a few weeks/months he would be a Nilbog level threat. If he started doing novel research that would allow him to increase his mana capacity, he could turn into a swarm. A swarm that can continuously manufacture support golems and mind control others.

If he were allowed to dig in, you'd never actually find the real Zorian.
