He's good, but he's not S-class. If you look at that bracket, it has entities like the Endbringers, Slaughterhouse 9 and Nilbog. Endbringers are literally unkillable if you don't happen to be a vengeful quasi-deity, Slaughterhouse 9 has a long track record of indiscriminately destroying locations and killing anyone they feel like, and Nilbog can multiply exponentially if he's allowed past a certain point.

S-class is reserved for those situations where you have to get all hands on deck to even contain the problem. In 1v1 fights he has pretty good odds in most matchups, especially if he can scheme and prep beforehand, but a lot of the big-name mages out there would hand his ass to him in a duel without a need for backup.
