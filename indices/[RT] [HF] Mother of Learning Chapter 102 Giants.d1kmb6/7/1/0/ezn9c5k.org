hmm, I hadn't considered the alchemical aspect, which is definitely a big thing. However, she's not just the weakest amongst QI, RR and herself, but the weakest by far. While narratively it was lampshaded many times that she is treacherous etc., the meta-purpose of her betrayal was to give RR and QI the information they lacked about Zach and Zorian, to make the battle more even. I don't see her playing any other major role in the story henceforth, unlike QI and RR, for example.

Unless the current lampshading of her being less dangerous but still dangerous is meant to indicate she gets to do something in the last chapters.
