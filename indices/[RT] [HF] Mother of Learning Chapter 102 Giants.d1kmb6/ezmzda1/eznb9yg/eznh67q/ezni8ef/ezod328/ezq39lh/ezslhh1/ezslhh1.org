I think that there's going to be a cliffhanger again. The angels versus demons battle is probably going to be the whole chapter. Then we're going to have a chapter dealing with the aftermath. There's also the possibility that they take the fight down to the primordial and *almost* have it escape. I can't see it being /just one/ more chapter.
