I didn't call him an S-class threat. But someone with the capacity to punch you is not a threat. That mindset leads to needing to destroy anyone who has superior skills.

Superior capacity is not superior threat. Threat requires some kind of indication that the other person is actually willing and able to act on it.

For example, Jason from the horror movie would be a threat. Jason, the karate expert from next door is not.
