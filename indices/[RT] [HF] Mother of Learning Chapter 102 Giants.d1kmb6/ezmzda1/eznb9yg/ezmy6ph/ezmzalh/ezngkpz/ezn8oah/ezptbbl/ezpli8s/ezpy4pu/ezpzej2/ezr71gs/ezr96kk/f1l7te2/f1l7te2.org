Equivalent to our world is someone whose knowledge includes how to build nuclear warheads and ICBMs, as well as all of the intermediate machinery to produce them. Plus knows of hidden uranium deposits and has enough private wealth to buy the materials and hire the people necessary. I can guarantee every major government would be keeping an eye on him at the very least.

Zorian could pretty easily topple governments and is impossible to hunt down. He's a serious potential threat, even if he hasn't dont anything harmful yet.
