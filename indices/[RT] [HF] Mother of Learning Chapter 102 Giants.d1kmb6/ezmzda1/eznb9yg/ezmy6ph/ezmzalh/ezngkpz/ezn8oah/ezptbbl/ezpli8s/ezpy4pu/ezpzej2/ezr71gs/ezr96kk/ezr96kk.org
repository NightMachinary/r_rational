Imagining him in our world is meaningless.

In that world, he's not inherently especially more powerful than anyone else. He's just had the benefit of gaining decades of experience without aging, and collecting large numbers of spells.

Equivalent to our world, it would be someone who gained immense knowledge, at 15, of various fields of study while also knowing where to find rich deposits of lost treasure.

The only way you could consider Zorian to be a threat is if you assume he's going to take advantage of people.

And the fact that he's a mind reader is irrelevent too, as there are plenty of them in that world, and they aren't all automatically threats.

Basically you're equating someone with great power with someone who has evil intent. Such as someone who works out at the gym and likes to bully people. Zorian has been pretty explicitly not a bully.
