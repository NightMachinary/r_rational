By that definition, anyone would be a threat. It's just that he's a bigger threat. Even a normal person would be a threat to anyone weaker than them.

I don't agree that someone becomes a threat just because they have the ability to hurt others. And remember, the original point I was responding to was whether the angels were right to kill all of the loopers. It's not merely a matter of watching, it would be government choosing to kill anyone in our world who has the knowledge and ability.
