Thing is silverlake is not a battle mage, her spells are hence slow and easily disrupted in comparison to the others, but she is a highly skilled soul & dimensional mage that know ZnZ way better then the other 2, but if she's not kept busy she can do awful stuff even if she's relatively easy to keep busy.

The reason I think she's a non threat so far is because the thing we've seen is not in fact silverlake but her raven in her form, just being there as a distraction since silverlake as said is not a combatant.
