Oww that actually makes a lot of sense! That might be why the gods can't be contacted anymore.

Theory: Postulating that the gods exist on a plane outside the spiritual planes where angels and demons reside, and that they set up a black box around the universe that includes this lesser spiritual plane, then that would result in all communications between gods and their lessers to be cut off.
