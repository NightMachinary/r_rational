How exactly is Silverlake dangerous anymore? The way I see it, she was dangerous only for her knowledge of Zach and Zorian. And, the 5-6 months after her exit and this (real time) month have seen (at least) Zorian eclipse what Silverlake knew of him. And her performance in this battle (so far) is rather poor too.

Of course, in the past, she'd be a threat to Zach and Zorian but as it is... I don't understand why she's still classified as a danger. Her x-factor was dimensionalism, and she's not that far ahead of ZnZ now I'd say.
