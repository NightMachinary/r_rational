It's not a blow for blow repeat (and couldn't be, since it's missing the mind control themes), but it's pretty similar. The heavy squares off against a dragon (in TB the dragon was a hero (Naruto), here it's a villain). The main nonlooping villain (IQ, Pein) focuses on sabotaging the efforts of the backing cast and stopping the protagonist from asking Heaven for help. There are several fights happening in parallel, neither side being entirely clear which is the 'true fight' and which are feints, until they merge as the bit players are taken out and only the main fighters on each side are left. Lots of prep time happens on each side with the end result of the heroes negating most of the villain's prep, at a substantial but lower cost than the villains needed to set it up.

It's its own thing, but the ending has so far looked much more ripped from TB than the middle did.
