You are correct. In Croatian Dveri (or dvor singular) means Castle or mansion or a large door for castle of temple or some such thing. Knez is a high noble.

Also "mrva" is not really used. Diminutive mrvica is only used either in ironic sense like here, or for a cute nickname.

The rocket launcher oganj is Serbian, not Croatian but i guess it fits. Name is used basicly for same thing.
