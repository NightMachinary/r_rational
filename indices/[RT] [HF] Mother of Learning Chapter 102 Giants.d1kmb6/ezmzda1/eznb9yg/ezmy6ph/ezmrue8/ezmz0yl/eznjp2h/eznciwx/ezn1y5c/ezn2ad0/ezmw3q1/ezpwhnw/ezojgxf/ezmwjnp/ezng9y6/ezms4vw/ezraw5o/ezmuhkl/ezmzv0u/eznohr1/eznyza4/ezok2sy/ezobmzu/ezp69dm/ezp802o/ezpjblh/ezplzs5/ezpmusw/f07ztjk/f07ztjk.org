  Dveri is also older name for castle, i have no idea what knazov is but sounds slavic.

While I speak a different slavic language, my guess is knazov is formed from a noun "knaz" which could mean "prince" and a suffix "ov" that is equivalent to the "'s" in English. So it could literally be "Prince's Castle". I used to think that "Dveri" part was meant for "Doors" but the castle makes more sense.
