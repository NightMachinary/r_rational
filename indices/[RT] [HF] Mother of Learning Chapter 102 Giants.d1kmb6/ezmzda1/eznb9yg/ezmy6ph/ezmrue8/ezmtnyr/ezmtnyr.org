They are amazing.

Zorian is no doubt pretty drained, but their allies are here, and his main contribution is done. He's never been a great pure combat mage. His shaping skills and mind magic and golem creation have been his greatest skills.

He can regenerate pretty fast as well. 1/32 mana units- simulacrum per 30 seconds, plus he can draw on ambient mana in emergencies.

I'm more worried for the invaders. They forgot that prep wins battles, and expended a lot of HP, mana, and effort on battering down a probably divine artifact and a single mage and golem to no use.
