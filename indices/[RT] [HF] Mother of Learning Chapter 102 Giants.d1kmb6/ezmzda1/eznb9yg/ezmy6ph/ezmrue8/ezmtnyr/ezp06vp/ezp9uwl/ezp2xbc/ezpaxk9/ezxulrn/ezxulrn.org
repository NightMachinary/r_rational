These angels are pretty much exactly in line with descriptions in religious texts. Lots of fire, lots of limbs and wings in odd configurations, generally incomprehensible things not meant to be seen by human eyes. The pretty, fluffy winged, human-looking angels are a later invention.

That aside, in this world people can actually communicate with angels; they definitely have an awareness of what angels look like.
