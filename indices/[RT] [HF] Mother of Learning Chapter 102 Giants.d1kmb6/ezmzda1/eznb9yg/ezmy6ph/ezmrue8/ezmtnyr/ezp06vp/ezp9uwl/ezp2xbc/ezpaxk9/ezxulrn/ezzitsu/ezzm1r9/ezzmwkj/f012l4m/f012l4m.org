I didn't bring up religious texts in response to "do they know what angels look like," it was in response to "that doesn't sound obviously angelic." Because if you're trying to determine whether something is angel-like, checking whether it matches descriptions of what angels are like is a good starting point.

Then I separately answered the first question when I said

#+begin_quote
  That aside, in this world people can actually communicate with angels; they definitely have an awareness of what angels look like.
#+end_quote

Then you decided to ignore that part of my reply and complain that the first part isn't answering the question I wasn't replying to.
