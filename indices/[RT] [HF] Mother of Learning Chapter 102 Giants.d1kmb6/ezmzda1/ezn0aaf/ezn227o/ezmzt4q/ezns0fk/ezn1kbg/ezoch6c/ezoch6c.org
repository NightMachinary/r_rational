It's absolutely critical that Zorian doesn't display his ability to bypass mind blank in public. Zach must be completely convinced that he's impervious to mind mgic under that spell, else he won't be able to fully believe the illusion that everyone aware of the time loop, other than himself, died. If he has a single fragment of hope that it isn't real, then he'll die.
