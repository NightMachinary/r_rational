Raven SL is an interesting take, didn't think of that at all!

Hmm but I think she's a bit of a non-threat overall, outside of her providing the information that RR and QI needed.. Yes, she's incredibly skilled in alchemy, soul magic, and dimensionalism. However, doesn't make her a heavy hitter esp not in battle... Ofc, Alanic is highly wary of her, but I'd even say Alanic can kill her easier than she can kill Alanic, just my reading of their relative skill sets.
