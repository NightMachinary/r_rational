They do not have our religious texts. It was asked if people recognize them as angels. It is completely irrelevant what texts these people have never seen to what the folk in this setting knows about angels.

They have their own religion and we can't assume everyone knows these are angels just because they relate to our mythologies.

So yes, irrelevant.

What would be relevant is is what their texts, priests and people who have seen or communicsted with them say.

I'm not sure how much information we have about their angels before this and if we know how much an average dude there knows about angels.
