one has to wonder how much of a damn mana drain the cube is on its power source, and/or how utterly perfect and efficient Zorian's spell formulas are

how long can that thing last

also, that thing is totally going to release that fireball back at Oganj or someone else sometime later. way too good to pass up

EDIT: actually...the cube could potentially store a very large or very plentiful power source within a pocket dimension, too... which makes it possible that this cube can last a /very/, *very* long time
