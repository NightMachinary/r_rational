A great chapter, with angels, demons, cool weird magical items, lots of rad fight scenes, and eagles coming to the rescue.

It does show that there is a lot of value in being the better prepared party. The angelic artifact and the wraith bomb counter means a lot of the skill and mana the invasion has was wasted futilely.

If they had found another way to delay the invasion they could have won.
