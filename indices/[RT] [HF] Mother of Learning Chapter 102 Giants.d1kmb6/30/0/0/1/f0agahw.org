Fighting a dragon is a common enough ending that I'm doubtful it counts as just a common thing to Time Braid.

The non looping villain was around, but he was mostly trying to punch Sasuke to death, and she punched him to death. Where did he show any concern about her talking with heaven? QI's main focus here was summoning a demon, not sabotaging the backing cast or stopping the protagonist from summoning angels.

Having multiple fights happen in parallel is just a thing for big fight scenes.

Preparing for fights is... well, I can't think of any stories where that doesn't happen. Notably, most of the villain's prep is just summoning more monster- they don't have any large scale elaborate anti city weapons. The final fight is in the villain's stronghold.
