While the story is obviously Naruto inspired and Time Braid inspired (in part since the author favorited Time Braid) the ending isn't time braidy. As I remember it, the villains summoned a bunch of clones of the main character, and the heroes used their extreme combat skills and mind magic stuff with clones to beat them up.

Here, the Sakura analogue Zorian is using his item creation skills and the aid of his brother to defend him while he summons minions and the Naruto analogue Zach fights a dragon.
