I just found out that some old favorites of mine have updated within the last few days without me noticing!

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/49/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k][Shinji and Warhammer40K]] - Shinji Ikari finds a boxful of insanity and becomes even more unhinged than before. Somehow, this is A Good Thing. As the grim dark future melts into stark bleak present, upon a throne of tropes humanity might find the savior it so requires.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052381/31/Sleeping-With-The-Girls-Vol-II-Chaos-Theory][Sleeping with the Girls]] - The experiment continues. What are the side effects of one's pressence if you give it a little time to percolate? Think you can call the shots?

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4833515/chapters/11070479][This Bites!]] - Sea Kings, sea-sickness, sunburns, a 95% genocidal Marine Corps and more than a million and one other assorted ways to die. It's official: Being inserted into an anime sucks ass... Buuut I guess it could be worse. I mean, look on the bright side: At least I'm sailing with the future king of the pirates.
