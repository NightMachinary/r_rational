Recently got around to finally reading The Thrawn Trilogy for the now defunct Star Wars expanded universe. Very impressed by it, probably the closest thing to a rational take on the universe that's been published. Among the many munchkiny tricks employed, it also works to answer questions like "Why don't starships just run off of AI, instead of being staffed by thousands of crewmen?" and "Why was the Emperor (who as far as we saw just shoots lightning out of his hands) so valuable to the Empire?" If you're like me and somehow missed them, worth picking up.

Also, Practical Guide to Evil is fantastic. Working my way through book 3 at the moment, not looking forward to reaching the current frontier.
