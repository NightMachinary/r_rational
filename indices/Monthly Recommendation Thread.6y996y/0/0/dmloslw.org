I read the first book in the Thrawn Trilogy and enjoyed it, but had trouble finding the second (I've got a pdf of the third). How does the second book compare to the first? I'm not sure if it's worth me trying to hunt it down while I still have other stuff lined up to read, but if it's even better than the first one I'd probably go for it anyway since I really liked book one.
