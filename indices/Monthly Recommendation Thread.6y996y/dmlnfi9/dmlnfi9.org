I got gifted /The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O./ from the Reddit sci-fi exchange! I love Neal Stephenson, so I dove right in. A government agency discovers that magic was real until 1851 and hires an adjunct professor of ancient languages to translate relevant documentation. Pretty solid explanation for why magic worked and why it stopped working, and at least the main characters are rational (but definitely not rationalist).

EDIT: 300 pages in. This book has made me laugh out loud more than anything since the Hitchhiker's Guide.
