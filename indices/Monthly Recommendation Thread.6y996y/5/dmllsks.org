I'm sure a lot of people on here have already read some of Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld series (if you haven't, go do it now - /Mort/ or /Guards, Guards/ are good starting points), but I'd like to recommend the Bromeliad trilogy.

It's a young adult series but I recently reread it and really enjoyed it anyway. While not fully rational, it has some rationalist traits (it explicitly rejects storybook thinking a few times, but it also has Pratchett's classic style of worldbuilding, albeit without magic). The core theme of the series is also something I think a lot of people on here would enjoy.

Most importantly, it's fun and creative.

I also read the first book in the Banners of Blood series, called 'Son of the Morning'. It's... kind of hard to describe, except that it has some similarities with Unsong despite not having much humour. Set during the start of the Hundred Years' War, it's excellent at capturing a foreign culture and mindset and its approach to reinterpreting a more active religion is excellent. I recommend it to anyone who liked Unsong for reasons other than creative puns, kaballah and the humour. You don't need to know anything about the relevant time period going into it - I didn't, at least - but it might add some extra pleasure if you recognise some of the characters.
