How did you like the Aspect-Emperor Trilogy?

I finished the Prince of Nothing trilogy, and oscillated between loving and hating the series. The writing would sometimes strike me as impressive, deep, and almost poetic, while at other times just came across as "faux-intellectual" to a masturbatory degree. The characters were unique and compelling, but were also almost entirely unrelatable, and all but a few were extremely two-dimensional. Not to mention that the entire first trilogy is just one three-act (fairly short, timeline-wise) story, so it often felt extremely slow, especially around book 2.

Given my opinion of Prince of Nothing, how do you think I would find Aspect-Emperor? Are there significant shifts in writing/characterization/pacing, or is it along the same lines as PoN?

Also, note for new readers: this series is definitely NOT rational
