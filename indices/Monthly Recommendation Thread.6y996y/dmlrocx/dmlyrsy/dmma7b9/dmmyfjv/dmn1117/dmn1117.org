Largely, people gave Bakker a lot more credit for having fully thought through a sensible working plot than he did and hand-waved a lot of what would normally be considered oversights as being intentional artistic choices when it turns out they were not. As I haven't given the series much thought since the finale i'll quote others from when the AMA was done.

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

And:

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

On how ambiguity takes away from the story:

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

Succinctly put:

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

Oh wait, he actually knows nothing huh?

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

The AMA making it impossible to fanwank away the plot issues:

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

More:

#+begin_quote
  [[#s][]]
#+end_quote

That's a bit of a mess to read formatting wise, my apologies.
