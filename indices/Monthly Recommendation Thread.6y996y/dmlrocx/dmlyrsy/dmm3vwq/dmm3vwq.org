Hate to break it to you, but I haven't gotten around to reading beyond the first book in the Prince of Nothing trilogy. I just know that a number of people here follow the series, so I'm just posting the link to let any followers know that it's finished.

I definitely plan on reading the whole series, but I don't have the time for it yet.

Sorry. I hope someone else can reply to let you know what the Aspect-Emperor is like.
