Some works that piled up in my backlog.

*Fanfiction*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle][/Man in the Middle/]], a /Sword Art Online/ fanfiction. Instead of focusing on the people trapped in the death game, it shows a government-sponsored rescue operation conducted by programmers and engineers. A fascinating deconstruction of SAO's premise, done in a way that would appeal to this subreddit. *Complete.*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9271192/1/Transcendent-Humanity][/Transcedent Humanity/]], a /Mass Effect/ fanfiction. Premise: humanity never developed FTL, and was forced to grow within the Solar System's bounds, achieving a "soft" singularity --- building a Matrioshka Brain filled with uploads around the Sun. Canon gets horribly derailed the moment transhumanity meets Turians. *Appears to be dead.*

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12446468/1/Modern-Cannibals][/Modern Cannibals/]]. Nominally a /Homestuck/ fanfiction, it's set in a world mostly indistinguishable from ours, and follows a group of +friends+ acquaintances on a trip to a Las Vegas FanCon. Among its positives is very good and unique characterization, entertaining plot, discussion of author/consumer relationship, an absolutely fascinating last chapter, and some metafictional shenanigans. Negatives: the majoiry of the characters are irrational, or have crippling psychological issues. *Complete.*\\
  Additionally, it's a work of Bavitz, the author of a rational /Puella Magi Madoka Magica/ fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][/Fargo/]].

*Movies*

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Coherence][/Coherence/]], a movie. A group of friends find themselves isolated in their house and its immediate surroundings; shortly thereafter, strange happenings begin. It's a curious case where the majority of characters are pretty /irrational/, as real people are, but despite that, they're clearly Level One Intelligent: they think about their situation, compare it to their experience with movies, and so on. [[#s][A moderately spoiling hook:]]

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Horror_Movie][/The Last Horror Movie/]], a movie. Follows a competent serial killer's activity, as he films his kills and talks to the hypothetical viewer. Filled with attacks on the viewer's morality, some meta-commentary, disturbing contrasts between the murderer's murdering and his "daily" self, and [[#s][ending spoiler]].
