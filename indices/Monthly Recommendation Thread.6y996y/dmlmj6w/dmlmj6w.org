Can anyone recommend to me racing stories? Specifically stories that involve a race of any type where various contestants have to cover a long distance to obtain a prize. I find such stories to be really interesting, but I only know two of them.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24807186-wolf-by-wolf][Wolf by Wolf]] - It's 1956, and can Yael use her supernatural powers of shape-shifting to win a motorcycle race and earn the prize of an audience with the reclusive Hitler to kill him?

- [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureSteelBallRun][JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run]] - Part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure which is centered around a cross-country horse race.
