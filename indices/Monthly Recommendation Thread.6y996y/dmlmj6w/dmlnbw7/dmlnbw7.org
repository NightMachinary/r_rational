[[http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one][The Adventure Zone]] has an amazing, cinematic, Mad Max-style car chase arc! It's called Petals to the Metal. I recommend starting from the beginning as it's a fantastic story, but you could probably just listen to the one arc and be fine.

Caveat: does not even try to be rational. Still hilarious and great storytelling.
