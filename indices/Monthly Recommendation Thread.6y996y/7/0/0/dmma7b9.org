As someone familiar with one of the larger online fan bases for the series the general opinion is that the first trilogy is superior but not massively so. There's still plenty of philosophical wankery on the exact same ideas as the first trilogy, there's still lots of unlikeable characters - though certainly some interesting ones - and there's plenty of epic moments, more than the first trilogy in my opinion.

The ending suffers from a distinct lack of payoff in many ways so I can't recommend it without that caveat. Also, if you do decide to read the second trilogy then afterwards do not read the authors reddit AMA unless you want to retroactively taint your entire reading experience.
