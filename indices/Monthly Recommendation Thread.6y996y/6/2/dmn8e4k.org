I assume you like anime if you like JoJo, so I recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUeaYaI-VAI][Redline]] purely on the merits of its visuals. The video I linked talks up the characters, but I personally found every scene that wasn't during a race rather boring. However, when the race is on, it's some of the most spectacular high-energy animation I've ever seen in my life. It's totally irrational, of course, but it's such a fun rush.
