[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hover_Car_Racer][Hovercar racer]] by Matthew Reilly might fit your bill. It's about a season of the fictional "hovercar" races, the courses vary from F1-style street loops to rally-style scenic circuits (and one points based orienteering race). It's a lot of fun, and Matthew Reilly is a master of characters thinking their way out of a situation whilst in the middle of an action scene. The book was originally released free on-line so you may be able to find a pdf copy if you look hard enough.

The smart characters are at Level 1 intelligent characters with moments of murder-mystery brilliance (putting together Chekhovs from earlier in the plot). It's tonnes of fun but it isn't rationalist in the slightest.

[Edit] It's also very much in the YA genre, so keep that in mind.
