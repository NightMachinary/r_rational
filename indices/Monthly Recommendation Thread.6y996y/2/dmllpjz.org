If I'm ever going to be thrown back in time or into another world and I have no idea of what I'll be facing, then [[https://www.amazon.com/Timelines-Science-Dk-Smithsonian-DK/dp/1465442472][Timelines of Science]] is the book I want to take with me. It's a very well-illustrated book about the scientific inventions and history of scientific figures throughout time from the prehistoric era to the modern day. It doesn't go very in depth into the separate scientific principles mentioned, but it's a great way to review the various technology developed over time and the order of such technology. Kinda expensive, I got mine slightly used but like new for $13.

[[http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/][Math Girls]] is an incredible series of books about three teens in high school discussing math from an elementary to college/graduate level. There's a sample from each of the three books in the series provided in the linked website. The samples are a very good indication of the quality of the rest of the book and should be helpful in deciding if you want the books.

Not necessarily rational, but rather recommendations for anyone who really wants to read more stuff about the anime, but the series is updating too slowly for your tastes. Mostly about Midoriya with a quirk or something unusual about him.

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793297.The_Steerswoman][The Steerswoman]] - It's a series that has been recommended here a few times, but it's been a while since the last one and I've been rereading it. Here's a summary someone wrote and posted to this subreddit previously

#+begin_quote
  Steerswomen, and a very few Steersmen, are members of an order dedicated to discovering and disseminating knowledge. Although they are foremost navigators of the high seas, Steerswomen are also explorers and cartographers upon land as well as sea. With one exception, they are pledged to always answer any question put to them with as truthful a response as is possible within their own limitations. However, they also require anyone of whom they ask questions to respond in the same manner, upon penalty of the Steerswomen's ban; those under the ban do not receive answers from the steerswomen.
