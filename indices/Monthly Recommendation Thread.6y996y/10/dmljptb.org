Lol I was just writing one up. Beat me by 5 minutes.

Edit: Uh I should probably contribute too if I'm here anyways. Talos was pretty easy for most of the game but still interesting. I'd also like to second someone else's recommendation of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_(video_game)][The Fall.]]" Both of these games have to do with getting plonked somewhere and trying to sort out what's going on in your environment, which seems to make for a decent plot hook. I don't think either of those are rational though.
