Over in [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hq2at/qbst_author_of_the_two_year_emperor_asks_would/][my market research thread]] [[/u/Nepene]] suggested that I look into doing commissions. I think this would be a blast, and I'd like to give it a shot.

I will need to figure out a livable rate but let's start with a basic reality check: if I write you a rationalist horror story (potentially with a basic premise that you specify), will you pay money for it?

How long would you want it to be? Here are [[http://www.writing-world.com/fiction/length.shtml][my definitions]].

(Note that the "you" in this is really more of a "all y'all" -- one person is unlikely to be able to fund my time for a substantial writing project.)
