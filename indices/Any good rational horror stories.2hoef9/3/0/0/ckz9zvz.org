If I'm working quickly on 2YE (a world that I'm very familiar with and have much of the plotting done for), then it takes me about 7-9 hours to write and edit ~5000 words. For something new where I'm going to have to do more work on the planning, it would take longer...maybe about 12 hours?

For that amount of time, I'd like to make $300, so if we can drum up a few more people, I'm onboard. PM me your idea so I can start chewing on it.

As to payment -- I can look into setting up an Amazon payments account. Could you send it via Paypal or simple credit card if that fails? I can have a credit card link set up in about three minutes since I can work it off the [[http://greendogpress.blogspot.com][GreenDogPress]] site.
