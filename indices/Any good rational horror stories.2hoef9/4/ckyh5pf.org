Blindsight, by Peter Watts. More horror in the makes you reconsider your life, your place in the universe, and humanity, but still the most scary thing I've ever read. And it's rational, no one makes stupid decisions or acts dumb. Great writing, would recommend. [[http://rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm][Here]]
