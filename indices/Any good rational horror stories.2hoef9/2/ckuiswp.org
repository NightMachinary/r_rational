[[http://www.voicesoa.net/bunny-love-has-no-limits/][Bunny Love Has No Limits]] is certainly horror, and as close to HSF as any Orion's Arm story; I'm not sure whether or not enough actually happens therein for it to count as a rational fic. But it's the closest I can think of.

Other than Charlie Stross's stories on Bob Howard, of course, with CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN and all that jazz; but that can pretty much be taken as a given, right? :)
