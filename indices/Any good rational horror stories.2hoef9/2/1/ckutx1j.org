  Other than Charlie Stross's stories on Bob Howard, of course, with CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN and all that jazz; but that can pretty much be taken as a given, right? :)

Honestly, I never found the Laundry books to be particularly terrifying or anything. The horror aspect just doesn't really frighten me. I sort of view them as generic urban fantasy. The latest book, The Rhesus Chart, in particular inspired more laughter than anything else.

That's not saying they're bad books - just maybe not what a horror reader is after. Or maybe you will find them scarier than I did.
