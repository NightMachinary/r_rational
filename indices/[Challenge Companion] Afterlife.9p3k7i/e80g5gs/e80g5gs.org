One of my favorite takes on the after life comes from Vladimir Nabokov in Transparent Things. A sublimely subtle writer, he often inlcuded the supernatural in layered and hard to detect ways in his English writing, but this short story was overtly from the perspective of a ghost.

The ghost's experience of reality is unstable - he has a tendency to "fall through" things into their histories, for example in observing a pencil on a desk he can't help but be drawn into a vision of the lumber it was carved from, the tree that was felled, the sapling that grew, the seed nourished by sunlight and air and on into infinity.

This was a beautiful and poignant picture of the afterlife for me, a place where you can truly experience both the interconnectedness and i unique narrative of every object, from people to particles. It is one of the few ways I can imagine spending an eternity, exploring all space time from each possible vantage point and tracing how every flap of a butterfly wing creates eddies through the future.

I'd be interested in more exploration of this kind of afterlife as infinite artistic appreciation.
