I'm glad to hear you say this, because it's more or less the intended reaction to the ship society. :-)

In general the ship is supposed to be neither dystopia nor utopia, but instead optimised for certain things that aren't necessarily well correlated with what we'd want. I think on balance it ends up being a significantly better place to live than early 21st century earth, but there are some significant downsides and enough that is different that it'd be really hard for most people to adapt to.
