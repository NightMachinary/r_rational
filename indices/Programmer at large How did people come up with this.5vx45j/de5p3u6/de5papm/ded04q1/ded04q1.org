That is absolutely not how I feel about this story. It's clearly not a paradise, and a lot of it is the main character but:

- Protag has the same introvert/antisocial tendencies that I have, along with the same genuine enjoyment of the small amount of interaction they can stomach.
- Protag sees software deployments as complex ecosystems, requiring management and biodiversity on top of hard boundaries. Again like I do.
- There's a similar level of non-concern with gender that I feel, even with our social expectations.
- I absolutely love being the person that is constantly running around making sure an organization works, even if it's not really noticeable how much smoothing and optimization I do in the background.
- The political structure of the ship parallels a lot of my favourite ideas on governance. Though I'd probably have a vaguely quadratic vote buying scheme on top of the system of voting.
- I suspect I would love living in space if my biology doesn't disagree.
- Good lord, the idea that people treat build artifacts are saleable things annoys the fuck out of me, but I didn't ever have a pithy way to express that before.

It's likely just a very lucky match between my personality and the particular choices of ship, protag, and setting, but this is very much the sort of world I want to live in. It's not so well developed that I can fantasize about it, but there's a large space of worlds consistent with your portrayal I would love being a part of.
