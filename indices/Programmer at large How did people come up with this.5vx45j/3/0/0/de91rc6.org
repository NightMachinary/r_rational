  Hell, I want that social software!

Yeah, the social software stuff is the bit that everyone (including me) is jealous of.

It's also just... not actually very technically hard? Or, it's technically hard, but mostly in ways we're already good at. Most of the moving parts have pretty good prototypes in the labs today, and computers are well on their way to being better at reading facial expressions than the median human (and certainly better than me).

This isn't an expertise area for me, so I may have been taken in by some good marketing, but I'd be very surprised if we didn't start seeing things like this in common use in the next 10-20 years tops.
