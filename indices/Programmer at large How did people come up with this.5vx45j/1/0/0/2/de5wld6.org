In general, the amount of labor-hours involved in making a decision should be proportional to the importance of the decision. A court system makes perfect sense when significant and potentially life-altering decisions are going to be made, but not so much when it comes to posting weekly mini-fiction on a subreddit. For our purposes, less than sixty seconds of a mod's time to make a decision should be sufficient.
