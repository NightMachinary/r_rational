It's a good fic, though even with the changes it makes the universe is not entirely rational. Also worth noting that it's not at all a rationalist story - while the themes kinda fit, intelligence is informed rather than shown and there are many things that come out of nowhere.

4/5, a fun read and much better than most in the setting.
