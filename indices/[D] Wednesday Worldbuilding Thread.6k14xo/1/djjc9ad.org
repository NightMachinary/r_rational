So, the zombie thread made me think of how I had the concept that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/66ar64/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dghrqxr/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][my vampires could become zombies under the right conditions]] (the thread is very, very long but the first couple of posts will give you tons of background, and I'm going to tl;dr below).

TL;DR: My Vampires regenerate like starfish, and the regeneration is based in the heart (probably). So if you cut the heart into lots of pieces, you grow that many entire new bodies.

This includes a new brain. The pulp horror implication is that the brain is a "blank human brain" with vampire instincts, so it lacks higher executive function but wants to seek blood. Basically a pulp zombie! Awesome coincidence.

Then my partner pointed out that a "blank human brain" wouldn't be able to do things like walk since that requires growth (which vampires can only do consciously), so you end up with two choices:

1) Copy of time-of-turning brain or of time-of-heart-cutting-brain: the vampirification process backs up the brain state, which then grows back as it was when the vampire turned; or the vampire's brain is constantly backed up so it's a clone of the vampire when you did the heart thing

2) Worse-than-infant brain: maybe the zombie twitches a bit, but ultimately it's powerless, but perhaps useful as a body double

So, the thread I linked above discusses this and basically determines that #1 is too powerful since you can make a clone army.

Then I realised: My Vampires, when devoid of human blood, "lose their higher functions" and become automatons seeking out blood - i.e. zombie!!!! So, a "clone" wouldn't have any blood human in its system, so it would seem like a zombie. It wouldn't have higher functions.

I like this: it means that /you are creating a clone of yourself/, putting it through miserable /starvation/, and /not realising that it actually feels/. AND I get to have my zombies.

Plus, staking works, so vampires will stake their clones to "store them", and they'll end up kind of going insane anyway from a combination of hunger and not being able to move.

The problem: *is this too easy to figure out, and thus too powerful*?

Like, "cut out a piece of your heart and leave it somewhere dark for a month and then it grows into a clone" seems like it's not intuitive: but if you cut your arm off and it grows back, how long before you start trying to figure out what grows back under what conditions? (You can create other vampires "the old fashioned way", to experiment on). Would vampires figure out that feeding their clone makes them "normal" again? I mean, it only takes a vampire to leave its clone in a dungeon with say a human servant, the servant to get curious about the clone and unstake it, get bitten, and then the clone is /maybe/ cogent again (unless "it goes insane from not being able to move", which seems a bit of a cop-out, and even if it /did/ go insane from not being able to move for centuries, it would probably be saner than a blood-seeking automaton which might make its master ask questions)

I think, in the great tradition of its thread, writing this out has caused me to reflect enough that I need to stay with #2 (worse-than-infant brain), because #1 would probably have been exploited by now.

Anyway, if you have any thoughts, feel free.
