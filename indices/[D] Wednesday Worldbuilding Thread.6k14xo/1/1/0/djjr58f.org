I've decided on almost nothing, war-wise, and it might be useful for the survivors to use vampire-doubling to increase the world vampire population, but if it gets widely used, that could be a problem; then again, a clone of The Main Vampire (William), being a reboot of a dark age general-king's brain in the 1600s, slowly becoming accustomed to modern life, is pretty neat. I'm not sure how they'd stop any impersonation from happening, though.

I'm also coming to terms with a "mass turning" and "vampire classrooms" in the early days. I never pictured William doing such a thing, but those were desperate times and it may have been a requirement.

It would result in young vampires having their patrons in their styles: "from the line of Guillaume" or similar. I'd like that: the Human Love Interest would just assume they were like surnames.... Yeah, I'm getting into this.

I figure vampires get benefit from having a sufficiently large population which is why they'd be motivated to expand it: being able to look out for each other, trade secrets against the other supernatural beasties, and and so on.

I never considered pain as being a useful limiter, but that has the potential to work out VERY nicely. Thank you.
