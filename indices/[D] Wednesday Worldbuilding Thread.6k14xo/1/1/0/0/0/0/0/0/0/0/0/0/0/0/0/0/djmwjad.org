Nah, just the exponential growth formula and a mathematical program (Octave).

  Only about 800 vampires (3%) were born before the year 1700. Young vampires are often killed by the elders for violating their inscrutable social rules, so the average age of everyone else is less than a hundred.

The rapid growth of vampires since 1500 would be enough to make the average vampire age less than 100 even without young vampire deaths...

  I'm not committed to any of this, and I'm not committed to a world vampire population: I worked out the density of vampires I would imagine in my home state, and extrapolated those densities to world figures, since that's what the author (Fiona, the ex-werewolf lawyer) would have done.

Then it's entirely reasonable for her figures to be wrong, should it somehow become plot-critical.
