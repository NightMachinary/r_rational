If you had 800 vampires in 1600 and 40k vampires in 1900, then you can't have (in 1900) more than 2% of vampires being older than /three/ hundred (never mind four hundred) because 800 is 2% of 40000.

Working with a constant steady growth rate between those points, you'd have 5656.854 vampires (working on averages) which would imply a maximum of 14.142% vampires older than 150 by 1900 (and that's assuming none of those vampires die and are replaced in the interim).

So, in short, your percentage of superold vampires likely needs to go down a bit, your percentage of medium-old vampires should probably be in the 10-15% range, and most will therefore be under 150. (This is the consequence of three decades of expansion; lots of young whippersnappers running around causing trouble...)
