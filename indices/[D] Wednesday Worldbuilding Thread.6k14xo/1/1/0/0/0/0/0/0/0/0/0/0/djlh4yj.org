...mmmmaybe. Or maybe it takes a long time (twenty-plus years) to be sufficiently /sure/ of a new recruit's suit preferences? Either can work. Or both at once.

Incidentally, growing from 800 to 40k over 300 years at a constant growth rate requires about a 1.3125% average per-year growth; which means only (average-wise) around ten-and-a-half new vampires in the first year; and at the end of that period, around 525 new vampires per year. So, you'd only need culling of some sort if the average vampire population increases /more/ rapidly than that. (Or maybe vampire hunters have started getting better lately, and that's what's keeping the numbers down, especially among younger, less cautious vampires?)
