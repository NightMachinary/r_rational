Thanks for those calculations! Is there like, a google doc you're using for these numbers? I should make one of my own and tweak it. I'm extremely glad that my ass-pulled numbers seem to make sense with the stats though.

Here's what I have on vampire demographics (written in a /Dune/-like appendix style, so it's in first person and in the present day):

  In Australia, as best as I have been able to determine, the ratio seems to be approximately 300,000 humans to 1 vampire, though this ratio is higher in cities (approximately 700,000:1) and lower in the country (100,000:1). It seems that vampires are willing to accept lower ratios of prey in exchange for a larger territory, though my research indicates this varies extensively based on the individual.

  A crude estimate based on the 300,000:1 ratio I've observed indicates a world vampire population of 23,000. However, if we take into account world urbanisation figures, the vampire population could be as high as 40,000 (5,000 urban / 35,000 rural). In Australia, the vampire population is likely to be about 100, total (20 urban / 80 rural).

  Vampire population is stratified. Only about 800 vampires (3%) were born before the year 1700. Young vampires are often killed by the elders for violating their inscrutable social rules, so the average age of everyone else is less than a hundred.

  The elders all seem to know one another and to be on reasonably friendly terms. From what I have been able to determine, the youngest of these would have been turned around the year 1500 or possibly even earlier. As the elders are not chatty, there has been little luck in finding out what happened. It's worthy to note that this is when vampire mythology as we know it took hold in Eastern Europe.

I'm not committed to any of this, and I'm not committed to a world vampire population: I worked out the density of vampires I would imagine in my home state, and extrapolated those densities to world figures, since that's what the author (Fiona, the ex-werewolf lawyer) would have done.
