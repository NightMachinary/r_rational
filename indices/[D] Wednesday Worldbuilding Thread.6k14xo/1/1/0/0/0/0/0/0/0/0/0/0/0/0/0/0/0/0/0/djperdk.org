Yeah, I was trying to hammer it out with my husband last night (pillow talk with a mathematician and an engineer...) and he's got this differential equation with grass-rabbit-fox to model predator/prey/etc demographics. So he's going to work something out for me, I think. I figure as the vampires get more dense, they're going to get noticed more, killed by hunters more, etc. So it'll attenuate the growth somewhat.

Then again, a world population of 130,000 vampires (exponential growth assuming 800 vampires in 1700 and 20,000 in 1900) is perfectly serviceable. The demographics shake out differently:

World population: 130k

1900-2017: 110k (85%)

1800-1900: 16k (12%)

1700-1800: 3.2k (2.5%)

Pre-1700: 800 (0.5%)

Much like my ill-advised "uniform distribution of vampire ages who survived The Big Catastrophe of 1700" plan, I'm probably going to have to get more specific. I also did some demography with world population in 1700 to work out where the vampires would have been drawn from as a rough approximation.

(Fun fact: randomly generated an age and ethnicity for William's ex-girlfriend who'll appear in Volume 2 which I'm beginning to get an itch to start writing, and by virtue of the RNG she's the 20th oldest vampire in the world (!!!!!! Valuable ally ahoy!!!!!!!) and originally from Korea. Reading some Korean creation myths has given me some fun thoughts for her character, which is excellent: there was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungnyeo][a bear who became a woman]] after staying out of sunlight and eating a lot of garlic... very interesting parallel to vampirism).

That said: given that of the 800 Elders, my story is likely going to introduce <5, I don't really think the specific distribution matters all that much since you won't have enough characters to do meaningful statistics, but maybe it's a good idea to know the numbers?
