Not just that. If the vampire has to be held down while someone else messes with his heart, there's the issue of /trust/. Precisely because his heart is so central, the person doing the messing about can stake him, then drag his frozen body onto the roof and wait for dawn.

In short, pain aside, in attempting to make a clone the vampire is deliberately making himself /vulnerable/. Most villains have trust issues - so that could also limit the use of clone armies quite significantly.
