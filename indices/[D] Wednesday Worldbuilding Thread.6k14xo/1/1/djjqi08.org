Maybe it's very, very painful to mess with the heart, to the point that removing a big enough piece to work (we can handwave and say that tiny heart slivers don't fully regrow) requires that you be held down while another person does the work. This should reduce the number of people who are willing to mess with hearts for the heck of it, and also reduce the number who are able to.

EDIT: Alternately, it has been exploited before (how much have you already decided on, with regard to the big war that happened?) and the old vampires now intentionally circulate false information to dissuade the younger vampires and kill anyone who gets too nosy.
