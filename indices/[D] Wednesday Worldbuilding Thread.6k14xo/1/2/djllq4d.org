For me? An extremely long time.

I'd put an extraordinary effort into not having my arms cut off in the first place.

Any situation where I could get cut to bits is a situation where I could also get killed, so I want to avoid those entirely.

Missing an arm or leg would also interfere with my social disguises. It would make it hard to feed.

And, with the low vampire population you're describing, the arm regeneration thing might only be known as a creepy, vampire version of an urban legend.

The vampire who discovers this and decides to exploit it would amount to a terrifying prepper.

Starfish need food. And bodies require mass. So, this is a dude who's going "Interesting. When I soaked my severed hand in this barrel of human blood i had lying around, it scabbed up and started growing a protrusion like a stump. Let's see where this goes."

Then, terrifying vamp discovers that he can make continuously screaming clones of himself at the cost of mere barrels of blood. And he decided this is useful, just in case.

Your setup is great, and I don't think it's an excessive exploit.

Going into that dudes basement, where there are dry, hissing husks of himself would horrify vampire-me. It would be way worse for actual me.
