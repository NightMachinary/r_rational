Okay, I [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ioo90KR3IeK2SWSGx0L1eak39gZ_r5CuxJtd4Vhm500/edit?usp=sharing][worked out how to make one myself]]!

It looks like if we assume that we start with 800 vampires in the year 1700, and end up with 20,000 vampires in 1900, reproducing exponentially and then reproducing linearly between 1900 and 2000 to get 40,000 vampires, we get a distribution that matches my thoughts pretty well:

World population: 45k

1900-2017: 25k (56%)

1800-1900: 16k (36%)

1700-1800: 3.2k (7%)

Pre-1700: 800 (2%)

Assuming exponential the whole way, we end up with 100k vampires in the year 2000 and 131k vampires in 2017: I think this is too many, but it's good to know that as a ceiling that we're still looking at something along the lines of "the vampire population has not had time to recover since 1700"
