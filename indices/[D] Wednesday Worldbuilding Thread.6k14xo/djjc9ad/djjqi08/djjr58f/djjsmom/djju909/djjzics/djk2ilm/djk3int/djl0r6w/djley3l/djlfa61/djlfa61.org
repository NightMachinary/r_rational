So, the question to that is, why are there /only/ 40,000 vampires? Why aren't there a million? The world could support them (ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM vampire population unless the vampires start breeding humans or something: 580 million) I guess old vampires kill young ones who have the wrong suit preferences, and 20k-40k seems to be about stable?
