My vision of demographics:

3-5% older than 400 (uniform distribution between 500 YO and say 2500 YO)

10-20% older than 150

~80-90% under 150

This isn't especially important as I haven't committed to anything, to be honest, but either way, something resembling the above will make sense with a constant growth rate model and also with a culling model; additionally, younger vampires could be more likely to reproduce, etc.

I do like the idea of two main factions with a tense "peace", and an elder scolding a new childe: "No, no, no. You send PERIWINKLE roses to a navysuiter. I know, they're uncultured brutes, but Queen Aliniana is a valuable ally all the same"
