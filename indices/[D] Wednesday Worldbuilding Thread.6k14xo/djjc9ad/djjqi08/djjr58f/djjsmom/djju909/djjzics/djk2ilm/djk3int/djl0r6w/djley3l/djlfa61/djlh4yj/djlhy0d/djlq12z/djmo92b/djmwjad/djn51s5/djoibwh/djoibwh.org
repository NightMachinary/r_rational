The switch from exponential to linear is probably significant. Population growth is almost always exponential, and even a complete agreement by all vampires to tone the conversions down a lot would merely result in /slower/ exponential growth.

/Linear/ growth sounds rather like a senior vampire decided that enough was enough, laid down the law, and made it clear that there will be no more than X new vampires in any given year, on pain of rather severe pain.
