Maybe. :/

I think I'm going to write myself into a corner with this idea though. I can't make it slot nicely into place, so I think it might be time to give up on it.

Now my big problem is, given how hard it is to make a vampire, how did the population go from 800 in ~1600 CE to 20,000 in 1900 CE ? What incentive does Vlad Vladington have to make baby vampires ?
