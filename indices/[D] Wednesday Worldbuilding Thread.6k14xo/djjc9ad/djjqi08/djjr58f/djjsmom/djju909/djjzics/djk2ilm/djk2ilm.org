It's OK: I realised that even if I use the "no blood = zombie" loophole, it doesn't give me what I ACTUALLY want, which is beheading a vampire makes them into a zombie when their head grows back: the beheaded vampire presumably wasn't on the verge of starvation, so when their head grows back, they have blood, and everything's normal.

The idea is dead. Kill your darlings, and all that.
