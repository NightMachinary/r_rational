There's been a debate over the last few hundred years, over something that seems fairly trivial to outsiders (such as whether navy blue or black suits are better). Both sides of the debate have been pushing /hard/ for their side, and part of that is trying to swell the number of vampire voices calling for their preferred answer to this trivial dilemma. Vlad Vladington makes baby vampires (after carefully establishing their suit preferences) because that gives him more votes.
