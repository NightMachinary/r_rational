If it helps any, the raw materials for regeneration come from the air, not from human blood; so it's not THAT resource intensive.

It only takes one out of THOUSANDS of vampires to want to work this out for it to be discovered and exploited; you don't even have to do it to yourself, you can turn a human into a vampire and do your experiments on them (you'll be more than strong enough to overpower a baby vampire).

The benefits? If the new brain has memories from when you were turned, why, you'll be able to get a clone army (admittedly, not with your current knowledge): or, with a suitably brainwashed mook, you can get a /better/ clone army than that, even. With exponential growth you can double your army at an astonishing rate. Yeah, they'll need humans, but at carrying capacity you can support a vampire for every 12 humans. I'm sure a feudal castle would give you plenty of chattel.

I do like the idea of vampires viewing being in the state of regrowth as unclean in some way: I never really thought about that, but it makes sense that it would have big social consequences. So you may not want to do experiments on yourself, lest people think you get in lots of fights, or something.
