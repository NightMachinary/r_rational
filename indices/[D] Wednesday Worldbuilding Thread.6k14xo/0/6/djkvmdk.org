This seems incredibly dangerous tbh. It's like rewriting your own code, except harder because biological code isn't as clean as programming code. Computer systems break all the time because of rewrites to parts of their code, so do you really want to rewrite your own code?

I mean, even something as innocent as your example "increase_penis_size.exe" could also contain genes for murderous rage. These genes may be slow acting and so difficult to catch. And so one year after "increase_penis_size.exe" comes out, society has degenerated into a murder fest.
