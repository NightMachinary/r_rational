  So, if I get a gene mod I don't want, can I get rid of it by stacking a "just-like-my-old-body" gene mod on top of it?

Not unless you pay a company do specifically develop a gene mod that changes an arbitrary person back into you (because simply copying your DNA won't result in the correct gene expression.)

Though you can do stuff like, for furry.exe specifically, "reduce_hair.exe" and "make_nose_smaller.exe or whatever. Still, you won't get a perfect reversion, and in all likelyhood I think having so many gene mods stacked on top of you could be pretty harmful in the long run.
