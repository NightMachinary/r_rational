  Though it would be incorrect to say that furry.exe is "open source," per-se. Its license allows for free use. That same license, however, doesn't allow any edits to furry.exe...

Which means you've only got /one/ target output?

I don't imagine many people would use it, under that scenario. I think most people who would be interested in using such a thing would have their own, unique idea of the perfect "target form", so to speak.

The /original/ would probably be set to the target form of the original writer of the software (either that or the person who paid the original writer and thus got to dictate such things), so I imagine there would quite possibly be /one/ user.

Anyone else? They're not turning into their fantasy image. They're turning into someone else's.

At the same time, it's hard to imagine that there wouldn't be a widely customisable GPL'd open-source editor (which would probably get you many similar effects - but that license does allow edits by its very nature). There, I think you'd get a few people willing to try various exotic bodies - some on a temporary basis. (We're not talking a percent. Or even a tenth of a percent. I'm thinking a vanishingly small fraction of humanity - best measured in parts per million, perhaps). There might be enough for a /single/ community somewhere, I guess. (So we're not just talking subculture, we're talking subculture of displaced people).

Having irreversible modifications forced on you would probably qualify as assault. (I'm thinking jail terms, fines, therapy for the victim, possible ostracism of said victim by family and former friends...)
