I really love this idea. Like what if your father is super rich and buys a program which has the ability to customize genetics from a big corp, and you find it one day? Who's to say a custom-purchased program would have all those safeties so it only affects the one person it was installed on? What if a kid has enough similarity to your genes in the sections the virus checks safety for?

Bug-testing programs is hard enough. But bug-testing a retrovirus so it only targets one person? The first and second generations it's gonna be terrible with lots of ruined lives.

What if you as a male kid have a female twin, and your parents get you both little 'tune up' viruses and mix them up? This would make a good fic for exploring gender identity as well as sexuality on top of furry-ness.
