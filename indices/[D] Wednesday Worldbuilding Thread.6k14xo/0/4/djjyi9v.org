That's kinda similar to how it works in my cyberpunk worldbuilding project, though less via genetics (which is relevant rather to Designer Babies and prenatal modifications) and more with advanced plastic surgery aided with biological and cybernetic implants. As for furries, their lifestyle and subculture, they are are similar to Real Life furry fandom though they don't need to create any fursonas or avatars anymore. Also they are kinda similar to LGBT community, as like the latter ones furries celebrate pride, diversity, individuality, and sexuality. Not really common, but also not the weirdest of transhuman subcultures.

Going back to your idea, how would introducing major genetic alterations in an adult human look like? Because retroviruses alone probably wouldn't be enough.
