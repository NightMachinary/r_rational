Several applications of retroviruses, I'd imagine. The first application modifies some cells to become stem cells, another application tells the stem cells to replicate across the body, another application modifies the stem cells into their intended type of target cell, another application modifies cells to release hormones to activate the stem cells, and a final application cleans up remaining hormone-producing and stem cells.

Of course, that would only be for a simple modification, like increasing the amount of hair producing cells on a balding man's scalp. A more complex modification (furry.exe for example) would have more steps, and steps that overlap each other to save time.

I think it should be possible to induce some pretty profound changes just with retroviruses, but as I said in the OP, it would take a long time.
