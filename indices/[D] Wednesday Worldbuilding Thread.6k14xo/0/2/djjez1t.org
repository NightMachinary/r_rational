The novel [[https://smile.amazon.com/Kismet-Watts-Martin-ebook/dp/B01MY02OXB][Kismet]] is essentially that, though with people who have chosen to become hybrids living mostly in habitats on the frontier of the solar system to get away from a more prejudiced inner system.

The novel is interesting in that its take on transhumanism could almost be a metaphor for transgendered people- it mentions "species dysphoria", for example, and portrays "cisforms"- unmodified humans- as being torn between their discomfort with the hybrids and a desire to be accepting, with conservatives decrying the entire thing as evidence of the degeneration of society.

For a small-press book, it's also pretty well written.
