Since [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6j1r84/d_friday_offtopic_thread/djaxnoc/][this]] question was asked, I've been thinking about furries. (weird, I know.) Currently, they still fall squarely into the "weird internet fetish" category that most people, despite their overt disgust, really don't care about one way or another.

But let's imagine a world 20 years in the future. Gene editing methods have gotten good enough that we can manipulate both DNA and gene expression to a fairly exact level. Plus, with massive advances to 3D printers, combined with the gradual fall in price of technology, it's relatively cheap to create the tools to create gene-editing retroviruses, and serums to modify and encourage gene expression. It's not easy, it's not fast, it's not legal (for private citizens), but it's cheap.

Now, the major bottleneck to recreational gene editing is the fact that retroviruses need to be personalized to individuals to have the intended effect, which in turn require the use of specialized (and very difficult to create) programs, which tend to be copyrighted by large pharmaceuticals. And with better technological methods to enforce copyright, this typically means that if you want to undergo any serious changes, you need to pony up the cash.

Still, many open-source programs exist, including, but not limited to, cure_nearsightedness.exe, glow_in_the_dark.exe, and who can forget the increase_penis_size.exe?

Most infamous among these, however, is probably furry.exe. Though it would be incorrect to say that furry.exe is "open source," per-se. Its license allows for free use. That same license, however, doesn't allow any edits to furry.exe... which in turn means that nobody has yet figured out how to undo its effects.

--------------

So to sum it up, imagine a world where people finally reach the transhumanist fantasy of relatively free control over what they look like, providing they have the cash. Most major changes are locked behind very high paywalls, although a few aren't.

What would the culture around genetic modification look like? What steps could such a society take to avoid x-risks from the easy genetic modification? With the knowledge that such a change would be permanent, how many people do you think would actually run furry.exe? What kind of subculture would the genetically modified furries adopt? For the people who had genetic modifications forced on them (for example, running furry.exe with someone else's genetic material, then administering the retrovirus to them without their consent), what would the societal reaction look like? Are there any other observations you'd make about such a society?
