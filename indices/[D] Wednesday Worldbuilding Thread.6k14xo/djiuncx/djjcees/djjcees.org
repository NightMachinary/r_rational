I'd think 90% of genetic modifications would be similar to plastic surgery; people would get it done, then mostly pretend that they had always been that way, and the polite thing to do would be to maintain that fiction. Hidden utility modifications probably fall in here as well, since they're not out in the open and you don't need to explain them to anyone. (/e.g. lipostat correction to kill hunger and let people slim down, modifications to give people clear skin, removal of unwanted hair, darkening or lightening skin color/)

Another 9% would be semi-transgressive but still within the norms of traditional beauty. I'm thinking things that today would be accomplished by rather expensive/uncomfortable/rare cosmetics. (/e.g. heterochromia, skin color modifications to make 'genetic tattoos', non-standard eye colors, non-standard hair color/)

And then that leaves 1% for flat-out social transgression. These would be the kind of thing you'd see on [[/r/genemodfails]], or posted to future-Buzzfeed's '10 Worst applications of genemodding'. Stuff where people would cluck their tongues and talk about how obviously that person doesn't ever want a job (though if the cost is high enough that might be a somewhat nonsensical criticism). These would be the equivalent of getting a full-face tattoo or an extreme body modification. (/e.g. furries, genemods that alter digestion to make someone a full carnivore or vegan, gills, green skin, etc./)

I don't anticipate a riot of transhuman variety, at least not until several generations have passed. Norms are pretty powerful things and hard to break, even if the technology exists to do so. Anyone thinking about getting a genemod would have to think about how their day to day life is affected, including going to the pharmacy, walking down the street, or standing in line at the DMV.
