Well the first option is just offload the decision to the wish engine (like for example saying grant me whatever valid wish will make me most likely to win). But that is likely to be forbidden, Test anyway.

Then we can try to wish for something specific but the rules are too vague to even know what kind of thing is even valid.

So first whish that after afew seconds the particles on the arena to be rearranged in such a way that she's alive and there's an small cut in the brain of all other participants that instantly kills them. If that's not possible just wish for the small cut in everybody's brain.

If thats not valid then depends on why it's not valid.

If she isn't told why the wish is not valid test wishes like rocks on top of the other participants, explosives, compressed ball of electrons that kills everyone but is situated to kill her last , complicated mechanisms that shoot stuff towards then etc.

If possible add some kind of cover for herself to the wishes (she can wish for a contraption that includes both)
