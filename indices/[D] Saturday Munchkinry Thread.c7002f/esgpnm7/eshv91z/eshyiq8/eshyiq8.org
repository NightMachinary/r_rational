  I wish you had given some example of what counted as a 'mundane power or trivial magic' since it's annoying to munchkin something that's so vague.

Things should get more understood as you progress, since you'll be learning not only from experience and future information, but seeing other people's attempts. Plus, the nature of a single-elimination tournament is that the early challenge is easiest, most of the time.

Felicity is of above-average fitness, but hardly a combat specialist. She might manage a marathon, but has never done any sustained martial art or combat sport.
