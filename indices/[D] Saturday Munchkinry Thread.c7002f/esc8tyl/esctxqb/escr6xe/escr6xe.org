There are some things you might want to clarify: is there a cooldown time (ie can you refresh the control indefinitely by just holding their hand or hugging them every nine seconds)? Do you lose control as they move away from you? Is your possession of the power a perfect secret?

The first thing that comes to mind, offhand, is hanging out in some kind of gambling establishment and rigging the bets, assuming the me in this scenario is not troubled by morality. You'd need seed capital to play the odds right, though.
