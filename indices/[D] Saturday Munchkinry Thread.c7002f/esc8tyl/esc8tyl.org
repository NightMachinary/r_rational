You can control anyone for ten seconds after they are in the area four millimetres outwards from your skin. It is like their body becomes your second body and you can control it, and use it's senses, as if it was your own. You also a get a multitasking boost to be able to easily control up to five bodies and that number will improve with practice.

You cannot make them do something they would absolutely not do, like having a the target just randomly kill their best friend, and if you try the target will have a chance to brake out of your control. What you could do is control the target so they get into an argument with their best friend which escalates to the point of killing them. As long as the context is there for them to justify to themselves why they did the action you can make them do it.

After the controls end people will remember things as if they were the ones in control and give themselves the emotional context for why they did what they did. So if you controlled a random person on the street into asking you out on a date, depending on what type of person they are, they might remember the action as they making a spontaneous joke or they might remember how they though you were so attractive they just had to ask you out right then and there.

You also learn much faster to be able to easily control the new body. Figuring out how to best move in a body with some sort of abnormality would take less then a minute.

How would you use this in the real world? How would you use this in a superhero setting?
