You have the power to swap utility functions: whenever you are in physical contact with exactly one other person, saying "I wish we were more like each other" will cause each of your utility functions to become the other's.

Memories, physical bodies, knowledge, abilities, etc. are all unchanged. You still retain your power and knowledge of how to swap utility functions, and so you can swap utility functions with A, then with B, to effectively give B the utility function of A. However, this plan would only work if you still wanted to swap with B after gaining A's utility function.

The utility function is intuitively a list of all stimulus and concepts that would make someone happy or sad. Having one's utility function swapped does not cause any immediate symptoms, and the person may not notice at all until they experience something that their new utility function treats differently from their old utility function. E.g., a person who loves golf may then find the game very boring the next time he plays golf, even though his memories tell him he should be having fun. At that point he will be confused about why he no longer enjoys the game, but you will be long gone.

An interesting effect occurs if the new utility function contains elements not found in the memory of the recipient. For example, if your utility function contains a very great love for a specific person A, and you swap utility functions with a person B who has never met A, B will gradually start to feel that something is missing from their lives. Then, if B gets to know A, they will feel like A is the thing that has been missing from their lives, that "A completes them".

What do you do with this ability?
