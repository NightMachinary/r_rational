A pretty good power for combo's is something like being able to see a second into the future since the more power you have the more effective it becomes.

Let's say you can teliport 10m: with future sight you can now dodge any non AoE attack simply by knowing it is comeing and instantly moveing out of the way.

Let's say you can move a 1000x faster than a normal human: Since you are moveing so fast from your perspective that second of future vision is like 16 minutes to a normal person.

Have a power that works by random chance: Look into the future to make sure the randomness always gose the way you want it.
