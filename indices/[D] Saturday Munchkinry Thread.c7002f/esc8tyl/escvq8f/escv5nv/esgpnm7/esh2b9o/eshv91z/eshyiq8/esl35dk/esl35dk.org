I think with powers granted like this, it's inevitable that the more generalist you make your power, the further scaled down it would become. Asking for omnipotence -> you can do anything to an extremely small degree, which makes it possibly the worst power you could choose (since you can't use all of it at once).

I think your idea of combos is spot on, as it's all about picking abilities that are usually underpowered (so they won't be nerfed as much) and then pairing them in a way that allows them to fit their niche.

On the downside, I am /not/ particularly creative, and it appears that all the combos I can think of require abilities that are already OP on their own.
