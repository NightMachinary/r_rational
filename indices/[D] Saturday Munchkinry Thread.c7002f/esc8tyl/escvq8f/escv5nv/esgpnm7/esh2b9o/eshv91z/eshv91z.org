I wish you had given some example of what counted as a 'mundane power or trivial magic' since it's annoying to munchkin something that's so vague.

--------------

Well the first thing to do is wish for omnipotence and work down from there. That way Felicity will get the strongest wish she can under the limits.

*A few considerations*

- We want a power that will still be usefull in the rounds after this one. So planing for some combo's will be a good idea. Or the power could multiply the MC's power.

- Since there is a high likelihood someone will have a hax power physical durability might be worth much less to invest in. As such it will be better to have power that let her avoid takeing attacks rarther than resisting them.

- Felicity seems like an average human so without wishes bosting her skill and mentality she will be pretty shit at fighting.

- She has thirty minutes of prep. Picking a power that you can charge up or has more effect if the user is given time would work well here. If she dose this allot 5 minutes to experiment then make the wish and start changeing up.

- If she could capture and interrogate her opponent that would be good. She should find out if the other people have redditors giving them suggestions. Also if they are captured she could exstend the match for more time to charge up a power for the next fight.

*The Wish Idea*

- [Summons Small Sprite]: A magical ritual that take a minute to cast that summons a [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Navi_%28The_Legend_of_Zelda%29.png][small sprite]]. The sprites are a fast as you are and has 1/20th of your strength at the time of casting. The sprites are very loyal to you and folow basic instructions. Since you will probebly be teliported to the area make sure they are all touching your body when the timers up. Can be combind with a strength stealing wish latter down the line for exponential physical power growth.

- [Charge shot]: The kinetic energy of your body (this includes body heat) can be charged up and be fired off in a directed AoE attack. Shoot it the moment you see the enemy.
