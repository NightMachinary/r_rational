Become a prison rehabilitator. For both the real world and the superhero setting.

Since people remember the actions you make them do as if they chose to do it themselves, you could mind control various prisoners and make them turn over a new leaf. For example, you could pat someone on the shoulder saying "I believe that deep down, you're still a good person." and then control their body to make it burst into tears and say they are sorry for their crimes. Then afterwards they would with high probability believe that they said that because they truly felt remorse for their crimes.
