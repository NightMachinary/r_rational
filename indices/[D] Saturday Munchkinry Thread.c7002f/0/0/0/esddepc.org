This is a pretty good idea though it would depend on how good of an actor you are. If you aren't skilled enough then you would be unable to use the prisoners body to do a convincing redemption scene and they would likely remember that as them acting out a fake redemption in order to mock you or something. Also if you are to over the top after you leave they might think back and notice they start acting weird or overly emotional whenever you touch them leading them to suspect something.
