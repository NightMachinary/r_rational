yeah exactly - anyone who's willing to use this power doesn't have a particularly strong utility function (e.g they're fairly aimless in life), and they'll use it until they get one that's strong enough to say "actually priority #0 in this utility function is to not lose this utility function" (e.g, they develop a strong sense of purpose)

like the only way to actually use this power is to come up with some pre-comitment scheme to guarantee that you'll get your original utility function back, and even then it'll probably be circumvented by a particularly strong utility function.
