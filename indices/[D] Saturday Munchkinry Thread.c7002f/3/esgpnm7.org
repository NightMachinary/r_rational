I want to start a miniature battle royale quest here. This is a super low effort thing, but I think it will be fun. Updates are intended to be weekly, in these munchkinry threads. People's comments will be translated into suggestions that the main character is privy to (there is no voting; the final decision is hers).

Note that I'm hoping to give you an almost-even playing field with the other contestants, though I'll be making most of it up as I go along. If you're significantly more creative than me, you should stand a shot of winning.
