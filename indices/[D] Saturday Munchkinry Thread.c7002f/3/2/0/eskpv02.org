Steal powers can be really OP for someone who can guarantee their first victory without an ability. If Felicity can get a powerful set up, then that might be a good ability to get soon.

Edit:

A possible implementation of it: From each person I defeat, I can steal an ability and keep it with a strength of minimum (their stolen ability, my powerstealing ability). This means that later on, when enemies have a range of abilities, Felicity can yoink away (a weaker version of) a clever one without spending an entire wish on it. I think this is balanced as the wishes get vastly more powerful as the tournament progresses, so it's a sacrifice of present power for future flexibility.

If Felicity doesn't get this, then it would be interesting if she faces someone who does, either to great effect (and they win) or they should've gotten a more immediate wish (and they lose)
