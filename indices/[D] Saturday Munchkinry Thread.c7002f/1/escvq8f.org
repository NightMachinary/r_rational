I'm curious what you guys think could be muchkinned about elemental magic and for the sake of this post let's limit ourselves to the elemental bending from Avatar, specifically water, air, and earth bending since fire bending makes no sense to me (unless it functions as a result of an entirely different magic system than the other 3 elements). I'd also like to add the limitation that bending abilities can't be extended into the bodies/material of living creatures otherwise you get really broken shit (blood bending, air-in-your-lungs bending, bone bending, etc.). Another rule/law I've been thinking may need to exist to really solidify the boundaries between elements is that, for example, a water bender can bend any material whose natural state on Earth is primarily thought of as liquid (if it was "any material whose primary natural state on Earth is liquid", then water benders would be able to bend the materials that compose the Earth's core).

Water Bending

I think if we start by looking at what water benders can do (turning water into steam, mist, and ice or the other way around), we can conclude that they can control the speed water molecules are moving as well as the distance between them, and if you were to extend these capabilities to earth and air bending you could get some interesting things. Even within water bending, there's probably more exploits to be had, especially if we assume water bending is really liquid bending.

Air Bending

Increasing or decreasing the speed air molecules are moving would result in warmer or colder air, but it isn't hard to imagine that someone that can vibrate air molecules to create heat could also oscillate them in a more patterned manner to create sound. I think Worth the Candle does a great job of explaining how useful sound magic can be. You might also be able to create explosions and plasma by compressing air while heating it depending on what sort of 'air' molecules you're working with. Assuming you have some ability to sense whatever magic you are using to bend and by extension, the element you are bending, a bunch of sensory abilities should crop up (for all the elements really). For air benders, sensing the way the air they are bending is displaced by objects in their environment or sensing the way it is being oscillated would result in echolocation or an approximation of it.

Earth Bending

Using earth materials such as permanent magnets in conjunction with highly conductive metals, you should be able to generate electricity in the conductive metals. Vibrating the molecules of something that qualifies as an earth element could result in lava bending. Compressing the molecules of gravel/dust/sand would also result in a fair bit of heat and you could probably crush people like this, similar to Gaara's sand coffin technique from Naruto. Vibrating the earth beneath someone's feet may lead to many of the same sorts of bone-shattering, vomit-inducing, and balance-ruining resonance techniques sound bending could pull off.
