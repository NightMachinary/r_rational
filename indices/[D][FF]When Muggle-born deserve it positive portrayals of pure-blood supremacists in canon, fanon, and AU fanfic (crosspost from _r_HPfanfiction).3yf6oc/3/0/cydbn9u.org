  How one should treat people new to their superpowers is obvious, but what is less obvious is what logical reasons the old guard would have for fearing and hating the new blood. You'd think it would be an easy way to gain power: gather all of them up in one place just after they found out, show them how your side is kind and inviting, and then teach them all about how to...oh. Hmm.

This suggests an interesting possibility: that anti-Muggleborn sentiment began to increase at the beginning of, and /because/ of Dumbledore's tenure as Headmaster. Perhaps when Hogwarts is run by someone not particularly sympathetic to Muggleborns, there's less negative feeling toward them society-wide. It's not so much about 'assimilation' as... call it gratitude.
