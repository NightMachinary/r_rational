I will eventually get my Hermione/Draco fic finished, but it's largely about this. Why do people hate muggleborn? Well, why do people hate blacks? I went on some white-supremacists boards and tried to find the most cogent arguments, then just used those, writing in my own counterpoints.

  Hermione didn't look up from the labels, where she was writing in neat little script. “Muggle-born come into wizarding society at the age of ten or eleven, picked up by the Ministry,” said Hermione. “Even with professor McGonagall around to help us, my parents and I were barely able to find all of the items on the list of school supplies, and my parents are rather clever people.” She looked up at him. “And I don't just mean clever for muggles.”

  “Spare me the story of the poor disadvantaged muggle-born,” said Draco with a sneer.

  Hermione continued on like she hadn't heard him. “A muggle-born arrives at school with far less preparation than someone who was born into a magical household, and the teachers and curriculum assume a basic level of knowledge about magical subjects that the muggle-born just don't have. When muggle-born go home for the summer, there's no one that they can really talk to about schoolwork, and their parents can't really help them, which means that for most, they go into the next school year without remembering as much as their pureblood peers. Did your father help you over the summer?”

  “No,” said Draco. “He hired me a private tutor.”

  “Well, my mother and father wanted to help me, but they couldn't,” said Hermione. “They had never gone through the same courses in their muggle schools, and the subjects themselves were confusing without that background. I suppose they could have hired me a private tutor as well, if they were fantastically wealthy, or the exchange rate between currencies were more favorable, but we didn't even know that there were tutors, which just brings me right back to my point, which is that muggle-born students do worse because they come in at a disadvantage that they must work very hard to cancel out. That's without getting into the issue of the impact of prejudice perpetuated by the blood purists.”

  “Oh come now Granger,” said Draco. “You can't possibly be blaming blood purists for muggle-born getting poor marks.” It took an effort not to say mudblood, but there was really no point in using the slur here, and besides that, she didn't seem to really understand it. Saying mudblood would only make him look like he was too lazy to follow what she was getting at.

  “If you had been listening to me, you would have heard that I was doing no such thing,” said Hermione. “The thrust of my point is that I would expect muggle-born to do worse in school, and that's precisely what a look at the grades will show, on average. Dumbledore does a disservice by trying to hide it from the world, and your father does a disservice by pretending that we should explain with blood purity what can be better explained by looking at how muggle-born deal with school. The same applies to other things as well, like why we tend to have worse jobs within wizarding society or a higher rate of crime; after all, career success, education, and criminality are all correlated. This would be the case even if blood purism were ended tomorrow.”
