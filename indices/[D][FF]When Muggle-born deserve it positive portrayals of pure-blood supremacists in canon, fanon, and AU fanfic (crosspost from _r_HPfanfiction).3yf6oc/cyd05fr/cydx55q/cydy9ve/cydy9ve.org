Yeah, there's a whole section in /Metropolitan Man/ about fail-deadly bomb-making that I've gotten more than a few comments on. More generally, my history is full of a lot of either contrarian or socially unacceptable websites, because I think they're great sources to mine for characters or viewpoints. There have been a few times that I've thought to myself, "In the past day I've read the Unabomber Manifesto, followed by instructions on bomb-making, followed by a white supremacist website, I wonder whether that tripped any algorithms somewhere". So far so good though.
