It baffles me that, in the immediate aftermath of the Boston bombing, the police tried to find potential copycat bombers by visiting the houses of people who googled "pressure cooker bomb". Seriously, what the fuck? The fact that it was a pressure cooker bomb was already in the news at that point, of course people following the news are going to google it to figure out what it is.
