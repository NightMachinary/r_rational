Do you ever wonder about how things like this look from the outside? For example, when I was writing Pay Attention, I spent a lot of time researching where to buy heroin in Boston. I've also spent quite a few hours reading up on explosives. If someone subpeoaned my Google history, I'd have some explaining to do.

I should do my research through Tor, but Comcast seems to block it in my area.
