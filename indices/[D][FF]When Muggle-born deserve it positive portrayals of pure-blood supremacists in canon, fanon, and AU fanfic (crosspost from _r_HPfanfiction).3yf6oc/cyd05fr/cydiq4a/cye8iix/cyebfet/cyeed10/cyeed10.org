Fair point. IQ has its uses, but is clearly limited and has a history (mostly left behind) of being demonstrably culturally unfair. I wouldn't object to the D&D stats being treated as similarly 'biased'. Though it would be interesting to see what orcs could have mentally to make up for the decreased skill points & will save.
