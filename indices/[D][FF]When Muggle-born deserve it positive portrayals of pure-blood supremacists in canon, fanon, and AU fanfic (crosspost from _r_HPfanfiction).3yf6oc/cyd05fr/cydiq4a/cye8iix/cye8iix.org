But do also note that orcs (most subtypes of them in D&D at least) are /actually/ on average less inherently intelligent than humans. And less charismatic. And less wise. And also stronger. While I'd love to read a good story dealing with the subject, I think you would have to choose between treating their mental stats as equal to humans or end up with the conclusion that there should be permanent institutional policies in place to address the fact that this group of people is on average genetically stupid, ugly and unwise.
