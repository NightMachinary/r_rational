  The "Orcs are born dumber, stronger, and more weak-willied" is akin to the phrenology argument used by US Southern slave-owners' to justify their point of view.

No, it pattern-matches to that argument, but its truth value need not be the same as the truth value of that argument. It's like telling a socialist that his arguments sound similar to the arguments used by Communists to kill millions of people.

This is especially the case when talking about a fictional world. Whether someone has lower IQ in the real world is something you have to find out, and the process of finding out is subject to bias. In a fictional world, it's whatever you say it is.
