  *Gun Safety Courses Spark Controversy*

  Wasilla Alasksa: A local principal's gun-safety policies have become the center of a community row.

  "My policies are simple, common sense," explained Principal Bumble, "We know that all children in this town will, at some point, come into contact with loaded firearms. Any responsible parent should support gun safety classes for all of our community's children."

  Bumble's planned curriculum includes lessons on the rules of gun safety, instructions on the proper assembly of firearms, and a course on 'defense against dangerous creatures.'

  The principal, with advice from NRA educational specialists, has also introduced students to a number of gun-centric games, such as "Exploding Snap" or "Gunslinger's Checkers" designed to build student's proficiency and comfort with firearms.

  Bill Black, local hunting guide, opposed these changes, particularly Bumble's decision to require students to attend classes while armed.

  "Yes, I've taught my own son about guns." said Black, "But only with direct supervision. The principal's policies are a completely different matter, bordering on neglectful."

  Local security guard Dave Lestrange, echoed Black's sentiments. "I guess I'm ok with my kid carrying a gun. He's heard me talk about safety since before he could walk," said Lestrange, "But I've heard that the school's loaning guns to kids from the lower-48. Those kids come from household's where no one's ever seen a pistol. That's just asking for accidents."

  Other local parents, who commented on the condition of anonymity, have said that they've told their children not to sit near children from the lower-48, at least until Bumble's gun safety courses have actually begun.

  Bumble strongly condemmned this pratice, and explained that the gun-loan program was a necessary step towards ensuring that all children, even those from households without firearms, could receive a complete and equal education.

  "I'm deeply saddened," the Principal said, "that this sort of xenophobia has taken root in our community. To hear these people talk you'd think that an 11-year-old shouldn't be immediately trusted with an instrument of distruction merely because they've never been told how to handle one safely."
