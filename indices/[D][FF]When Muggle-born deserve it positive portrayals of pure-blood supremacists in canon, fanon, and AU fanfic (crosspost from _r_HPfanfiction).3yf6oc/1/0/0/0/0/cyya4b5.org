Are you referring to Michele Catalano?

If so, there was an [[http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/1/4580654/michele-catalano-google-search-pressure-cookers-backpacks-bomb-scare][update to that story]] where the police said they got a tip from a company that a fired employee had googled "pressure cooker bombs" and "backpacks".
