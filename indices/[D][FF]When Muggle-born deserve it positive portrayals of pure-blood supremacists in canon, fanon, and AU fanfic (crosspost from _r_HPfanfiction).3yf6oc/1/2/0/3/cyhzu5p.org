There's a Forgotten Realms (D&D) series of novels written by a famous author, R.A. Salvatore that has completely killed orcs for me because of this- the Hunter's Blade trilogy. Spoilers!

It starts out as, in typical fashion, the orcs overrun a dwarves kingdom. But then their leader decides to form an orcish kingdom with the conquered land (and thus, a true Orc civilization, begin trade, establish diplomatic relations, etc.). It was very novel at the time but it just completely ignores how orcs are portrayed in the rest of the D&D setting. In hindsight I'm a bit surprised he was allowed to it.
