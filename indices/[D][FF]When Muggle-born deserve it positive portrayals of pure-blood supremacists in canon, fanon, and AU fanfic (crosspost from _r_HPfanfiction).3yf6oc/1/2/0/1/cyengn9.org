Point taken. The "Orcs are born dumber, stronger, and more weak-willied" is akin to the phrenology argument used by US Southern slave-owners' to justify their point of view.

With each new edition, D&D is also changing with the times, changing the thief class into the rogue, using both male and female pronouns, moving away from binary sex/gender labels... and 'racial disadvantages.' There are only minor racial bonuses, no negatives. In fifth edition, players can make their characters be any sort of class they want them to be, as long as they are willing to have their character work a little harder.

Getting a chance and working hard to prove one's worth are key arguments favoring the disenfranchised.

(And to keep this on topic, squibs are also at a disadvantage and could be akin to the disabled. They just need a few custom devices to give them the independence they need in society.)
