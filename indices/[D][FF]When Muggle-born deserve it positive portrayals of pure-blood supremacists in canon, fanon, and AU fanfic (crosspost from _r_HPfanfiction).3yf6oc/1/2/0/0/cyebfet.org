If you're going to go with mechanics, then it would be interesting to not go with half-measures. Orcs might have low 'int', 'wis', and 'cha', but do these mechanical deficiencies translate to lacking intelligence, wisdom, or charisma as we understand them in the real world? I'd wager there's only a partial correlation, and that the gaps in the games mechanics leave enough room for the question of whether orcs need 'help' to not be clear.
