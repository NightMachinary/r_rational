It's falsifiable, but they probably don't have the sample size. What they need are pureblood students who were (for whatever reason) raised by muggles. Harry would /almost/ fit, but he's halfblood, not pureblood. There's no good canon answer to how many children really go to Hogwarts, but it's pretty low, so I would expect most students to come from traditional families, especially considering wizarding conservatism (minus some number who were orphaned by the wizarding war). They could also go the other way with muggleborn raised by wizards, but those are probably even more rare.

I suppose if blood purism makes claims about how well halfbloods do you might be able to correct for the inevitable class issues and go from there. But it's really a question of how much data the wizards have available to them.
