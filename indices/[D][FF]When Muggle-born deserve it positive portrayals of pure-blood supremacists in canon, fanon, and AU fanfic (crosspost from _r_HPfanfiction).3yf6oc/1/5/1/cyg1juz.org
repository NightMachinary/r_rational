How about 2nd generation muggle-borns?

If Hermione is correct, a wizard with 4 muggle grandparents and 1 or 2 wizard parents would be on par with pureblood wizards, at least academically. If Draco is right, 2nd generation mudbloods will still fail at school just as hard as their parents had despite being exposed to wizardry from birth.
