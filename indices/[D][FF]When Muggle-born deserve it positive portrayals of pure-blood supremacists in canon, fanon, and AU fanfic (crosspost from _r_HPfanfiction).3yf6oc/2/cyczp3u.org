The reasoning that would seem most simple to me would be to argue that magic is a finite resource. Though never really discussed outright in canon it does seem that the greatest achievements in terms of raw power are further in the past of the wizarding world (when populations in general were much smaller).\\
If we assume that there is a limited amount of ambient magic which all wizards draw from then an influx of wizards is to the detriment of those already present. This also fits nicely with the tendency for relatively small families among wizards and the scorn commonly expressed towards the Weaslies for bucking that trend.
