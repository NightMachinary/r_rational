I came up with one possible explanation for why people would assume muggleborns are incompetent:

The trace is a recent invention, and before that, muggleborns were only occasionally discovered by chance. A lot of the time they would start school at a later age and far behind their peers. Plus with no support system, they'd be under a lot of stress. So it makes sense that they wouldn't amount to much.
