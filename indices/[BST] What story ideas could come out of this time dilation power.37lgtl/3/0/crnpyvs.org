Googled that and realised I had read part of the story already. The biggest difference is that SDG can't change back. He's stuck at this speed, and that makes for a very different story (imo) than a story where the character can speed up or slow down at will. As long as the implications turn out very different, I don't think this similarity matters overly much.

Plus, it's not like Flicker is the first speedster ever invented, or the first person to ever be able to freeze / slow time for themselves. It's the involuntary, constant nature of SDG's power that makes him interesting, in my opinion. The story is just as much about him struggling against his power as it is using it.
