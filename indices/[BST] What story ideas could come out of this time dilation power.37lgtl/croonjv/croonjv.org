How does gravity work?

It's possible that he can jump super-high, as long as he's wearing shoes. On the other hand, maybe gravity shifts between reference frames, which seems like it would produce some sort of free-energy exploit or other.

(Also, does he have an aura turning light back to normal? Does he get a Doppler effect when he runs, or something?)
