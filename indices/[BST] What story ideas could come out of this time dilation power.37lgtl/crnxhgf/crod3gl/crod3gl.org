One of the first things I plan on doing before expanding the story is to make a good character, rather than the fairly generic one I put in my first draft. After all, the major literary problem with this story is that the character is completely alone. They could talk via letters to people (with the other person responding in real-time via their frame of reference) but even so, there will be very little dialogue, and the character's internal monologue will absolutely have to carry the story.

The character is willing to steal to survive, though he feels somewhat guilty about this necessity. For that reason I imagine he'll take steps to minimise the amount of stealing he does, such as using taps to gain water rather than stealing bottled stuff. It's what I believe I would do.

I hadn't thought of the similarities between this and a survival story. That's a source of inspiration I hadn't thought of. Thanks!
