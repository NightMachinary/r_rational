Thinking about it further, I've cleared up some edge cases I hadn't thought of before your comment. If SDG is touching a human, the human's body is moved into SDG's frame of reference, but they won't have the same speed of cognition as SDG. Think of a human like a computer. SDG can lift a laptop and move it to another room, but he can't make it compute any faster. He's not bringing the electronics into his frame of reference, just the chassis. I'm not sure exactly how this would feel as the normal human.

I hadn't thought about what would happen if a normal person and SDG were both touching the same object. That's a very good question. Based on the rules I have already set, the item (but not the human touching the item) would be in SDG's reference frame. Any item SDG touches or is within an inch or two of (to allow for stuff other than clothing to be in his reference frame) is within his reference frame, but that doesn't apply to objects touched by the touched object. If it did, the whole planet would be in his reference frame, and he now has the much less interesting power of "The world slows down every time he jumps".

However, that leads to an interesting conclusion; SDG now has the power to break anything he wants. If he kicks a wall, the wall doesn't break, but if he hits it with a sledgehammer, the sledgehammer is in his frame of reference and the wall isn't. The sledgehammer will cut through the wall as though it were air.

This may be an exploit that the character could discover fairly late in the book as the solution to a problem. It definitely changes the flavour of the story somewhat, changing it from a survival story to more of a superhero story once this kind of exploit is discovered, but I like the idea of it. I may have to use it.

The major problem with this, however, is that there is no way that he would fail to discover this for long. If he accidentally tapped his spoon against a bowl, the bowl would shatter. If he placed the bowl down on the table, the bowl would probably keep going as if the table wasn't even there.

I'll have to think about this one.
