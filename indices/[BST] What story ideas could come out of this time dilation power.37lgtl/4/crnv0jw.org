Well. that person just lost all ability to have social interactions in any normal way. And nearly at all. I mean, you could start correspondence with a bunch of people, and people who respond very quickly will only be delayed from your pow for.. oh, a couple of weeks or months.

.. This is a recipe for insanity. Humans do not function well at all in total isolation. Most likely result is that the victim does something they have wanted to do, and now have the power to carry out until they can't take it anymore, and then kill themselves. The "something" depends on the person in question. Read the local library. Go run through a couple of warzones at high speed disassembling all the weapons, track down every pimp in their home town and disembowel them... but the nigh sure and certain end game is "suicide".
