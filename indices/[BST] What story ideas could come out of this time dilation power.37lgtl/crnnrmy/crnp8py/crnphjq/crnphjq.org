If the character is able to give other humans his reference frame (I assume this is how this service would work) he could simply go 'door-to-door' as it were. Touch someone, bring them into the reference frame, give the elevator pitch. If they say no, just remove your hand and move on. In my current draft, bringing other living things into the reference frame is not possible, as it removes much of the feeling I'm going for with the story if he can just talk to someone in his own time whenever he wants. But it is possible if I took the story in this direction. I've updated the OP to include this as the fourth (least important) rule.
