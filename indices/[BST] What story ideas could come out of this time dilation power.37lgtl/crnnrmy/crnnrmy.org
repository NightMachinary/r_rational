Your character can go to college campuses and sell services to allow people to catch up on sleep and study time.

After years of subjective time, the main character becomes deranged, goes to an ER and brings people into his reference frame while they're bleeding out or under anesthesia during surgery, likening himself to the angel of death.

The main character finds that DUN DUN DUN he's not the only one... or thing moving at this speed.
