He could melt pieces of the computer together so that it counts as one object. And mess with the circuit breaker to let it draw 3,600 times as much current. And if he wants internet he'll have to reprogram the drivers, and it will still go agonizingly slow.

Once he gets the internet and stuff working, he can set up a website where people email or text him a problem and, provided he's in the same city, he instantly solves it. He can distribute fliers. This should give him something to do fairly quickly, and decrease the time until someone finds something important for him. Also, he might be able to make enough money to pay for bare necessities.

Liquids are annoying so he could try eating watermelon and other high-water foods. Also, he could eat ice.
