Plot ideas:

- Slowed-down guy discovers another slowed-down person; adversary or love interest, or both
- SDG gets discovered by the military/government, and they try to kill/control him (or hire him)
- SDG gets discovered by a major corporation, and they try to kill/control him (or hire him)
- SDG has to respond to a major disaster that he sees happening in slow motion (recommend tsunami, or if the math is favorable, an explosion)
- SDG grapples with all the limitations of his existence which can't be eliminated with logistics-fu (ennui, lack of human contact, lack of socialization)

Then you can link these things together in some way; the first third of the plot is SDG getting his systems in place and exploring the limits of his power, and this is disrupted by his discovery of a sound system playing a message at 1:3600 speed, just for him. That leads him to the discovery of another SDG, who has been less cautious and is being tracked by the government, etc.

I would generally shy away from an "aliens did this" plot, but that's just me.
