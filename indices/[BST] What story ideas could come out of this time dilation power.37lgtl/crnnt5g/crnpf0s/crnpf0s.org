The first, fourth, and fifth ideas are ones I have thought of. The first seems cliche, so I disregarded it. The very first thing I came up with when imagining a story like this is a second SDG. I am no longer surprised when this happens in a superhero movie, and I am notoriously easy to surprise in a story. I almost never see things coming, even when narratively obvious. That said, I won't throw the idea out; turning cliches into interesting things is a pretty common thing for a rational story.

I don't think the fifth idea can carry a story on it's own without some defined conclusion, though it would definitely make the cut for inclusion to some degree. The fourth idea was colored by my belief that there had to be a supernatural reason for the power to be there, and thus the disaster would be one that the protagonist had specifically been slowed in order to avert. But if this wasn't necessary, or I chose to include a more naturalistic explanation (Military/government/corporation was experimenting with Time, somehow our protagonist was the person who ended up being hit by it) I could definitely take the story in that direction without worrying too much about a Grand Purpose. This would also allow for a resolution to the conflict, too: the party dealing with Time has the ability to change SDG back, but has set up safeguards even SDG can't break. To get back to his normal life, he has to do what they want.

Combining these ideas gives me an interesting outline.

Part 1: Character learns how to survive in the new world, explores the limits of power.

Part 2: Several months or even years have passed, and SDG has learnt (or is struggling to find) methods to maintain his sanity and well-being long-term in the frozen world. At least an hour (5 months) and up to half a day (5 years) have passed. At this point, he's contacted by the party that did this to him. They have probably waited this long because the experiment went wrong, and they took less than a day to find him because as soon as they saw something suspicious (SDG will eventually have to do something pretty conspicuous to feed himself) they knew the experiment had succeeded on him instead of the intended subject. They offer to turn him back if he does something. This something is probably why they planned to turn one of their own operatives.

Part 3: Character does the thing, or perhaps grapples with the moral problems of doing said thing, or perhaps tries to turn himself back without doing the thing. Either way, this resolves the story in one way or another.

I don't know why I didn't think of a plot like this before, as it makes a great deal of sense. But then, finding ideas that make sense but have slipped by my radar is precisely why I posted here.

Thank you so much!
