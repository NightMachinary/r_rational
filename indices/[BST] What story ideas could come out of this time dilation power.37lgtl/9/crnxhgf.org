One thing I would suggest is more characterization. You need the guy to have a backstory of some kind and your diary format is the perfect opportunity to reveal some of that. Whether it hints to any possible source of why this happened to him would probably be part of his exploration of his backstory in written form (but finding out doesn't necessarily have to be the plot). Then make the story about survival, about fending off insanity, about being productive despite being somewhat doomed. At its heart it could be a 'last man on earth' or a 'stranded on a desert island' story with a very cool twist - he can still ALMOST interact with people and his actions still have consequences for others.

He should at some point here realize that the situation is not that dire from a logistical perspective, at least as long as he is willing to steal. He would have to be a real goody-goody to not be willing to steal in order to simply survive. Any grocery store has enough food and beverage to allow someone to survive for years. He can cover enough distance to excrete over a wide enough area to cause little issue and has no worry of being observed. He just needs to give up the idea of living his normal life in his house, which understandably might take him a few days. The struggle with the morality of it would be a long term plot point and him trying to make things better for the people he steals from might be a good goal. He could become a robin hood of sorts, stop robberies, steal from criminals, etc and do good in order to inject meaning into his week or so that he has to live.

Look to any story about a man stranded on a desert island or planet or left as the last person alive for inspiration. Just staying occupied and hoping for a way to communicate with people or find a way out is plot enough most of the time.
