  The first seems cliche, so I disregarded it. The very first thing I came up with when imagining a story like this is a second SDG. I am no longer surprised when this happens in a superhero movie, and I am notoriously easy to surprise in a story. I almost never see things coming, even when narratively obvious. That said, I won't throw the idea out; turning cliches into interesting things is a pretty common thing for a rational story.

The reason that this trope is cliche is that it does a lot of heavy lifting. The Evil Counterpart allows the author to make a commentary on their hero, offers an easy way to increase the threat level, speaks to the human desire to not be alone in the world, etc. It's a /huge/ multitool. I don't think authors use it because they're lazy, I think that they use it because it's effective, regardless of whether the audience is really surprised by it or not. It became cliche on its merits, not because authors were necessarily copying each other.

(I'm not saying that you should use it of course. What I mean is that cliche isn't really a sufficient reason to ditch an idea, because all of the "best" ideas are going to be cliche, and cutting yourself off from the best ideas that the collective intelligence of authors has come up with over hundreds of years is going to make things a lot harder. Write what you want to write, but don't shy away from something just because it's been done before.)
