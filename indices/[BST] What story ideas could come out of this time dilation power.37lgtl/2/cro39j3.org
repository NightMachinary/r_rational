I think the mistake is making the slowed-down guy the protagonist- instead, make him the maguffin. He is the ghost, the unknown, struggling to reconnect with a society he has lost- every written interaction comes excruciatingly slowly from his perspective, however, he is the ultimate spy. Have the protagonist be someone who discovers his existence, you get to slow reveal the time issues to the audience as the protagonist discovers them, then have them trade on finding a cure for the time dilation and solving problems for the protagonist in ways only a super speedster could. Also- how do relationships work when your communication is so different- by the time a day has gone by for the protagonist, years have passed for slowed-down guy. To that end- what if slowed down guy has many, many contacts, and is playing a very slow (to him) game of chess for some unknown nefarious (or not) purpose?
