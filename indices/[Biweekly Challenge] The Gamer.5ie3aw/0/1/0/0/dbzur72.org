Maybe it won't if that's the case. The problem is that Chooser's deduction chain:

#+begin_quote
  RPG mechanics existed in RPG games before human magic enforced them on reality. → Human magic must've enforced them in RPG games prior to manifesting in a more global scale. → RPG mechanics must have a will of its own, which can be gauged by analysing which tropes have been the most popular in RPG games.
#+end_quote

seems like an example of faulty Aristotelian reasoning to me. For example, what if human magic /does/ enforce a unique kind of reality warping (the RPG mechanics), but that's as far as its influence goes on its own (i.e. without human agents to further shape it through their personality traits, moral principles, etc)? What if it somehow made human societies create games with RPG elements, but all the rest of the content in RPG games\videogames\etc was decided by basic demand and supply (i.e., in supporting the videogame industry were mainly interested videogame players, and since they were regular citizens, they also liked seeing justice being served in the games they played)?

I agree that Pilot's decision of nuking Earth from orbit ASAP was rushed. But even if they were in a losing battle against the other reality-warping race, going to humans right away and briefing them on the whole alien metaverse was not the right decision either --- at least not until they had a valid proof through their observations that their hypothesis regarding the nature of human magic was the correct one.

So Pilot rushing with his plan of destruction without cunsulting with anybody was the first [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot][WhatAnIdiot]] case in the story, Chooser deciding to haphazardly bring the whole human race into the loop was the second one (admittedly, she was in a zeitnot), and the inter-dimensional counsel not having foreseen a possibility of an enforcer going rogue (like Pilot did) and not preparing any fail-safes against such a scenario was the third one.
