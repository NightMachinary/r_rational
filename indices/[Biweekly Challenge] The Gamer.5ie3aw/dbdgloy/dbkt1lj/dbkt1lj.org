A really well done short story, and a good opening to other possible stories in the same universe too. Thank you for writing it.

(spoilers)

What the Chooser failed to notice though was that the prevalent “protags save the world” stories were appealing mostly to those of the humans who weren't hungry for power to begin with. The power-hungry ones went into politics and ignored the manifestations of the human magic on the world (the RPGs, etc) because before the Awakening those manifestations were simply not any good for climbing up the power ladder and putting your boot on the world's throat.

And now that it has become good enough for them, those types of people will start influencing the “default” narrative patterns much more, and likely make the human-made RPG much more ruthless.

Hell, if Chooser just ended up in China instead of Japan and had her introduction to human story-telling from a xianxia reader, she might've even deciding to support the decision of nuking the whole thing from orbit.
