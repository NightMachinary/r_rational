I didn't expect much from this story especially since I found the beginning pretty weird and difficult to get invested in the characters, but man oh man did it end up being awesome. You didn't just take the Gamer idea in a completely non-traditional direction, but you really managed to get to the heart of what RPG mechanics are really supposed to make us feel and why that's so important to us.

You should repost this on the subreddit after the challenge is over so more people will see it. I don't usually read challenge entries even after the winners are announced, but this was fantastic. I want to see more of this world and what happens next. I personally found this cast of characters to be kind of boring, except for their moral conflict, but I adore high concept adventure and you've got the creativity for it.
