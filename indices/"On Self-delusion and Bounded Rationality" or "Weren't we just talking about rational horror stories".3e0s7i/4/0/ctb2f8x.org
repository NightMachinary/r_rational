I don't have my copy on hand, but I believe the core concept was first laid out by Thomas Schelling in "Strategy of Conflict" (circa 1960). It might have been Bertrand Russell (around the same time) if it wasn't Schelling. The wording would be different, but not by much; "chicken" is one of the classic games in game theory.
