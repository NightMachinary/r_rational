Besides, you have to be a really /primitive/ mortal to be that cowed by the mere outward appearance of a god. It's the /soul/ you should be genuinely afraid of, if its alignment is too out-of-whack with yours. Mystic awe is cheap and undeserved next to what a Power Who Is can really do to the fabric of reality if they cut loose.

And should the soul of a Power be too closely aligned with yours, well /then/ you're in quite enviable Deep Shit.
