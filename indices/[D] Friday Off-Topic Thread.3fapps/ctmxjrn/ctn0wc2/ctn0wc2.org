/Hogfather/ has a dreadful anti-moral at the end, IMHO. Also, once you consider words like "believe" and "probability" to be talking about states of information (Objective Informational Bayesianism, aka Jaynesianism), this argument holds no water, because no mere argument can entangle you with reality (be there a God or no); only causal entanglement can transmit information to alter a distribution.
