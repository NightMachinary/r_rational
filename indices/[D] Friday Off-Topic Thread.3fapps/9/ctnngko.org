Shameless self promotion for my blog:

[[http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com]]

I run a serial rational(ist) fiction there called Fall of Oso, while also posting bits of worldbuilding. I've been posting updates pretty regularly and google analytics is telling me I'm getting traffic, but there's not been much in the way of commentary on any of it so far. I'm curious how people are liking the way the story is progressing.
