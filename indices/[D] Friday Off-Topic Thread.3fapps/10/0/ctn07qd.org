I agree that quite a few people are acting hypocritically about this, both in the rampant doxxing, death threats, vandalism, etc. and the focus that's being placed on this one particular hunt as opposed to others.

But at the same time ... I don't feel a ton of sympathy. Palmer lives in Minnesota (same as me) so this has been getting a bit more conversation here, and while I can agree that a man's life probably shouldn't be destroyed so casually, he really should have been smart enough to see the potential consequences. Suffering the consequences that he had to have known were a possibility is ... well, he's the one who rolled those particular dice.

And in this case, there's not really much question. This /isn't/ a witch hunt, because that implies we're looking for a phantom, or picking people out with no clue whether they're the guilty party. He already admitted to killing the lion. The people who are angry with him aren't angry over whether it was legal or not, they're angry because of what he did.
