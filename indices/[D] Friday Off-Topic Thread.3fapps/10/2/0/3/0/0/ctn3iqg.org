I may have went overboard with the destruction of humanity, but it seems like a mainstream attitude in most of what I've read or heard on TV (I'm not from US, by the way, so my view may be distorted) of "green" inclination, that anything humans may want is secondary to preservation of the nature.

Like, almost every time any construction project is mentioned, be it apartment complex or mega-factory, the first thing you hear/see is "but think of the ecosystem!". And it's kinda implied that /no/ amount of economical value can offset /any/ ecological damage.

Of course, it may be that I'm reading too much into this, as OP has mentioned, people are perfectly happy to harass other people over multitude of issued, so the specifics are not that significant. It would be the same if he just drew a silly picture of some alleged prophet.
