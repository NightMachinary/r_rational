I think in this case it's really more about the fact that there was no real value to be had in killing the lion. They took the head and left the corpse to rot. The sole economical value seems to be in ... what, the ego boost of killing a lion? The entertainment of the hunt? The trophy of having its head on the wall (which requires a bribe to customs)? And the lion itself had /far/ more economical value than what was paid for the hunting trip, both in the form of scientific research and tourism.

And this is often the case when people talk about the environment; it's privatized profit and socialized losses. A factory pollutes the air, lowering the quality of life in everyone who has to breathe in the smog. Farmers dump pesticides and fertilizers into the rivers, meaning that we can't eat the fish there anymore.

This is /most/ of what people get upset about. There are going to be people like PETA who think that pet ownership is tantamount to slavery (or alternately, PETA wants attention/money and that's how they get it). But most environmentally conscious people (and I say this as someone who has met hundreds and hundreds of environmentally conscious people) just care about there being some balance between the private profits and social losses. Most of them (including myself) would argue that we're currently /way/ too far on the private profit side of things, even after a fair amount of successful action over the past few decades.

The second balance is between short-term and long-term. Short-term, it makes sense to fish the oceans clean until there are no more fish left. Long-term, /that's idiotic/. But it's not going to stop people who want to take their profit and then leave. I think that's something to be rightfully pissed off about.
