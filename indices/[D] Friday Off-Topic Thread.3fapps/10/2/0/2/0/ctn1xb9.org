I think characterizing a group of people by its extremists is insulting.

While I /do/ think that the "humanity is a parasite" crowd exists, I also think that they're very, very small. I say that as someone who spent some years working at a local Food Co-op in a very liberal city. I've had exposure to all sorts of kooky activists who believe all sorts of kooky things, not one of which has wished for the destruction of humanity.
