I think that's pretty close to being the ideal of a strawman. As a "green"-inclined person, I think that we should be creating a sustainable habitat for humanity (i.e. not one that's only temporary) and maintain what beautiful parts of nature we can for future generations. Killing off big game animals is stupid and short-sighted, /especially/ given that you can make money off of them through ecotourism. Culling is one thing, killing a strong, healthy animal is another.
