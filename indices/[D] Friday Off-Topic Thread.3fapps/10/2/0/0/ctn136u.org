What do you think about the argument that [[http://foundational-research.org/publications/importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/][maintaining nature as it is causes /vast/ amounts of suffering?]]

#+begin_quote
  The number of wild animals vastly exceeds that of animals on factory farms, in laboratories, or kept as pets. -- The massive amount of suffering occurring now in nature is indeed tragic, but it pales by comparison to the scale of good or harm that our descendants --- with advanced technological capability --- might effect. I fear, for instance, that future humans may undertake terraforming, directed panspermia, or sentient simulations without giving much thought to the consequences for wild animals. Our #1 priority should be to ensure that future human intelligence is used to prevent wild-animal suffering, rather than to multiply it.
