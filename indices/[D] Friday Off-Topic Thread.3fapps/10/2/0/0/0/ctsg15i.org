I don't really care about animal suffering.

That is, I acknowledge that animals have some capacity for suffering, given that some of them are sentient (if not sapient). And all else being equal, I would want to reduce suffering.

But with that said, it's low on the optimization totem pole for me. I eat meat. I mostly eat free-range, cruelty-free meat, but I /do/ eat meat, and my choice of which meat to eat is far more about feeling good about myself (or just improved meat quality) than it is about reduction of suffering.

So I don't care about the suffering of animals I have no connection to. Even among those animals that I /do/ have some connection to, I don't care about the suffering of all of them, only the ones that I like. (There's a deer that comes and eats stuff out of our garden. There are birds that wake me up in the morning. There's a white cat that harasses our cat. There are mice that my cat brings in, sometimes still alive. None of these animals do I care for.)

So without that emotional connection towards all animals, all I'm left with are strictly logical arguments in favor of caring about them in some sense other than their utility towards humans (whether that's research, aesthetics, their role in the biome, meat, companionship, etc.). The problem is that none of the strictly logical non-utility arguments in favor of animals really compel me, in part because of the lack of wide-scale emotion.

I don't think this is an ethically satisfying answer, which is why I'm hesitant to give it. And it's a conversation I've had with my grandfather-in-law (an ethical vegan) a few too many times.
