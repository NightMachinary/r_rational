What counts as "less-developed"? Chimpanzees? Mice? Lizards? Insects? I think the ability to feel suffering is a sliding scale and even though animals with smaller brains and neurosystems maybe aren't as fully "conscious" as people, they still feel some amount of pain because they partially share the same brain architecture than people.
