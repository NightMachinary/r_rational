I firmly disagree with your stance on the issue, but I am also sympathetic for the Minnesotan hunter. Maybe he's a dick, but he's not morally at fault for what happened, as far as I know. Cecil's death was awful, for several reasons: he was private property of humans who wanted to keep him alive, he had sentimental value for them, the hunters should have known better, etc. But the hunter being torn apart over this on social media is not responsible for it. He was essentially a tourist with a gun. He had gone on similar hunts many times before, legally and to no harm. I am inclined to believe his statement that he had no way of knowing the crew he hired this time were shoddy and unethical. They are the ones at fault here; they were the experts and they were competent enough to know how to do their jobs properly.
