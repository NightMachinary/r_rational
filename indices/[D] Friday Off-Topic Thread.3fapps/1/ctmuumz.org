I went to an orchestral concert last night, and while I enjoyed it (mostly modern pieces mixed with the music of early 20th century iconoclast composer Charles Ives), it got a standing ovation. Pretty much every play, concert, or performance piece I've gone to in the past few years has gotten a standing ovation.

The cause of this is standing ovation inflation. I think it's the same reason that the United States has a tipping culture; it was just something that happened for good service, then morphed into the standard, and now when you don't tip someone, you're not making a stand against the shifting social landscape, you're just an asshole (or you're both). And for standing ovations, when everyone else is standing you don't want to be the only one sitting, so there's a strong social pressure to just stand up and clap politely, because you were probably going to stand up anyway to get out of the theater.

I hate that social stuff. So much of it seems like a pervasive, necessary evil in my life. I am sociable, in that I can pretty easily navigate my way through these hoops. I just wish there were a way to opt out of some of the dumb stuff that society does without having some negative impact on me. I want to be able to say to people, "No, I don't want to have dinner with you, because I prefer to be alone" instead of having to invent some excuse or needing to give some assurance that I still like them. I want to be able to leave a friend's house by just saying, "I've extracted enough joy from this encounter, to the point where I think there's probably going to be diminishing returns, hope the same is true for you". I don't really have a meaningful way to accomplish this change that I want from the world, especially given that communication seems detrimental in this case (because it would make me look either weird or assholish).
