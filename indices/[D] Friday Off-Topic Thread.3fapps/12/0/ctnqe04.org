The canonical summary is the IPCC Fifth Assessment report ([[https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/][link]]), which draws together about a decade of climate science. It has the unanimous support of it's several hundred authors, and each word of the text must be approved by a consensus of the UN. Many climate scientists believe that it understates many dangers where there is substantial uncertainty, but it makes conservative assumptions and is rock-solid where any claim is made.

[[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf][Here's]] the summary synthesis report. I recommend the /Summary for Policy Makers/ of each of the three working groups (the state of the climate, expected impacts, mitigation options) to anyone, and the full (very long and technical) reports to anyone interested.

To dig into the detail of all the detail you mentioned will be a huge task - you're talking about the work of thousands of experts. It's certainly worth understanding (IMO); the best place to go after reading the full reports would be their citations, or university-level study of climate science.
