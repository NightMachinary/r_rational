I really don't see the relevance to climatology. I mean, yes, you've got movement of gases with uneven heat, but I would guess that the fluid dynamics work somewhat differently when you're dealing with 40km of air with a huge pressure gradient on the surface of a sphere over 6,000km in radius, instead of a chamber that's maybe a few megaliters.

That's the main point I've been driving at. You said you disagreed with hordes of experts in the field, and people told you it's silly to do that unless you're also an expert in the field, and you responded that you're an expert in a mostly unrelated field.
