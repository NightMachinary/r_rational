Roger that. Your position appears to be:

- Asking questions about science subjects in a rationalist setting is foolish on the off topic thread.
- Actually looking at the data because you want the facts and not the conclusions is foolish and a waste of time.
- You must have formal academic qualification in a field to fact check or to form an educated opinion, because you distrust the motivation.

Just curious, what is your motivation in mocking someone who wants to question their own assumptions, but demands evidence before accepting the mass-conclusion of their peers?
