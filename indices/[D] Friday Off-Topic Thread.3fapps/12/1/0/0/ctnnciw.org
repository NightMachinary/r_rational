  Qualified Nuclear Engineer. . . Which is a lot of applied thermodynamics

Sure, and organic chemistry is effectively applied quantum physics. But if I can design a quantum computer, that doesn't mean I know organic chemistry. You being a nuclear engineer doesn't mean you can understand climate change models without further training. And even if your training were the theoretical basis of climatology, that doesn't mean you could understand

  Oh and just to further polish the academic credentials I got fed up with the defense industry and am back at school getting my MS in computer science with my thesis on OCR.

Which just means you're at least moderately intelligent and okay with academics. Ah, but more than that: it means you're attending a university that has a graduate engineering program, which means it's at least moderately likely that they have courses in climatology that you would be eligible to take or at least sit in on. It means you have access to a university library and JSTOR and a host of other resources.

In other words, you're in a much better position to do some research to answer your own question than most anyone else here.
