Qualified Nuclear Engineer. . . Which is a lot of applied thermodynamics, and the way most models apply secondary effects such as human atmospheric input over primary effects such as change in solar output shows the popular lack of ability to multiply. There's other political spiders and profit motives involved that come from my experience in project management. After many years of learning to make accurate reasonable order of magnitude estimates I tend to trust my own assessment on situations where the statistical models routinely fail. Oh and just to further polish the academic credentials I got fed up with the defense industry and am back at school getting my MS in computer science with my thesis on OCR.

Are you familiar with Heinlein's quote on the democratic fallacy? Or on what everyone knows?

Anywho still interested in primary sources if anyone can point to evidence instead of making a silly argument that everyone believes it followed by a what do you know attack.

As an aside, why does someone need academic credentials to question a popular sacred cow? Isn't it enough to say what are the facts?
