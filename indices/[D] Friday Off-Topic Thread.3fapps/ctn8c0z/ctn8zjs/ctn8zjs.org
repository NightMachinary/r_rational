There are different types of love. I think you have to divide them up before you can get a sensible conversation going. C.S. Lewis divided it up into four categories based on the Greek words for love: storge (familial/familiar love), philia (friendship), eros (eroticism), and agape (Godly love). I'm understandably skeptical of that last one.

I think the loves can mostly be reduced to chemicals in the brain; they are (non-permanent) neurological conditions. Evolutionarily speaking, the loves serve one role or another, but rationally speaking, we're not beholden to /actually/ fulfilling those roles, in the same way that we can have sex just for fun instead of to create a child.

Other than that ... I don't know what the question is. I love my wife, which means I have a neurological condition which makes me want to be with her and make her happy, among other things. This neurological condition makes me happy in turn, so I have every reason to keep it around (and to stimulate her own neurological condition of loving me).
