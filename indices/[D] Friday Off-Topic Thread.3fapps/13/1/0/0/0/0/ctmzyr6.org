Why try to hold a conversation for the sake of conversation? If there are no questions which actually need answering, and there are no topics which are general and can be discussed then there is no -real- need for the conversation.

if it is a social event and conversation is a planned activity then it just means there need be something else to do in parallel, that would usually bring up topics by itself.

if nothing happens still then forcibly adding questions will not change anything.
