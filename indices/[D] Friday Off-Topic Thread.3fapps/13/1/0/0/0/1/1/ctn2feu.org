When I said "cuteness = waifuness", I was trying to put the concept in terms likely to be understood immediately by a frequenter of an imageboard. Pre-timeskip Hyuuga Hinata is more or less the archetype of "cuteness" in this context, for a better mental image. "Cuteness" and "hotness" are rather mutually exclusive.
