It's easier to munchkin an established universe. It's also easier to write familiar characters. You can read [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/other-universes][Yudkowsky's essay on the subject here]]. That said, I think it's also some community overlap. Lots of us came here by way of HPMOR, so either read fanfic, or at least saw its potential. That means that [[/r/rational]] as a group has a higher appreciation for fanfic and is more likely to write it. And because much of the "rational canon" was fanfic from the start, that means that much of what's produced afterward is going to be fanfic.
