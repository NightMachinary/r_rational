I went to GenCon this weekend, which had greatly accelerated my excitement for the board game that me and my friends are designing and making. Based on the categories I've seen at gencon, it's a tile laying resource management game, and is space themed.

We've got one prototype of the game that I laser cut from wood, which we managed to get a couple of people to playtest here, and who actually liked it and wanted to keep playing, which is an awesome feeling.

If anyone here is interested, we're hoping to have an initial print and play (though as advance warning, it's a hex based tile laying game, so print and play will involve a semi-decent time effort for cutting) available within the next week or two, and any feedback is highly appreciated, especially with any broken game mechanics that we've missed (like the infinite resources trick that one of our testers last night found)
