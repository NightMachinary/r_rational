Actually, I had completely forgotten that, thanks for the reminder as it does help a lot making sense of this.

However, I don't think it necessarily settles the inconsistency- for example, leaving aside how acceptable it is to have a god that completely absolves himself of near-genocide and other questionable acts, a lot of the basis for Christianity come from that (and at least I was still taught using the OT). Specifically, if you look only at the New Testament then a lot of the problems with abstinence, abortion, homosexuality mostly disappear... but instead they still implicitly act like Old Testament applies despite the rules having been changed.

And that's essentially the situation I'm heading towards with my friends... not very productive at all. I was just curious how other people dealt with it.
