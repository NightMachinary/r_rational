People interpret bits where the rules are said to have changed differently. Acts chapter 10 is sometimes interpreted to mean merely that food cannot be unclean and no dietary restrictions apply, and sometimes (much!) more broadly, as [[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2004/07/16/the-abominable-shellfish/][Fred Clark discusses here]]. There are a lot of other passages which admit varying interpretations as well.
