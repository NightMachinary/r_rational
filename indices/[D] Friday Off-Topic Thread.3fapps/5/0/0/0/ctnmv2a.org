  Specifically, if you look only at the New Testament then a lot of the problems with abstinence, abortion, homosexuality mostly disappear

Nah, the New Testament has three or four passages indicating that homosexuality is sinful, and one even says that they won't inherit the kingdom of God. It's a bit less ambiguous about it than the Old Testament. Abstinence isn't really a thing in the Old Testament, whereas the New Testament outright says it's better to be abstinent than to marry (though marriage is far preferable to fornication).
