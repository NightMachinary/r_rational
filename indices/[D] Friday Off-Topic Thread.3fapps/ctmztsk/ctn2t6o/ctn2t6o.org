For nonfiction rationality, go somewhere else; either to LessWrong, [[/r/LessWrong]], or [[/r/LessWrongLounge]]. /Please/ do not use this subreddit for nonfiction. That's not what it's for. If you have a burning desire to discuss some topic of general rationality, save it for this Friday thread, or for the comments section of a posted work of fiction.

(This is a bit difficult, because we're the largest, most active place on reddit for rationality ... but we're that large because we're restricted to fiction.)
