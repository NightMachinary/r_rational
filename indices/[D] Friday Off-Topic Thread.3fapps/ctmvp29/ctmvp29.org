I've started noticing how the tiniest differences in introductions can completely change how I read a story. Recently, the link to [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/muse.shtml][Muse]] billed it as "rational horror", and then I noticed horror stuff starting from basically the start.

The same thing happened with [[http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/?xcbv][The Cambist and Lord Iron]], "A Fairy Tale of Economics." I started looking for fairy tale elements, which I found.

Comparing that to when I read [[http://web.archive.org/web/20090414062819/http://www.asimovs.com/hugos_2009/Truth.shtml][Truth]], or novels like The City and the City or Ancillary Justice, where I knew absolutely nothing (beyond the fact that they were award winning) about them, I think that even the tiniest bits of information about a story can reduce my enjoyment of them.

What are peoples' thoughts/experiences on this? Do you like to go into a work with fresh eyes, or do you want some form given to your expectations beforehand?

EDIT: I suppose I should add my own counterexample, since I have it. I watched "Divergent" after hearing something like "It's not which traits you /have/ that determine your house, it's which traits you /value/". I think this improved my enjoyment of the film by quite a bit.
