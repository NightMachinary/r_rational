It depends on what the creator's intent was. Setting expectations with extra-textual information can be a really important part of creation. I listened to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BENxxDZFPmI][this piece]] last night, titled "Supermaximum", which is an exploration of incarceration. I /might/ have been able to pick up on some of that, but knowing what it was about beforehand (via program notes) enhanced my enjoyment of it.

So ... I don't know. I think it helps to know that you're reading a tragedy while you're in the middle of it, because otherwise the ending might leave a bad taste in your mouth. Sometimes the creator really wants to leave you in the dark (something I've often found can make horror in particular a lot more horrifying). It differs from piece to piece, mostly by creator intent.
