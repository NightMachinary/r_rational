I take it more as J.K. Rowling being inconsistent, because in everything else, it seems to be based on actual virtues, or the best house for your growth/success. Harry had to argue with the hat to be placed in Gryffindor, which is not at all consistent with your interpretation. Meanwhile, Pettigrew is a sink of vices: not ambitious, cunning, intelligent, studious, hard-working, or loyal, and he was simply bold enough (not brave either) to stab his friends in the back like that.

I think I prefer that interpretation, at least for canon. :P
