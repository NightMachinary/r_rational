.../Why/ do people do this?

Seriously, is there a name for this bias? If it is a bias? It's one of the most frustrating things in the world. I mean, where does a statement like this /come/ from?

  It seems like Eliezer has convinced a ton of nerds (I hate the word but let's roll with it) that they can succeed in writing fiction by applying this one weird trick. But you need much more than that.

wtf is this shit? There's not the faintest attempt at trying to support this claim. It's an impression based on the commenter's own inventions. And no one calls him out on /making shit up about other people that makes them sound worse than anyone actually has reason to believe./

Then you have this wild and confusing generalization:

#+begin_quote
  A general failing of HPMOR and most 'rational' fiction is they suffer from the same plot railroading. Instead of starting with a world rules, characters, problem, and unbiased evaluation of what happens they generally try and fast talk their way into some predefined plot.
#+end_quote

like he's read it all, and like that's some kind of problem of rational fiction instead of shitty amateur fiction i mean srsly wtf

And of course the coup de grace:

#+begin_quote
  I think it's tapping into a rich market, that of people who believe they are much more rational (read: smart) than the broader herd. The conviction is already there.
#+end_quote

This kind of thing is all over the place in so many contexts, not just this one instance, which isn't particularly bad. It just baffles me how people think it's okay to make this stuff up, and why so many people go along with it.

It needs a name, like the Just Making Shit Up Phenomenon, or the Sure Would Be Nice If This Incredibly Convenient But Clearly Ridiculous Sweeping Generalization Were True Bias.
