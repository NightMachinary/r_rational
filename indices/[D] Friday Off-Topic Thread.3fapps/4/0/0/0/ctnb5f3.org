One of my prouder gamer accomplishments is that I was involved with the demo game that 'pitched' /Race for the Galaxy/ to the eventual publisher (Jay Tummelson). I desperately wanted that game published. Still play it, waiting for the Xeno expansion.

My favorite recent games (and one sentence pitches) are

*Eclipse* -- Managable Space Opera

*Mage Knight* -- Start as a demi-god, conquer a land in 3 days. (Great solitaire, too!)

*Sentinels of the Multiverse* -- Co-op superheroes dripping with theme

*Coup* -- Bluffing game reminiscent of the old Eon game Hoax (but it works).

*Pandante* -- Poker + Coup: Your hole card's suits grant special powers. (Can be played for money or as a game)

*Baseball Highlights: 2045* -- A full game of BB in 6 cards. Manage a season in 60-90 min. I played a 28 player tournament of this (using 7 sets) and it was a blast. (Obviously that took longer).

*Quartermaster General* -- Brilliant WWII game in an hour (6 players). Each player has 8-12 pieces and a deck of cards.

*Too Many Cinderellas* -- Inspired Minimalistic Game from Japan. Remind the Hungover Prince who he met at the ball. (This one is literally 18 cards and 9 chits).

*Machi Koro* -- Settlers w/o the board (the expansion adds a dominion like element). (Good with children, but not to young).
