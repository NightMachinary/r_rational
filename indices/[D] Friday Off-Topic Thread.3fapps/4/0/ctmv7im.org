Eclipse, 7 Wonders, Tsuro, Dominion, Discworld, and (/sigh/) Catan are our go-to games. For more general "party" games, Telestrations, Wits & Wagers, or Scattergories.

I tend to give priority to games that have a pretty fast setup with minimal downtime between turns; Eclipse and Dominion are the biggest losers in terms of setup times, even with organization of the pieces.

(I don't consider pen-n-paper RPGs to be boardgames, but Pathfinder is the current system of choice - though I'm still trying to convince some friends into playing a Mutants & Masterminds game in my angels/demons/patriots/communists setting.)
