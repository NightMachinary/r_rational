I believe the following is attributed to Blaise Pascal:

God either does or does not exist. Let's say we can either believe in him or not. Case Y: we believe in him. If God exists, then yay!, eternal paradise. If he doesn't exist, we lost some Sunday mornings or something. Case N: we don't believe in God. If God does exist, then an eternity of pain and suffering. If he doesn't exist, then nothing happens I guess.

The difference in utility function of maybe eternal paradise versus maybe eternal torment is so great that it's better to believe in God than not.

Response 1: Seriously, the reason you're going to believe in some supernatural divine being is this mercenary calculation? You're hedging your bets in case God exists? Won't he think that's a bit disingenuous?

Rebuttal 1: Note that careful wording of the last paragraph. The argument isn't that you should believe in God because of some calculation, but that a person who does believe will be better off than someone who does not. You can find a separate reason to believe. After all, humans believe in all sorts of stuff. To quote Terry Pratchett:

  HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.

  "Tooth fairies? Hogfathers? Little---"

  AS PRACTICE. YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.

  "So we can believe the big ones?"

  YES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.

  "They're not the same at all!"

  YOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET---Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.

  "Yes, but people have got to believe that, or what's the point---"

  MY POINT EXACTLY.‚Äù

Response 2: There are more than two possibilities. Maybe the Christian God does exist. Maybe he does exist but humans have really garbled the translation. Maybe he doesn't exist but some other diety you should be worshipping does, and he'll get really mad at you for following a false god. Maybe multiple dieties aren't mutually exclusive.

Rebuttal 2: The cost-benefit analysis still points to following the subset of religions that maximizes probability of heaven (or equivalent) minus probability of hell (or equivalent).
