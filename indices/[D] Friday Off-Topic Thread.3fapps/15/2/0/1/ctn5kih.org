Yeah, I have, but the disparity between the OT and NT, in terms of depiction of God, is quite striking. Pascal's Wager fits with the UFAI OT God, but not the FAI NT God. With the former, the notion that "God is good" falls apart, unless you're defining "good" using "God" rather than the other way around, in which case you've stumbled into moral relativism while stubbornly claiming you haven't - you're the ultimate proponent of might-makes-right.

A non-Lovecraftian God is one that, if it were an AI, would be considered friendly.
