Opinions on the Cecil the lion issue?

(Prepares for downvotes)\\
Personally I think it's grossly wrong to destroy a man's life because he killed an animal. No matter how special the animal was or how endangered the species is. Lion hunting was allowed, he did pay money for it. (legally or otherwise)

Does it really make a difference if the lion was 'allowed' to be hunted or it happened to be the country's top attraction?

Keyboard warriors have now ruined his life over no grounds. This is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Tripathi][Boston Marathon]] thing all over again. People witch hunting and shaming someone they didn't know over a crime that purportedly happened which they found out about on fucking imgur.
