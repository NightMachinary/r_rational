A couple of reasons:

- The lion had a name and had already been humanized to some extent. It was a known quantity to a variety of people who cared about that sort of thing, and there were a ton of pictures taken of it which were ready to go for both media and social media purposes. If this had been some random lion, the headline would be "Lion poached" which isn't a story. "Cecil the Lion Killed" /is/ a story, especially with accompanying details (all of which exist thanks to the fact that the lion was a research subject). All that information gives the story meat.
- The hunter was found out. "Minnesota Dentist Kills Cecil the Lion" is an /even better/ story than "Cecil the Lion Killed", because it compels us to learn more about both lion and hunter. Once we've learned about them, we're more compelled to share, which in the digital age makes the story spread like wildfire.
- We exist in a time of wealth inequality and some general dissatisfaction. The average person sees a rich guy spending their yearly salary to go shoot a defenseless lion in Africa and gets /pissed/, not just because that (humanized) lion was killed, but because of the waste of money. Hunting big game is already typical rich guy shit anyway, the kind of thing where you think ... alright, you spent /that much money/ that basically did nothing but destroy value in order to stroke your ego. This feeds into the general sense that rich people are basically pricks who don't give a shit about the world; it confirms biases.

So really, the story has all the elements necessary for outrage culture to get spun up and working in full force. There are enough twists and turns that the story has some meat, which is good for more cycles than it would otherwise be. There's also not that much consumable news going on right now; the media (and social media) works on a constant content-delivery schedule, so they need /something/.
