Well, it's not that they feel pain /because/ they have a similarly structured brain, but rather we can guess that they feel pain due to the similarity. That's probably pedantry, though.

When I say "as capable," I'm referring to that sliding scale. I believe we can discount suffering-behaviors, insofar as they would not be suffering as much as it seems in concordance with their brain... size, let's say. But honestly that's only if one is being totally pragmatic. I certainly don't advocate animal abuse, particularly since it's indicative of someone willing to abuse humans as well. It's more on an institutional level.
