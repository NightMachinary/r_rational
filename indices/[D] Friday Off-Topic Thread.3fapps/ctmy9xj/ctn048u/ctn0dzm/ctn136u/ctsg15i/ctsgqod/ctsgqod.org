Thank you.

Even though you said it's not an ethically satisfying answer, I think it sounds pretty satisfying to me. Everyone has a "cut-off point" in regards to caring about other subjects. I've lately been reading essays about [[http://reducing-suffering.org/the-importance-of-insect-suffering/][insect suffering]], [[http://reducing-suffering.org/bacteria-plants-and-graded-sentience/][bacteria suffering, and plant suffering]] and even though I understand that these lower-level creatures /might/ suffer in some way (though I'm still a bit skeptical about that), I can't get myself to care about insects, and even less about bacteria or plants. Your cut-off point is somewhere between animals and humans, my cut-off point is somewhere between mammals and insects, and that's perfectly okay, I think.
