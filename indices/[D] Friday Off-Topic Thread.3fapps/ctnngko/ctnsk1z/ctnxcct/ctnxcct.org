I probably do need to probably put up a 'synopsis' page which tells about stuff, problem with original fiction is that you can't just build off the foundation of an established universe.

The story is, roughly, as such:

On a gas giant planet where continent sized chunks of stone are held aloft in electromagnetic equilibrium, human nations cling like insects to the back of the floating stone. How people came to this strange world has been lost to history following a devastating war many centuries past. As the civilisations of Aeria creep towards industrialisation and try to explore the world they find themselves in, old prejudices and conflicts begin to flare up. The Amat Empire, one of the largest nations of Aeria and home to the only mages in all the world, is sliding towards a war that might threaten to shake the world apart.

That's my rough "for this post on reddit" synopsis, I'll edit and clean that up before I make a page for it on the site, but I will get to that as well as updating the index page.

In terms of rational(ist) themes, I strive very hard to make sure no characters are holding the idiot ball. Aeria is a fantasy steampunk world, so I don't want to name names or explicitly reference real world studies. This makes it a bit less obvious, but the characters all still try to behave in a manner that makes sense to them, no one does anything for the plot, and I do sneak in some rationalist thinking methods when I can.
