I thought it was canon, in particular for Hermione being in Gryffindor. In the very first book, in the room with the potion riddle, she says that there are things more important than learning, namely bravery. So she's in Gryffindor.

/Harry Potter and the Natural 20/ gives the real explanation, though: there are a house for PCs, a house for villains, and two houses for NPCs to make up the numbers.
