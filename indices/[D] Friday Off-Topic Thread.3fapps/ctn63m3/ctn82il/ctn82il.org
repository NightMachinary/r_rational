I play too many video games for a writer, to be quite honest. Mostly HyperRogue, which is really great, a Roguelike unlike any other. It only costs two bucks, too, and the developer updates it with new content often. Hyperbolic geometry really is perfect for a Roguelike.

I acted in plays in high school, and even got a few lead roles; it'd be fun to continue that as a hobby in the future (I'm just entering college now). It'd also be neat to get into tabletop roleplaying games; I've always kind of wanted to, but high school wasn't really conducive to it and I've been afraid it'd turn me into an even bigger nerd than I already am. That's why I've avoided anime this long.
