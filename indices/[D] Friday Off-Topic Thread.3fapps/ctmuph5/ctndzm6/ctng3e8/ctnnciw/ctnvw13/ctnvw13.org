It is amazing how many times I've been insulted for saying I don't agree with a model but I want to look at the data and make up my mind. I know politics is spiders, but it's sobering to see how bad it is here.

As to the heavy thermodynamics aspect to nuclear power:

You might want to look up Thermal coefficient of reactivity (alpha sub T or fish T) and it's importance in power turning. Hint: It's illegal to have a positive fish T design in the US. Negative fishT provides negtive feedback to power excursions this is what separates and inherently safe reactor from a bomb. Chernobyl had a positive fish T under some conditions: it went boom.

This is how you have a hot rock not boil water, which boils other water, which makes the steam turbine go roundy-roundy. You end up spending most of your work on the roundy-roundy parts and maybe the hot water boiling other water parts. Trust me it's mostly an applied thermodynamics steam plant, and a hot rock in a can.

I asked for resources because being pointed at few good papers is usually very valuable just something to play with while my pleasure reading stack is a bit thin.
