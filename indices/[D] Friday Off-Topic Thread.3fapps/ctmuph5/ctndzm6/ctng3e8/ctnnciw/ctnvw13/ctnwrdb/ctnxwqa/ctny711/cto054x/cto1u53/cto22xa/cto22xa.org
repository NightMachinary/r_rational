Ah We interpreted that one differently.

I find it silly to assume I have to be an expert in a field to question it's assumptions. When asked for credentials I proffered mine and asked how they were relevant to wanting to look. Subsequent attacks were taken as general attacks due to their inflammatory tone and not in the vein of my original question. I think we still disagree with how silly it is to question conclusions or ask if some questions have been asked in another field.

Like you said you're not a heat guy, but if we are assuming climate change is man made, over other factors, what are the other factors what are their magnitude, is there damping in the system. Kind of basic questions when you step back and try to look at the big picture. There's lots of mixing problems and stratification that make it a dedicated field of study but I'm looking to see questioning criticisms I remember from my youth have been anwsered. That all the experts in the industry of climate change agree on climate change /shrugs/ political spiders.

I don't think I have to justify asking questions or consider myself silly for wanting to see the data when all the experts in the industry agree on the industry. My experience mostly is there as background for understanding how to apply a statistical model and a good basis in basic physics, which is really all you need other than time and interest to swat up enough information to ask interesting questions. I think we disagree on that, or you are assuming because I proffered some academic credentials that I assumed they were directly applicable, maybe I should have bothered to explain it'll be a good challenge and a fun thing to stretch my brain around /shrug/

That said I respect your taste in authors.

Good day.
