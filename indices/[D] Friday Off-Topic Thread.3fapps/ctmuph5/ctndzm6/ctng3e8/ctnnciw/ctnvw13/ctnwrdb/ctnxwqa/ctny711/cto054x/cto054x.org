Please calm down.

I'm not picking a fight, but I'm hardly going to just take mocking for admitting I disagree with the group, asking for a pointer towards some specific types of data that can change my mind.

To reply in specific:

I brought it up my experience the first time because I was told :

#+begin_quote
  That makes climate-change denial a ridiculous position if you don't have other scientific prior knowledge on the topic you are not telling us about.
#+end_quote

Do you have to be a climatologist to ask questions about climate or something?

I brought it up a second time, and I'll admit more than a little snidely in reply to your comment about Nuclear power being applied thermodynamics:

#+begin_quote
  Sure, and organic chemistry is effectively applied quantum physics. But if I can design a quantum computer, that doesn't mean I know organic chemistry.
#+end_quote

Because to do anything in the united states in the practical applications of nuclear power you need to be a good steam cycle guy. To make analogy to organic chemistry I think thermodynamics is to nuclear power as understanding the binding characteristics of carbon is to organic chemistry.

To be succinct I know I have a opinion, based on observed realpolitik, grant money biases, and other political spiders. I want to look at some data. I'm patient enough to puzzle it out as I have working my way through various fields I've worked in.

I'm willing to spend time hitting back when mocked or asked for credentials, as if they are a requirement to ask a question when I know what I need to change my mind.

Perhaps I'm being defensive of the long held opinion I'm taking the time to question, probably. Perhaps your mocking wasn't meant to be condescending and inflammatory, yeah right. I'm sorry I'm not willing to give you a free hedron for mocking the climate change denier.

I do disagree with you on the qualifications to understand the data. It's pretty easy to look at what the inputs are for a statistical model look up the magnitude of the inputs and see what the magnitude of other factors are if inputs are considered constant and what their historical variability is, if you can find the model.
