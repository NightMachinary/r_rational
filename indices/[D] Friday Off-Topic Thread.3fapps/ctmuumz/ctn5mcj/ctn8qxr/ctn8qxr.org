Only the multiverse? Weak. See no matter how hige of a scope you threaten it is ultimately meaningless, because even if the very highest levels of reality of your cannon are erased by evil, other authors seem to think they are beyond the scope of evils afflicting your world. There are after all, always concievable stories in which the hero won.

That's why I've gone above and beyond. If the evil in my story wins it will literally escape into other fiction and kill all your favorite characters.

Books you already own will be retroactively edited and the very information in your brain regarding the heros' victories will turn to defeates.

Liturature itself will bow before my supervillian or face destruction! Mwahahahahahaha!
