  I went to an orchestral concert last night, and while I enjoyed it (mostly modern pieces mixed with the music of early 20th century iconoclast composer Charles Ives), it got a standing ovation. Pretty much every play, concert, or performance piece I've gone to in the past few years has gotten a standing ovation.

I've been on the other side of this when the choir I'm in puts on a performance. I'm not sure if it's because of inflation or if I just never got it in the first place, but I get mildly annoyed at standing ovations.

I mean, we're good, but we're not /that/ good. There's no need for an entire new level of praise for our performances that sets us apart from merely clapping. (Individuals saying they enjoyed it and thanking us for the performance after the fact is very appreciated, though.)
