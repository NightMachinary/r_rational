For each prepared speech we have 2-3 minute evaluations (that are also done as public speeches in front of everyone, and likewise applauded). These evaluations include both praise and criticism, for whatever virtues or flaws your speech happens to include, with specific directions and constructive advice. For the evaluations and brief unprepared speeches, to get detailed feedback you have to talk to people during the break or after the meeting - though we also vote for a best speech in the seperate prepared/unprepared/evaluation categories each meeting as well. Also, there are paper slips everyone is encouraged to fill out to give their opinions of each speech anonymously as well. Finally, you get some speech statistics at the end of the meeting for each speaker too (length of speech from the timer, use of 'ah' and 'um' etc from an 'Ah counter', and good/bad grammar use from the evening's grammarian)

The fact that I am being evaluated and criticised feels a lot less threatening when I am speaking, if I know that I am going to be greeted by applause even though I know intellectually it may be false applause, and the actual out-loud evaluation will be delayed until later on. This is pretty 100% irrational but the emotional reaction exists anyways.
