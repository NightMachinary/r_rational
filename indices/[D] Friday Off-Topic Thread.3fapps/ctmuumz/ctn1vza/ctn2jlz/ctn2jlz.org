  My reason for not standing up at a performance is follows: the purpose of a standing ovation is for the audience to show the performers their appreciation for the performance. If I stand up all the time, the signal is now meaningless. I've gotten looks from people as if saying "you're a dick for not standing," but the opinion of a stranger I'll never meet again holds little weight.

The problem is signal transformation. It starts with people standing to show strong appreciation. Then it becomes standing to show regular appreciation. Then it becomes standing to not signal disdain. So if the accepted interpretation of sitting at the end of performance instead of standing with everyone else is that you didn't like the performance ... then that's what you're signaling, in spite of what you might hope you're signaling.
