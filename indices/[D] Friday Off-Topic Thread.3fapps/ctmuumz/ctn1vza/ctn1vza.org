My reason for not standing up at a performance is follows: the purpose of a standing ovation is for the audience to show the performers their appreciation for the performance. If I stand up all the time, the signal is now meaningless. I've gotten looks from people as if saying "you're a dick for not standing," but the opinion of a stranger I'll never meet again holds little weight.

In the US, workers who receive more than $30/month in tips can be paid $2.13/hour. Yes, if the amount of tips is low enough, their employer is supposed to pay them more so that they do make the federal minimum wage of $7.25. So I could make a stand and not tip, but the restaurant and waiter will more likely interpret this as me being a tightwad ("f!@#ing cheapshake asian at table 2 didn't leave a tip") than taking a social position.

At the end of the day, I have a more fulfilling job and am more financially secure than my server. In terms of utility function, $1-2 means more to them than it does to me, so I just go along. Is this rationalization?
