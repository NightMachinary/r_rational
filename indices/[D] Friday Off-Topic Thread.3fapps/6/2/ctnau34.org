Rea- Oh. Um. Wri- Wait. I'm sure I've got something else. Typing fiction! Listening to fiction! ...I really like fiction.

The only video game I really play is Smash Bros., though it's hard to find people to play with in Israel. We have been building a bit of a scene recently though, and are starting to have weekly meet-ups.

I supremely enjoy reading about etymology/linguistics/neurolinguistics.

I spend a large portion of my time just thinking, usually. I'm sure once I've finished my army service I'll be "doing things" a lot more often, but the past couple years have only enforced my habit of sitting and thinking for hours on end. Motivation is incredibly hard to come by, and every scrap of it is put towards my writing. Productivity in other areas has basically flatlined.

Only nine more months to go...
