Tabletop roleplaying games are my big hobby, personally, and I know at least one of the other players in my Pathfinder group frequents this subreddit.

Shameless plug of my (somewhat outdated) 'gaming resume' (because matching playstyles and expectations among a potential gaming group is the most efficient ROI of hedons-to-effort-invested that I've observed in any game, and potentially finding new, quality people to play with is always worth the trouble.): [[https://i.imgur.com/5a2rH5b.png]]
