Everyone dislikes kender. Kender are sort of OK in single-author fiction, but are almost universally disruptive assholes in actual play. Their fluff encourages them to not understand other people owning things and stealing from party members, among other things. A player wanting to play a kender is a reliable barometer of being a dick.

It's like fishmalks, but worse.
