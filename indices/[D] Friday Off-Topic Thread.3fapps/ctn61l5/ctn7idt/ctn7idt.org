Many Christians write off the Old Testament as a matter of their theology. Basically, when Christ came along, he changed all of the rules and Judaism was superseded by the Christian church with the New Covenant. So when they say that the Old Testament doesn't matter ... they're talking about one of the core assumptions of Christianity. The Old Testament /doesn't/ matter. Christ was essentially a reformer, not to mention the son of God, and he fixed everything that was wrong with the Old Testament. The Old Testament is still important, since it documents a lot of good lessons, but /the rules it set out no longer apply/.

  In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.

So if you say, "Old Testament says not to eat shrimp, whycome you guys eat shrimp?" and they say, "Old Testament bro, doesn't matter" ... that's them being entirely within the doctrines of their faith.

(Some Christian faiths care about the Old Testament more than others though; it's hard to generalize.)

Broadly speaking, I just don't argue with people about religion anymore. I don't think I've had a single productive conversation on the subject with any of my religious friends.
