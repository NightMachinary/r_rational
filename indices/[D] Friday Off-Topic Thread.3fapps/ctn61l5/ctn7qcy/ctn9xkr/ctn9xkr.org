Actually, I don't know if they're being inconsistent with the message of love/forgiveness in that respect- for example, if you believe that at the moment of conception, a soul was born and is precious (and then applied typical Western beliefs), then it's a greater fulfillment of those ideals to save the life. Essentially if you start from that premise, and see it the same as if you straight up murdered another adult, then doesn't matter if you have a different opinion, that can't be allowed and it's their duty to stand up to it.

Not saying all people think like this, but I know that at least my friends understand the "pro-choice" viewpoint, they just think it's irrelevant. Combine this with adoption/contraception as options and it's not too much of a stretch to think that people who want abortions are horribly wrong/short-sighted.
