No, only the posts marked with "Arcanine /(You)/" are definitely written by the same person (me). "Arcanine" with no "/(You)/" appended is the /nom de plume/ given by default to every anonymous poster on the board (which is named "r9k"). That's how anonymous imageboards like 2chan, 4chan, âˆžchan, etc. work.
