Did something change in Hinata after the timeskip? because i don't remember anything significant other than the looks.. And i fail to see how cuteness ans hotness are mutually exclusive, unless one of them is describing something else from what i am thinking..

cuteness is mostly a personality property, while hotness is mostly a property of looks. technically hotness\attractiveness could be effected by personality but they don't imply anything specific. so the only way i could see the two properties as mutually exclusive is if its based on your personal taste, by which cuteness is a turnoff.
