Do you have some sort of social dysfunction, like Asperger's? From the thread, you come off as pretty autistic. I don't mean to be rude, but, well, you certainly seem to fit /r9k/ to a tee.

50801 in particular makes you seem literally sociopathic, as you admit you don't like your friends except for one example of probably-sexual attraction.

You seem to base sociopathy off of the success of manipulating people, but that implies that there aren't any sociopaths who don't actually have social skills, like what you seem to be.
