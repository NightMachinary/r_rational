  Well, she became more independent and strong-willed, didn't she? (Bear in mind that I've read a lot of fanfiction, so my remembrances of her canon self may be colored.)

I don't think she really became any more strong willed, just more of an adult. And that too only actually made it so when she thought it was basically the end of the world she managed to confess to naruto. other than that i don't think her personality really changed that much.

well, i could see how you would claim the ideal form of cuteness and the ideal form of hotness cannot be held in parallel, but that is not quite what i would call mutually exclusive :P

And that still seems to based on personal taste and what you consider to be cute\hot, as i don't think the properties you mentioned are the only accepted form by which something could be cute..

anyhow now that you clarified that you didn't -really- mean that the properties are mutually exclusive i think the situation is clearer to me..

thanks for the reply :)
