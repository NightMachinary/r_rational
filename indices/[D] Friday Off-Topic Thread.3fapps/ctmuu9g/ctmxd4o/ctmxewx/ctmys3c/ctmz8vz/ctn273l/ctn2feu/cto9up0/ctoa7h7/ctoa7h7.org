  Did something change in Hinata after the timeskip? because i don't remember anything significant other than the looks..
#+end_quote

Well, she became more independent and strong-willed, didn't she? (Bear in mind that I've read a lot of fanfiction, so my remembrances of her canon self may be colored.)

  i fail to see how cuteness ans hotness are mutually exclusive
#+end_quote

They aren't /completely/ mutually exclusive--post-timeskip Hinata is, say, 4/5 on cuteness and 3/5 on hotness. However, pre-timeskip Hinata is solidly 5/5 on cuteness and (being rather young) 1/5 on hotness, which is why she's the archetype of cuteness only in her younger form. The point is that post-timeskip Hinata's hotness and cuteness /detract/ from each other: I'd be reluctant to impose myself on an innocent-looking person, and I'd likewise be reluctant to consider an attractive, strong-willed person to be needing protection.

#+begin_quote
  cuteness is mostly a personality property, while hotness is mostly a property of looks.
#+end_quote

I'm considering /both/ the mind /and/ the body to be components, here. Pre-timeskip Hinata is cute (innocent, requiring protection, etc.) /both/ because she's young and round-faced /and/ because she's timid.
