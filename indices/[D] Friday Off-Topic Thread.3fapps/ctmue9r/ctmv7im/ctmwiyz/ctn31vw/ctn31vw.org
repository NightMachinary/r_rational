I think the reason you don't like Eclipse as much is that you place a high priority on strategy / game theory and winning the game: your RftG story is about disproving your friends' assertions on dominant strategy; your concern about Eclipse is that you don't do as well as you think you should, especially in relation to your friend; you wish Dominion base set had a wider range of strategies.

Part of the draw of Eclipse is that it is manageable space opera. It's not a monster like Twilight Imperium that will take the whole day and exhaust everyone by the end. In Eclipse, you get the narrative space aliens expanding, meeting, and inevitably coming to blows. There are laughs and groans as someone takes the technology that someone else really needed. There's the multiplayer diplomacy of convincing people that someone else is in the lead. Someone tears their hair out because their missiles all whiffed and now they're staring down a lot of plasma cannons. Or someone buys wormhole generators and now my border has gone from chokepoint to exposed flank.

I don't care if I win Eclipse. In fact, I don't care if I win any game against my friends as long as my friends and I are having fun. I think that's the reason I like Eclipse more than you.
