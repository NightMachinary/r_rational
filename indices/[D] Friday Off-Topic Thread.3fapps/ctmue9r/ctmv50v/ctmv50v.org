I've done a fair amount of playing around with /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/][GURPS]]/, which I find to be a whole lot cooler than /Dungeons & Dragons/, due to its incredible detail. /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Vehicles/][GURPS Vehicles]]/ even lets you stat up your own vehicles, from a Smart ForTwo to General Grievous's wheel-bike to the Space Shuttle (including booster rockets)!
