For me, choosing a favorite boardgame is like choosing a favorite book or food or movie or song. Sure, I like it, but life would get pretty dull if we focus on just one thing. I like different games for different reasons. Some games make me feel smart (even if I'm not doing anything particularly clever). Some games are just instant fun with your friends. Some games tell a cool story. The right game for right now depends on who you're playing with and what people want out of it.

So I wish people were more specific than "what's your favorite game?" They could be asking, "What game might I not have heard of that I should check out?" They could be administering a sort of gaming rorschach test and how that person responds says a lot about what that person thinks about gaming. I don't know! Maybe I should just point them to my BGG ratings and comments and let them data mine that.
