Favorites are hard, but I teems to play a lot of Resistance Avalon, Dominion, Suburbia, and Pandemic.

Lately, I've been spending a lot of time just playtesting a game that I'm designing with some friends. We're calling it Galaxia until we come up with a better name and are finally to the point of playtesting for balance rather than making major game play changes.

If there's any interest, we should have a print and play version available in the next week or so, and I'll almost certainly be posting the rules and the like on here among other things to see how easy it will be for someone to break them, with this sub's affinity for munchkinry.
