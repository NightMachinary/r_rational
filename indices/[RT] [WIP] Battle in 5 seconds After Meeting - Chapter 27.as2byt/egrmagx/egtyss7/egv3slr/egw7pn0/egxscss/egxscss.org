Oh, I absolutely agree to the second point. This setting is in no way the sort of place I'd expect to find unbound conceptual powers. But, as to the first point, that he's /kept/ the powers that he already revealed say something about her mental state - namely, she hasn't updated in the direction of "oh, so his powers are fake."

Because if she had, he'd have lost his abilities.

Since she's willing to as-if the realness of his powers, it's surprising that neither of them think about high-potential nonlethal extensions.

"People who see me who aren't you will be knocked out if I say [arbitrary codephrase to limit the power's scope and action] followed by a duration of effect activation. Do you believe that my power can do that?"

"People who aren't you will feel that I am extremely charismatic and persuasive if you see me crossing my fingers behind my back, with the effect lasting until I you believe my power is a different power. Can you believe it?"

Even if it didn't yield immediate results, it should have been addressed pretty-much at once. Especially considering that this preteen is, as a plot detail the seventh best debater in the world, and extremely prone to analytical thinking.
