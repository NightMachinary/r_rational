I read this up until the in-progress point, and found the experiments with the power and logical thinking about its implications to be the only worthwhile part of it. So much of the rest is just standard shonen garbage, including the nonsense premise, rapid shifts in plot and scenario, and the completely unrealistic side characters who act nothing like real people and deliver terrible dialogue with a straight face (which I don't think can be blamed entirely on translation, but I don't know).

This isn't a counter-recommendation, but know what you're in for.
