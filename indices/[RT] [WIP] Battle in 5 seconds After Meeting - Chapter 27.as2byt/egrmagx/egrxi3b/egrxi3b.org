Back to the OP, I agree that outside of the experiments he performed to understand his power, the story is not really very rational, especially with the way the characters are written. I might just have a soft spot for standard shonen tropes so that plus a side helping of some rational thinking, even in very small doses, is pretty good for me. You're right that people should know what they're in for. Next time I recommend something I'll try and be more transparent with that kind of info, as I know that I myself appreciate recommendations more when they tell me what I'm in for.
