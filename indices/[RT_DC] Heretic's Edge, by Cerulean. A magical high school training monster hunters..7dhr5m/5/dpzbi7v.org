So...the best strategy for hunters is for the experienced ones who have hit diminishing returns to capture what monsters they can and have the students execute them for magical xp? It seems that if the monsters are common enough to build a story off of and devote a school to fighting then there should be a system in place to get all hunters to a certain minimum power level, if not skill. Haven't read the story, just the first thing that popped into my head.
