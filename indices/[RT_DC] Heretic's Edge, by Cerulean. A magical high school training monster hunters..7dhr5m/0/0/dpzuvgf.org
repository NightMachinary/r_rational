As a huge fan of Heretical Edge, I do have to agree with you that this is one of the major weaknesses. I don't think it holds up nearly as well to binge-reading the whole thing. The constant excitement does work great reading it episodically, but yeah.

There's also how Cerulean didn't want to do the Harry Potter thing of introducing a new villain every year and then neatly wrapping it up in the end. An admirable goal, but it led to just being dogpiled with threats, enemies, plots, and mysteries for a while. I feel like Heretical Edge is so in-depth that it really rewards serious fans but is harder for casual fans to get into.
