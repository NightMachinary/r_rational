I tried to read both this, and Certuleans worm fanfic Intrepid and eventually just stopped reading both.

Not cause they're bad, they're just exhausting. The story never ever stops and takes a breath. Arc is about to finish, but right before the end Boom, dramatic reveal, i'm your father, Boom, dramatic reveal, secret ancient enemy. Go Go Go next arc. Lets start 3 more plots that won't be resolved for the next 5. Boom dramatic reveal, "She LIVES!" Boom, dramatic reveal New enemy out of nowhere. Boom dramatic reveal, I'm also family somehow.

Maybe its better if you read it a few chapters at a time instead of binging it. Intrepid is even worse cause it has switching PoV, each with their own plots, so there's even less downtime.

Liked the start of it though. Read up til volume 18 or so.
