Thanks for following up. I guess I don't need perfect verisimilitude or slavish research in my stories, but my instinct is that an author that uses a head-scratcher like this right off the bat (the unrealistic drug bust) might not yet understand human nature or how the world operates well enough to tell a story that I don't find annoying. With that said, the technical writing is on the better side for web fiction and the premise sounds interesting, so thank you for suggesting the story and hope you continue to enjoy it. I've definitely read some pretty out there things myself (wuxia comes to mind), we all have different priorities when selecting what to read. :)
