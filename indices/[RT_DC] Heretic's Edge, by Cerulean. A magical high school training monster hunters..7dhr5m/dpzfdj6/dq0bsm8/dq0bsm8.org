While I can't comment on the rest as I havent read enough, I have to agree that the drug 'bust' was laughable. That's a police officer using a civilian (and a Minor!) to elicit testimony or evidence gathering they were not entitled to without a warrant.

That whole search is getting thrown out by any competent lawyer. The police can't end run around the 4th amendment by getting a civilian to do their dirty work for them.
