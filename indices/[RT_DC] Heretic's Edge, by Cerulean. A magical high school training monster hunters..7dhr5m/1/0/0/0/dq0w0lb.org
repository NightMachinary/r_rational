I follow Heretical Edge and have been caught up for a year now. It's written well and the plot itself is interesting which is why I still follow it.

My issue is similar to the one you mentioned, but perhaps a little different: everyone is sensitive, fragile, and almost caricature-like in their exaggerated emotional responses. Oh and everyone needs a tragic backstory, which I guess can be chalked up to the grimdark nature of the world, though I feel it's taken too far, with people being evil for the sake of making the world dark most of the time.

Why do I say this is relevant to the moralizing? Because a lot of these emotional responses happen because of some moral issue arising. For example, in recent chapters, one character had to take control of the body of another character, and they just keep apologizing and feel like they've done something wrong because I suppose mind-control stigma and a personal violation of their body. Which isn't wrong, per se, but the incessantness, and reiteration just goes too far. To be fair, there's a little more to the situation that would be spoilery, but it doesn't fully counter my point.

There's also how nakama/friendship power comes into play where they make each other feel better because everyone is traumatized in one way or another. For some characters, it's like [[/u/Oaden]] said, they're traumatized once every week. At some point, you become desensitized and just hate them all for being snivelling, whiny, and fragile, even though that may be a little harsh to them. The presentation still makes you feel annoyed anyway. Worm did it better: depressing but not constant +black clouds+ thunderstorms and lightning drowning and burning everyone. There are upbeat moments where they go on dates or have talks but they're usually subverted and it's a little too sickly-cutesy to the point where you're rolling your eyes.

Despite all this, I continue to read because the plot and content is good and interesting, even though I do get pissed off almost every chapter.
