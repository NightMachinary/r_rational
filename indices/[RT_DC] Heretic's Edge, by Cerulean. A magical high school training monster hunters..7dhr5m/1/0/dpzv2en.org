Moral complexity is actually one of this story's greatest strengths, even if it's not apparent for a few arcs. Some of the best storylines come from characters realizing that simplified moral views are misleading and miss a lot of stuff.

I have no knowledge of how drug busts work, so no comment on that.

The exposition does take some getting used to. Personally the style bugged me a little at the beginning but doesn't anymore, so I guess I just got used to it. I don't think it changed all that much.

It seems you have an issue with the backstory being too simple or normal or something, which...well, I guess it's reasonable at this point in the story, but it's utterly hilarious with more context. The author just didn't want to get into all the backstory immediately, and a lot of the future story actually goes to examining Flick's life so far and all the influences on it.

I'm not necessarily trying to convince you to read more, since I don't know how much emphasis you place on each issue, but I thought I'd give you a bit more context so you could make a more informed decision.
