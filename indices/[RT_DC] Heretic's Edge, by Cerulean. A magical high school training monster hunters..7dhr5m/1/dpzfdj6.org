Started this story just now but don't think I'll continue. A moralizing protagonist right out of the gate (how dare you sell drugs to kids!) that ignores most of the complexity of how dealing drugs actually works, not to mention how busts go down. (If this was real life, the real bad guy in the situation would be the negligent police officer.) The exposition is really heavy-handed here, it does my least favorite thing at the beginning of stories, which is to immediately and awkwardly tell the protagonist's hair color in the first few sentences as if it's the most important thing that absolutely cannot wait. At least she doesn't look in a mirror and describe herself. I'm also underwhelmed by the backstory--your mom left so you don't want to have friends. Just feels very transparently written by an 18-20 year old.
