Minor nitpick, but isn't the title "Heretical Edge," not "Heretic's Edge"?

I second your recommendation for HE; I read the web novel (up until I was caught up with the new entries) early this year and recall that I really enjoyed it. I've read /so much/ in the months since then that the specifics as to what I liked are murky in my head, but back in February I wrote:

  Heretical Edge: Still in the middle of reading this (well, 16/20 arcs into it), but I've liked it so far. A teenage girl ends up going to a secret academy where Heretics (humans who can see monsters and absorb their abilities) are trained to protect the rest of humanity. The writing is pretty good, and the author frequently throws twists and turns. Fair warning - the scene can go from jocular to extremely violent and gory very quickly. The author does a great job writing some of the horror scenes. There's not a strong focus on the system of magic or abilities unfortunately, but if you like action, drama, horror, and budding bisexual teenage romance, it's worth checking out.

Thanks for the reminder about this; when I finish reading some of the other stuff I've got on my plate, I think I'll pick this up again and see what's been updated in the past year!
