In regards to character depth, I'm starting to see that with Avalon. My previous issue has now been subsumed by what feels like a need to set her character up as this over exaggerated charicature so that your preconceptions can be subverted ‘to the nth degree'. I feel like the author wants me going ‘oh wow, I completely misjudged this character' when I just feel like the character was made to appear completely outside the bounds of what is realistic just so that said subversion of expectations could be as impactful as possible. I feel similarly about their group mentor who's cool-guy nonchalance had me rolling my eyes. Koren and Scout feel like that, but to lesser degrees.

I fully buy that the author is going to add more complexities to the side cast, I just don't buy some of the initial depictions as realistic of an actual person I guess.
