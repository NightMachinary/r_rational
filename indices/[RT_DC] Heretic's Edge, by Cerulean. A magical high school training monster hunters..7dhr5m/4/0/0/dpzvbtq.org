Yeah, she was a bit overly judgmental with her ancestor, wasn't she? I think Flick holds herself to a higher standard than a lot of people, and this may have led to judging her ancestor too harshly. I think some of it was also disappointment that the noble dude wasn't her ancestor.

The "cringe inducing" pet rock and similar humor is very much a part of Flick's character and interactions with others. If you can't stand that sort of dorkiness, then yeah, maybe you just wouldn't get along with Flick all that well. Nothing wrong with that.

I was going to say that I was confident that no student was actually a complete caricature, but then I remembered one who might count (Isaac). Still, you won't get to know him for like 25 arcs and he's a minor character. And I guess you could call Zeke a caricature, but I'd be willing to bet that's just because we haven't really gotten to know him yet. Every other person who seems shallow and one-dimensional absolutely isn't, and in fact character depth in nearly every character is one of the strongest points of this story. It just hasn't been visible so far because of the necessity of also starting the plot and expositing about the world. For instance, Avalon's a lot more than a shallow bitch, Koren has hidden depths beyond her thoughtlessness (and is one of my favorite characters), Scout is an amazingly deep character whose reluctance to speak is deeply relevant to lots of things, and even Wyatt is far, far more than just a ridiculous, over-the-top silly security guard.
