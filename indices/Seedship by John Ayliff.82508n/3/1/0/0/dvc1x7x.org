A perfect planet, before modifications to scientific or cultural databases will (usually) grant you a score of 14500.

Add in Monumental and High-tech ruins, and you can easily expect to average over 15k for that.

The theoretical maximum appears to be 18,850, which is achievable with a perfect world, getting each of the beneficial random one-time rare events that can increase your science/culture and getting the maximum increase from each of them (Reading Databases, Transmitting to Alien Probe, Exploring the Alien Derelict, and Analyzing the Alien Signal, +90 Culture, +25 Science), taking no system damage, getting the maximum benefit from both Monumental and High-tech Ruins (+30 Culture, +30 Science), and integrating well with a native High-tech society (+30 Culture)

That gives you a theoretical maximum of 250 Culture and 185 Science.

The odds of achieving this score, without modifying the random number generators (like I did in looking at this) is incredibly unlikely.
