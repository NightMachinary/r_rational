On my second attempt I got what I assume was a perfect score of 10,000.

First planet was a bust, and had to lose a surface probe in the event after it. Second planet had a toxic atmosphere and was very hot, but also had airtight and insulated caves that perfectly countered those negatives.

Everything else about the planet was basically Earth-normal. Easy route to a new post-scarcity utopia, I guess.
