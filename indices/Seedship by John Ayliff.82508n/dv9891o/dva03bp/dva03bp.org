I've gotten in the 12,000's by getting cosmic enlightenment and information age. However I think the best actual result I've gotten is post singularity, post scarcity civ though that got a score of 11,572 so I mean "best" in the sense of being on a pretty habitable planet and clearly being the best place to actually live.

Though the whole tech thing does seem a bit weird since you'd think that there should be nothing stopping people from advancing tech on their own unless you have a really regressive government or a lack of resources.

P.S. Looking at the high scores on reddit it seems like a score of at least 15k should be possible and there are screenshots for people getting in the high 14k's
