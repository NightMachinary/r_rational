10k isn't /quite/ perfect. It's possible to run into unexpected good luck (usually involving alien contact), which improves your databases beyond the starting point and leads to a civilization that grows beyond the normal maximums. It's not /likely/, though; you can normally expect that your values will go down, not up.

So yeah, 10k is about the best you can hope for.
