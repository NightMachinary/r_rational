What a terrific project. Thanks for sharing this. I seriously want to just stay in space until making contact with a spaceage civilization, but there is no guarantee that that is a possible result. That option was less tempting after getting my seedship attacked by thieves. I'm pretty happy with my second result: the colony on the ice world of Heart reaches the Information Age with 97% of their cultural records.
