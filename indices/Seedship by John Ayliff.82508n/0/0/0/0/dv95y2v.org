Sounds like you did OK - if the hit had taken out 10-20% of your landing or construction gear, you end up taking heavy hits to your colonist populations which result in the scientific/cultural databases being reduced. You can definitely take one or two landing hits, but more than that and you're in trouble.

I generally get rid of the surface probes and the scanners first, focusing all the damage to a single scanner, and keeping two scanners as pristine as possible to upgrade.
