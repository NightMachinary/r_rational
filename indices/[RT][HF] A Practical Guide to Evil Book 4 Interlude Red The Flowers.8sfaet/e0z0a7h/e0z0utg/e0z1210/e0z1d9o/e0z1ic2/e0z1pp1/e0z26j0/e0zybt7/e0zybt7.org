Great point. I've seen this speculation that bard and Assassin are counterparts, but it seems unlikely because Black gives Assassin orders and was comparing Bard to Triumphant. I think Assassin's "immortality" might be more of a planned thing like using a MOL simulcrum (which has all the same abilities but is constrained by a common power pool)
