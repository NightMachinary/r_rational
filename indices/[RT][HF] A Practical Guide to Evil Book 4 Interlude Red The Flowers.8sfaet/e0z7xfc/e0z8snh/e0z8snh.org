Matured adventurer-style hero bearing an ancient and weighty Name with not just a history of beast slaying, but specifically Praesi beast slaying? I am wondering what sort of shenanigans *stopped* Fate from making that happen.

Maybe it would be a suicide run and the "Anti-Malicia Party" story gave a veto.
