Sure, what I was trying to convey was that Anaxares' judgment was extremely powerful because his rejection of the great game was effectively an earthly tribunal rejecting the meddling of the Gods Above and Below, and as such it should have a massive impact on one of their tools, the Bard. If she and the Assassin are diametrically opposed, it serves to reason that he should be equally impacted by such a ruling, though by different means.
