RIP Black?

It seems pretty final. The jig is up. A win, a draw, and now a loss.

Well, I do hope Black and Warlock find their way out alive, if for nothing else but the fact that the series was going to be about them at first. Who knows? Maybe when Hanno was [[http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/276/749/286.jpg][studying the blade]], Black dug up some new stories to use. One can hope.

I do like how the ability to draw on past heroes' memories provides a counter to Black. They had to grind through an abattoir's worth of heroes to map out all of Black's tricks. All the more reason to accuse the Heavens of cheating, I guess.

So now it's Black and Warlock (maybe Assassin?) against White, Witch, and Champion (wearing Captain's dead body? Did I catch that right?). On its face, it does seem like the villains are going to get pasted all over the mountains. I hope not. That would be pretty disappointing.

Oh, and finally a dragon!
