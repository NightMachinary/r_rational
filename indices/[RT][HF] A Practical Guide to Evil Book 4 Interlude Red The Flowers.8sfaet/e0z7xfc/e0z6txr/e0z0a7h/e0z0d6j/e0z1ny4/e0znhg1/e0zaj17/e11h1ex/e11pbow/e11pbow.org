Have to keep an eye on the northern host, or they'll attack and overrun the Army of Callow.

Now me, I'd do a fighting retreat through a portal to Arcadia and break contact, then send the army back to garrison and recover, while heading south to play Fun With Heroes Not Covered By The Pilgrim Or The Saint.

But there's a reason Cat isn't doing that. Wish I knew what it was.
