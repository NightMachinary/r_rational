I believe Black explicitly mentioned in one of his interludes in the third book that no pattern of three formed between himself and the White Knight. It was this that led him to believe that he had only a year or two left to live.

In terms of extra-textual reasons, I don't believe Black's death, far away from Cat with little to no interaction between the two in the proceeding year, would be a satisfying resolution to their personal story.
