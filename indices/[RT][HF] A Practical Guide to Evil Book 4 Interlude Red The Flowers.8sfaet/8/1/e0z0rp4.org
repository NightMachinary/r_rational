Yeap. One of Hanno's ability is to go through the experiences (memories) of dead Heroes and relive through them.

His second aspect, Recall, allows him to remember the skills and fighting styles of dead Heroes and switch between different Heroes. From his 2nd battle with Black in Book 3, it seem that he can only focus on one at a time and every time he shifts, the cooldown time and shifting time increases.

That, however, was 'shifting' in the middle of battle. From this chapter, he went through the experiences of the Heroes before the battle to simulate Black and choose the most effective anti-Black techniques beforehand.

Given that: i) Hanno and Black currently have a Pattern of 3-ish pattern (Round 1: Hanno Lost, Black Won & Retreated, Round 2: Hanno Lost but Black Lost so Draw?) and ii) Hanno's 3rd Aspect has not been revealed, it's also likely Hanno's 3rd Aspect is going to be anti-Black.

I'm picking up Black deathflags throughout the entire chapter.
