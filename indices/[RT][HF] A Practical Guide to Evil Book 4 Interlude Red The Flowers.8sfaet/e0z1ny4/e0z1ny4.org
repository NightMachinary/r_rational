I'm interested to see how Catherine branding Black's name will come into play in the upcoming engagement. I'm guessing Black will straight up avoid 1v1ing Hanno since that's just fitting into the pattern of three. Maybe he will fight Champion? He has a revenge story there with Captain, and if Champion wears her fur cloak to battle all the more narrative weight will be given to Black.
