Rational!Zelda? With a crossover twist?

Interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing this quest in action after reading the prologue: I'm ready to smash some game mechanics like pots in the OoT guard house.

Feedback:

- The maps could really use some scales
- Will resources (such as the players' current inventory, health, stamina (if applicable), magic meter (if that's also a thing), etc. be mirrored on [[https://chaossnek.com][chaossnek.com]] ?
- If users have technical issues with said site should they report feedback to you here on reddit via PM, start a conversation on SV, or will there be more functionalities on the website itself later on to address such issues?

Also I'm guessing that the crossover is with Dune. Not because it make sense but because it would be amazing if you could pull it off.
