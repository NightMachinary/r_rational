  I begin to wonder why there are no manipulators

A couple of other commenters asked similar questions, to which I replied:

  Of course some would. The only problem is that chips get a lot more benefit from economies of scale than motors and structural frameworks; while computers continue to become ever-cheaper, robots don't improve nearly so quickly. Emulated minds who pay for luxury robot bodies will, by necessity, need to be paid more than a similar em who doesn't pay for that luxury, and given how many such ems are likely to be found in the marketplace, will likely be rapidly out-competed by the ems who toss such values under the bus. (There's a now-famous blog-post on such issues, "Meditations on Moloch", at [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]] .) There are ways to avoid this form of race-to-the-bottom, such as em labour unions and government regulations, but they require significant effort to keep working.

  That said, never underestimate the power of a motivated fandom: even if it's not perfectly economical, I'm sure that by this point of the timeline, the Wall-E 'verse will have expanded (either canonically or fan-head-canon-ly) to include, say, blue retints of Wall-E used for mail delivery (perhaps "Deliver Anywhere Nearby, Earth-class": Dan-E's), and there'll be enough Adam Savage style prop-reconstructing tricks to produce lifesize working models. (... And now I'm starting to wonder about my fascination with rectangular-shaped future people. :) )
