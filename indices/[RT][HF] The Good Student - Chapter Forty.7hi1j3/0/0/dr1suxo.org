Well, yes and no. I'd like to take full credit, but sadly I can't. Your interpretation is all bang on and you're right about how I wanted the relationship between them to come across. The only thing not quite right is the switch in format. The reason the demon stopped talking in italics was because I forgot.

I also forgot that Dizzy had been in the secret room in the library back in Ch18 (as someone had to point out to me). Will need to amend that also. This is what happens when you write three different online serials at the same time. A good reason to take a break, I feel.

The switch in format was a nice idea, although I probably wouldn't have used it (even if I had thought of it) simply for the reason that readers might not be sure if it was an accident or not (as I amply proved). In a published book that's been checked over properly it would work much better.
