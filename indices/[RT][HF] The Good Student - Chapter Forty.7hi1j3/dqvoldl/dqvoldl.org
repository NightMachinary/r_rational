I love reading too far into things, so I may be wrong, but when the demon says:

#+begin_quote
  “Your Green Demon is no demon at all,”
#+end_quote

it's the first time anything that the demon says is in quotation marks, whereas Nic has been speaking in quotes all along.

Nic's response to that is:

#+begin_quote
  “He is as much a demon as you,”
#+end_quote

The purpose of this line should be to hint at what Nic reveals shortly. The Green Demon had adapted to human society and become more human. I think it takes things one step further, though. I think the stylistic change shows that it is not only the Green Demon who is becoming more human. The punctuation is showing us that the demon in Nic's mind is losing its divinity.

The story of the Green Demon is probably a direct allegory to what is occurring between the demon and the seeker of knowledge (Nic) in the real world. I think that this line from the beginning of the Green Demon story, referring to the seeker of knowledge is at the core of it all.

#+begin_quote
  “The man insisted he would be patient. He sensed a rare opportunity to improve himself, and he was willing to be restrained, even though it was not in his nature.”
#+end_quote

Though not instigated by Nic, this is the same gamble that he is making with the demon in his mind.

Immediately after Nic reveals that the Green Demon had changed to become more human, Nic and the demon fall into this sort of pattern where the demon makes an assertions and Nic replies, "Yes."

This continues until Nic instead replies:

#+begin_quote
  “Yes. You are right, except that the Green Demon failed.”
#+end_quote

This is the point where the power shifts completely. From this point on, the roles are reversed. The demon fighting Nic has also failed.

Nic asks the demon a series of questions, to which the demon replies with a simple, "Yes."

Completely ignoring the fact that Nic is literally consuming the demon at this point, the parallelism here hints at the reversal of power. This whole exchange is such a beautiful way of showing exactly what it is telling. Little by little, the demon is becoming more like a human, and Nic is also becoming more like a demon. I think that the line where Nic says that the demon in the story failed is the point where that shaky balance crosses the line.

I don't personally think that Nic will go full demon and lose his quotation marks or anything, but I do believe that he will be stuck in a sort of uncertain state for a while, kind of like the demon who is already human enough to speak in quotation marks.

On the other hand, the whole punctuation thing could be a formatting error. Haha. However, I think that it works nicely with this part of the story, and I'd find it a little surprising if Moody went to the effort to give the demon a specific format to his dialogue and then just abandoned it completely. Regardless, I think that it reads beautifully.
