Demons don't lie right? Or am I misremembering that?

First the demon says it can't show Nic out:

#+begin_quote
  “Show me how to leave this place,” said Nic. “I cannot. I will not. You must find your own way.”
#+end_quote

But then:

#+begin_quote
  “You wish me to tell you?” said Nic, simply, plainly. “Yes,” said the demon. “If I do, will you be grateful?” “Yes.” “Will you show me the way to leave this place?” “Yes.”
#+end_quote

So assuming the demon didn't lie, did Nic's story about a demon changing somehow change what this demon is capable of?
