I don't get what Shen's plan is here, is he trying to get into a position to undermine his brother in ways that don't involve a direct confrontation or is he trying to get into a good position with the instruments under the assumption that Piccolo is going to come back regardless of what happens? That doesn't seem like it's going to work out for him.

From a meta perspective I'm glad we're bringing together at least some of the main characters again. All the hopping around makes it hard to remember what was going on where without having to click back to the previous few chapters (though the delay between chapters also kind of isn't helping here, it'll probably be a lot easier to follow on a reread).

Awesome chapter as always! Really looking forward to seeing how the fight between Goku and Tao Pai Pai ends up going.
