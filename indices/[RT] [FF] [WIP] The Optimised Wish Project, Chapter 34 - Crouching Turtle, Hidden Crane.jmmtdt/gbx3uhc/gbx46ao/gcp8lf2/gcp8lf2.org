I am also very happy what is going on with Gero and Bulma.

If I understood correctly, she is taking him with her back to Capsule Corp. This is a great idea both in-universe and storywise. So there will be much more of their interactions, and maybe also interactions with Bulma family.

I just had one idea, which would be great if it happened, but I'm not sure if it's going that way. You have already prepared a good science background for our protagonist, maybe they should use it somehow in more important way for the story? Maybe... maybe Goku could take Frieza fate from canon, get slain and come back as "Mecha frieza" but Goku version, revived by Bulma and Gero?
