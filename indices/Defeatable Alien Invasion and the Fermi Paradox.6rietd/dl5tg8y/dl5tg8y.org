These are both great set ups for new takes on classic stories. The first one can easily rationalize the standard alien invasion seen in War of the Worlds, Independence Day, and Falling Skies while opening the path for exploration of themes about human society.

The second one sounds like Firefly meets Star Trek with all the pieces necessary for episodic adventures consisting of frontier trading, exploring the unknown, and fighting oppressive governments. Throw in some weird superpowers and you'd have a sci-fi One Piece, which I have no objection to.
