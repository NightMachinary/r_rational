  What about companies that make a lot of things for the civilian sector but also have a division that sells stuff to the army?

I think it depends to some degree on /what/ the company is selling to the army. Guns are one thing, bandages are a completely different thing.

I don't think it really matters how much the company sells, or who else they sell to - that is, I think it is ethical to work for a company that sells bandages, /even if/ they sell those bandages exclusively to the army.
