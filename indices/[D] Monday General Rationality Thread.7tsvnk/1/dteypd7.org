I think it's rational and ethical to not want to contribute to the war effort in a country that one lives in, because contributing means that one has a chance to contribute to unjust murder and I think it's rational and ethical to want to minimize this chance. This should also be balanced with one's self-interest, though, since gaining capital would let one donate money and otherwise influence the world in a positive way, thereby possibly saving lives and offsetting the chance of murder that they contribute to.

My dilemma lies with trying to figure out how much contribution is OK. Paying taxes is pretty vital to doing anything else and is otherwise a fairly minimal and general war effort contribution so I think that's OK even if it contributes to war. I think involving oneself with/working for a company that makes weapons puts one's efforts too close to the war effort to be ethical; working for a company that doesn't have any divisions that sell to the army is probably the most ethical way one can contribute to their self-interest while also minimizing war involvement.

What about companies that make a lot of things for the civilian sector but also have a division that sells stuff to the army? Is it unethical to work for them, is it rational to want to avoid those companies, even work that's outside of those divisions in those companies, if one wants to minimize the number of deaths they are involved in? Are those companies far enough away from the war effort that working for them makes a similar minimal impact as paying taxes does?

Or is my entire framework here irrational and one should just ignore the possible unjust death count one would be contributing to if they help design stuff for a company and just work anywhere?
