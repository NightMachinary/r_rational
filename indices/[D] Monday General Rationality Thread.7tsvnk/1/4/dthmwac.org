/I think you underrate the importance of taxes:/

My own personal sense of the situation is that the important thing isn't the absolute contribution of an act, but the marginal contribution of one course of action relative to another.

This is of course not the case - we must also watch out for the contribution of one's actions and precommitments on the existence/selection/stability of Nash equillibria - but for social movements that are not even remotely popular yet, ignoring these second-order features and using pure marginal analysis can probably be justified in the same way as the small angle approximation in physics.

...So, using this marginal view, we can do a economic supply/demand calculation and find the market-clearing amount of evil. The result, in the long run, for most people, I suspect, is that the supply/demand curves are such that the supplied number of bombs falls far more when they stop contributing taxes than when they decide not to work somewhere and the next highest bidder takes the job instead.

This may not be the case if the person in question is underpaid - that is, substantially more competent than the average person in their pay range.
