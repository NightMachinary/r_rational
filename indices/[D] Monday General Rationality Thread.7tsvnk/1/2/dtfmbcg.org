I'm not sure what your trying to discuss. It sounds like a question about ethics and morality. Allow me to rephrase your arguments, and then let me know if I have it right, okay?

1. Unjustly killing a person is morally wrong.

2. Innocent bystanders die in war, which killings are morally wrong.

3. War, therefore, is morally wrong.

4. Actions that support a war effort are morally wrong.

5a. War-profiteering is morally wrong.

5b. War is financed by taxes, which are paid by citizens. Therefore, paying taxes in wartime is morally wrong.

First, can we agree to remove rationality from this discussion? There's nothing inherently irrational about supporting an unjust war. Rationality doesn't take sides in moral debates. Which is why the sidebar says (of rational fiction) that "factions are ... driven into conflict by their beliefs and values."

Second, is it ethical to participate in an unjust and immoral society? Is it preferable to try to change that society from within, or to leave and join a different, more just, society? If the latter, what if you decide that on the balance your society is moral and just, but that a different society is more moral and just, is it preferable to leave and join the other society?
