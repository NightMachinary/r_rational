I've been enjoying 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' however it mentions an experiment in which people became happier when holding a pen in their mouth. Does anyone know if this experiment were reproduced successfully? I remember hearing that power-poses(i.e. standing in a powerful position to gain confidence) were debunked.
