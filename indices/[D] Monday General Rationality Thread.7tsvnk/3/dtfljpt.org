I have a question regarding rationality. What actions would you recommend for someone who is attempting to become a rationalist. Points I wish to clarify:

I do not mean suggestions like read the less wrong sequences. In this case the reason for that is thus. If you wished to learn mathematics, you could read a maths textbook. However if you actually wanted to get anywhere you have to practice. So this is what I am requesting. Suggestions that can be given for the practice of the important skills of rationality. In fact in your opinion what are the most important skills of rationality.

The ideas that I have had so far are

Tracking down intelligent sounding people with both sides of a viewpoint seems like a reasonable idea. You can then try asking them why they believe what they believe. Do this with both sides of a debate, including your own side. Fact check everything, check for logical flaws, and make sure you don't accidently or subconsciously strawman someone by requesting clarification if a position seems utterly stupid beyond what you have seen elsewhere and checking multiple sites for information. If a site fails this check stop using it.

Second, pick a argument on which you have a side. This shouldn't be a strong opinion or one tied up in your sense of self. Try writing down your most persuasive case for the position. All facts must be backed up and all arguments must be free from logical fallacy. If it helps you pretend that you are going to be using this to try to persuade people and every time you feel tempted to relax your standards think to yourself "The truth will stand up to scrutiny. If this is true it will stand up to the fires of judgement without aid" Also write down any arguments you think of that will argue for the other side.

Thirdly start a journal. In this journal, write down each of your actions for a few days. Once they are written down, write down your reason for doing them. Look over this a consider. Consider long term goals, reasons for achieving them and whether you are taking action towards them. (As an aside what motivated you to become a rationalist and does it affect what skills you are good at?)

After that I'm not sure. For instance how does one use bayes probability theory in the real world? Where does one get priors from and where does one get adjustment factors? How does one tell you are right? Are there any other skills of a rationalist that I am leaving out, or do my plans have some flaw or improvement that I need to check.

I am writing this comment for a couple of reasons. Firstly I wish to be more rational. I do not like the idea of biases and emotions controlling my every action. Secondly I am planning, once I improve my writing skills, to write a story with a rationalist protagonist and I wish to better understand the character. This character will be rational because the world involves a large amount of mind control and moral dilemmas and the more the character thinks things through the better for the story. Them mustering good arguments for both sides and being forced to choose is sort of the point of the story. Thirdly, I think this seems interesting. Fourthly, one of the things I always wished for myself was for me to be less ignorant and understand more of reality. This is why I am going to study maths at university. Fifthly, if I do get some friends who are interested I can give them suggestions.

Tldr What are the most important skills of a rationalist and how do you practice them to begin with
