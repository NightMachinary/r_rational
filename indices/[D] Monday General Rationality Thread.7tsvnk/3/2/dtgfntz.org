  After that I'm not sure. For instance how does one use bayes probability theory in the real world? Where does one get priors from and where does one get adjustment factors?

Guesswork.

No, seriously. That or looking up statistics, but in the moment it's often guesswork and gut feel.

What explicitly using Bayes does is that it makes your guesses more /consistent/. That, and it allows you to improve your intuitions about probabilities with respect to each other. So you can make guesses about things that you are pretty confident about, and transform them into information about things that you are less confident about; or you can deliberately bias your all guesses to one or another side, in order to be fairly certain about which side your final result is biased towards.
