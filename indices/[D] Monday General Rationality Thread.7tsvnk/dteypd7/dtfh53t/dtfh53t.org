It's tougher because you don't necessarily know if the war is unjust. We can say today with great certainty participating in WW2 for the allies was just. But at the time, average citizens didn't know about concentration camps, it just appeared to be another general European war, so would in 1941 an American wanting to join the war be immoral if it made the war last longer?

Similar situation with the Iraq war. Now we know there wasn't much evidence of weapons of mass destruction. But if there was say a 1% chance of Iraq having WMDs America could stop by sending in soldiers, which an average citizen like you may think is true, then it may very well be a just war.

Even if you still think it ended up of the negative end of the moral scale, is it far enough on the negative end after weighing the positives to significantly change your life?
