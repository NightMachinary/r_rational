  Similar situation with the Iraq war. Now we know there wasn't much evidence of weapons of mass destruction.

This was known during most of the actual war itself. Mind you, I'm not sure if it was known /by/ the average American...

Nonetheless, if your country is in a war, then you can assume that the media you are exposed to is largely propaganda, unless you make deliberate and significant effort to ensure it is not. Does this consideration change your analysis?
