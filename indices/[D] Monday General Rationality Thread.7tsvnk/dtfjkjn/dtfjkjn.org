I've recently become somewhat obsessed with [[http://www.koryheath.com/zendo/][Zendo]], a tabletop game of inductive logic.

I think many people here would get a kick out of it, because the point of the game is to figure out a secret rule through experimentation.

Incidentally, I learned about its existence from a story posted here, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps]].
