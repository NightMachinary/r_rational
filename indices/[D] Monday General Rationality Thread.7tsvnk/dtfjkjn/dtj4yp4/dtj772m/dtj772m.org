The 2-4-6 task was exactly how I explained it to my only friend who's read HPMOR, actually!

It's incredibly easy to make new rules, and new variations on old rules. With people who've played a lot, you can keep tacking logical operators on stuff, and as long as everyone is playing on a similar level, it just gets more fun.

That's actually an important point. The people you play with have to have the ability to hold multiple properties in their heads and use abstract thought. If you try to play with someone who doesn't have those abilities, it is just sad.

That said, I'd suggest playing with a diverse group. I've played with biology people, literature people, and engineering people in one group, and the difference in modes of thought make for clear variations in strategy which are cool to see.

When you do end up playing, please let me (and the community) know how it goes!
