Nod. I don't even like driving. I simply can't get past “metal death machine hurtling at sixty miles per hour, and even if I do everything right, I also have to trust that everyone else is going to properly operate their own metal death machines.”

(This is a big reason I moved to SF, where the public transportation is good enough that I don't need a car)

Self driving cars cannot come quickly enough.
