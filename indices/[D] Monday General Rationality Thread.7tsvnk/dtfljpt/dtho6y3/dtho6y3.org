Well, that's not really quite fair to "reading math textbooks". I've gotten quite a bit better at math over the last three or four years from, almost exclusively, doing just that. (I've never really learned to do work at home, so I have not yet successfully set up a practice-session program. But I /can/ get myself to carefully read a text. So I do that.)

Similarly, I've heard it said (but not checked the literature myself) that the usual fiction reading that people do is pretty well known to improve their mental models of people's emotions... and I'm reasonably confident that reading repeated fictionalizations of rational though processes has made me more likely to use them - and use them correctly.

On the other hand... towards the end of the first batch of writing on LW, EY wrote a couple posts that basically said "yeah, I've written an infodump of bits pointing in the right direction, now we have to figure out (1) what matters the most and (2) how to actually teach it. And figure out the meta-level problems of figuring out (3) /when we've taught it/ and (4) /how to know that someone has figured out 1, 2, and 3/."

I've been somewhat underwhelmed by our progress on questions 1-4 in the last decade. (But then I'm not in a good location or group to notice any such progress, so that doesn't signify much.)
