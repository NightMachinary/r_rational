JaNoWriMo is well underway: [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo]]

I've plotted out the whole of the first "volume" now, so I know what happens (my story has 3 volumes, each about 30,000 words I think).

I kind of hate the quality of my writing, but I suppose there's little that can be done for that until I am able to get heavy editing done.

I wrote 1300 words in 2 hours yesterday, which is kind of sobering / scary. I'm back at work today so I'm not sure I'm going to have as much time to write as I'd like. I also discovered I have a hard time writing at home so I've been using public libraries.

It was meant to be about one thing but then the characters drew the conversation elsewhere, which was less than ideal, but c'est la vie.

My husband also finally read what I've done so far! Predictably he didn't like it (it's vampire yaoi after all), but at least someone else went to the trouble of reading it :)

Hopefully one day I can fix it up so it's a bit more shareable, but at the moment I feel too vulnerable opening it up to be torn apart. I think it's because I don't feel like any of the passages are "finished" yet, so they're not a true reflection of my abilities.
