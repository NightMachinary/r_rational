Oh my god thankyou so much! You have no idea what that means to hear :).

I'll definitely post more on the weekly writing skills threads, and I'm considering sharing the final work in a serial form on here if people would find it rational. I'm doing my utmost to have the setting rational, and the characters act rationally, but the genre seems wrong. (But that's probably just because the rationalverse is typically considered to be "cishet white males with CS degrees", and vampire yaoi is not really targeted at that audience; maybe publishing some might help reveal the hidden diversity or at the very least help to buck that impression?)
