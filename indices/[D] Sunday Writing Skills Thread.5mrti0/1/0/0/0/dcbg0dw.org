I've always gotten the sense that the community has been pretty open to recommendations that fit the general mold of rational fiction.

There's a lot to be said for stories that focus on experimenting and toying with the limits and implications of specific powers and underlying mechanics grounding a particular universe. I think those aspects also often make a particular world feel much more 'rational' as characters actively test and tease truth out of the world at every turn (though privy to mistakes of their own).

But personally, I think there's a healthy amount of breathing room in the genre that's yet often unplumbed. That is to say, a wide stretch of territory between rational stories and rationalist stories.

In any case, I'd like to read your story regardless of whether or not it fit the specifics of the genre classification (which is rather nebulous anyways). It's a fascinating world you've made, and one I'd like to live a story in.

(Not sure if this even bears mentioning, but I'm a straight male and wouldn't stop reading a story just cause yaoi. Maybe it'd be more accurate to say I wouldn't actively seek it out, but neither would it actively deter me. I mean, lesbian, straight, poly amorous, or whatever else. Good romance is good romance.)
