Book 1 of Mistborn (The Final Empire) comes to mind, as the main character has a variety of magical powers that she's trained in the use of. One of the things I recall Sanderson specifically doing with the magic was creating some of the powers in such a way that they actually caused the user to perceive the world differently (even for powers that were not specifically centered around perception).

Specifically, one class of magic users (Lurchers) is able to pull metal objects in their environment toward them. To observers, all they can see is the metal object flying toward the Lurcher; it might look like the ubiquitous Jedi force pull. However, when the Lurcher uses their power, they are able to sense metal objects nearby, and when concentrating, they can "see" lines connecting them to the metal objects that they're capable of pulling, almost like invisible threads that are connecting them to proximate metal objects, and they can then select one of those threads and "pull" on it to draw the object to themselves. (Note that the "pulling" doesn't actually involve actually physically tugging on a string with their arms; in practical terms it's sort of like a telekinetic psychic power.)

Once the reader understands this visual language for communicating the mechanics of the Lurcher's metal pulling ability, it becomes more apparent how one might "master" this ability. Namely, a big part of a Lurcher's skill comes from her ability to cut through the noise: when the Lurcher is in an area with lots of metal objects, there are lots of little lines, and pulling a specific object to yourself requires the ability to identify which of the little invisible "strings" is the one that corresponds to the object that you're trying to pull. Pull too hard on the wrong "string," and you might find that there's suddenly a nail hurdling in your direction at high velocity, ready to impale you.

I'm not sure if this example is sufficiently "strange" to address your question, but to speak more generally, finding ways like this to make powers more manifest also creates plausible scenarios in which one could be "bad" at the magic, which creates room for improvement, and opportunities for learning.
