There isn't really a great option. I refuse to go to SpaceBattles because every interaction I've had there has been negative to some degree, and the mods are much quicker and more random on the trigger than on SV. Some of our main contributors didn't want to go to QQ, and QQ has its own issues like "If we think this relates in any way to modern politics then you get the hammer." As a general rule, SV is a good candidate.
