Everything posted anywhere on the site must conform to [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-rules-and-procedures-of-sufficient-velocity.40100/][the site's rules]]. That includes things like "don't be hateful", which is probably what we were being infracted under.

I'm actually fine with (eg) neo-Nazi comments getting punished, and with individuals being punished for insulting each other. I simply think that I'm no way was this an infractable event.

On a separate but related note: I briefly played in a quest where the MC was portaled into the world of Worm. It was made clear in the first update that the MC had been in their 20s before being portaled. It was therefore creepy af when he started dating Vista who at the time was 12. (11? 13? Something like that.) Multiple people complained to him, he dug in his heels and refused to change it, even though it would have meant deleting or modifying one line in the original post. He even threatened to threadban anyone who raised the issue again. People, including me, reported him for it. The mods looked at it and went "Nah, you're good."

In fairness, nothing sexual happened between the two, which means it probably was within the bounds of the site's rules, at least technically. Still, if we were going to get pasted for the Uchiha deal I would have preferred to see a little more consistency and objection to what can only be considered a lead-in to sex with a child.
