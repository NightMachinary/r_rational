Part of the incident. The reason my appeal took so long was mostly my fault though. I wanted my arguments to be ironclad, but I was also working at the time. And I used an Advocate who themselves is just a volunteer forum user with their own time constraints and in a completely different time zone to boot. So I actually asked for continuances on the appeals process. All that only to have the Arbitrator completely agree with me and remove all infractions roughly a week after my threadban ended anyway. But I mostly did it on principle and in the hopes to have the next mod think twice about whether they are being fair.
