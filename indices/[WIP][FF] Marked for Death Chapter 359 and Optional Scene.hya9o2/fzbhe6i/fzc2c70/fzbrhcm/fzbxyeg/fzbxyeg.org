The Gōketsu (the MC's clan) made a deal with the Uchiha clan: The Gōketsu would adopt a bunch of civilians that the Uchiha could not afford to support and would receive assorted political favors. In exchange, some of the women who were changing clans would be required to have a certain number of babies with ninja (meaning the babies were likely to be ninja-capable). The babies would be adopted back to the Uchiha, who desperately needed more ninja.

- Everyone involved was over 18 and giving enthusiastic consent to the whole thing because it would make their lives objectively better.
- The parents and babies were not being separated. Everyone involved would be free to visit back and forth between the two clan compounds at will and the women could probably have been adopted back later once the Uchiha were on firmer financial footing.
- Any woman who changed her mind about the deal or showed any signs of health issues as a result of birthing could beg off and a different woman would be found who was happy to take her place.
- Having a ninja parent, the babies were almost certainly going to be ninja themselves. This would have made them incredibly respected and set them up for the best childhood possible in a 12th-century feudal death world.

The mods went bananas -- not at the idea of eugenics, oddly, which might have been a reasonable accusation even though I'd gone to some pains to make it clear that wasn't what was happening. No, they were angry at the idea that I (and, by association, the other two QMs) was dehumanizing the women by writing them into a consensual relationship that required them to voluntarily have a certain number of babies who would then be raised as (effectively) princes and princesses in a building two miles away from where the mothers lived to which the mothers would have free access at all times.

They locked our thread with no warning or explanation, dragged the three QMs into a Discord channel for a 4-hour inquisition that turned very repetitive and featured phrases like "I need to hear you explain what you did wrong" despite having already been told "Okay, got it, the issue was that we were dehumanizing the women by making their childbearing transactional. Also, I had a character use the word 'brood mare' and this is bad despite the fact that this character is shown to be a little bit crazy and morally dark grey at best. Won't happen again."

While said inquisition was going on, two of the mods came into the quest's Discord channel. One of them had good intent, the other was there purely to stir things up and insult the authors and the players, which they did very successfully.

So, yeah. I'm not anxious to go through that again.

EDIT: In the end, the mods decided we had some nothing wrong and the QMs were not infracted. Then they went through the remaining (1900, I think?) messages in the thread to see if any of the players had said anything naughty. They found five or six comments they didn't like, several of which required IMO a /very/ uncharitable reading. Those people for infraction points and threadbanned for 1-2 weeks.

Were I being uncharitable, I might suspect that the mods were embarrassed to have made such a big deal and then found nothing wrong, so they went looking for something with which to save face. I would also point out that [EDIT: This segment invalidated by [[/u/faflec]] finding the exact quote: +the same mod who has come into our channel to stir up muck one of the mods involved in the inquisition, when asked why the player comments were being reviewed, said something to the effect of (quoting from memory): "when you turn on the lights you usually find cockroaches"+] one of the mods involved in the inquisition came into our thread afterwards to discuss it and had the following conversation with one of my co-QMs. Names redacted for courtesy:

[QUOTE]

/QM: The whole "eugenics" issue began with a particular update. Let's call that time point X. At some point later, someone reported an alleged rules violation. Let's call that Y. Without knowing the future, the reporter could only have been reporting a violation taking place between X and Y. There is no need to catch up on the thread, or lock anything, in order to investigate something that happened between those two points in the past. Either a violation took place between X and Y or it didn't. If it did, fine, standard SV sanctions apply. If it didn't, case closed. Investigating past point Y is looking for fresh violations knowingly based on a false report./

/Mod: [QM]: Suppose you see a cockroach in your house. Do you assume it's the only one?"./

[/QUOTE]

In other words, he dehumanized our players by comparing them to cockroaches.

+EDIT 2: As to the cockroaches comment, I remember it very clearly but I've looked around for it and can't find the source, so perhaps I'm mistaken and it's a false memory.+

EDIT 3: Aha! The almighty [[/u/faflec]] has found it. He is all the wonderful. Prior comments updated with correct details.
