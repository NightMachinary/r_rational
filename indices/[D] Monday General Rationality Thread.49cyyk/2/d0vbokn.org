An AI is now at 2-0 against Lee Sedol, possibly the best human Go player in the world.

Even though Lee was in top form and played a game that commentators struggle to find flaws in.

[[https://youtu.be/l-GsfyVCBu0?t=1h17m42s][At one point]] in match 2, the AI played a move so mystifying that the pro commentator (high rank himself, able to predict a good many moves) was wondering about a misclick. (You can see him hesitating to put the stone on the display board.)

And then Lee stopped and thought about that one move for twenty minutes (with his 2 hours clock running!).

And still lost.

This is what true superiority looks like. When you can't even tell what you did wrong or your opponent did right.

 

“Yesterday I was surprised, but today, more than that, I am quite speechless. I would have to say, if you look at the way the game was played, I admit that it was a very clear loss on my part. From the very beginning of the game, there was not a moment in time that I felt that I was leading the game. [...] AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game.” (Source: Lee's post-game interview, end of the above video)

"Yeah, we could maybe have AlphaGo learn everything totally from scratch and reach a superhuman level of knowledge just by playing itself, not using any human games for training material. Of course, reinventing everything that humanity has figured out while playing Go for the last 2,500 years, that's going to take quite a bit of time. Like a few months or so."

Three more games to go; Lee is now saying he'll try hard to win one.
