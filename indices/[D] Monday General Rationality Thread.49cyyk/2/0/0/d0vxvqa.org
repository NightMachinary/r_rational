That's possible, but it's also possible that AlphaGo is vastly more capable than Lee, and I think that would look like this? It prioritises increasing its probability of victory and doesn't try to maximise its score, so you don't see 'overwhelming victories' where AlphaGo gets piles more points than Lee. If anything, wouldn't it tend towards 'marginal victories', because that means its putting all its resources into increasing its overall chances of winning?
