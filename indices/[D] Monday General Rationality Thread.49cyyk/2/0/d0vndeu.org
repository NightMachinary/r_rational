I stayed up late last night watching this and read quite a bit of the commentary this morning. There are way too many Skynet jokes.

I don't necessarily think that this is what true superiority looks like. The big issue is that AlphaGo is a complex trained neural net, which means that it's very hard to see why it's doing /anything/, even if it's making mistakes. This isn't necessarily a matter of mastery, it's a matter of pure inscrutability.

To think of it another way, let's say that the game of chess was carried over the Aleutian land bridge (or whatever) and the native peoples of the Americas developed a strong culture of chess. When first contact happened, eventually a European would sit down to a game of chess with an Algonquin ... and they /both/ would find themselves up against moves that they didn't know of and didn't have the context for, because the chess metagame would be similar but different. Since AlphaGo trains mostly by playing itself (IIRC) it has a different "understanding" of the game, and part of its advantage is that it's probably consumed all the games of baduk on record but no one has studied /it/ enough to know its common lines of play. Given time, human players might be able to figure out why it's doing what it's doing and why, but that time doesn't exist and we don't have a catalog of games (we only have two games of the current best iteration of the program).

I'm not saying that AlphaGo isn't better at the game than Lee Sedol (since I think it's pretty likely that it will take the series 5-0) but much of what it's doing hinges on "alieness" rather than "skill", if a neural net can be said to have such a thing.
