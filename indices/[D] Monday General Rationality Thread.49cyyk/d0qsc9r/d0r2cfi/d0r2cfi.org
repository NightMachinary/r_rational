Nice.

Here's a thought: Say you or someone else pursues this hobby for an arbitrary amount of time and decides to write either 'The Beginner's Guide to Civilisation' or 'Self-Uplift for Dummies';

What are the theoretical minimum requirements for a reader to be able to follow along and build a society on par with ours?

Would it be literacy in the language used? Fluency? Or would the ability to perceive and understand pictures be enough?
