Let's see well one of the biggest discoveries for getting it started seems to actually be isolating and proving the existence of oxygen.

Also the amount of weight that oxygen contributes to things that burn.

So if you have a good source of oxygen from a process you can do a lot.

Doing this requires some chemical combinations, one of the easier ones to do is burning 'calc of mercury' with sunlight and a lens. Calc of mercury is oxidized mercury and was common as an apothecary ingredient and thus fairly easy to acquire.

Alternatively if you HAVE mercury you can just oxidize it to manufacture calc of mercury and thus assemble your experiment from there.

After that proof isolating atoms via electrical processes is next, which you need a volt pile or battery at minimum. That takes copper, zinc, cardboard and salt water.

You can use this to do things like isolate sodium and potassium from compounds that they are otherwise bonded too.

Potassium and sodium make for great magic shows to wow audiences too.

This gets you the basis for the electron as a component of atoms and electron based bonding of atoms to make molecules because the different poles of your circuits that are used to say split hydrogen and oxygen out of water will be drawn to positive and negative poles.

After that things get a bit more complicated and much more labor intensive, pitch blend (the ore of uranium) is a common waste product of some silver mines. You can start demonstrating radioactivity with raw uranium ore using just photographic paper, to build the instruments to detect radiation with any precision though you need some experts in quartz crystals and piezoelectric however, radioactive isotopes WILL make air more conductive, so you can start working through how to build that stuff.

Extracting radium from pitchblend is immensely intensive labor wise but might be good for a light show (kinda dangerous though).

You need an X ray source and a particular kind of crystal that I don't know the properties of yet to get an X-ray spectrum of pure elements.

This will give you an atom's position by atomic number and sidestep the complications of trying to figure out the periodic table by the more complicated and not quite intuitive atomic weight method that was actually used.

I'm leaving off a lot of the individual element isolating experiments in favor of the more foundation/bigger picture proofs.

I still want to shore up some of the knowledge bases here personally before I move onto figuring out how to do neutron detection/proof.
