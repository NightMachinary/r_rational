High vacuum is a powerful tech to introduce for a lot of applications (x-rays, mass spectrometer, insulation for cryogenics, power electronics), so look into that. It is actually fairly simple to achieve with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprengel_pump][Sprengel pump]] using some glass tubing and liquid mercury.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing][Glassblowing]] is going to be a big deal, so maybe start by hiring some competent glassblowers. Not only are you going to want it for things like test tubes and Sprengel pumps, but obviously there is the fact that glass has useful optical properties. If you can set up a [[http://www.heathway.com/ctowers.htm][drawing tower]] that works well enough, you could use fiber optics for communications (skip the copper cable telephone and go straight to the photophone); not to mention as a way to create lasers, when you are ready to get ambitious.

For precision machining, you need flat surfaces and straight lines. There's a way to get flat surfaces by grinding three surfaces against each other. You can also get straight lines by grinding three rods together. Both of these are described [[http://www.engineeringforchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/multimachine-concrete-lathe-ver-1-10.pdf][here]], as well as a trick for using cast concrete (which shrinks when it sets) for precision machining (basically, you use cast concrete to make the general structure, then use nonshrinking grout to fix the ways in place).

Speaking of bookkeeping; given that your strategy will probably involve gaining and managing a lot of wealth, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system][double-entry accounting]] is going to give you an advantage (assuming it isn't widespread in that era). You could potentially use it to make your vassals richer, especially if you had a system to enforce its use uniformly. You could also use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax][land value tax]] to encourage people to build smaller and closer together while funding infrastructure and defense. Another thing might be to add a credit scoring system that incentivises repayments and thus permits the use of credit without there being things like debtor's prisons and slavery.
