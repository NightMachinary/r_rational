I've thought about the same problem before now. High five from a fellow uplifter!

  But the rest is mostly just resources and getting some one who can do book keeping on the findings.

As an engineer I am understandably biased, but I've also had some extra details about what you need to actually create 1900's technology ground into my head. The physical making of stuff is more of a concern than you might think, there are a lot of hidden pitfalls that are not immediately obvious.

To get your score card up to full implementable uplift level, you'd need knowledge of the steel producing blast furnace, the Haber process, some simple metallurgy knowledge like how to make it so the iron/steel isn't super brittle, a basic understanding of making re-usable moulds to allow for mass production and replaceable/interchangable parts, and ideally the recipe for black powder and the basics of designing a steam engine to make the mining easier. You could probably pick that up in an afternoon or two. And then, you can become King of France!
