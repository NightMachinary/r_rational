The key idea behind these experiments is that their not necessarily obvious but open up a massive amount of opportunity for experiment and further study.

I'm not expecting to build a civilization myself. That's why I picked 1600s there are the right kind of infrastructures and the idea of scientific exploration in place in a systematic way. Also a lot of experts in fields that can be directly supported by good chemistry.

It's a lot more work to do stuff in isolation of that which is why I'm not confident I could make the same improvements any earlier and much later I also am not confident I would do much more then tell a few people something is possible they think is not.
