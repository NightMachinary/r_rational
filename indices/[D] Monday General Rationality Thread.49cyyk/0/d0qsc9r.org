I've got a personal score card for myself.

How much of modern technology could I jump start from a given era assuming the ability to communicate with the locals.

I am pleased to say that I could probably shave off three hundred years from the 1600s now.

Or in other words I know 'most' of the foundational experiments that go from phlogiston to atomic numbers.

I need to work out how to build an X-ray tube and identify raw copper and zync ores still.

But the rest is mostly just resources and getting some one who can do book keeping on the findings.
