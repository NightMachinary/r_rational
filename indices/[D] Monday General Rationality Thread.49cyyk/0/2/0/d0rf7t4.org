Hmm tricky but I think pictures would be minimum with humans. That said if you can share a language (even something like simple english) you can get through most of it. Be a fairly dense book.

Would also not be an encyclopedia it would be "here are the ways to get the foundational knowledge experiment in x directions to fill out details"

It would honestly work a lot more like a game in a lot of respects then a guide book. You have to complete x to perform y etc.
