alexanderwales ripped the code from that worldbuilder CYOA a few days back and guided me through enough of it to let me start experimenting/learning how it worked. I started out knowing zero coding, and while I'm obviously not doing anything advanced, it feels really good to be able to take a functional piece of HTML and rework it with my own content. In a day or three I think I'll have finished making my own interactive CYOA, and I'll be sure to post it here. I'm also finding learning coding a lot of fun, so I think I'll hit up a general beginner's guide when I've finished the CYOA.
