The duel:

- SA'AR

Hebrew for "storm", it was drawn from the hurricane by Thamiel.

- TEMPESTAS

Latin for "season, weather; bad weather; storm, tempest" as well as the ancient Roman goddess of the same portfolio, it was translated from SA'AR by Thamiel.

- HURRICANE

English word. It was translated from TEMPESTAS by Thamiel.

- *HRCN*

Transitional state. Thamiel stripped the vowels (and one R) from HURRICANE to create it.

- *CHRN*

Transitional state. Thamiel rearranged HRCN to create it.

- A*CH*E*R*O*N*

The river at the boundary of hell. Thamiel added vowels to create it.

- *CH*AI AA*R*O*N*

"Life" and "Aaron" (the historical figure). Uriel changed the meaning without rearranging any consonants.

- *CH*AO*S* *R*UI*N*

Thamiel brought an "s" from the wind, and didn't otherwise change the consonants. Note that the text presented this in the opposite order (Ruin, Chaos) despite Thamiel not rearranging the letters, which is not a coincidence.

- *M*A*CH*I*N*E *R*A*Z*

"Machine" and "secrets". I don't know if it is "Machine Raz" or else "Raz Machine". Uriel brought an "M" from the water, and hardened the "S" into a "Z".

- *N*A*C*O*M* *R*A*SH*A

"Punishment" and "Wicked", again presented backwards in the text. Thamiel softened the "Z" back into an "S" and reorganized many letters.

- *M*E*R*EA + ?*SH*?

"Friend". The "N" and "C" fell out of their own accord when Thamiel pointed at them.

- *S*O*H*U

The "M" and "R" fell out when Thamiel pointed to them.
