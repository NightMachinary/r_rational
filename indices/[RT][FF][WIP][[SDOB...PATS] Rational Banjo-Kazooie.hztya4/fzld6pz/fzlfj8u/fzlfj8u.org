Indeed! I don't think any paragraph I could write would capture the way Spiral Mountain exists in a reader's mind. All fanfiction runs into not wanting to waste space delivering exposition the reader is assuredly familiar with and video games invite their audience to inhabit their worlds more concretely than any other medium. I'll leave it to be judged if I leaned too far with this - but thank you for not assuming it was unintentional. I appreciate the feedback.
