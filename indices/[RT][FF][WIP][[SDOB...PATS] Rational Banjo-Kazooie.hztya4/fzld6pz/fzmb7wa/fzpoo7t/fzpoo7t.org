Thank you, intensely, for your feedback. I know there's so many things I wish I took the time to write a comment on at brief length, and it was always good to see somebody drop by and say something close to what I wanted to interject. From the three upvotes here clearly you're speaking for more than just yourself, and I like to imagine more than a few other general readers - and future readers.

  I assume from your comments and Banjo's mentions of Wizpig that you're building a "Rareverse"-style setting in the vein of [[/u/gazemaize]] and their Dahlverse....(Depending on the level of "chuck it all in", it could also end up with characters from James Bond and Joanna Dark to the Battletoads, so I will wait and see to what level you're taking this.)

Oh, it's not what level _I'm_ taking it

For any particular video game franchise you might wonder as to its implications on this fic, you're either going to find a straight answer or two decades of evolving scholarship by canonographers of the philosophically absurd.

And that goes for any particular element. There's a two hour podcast about Mr. Patch from Banjo-Tooie recorded because a listener fulfilled their challenge of recording six hours of commentary on their six hours commentary on the Yooka Laylee developer commentaries. They built a macro in the late Project Spark that generated random acorn people from Conker's Pocket Tales, which nobody remembers partially because it got pulled from the shelves when the series went M-rated.

I wrote to another commentator very politely expressing that my lack of description and exposition made it impenetrable to people who never played Banjo-Kazooie. The specific writing I certainly lean into and utilize stylistically, but also am doing that to cover for genuine weaknesses in those areas (your point on dialogue is another weakness). However, impenetrability?

There's those commentators, there's the you commentators, then there's the hypothetical someone who engaged with these games like those guys with the Donkey Kong Universe, the Rare version of a grown-up kid who daydreamed about their favourite Dahl books intermingling. Their minds are already exploding at the possible connections to where Kazooie is and wondering if my inventing this tribe's name as "Jublins" implies I'm favoring the Jinjo connection theory with Mumbo. Maybe very few of even they caught the reference to Donkey Kong Country 3 until I namechecked Razor Ridge; as Pacifica was a bonus world added to the extensive 2005 Gameboy Advance remake.

Already in writing these three chapters and engaging with these handful of comments I've structured a lot of where I want to go, and how better to approach my writing to best address the more negative criticism. Even the briefest thought is something that impacts me and tells me to rethink how I'm communicating and what people are anticipating. You should see the pages of notes I have on both Brentilda and Cheato.
