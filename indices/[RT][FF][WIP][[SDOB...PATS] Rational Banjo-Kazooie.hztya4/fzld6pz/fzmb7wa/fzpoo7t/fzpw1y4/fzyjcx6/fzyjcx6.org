  I've never really "got" or enjoyed stories where you have to reconstitute the actual story out of a mess of unreliable narration; it feels too much like being given a bowl of story mix and being told to bake it myself. If I've decided to spend time reading something, I'd really prefer not to also have to do homework.

Thank you for the continued feedback. I don't want to reply to everything as that might be too cluttered and I'm in the swing of writing more. But I wanted to say that for as much as I like weirdness, I actually quite agree about unreliable narration and too great an ambiguity in what's going on. Hopefully the next leg will assuage some concerns; but also there's a matter of my refining myself as a better author to find the line on these things.

Certainly I want to assure you I hate those kinds of endings, and you needn't worry about getting invested in something to find a soup of ideas and sentences at the end. Moreso than you found along the way, ahahahah. Thank you so much! Been thinking about every bit of what you said and how to tune my writing thinking from your kind of perspective
