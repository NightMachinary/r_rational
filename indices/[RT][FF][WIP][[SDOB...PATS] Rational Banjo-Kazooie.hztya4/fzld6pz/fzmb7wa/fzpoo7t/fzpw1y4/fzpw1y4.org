Another thing: I went back and reread while listening to the Spiral Mountain theme and it worked a lot better for me. Not sure whether it's better on reread or due to the magic of Grant Kirkhope.

The 3 chapters up currently really feel like one - there's three different scenes, but they're all part of one narrative beat. The "Yes." at the end of chapter 1 falls especially flat - I think the conversation doesn't have the narrative momentum at that point.

That said, I now really hope this takes off because I love the "corkboard and string" sort of feeling of making connections between all the different parts and I'd love to see what intense [[/r/rational]] discussion of this fic looked like. I'm going to go read through that DKU site next.

My commenting style tends to be to read through and try and keep in mind what my impressions are as I go. I can't necessarily tell the author what was good or wasn't, but I can tell them what landed for me. Admittedly, I'm guilty of skim-reading a lot of the time and just enjoying the surface-level of stories - I've never really "got" or enjoyed stories where you have to reconstitute the actual story out of a mess of unreliable narration; it feels too much like being given a bowl of story mix and being told to bake it myself. If I've decided to spend time reading something, I'd really prefer not to also have to do homework. (This is to illustrate what sort of reader I am, and therefore hopefully put my comments in more context.)
