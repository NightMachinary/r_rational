I think it's good that you're writing and exploring spaces that are interesting to you.

I'm sorry, but while I can typically mentally edit around minor typographical errors without too much loss of immersion, there are twenty-one instances in the three published chapters where quotations end with the closing full stop outside the closing quotation marks, and I find it all but impossible not to stop and stare at them when I see them, losing all context and finding myself quickly lost. Bottles' name is spelled 'Bottled' in one place in the first chapter.

If I was a diehard Banjo-Kazooie fan, I might be inclined to read on to see what you've done with the universe, but as it stands, the typographical errors and lack of context prevent me from entering an enjoyable reading flow.
