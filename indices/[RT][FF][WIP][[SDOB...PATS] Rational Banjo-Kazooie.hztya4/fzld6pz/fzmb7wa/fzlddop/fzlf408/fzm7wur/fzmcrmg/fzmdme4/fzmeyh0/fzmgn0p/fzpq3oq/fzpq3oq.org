  Years of reading and programming have primed me to have certain expectations. When those expectations are stretched or subverted, I can be delighted; when they stretch too far, I'm no longer able to feed it into my reading-hopper easily. It gets jammed.

I'm glad you guys hashed this stuff out in this direction. Rationalfic particularly has a high degree of people coming in from less narrative "writing" environments, and this kind of discussion of syntax is hugely interesting to me. One of my favourite poets is [[https://www.best-poems.net/e_e_cummings/index.html][e e cummings]] ; I'm certainly no e e cummings. But I think I'll navigate that line.
