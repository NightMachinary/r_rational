Since you mentioned programming, I'll just say that the /most/ important thing stylistically is consistency: use tabs if you wish, use spaces if it makes you happy, but /please/ don't mix them. Or in this case, ending quotation styles.

(Also, as a programmer, I still much prefer keeping the punctuation inside the quote. It's part of the string, not an outside operator being called on it! ;p </opinions>)
