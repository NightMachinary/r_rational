I like the full stop outside the quotations... but I should rather stick to the consensus style to not jar the reader. Kind of strange I could come to think of this kind of stuff as unimportant and writing as kind of this frivolous thing... perhaps I'll trade beta readings with a friend somewhere because I'm totally noseblind to these things. Thank you for giving such a thoughtful feedback! I'm touched, it wasn't even phrased negatively
