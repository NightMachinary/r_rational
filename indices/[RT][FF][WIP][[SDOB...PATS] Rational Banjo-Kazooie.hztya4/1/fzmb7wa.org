Interesting. I don't feel like Banjo or Bottles are quite capturing the "Rareware character" feel in their dialogue, but that might be because we don't have Kazooie in the story yet - it seems like an odd choice to have her not present at the start, but I assume you've got A Plan for the bear and bird meeting that necessitates moving their meeting after Tooty gets abducted.

I assume from your comments and Banjo's mentions of Wizpig that you're building a "Rareverse"-style setting in the vein of [[/u/gazemaize]] and their Dahlverse. Presumably that includes Diddy Kong Racing and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Possibly it also includes DK64 and the various Donkey Kong Country games? Time will tell, I suppose. (Depending on the level of "chuck it all in", it could also end up with characters from James Bond and Joanna Dark to the Battletoads, so I will wait and see to what level you're taking this.)

I find it surprising that neither Bottles nor Mumbo have brought up the existence of Jinjos yet during the discussions of magic - I thought that Bottles explained their existence to you when you first find one, but I could be mistaken.

I'm also looking forward to how Brentilda and Cheato affect the story - against a smarter Gruntilda, the information they provide is likely to be key.
