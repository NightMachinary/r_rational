Sure, but I'm not making a statement about objective reality here, I'm just saying that

char[] foo = "adjective";

char[] foo_sentence = "I'm an English sentence.";

Feels a lot different to me than

#+begin_quote
  He said, "I'm an English gentleman".
#+end_quote

Years of reading and programming have primed me to have certain expectations. When those expectations are stretched or subverted, I can be delighted; when they stretch too far, I'm no longer able to feed it into my reading-hopper easily. It gets jammed.
