It's a bit of a balancing act writing Athos in these early chapters. He's only been a sophont for a week at this point, and he only figured out what '+' means a few days ago. I don't want him to be stupid, but at the same time he's effectively a child in a giant's body. Chasing the shinies is the believable thing, I feel. But, yes: It makes me wince at the opportunity cost he's paying.

EDIT: Also, cough cough...spreadsheets, formulas, typos, you know how it goes.

Corrected version:

  I didn't bother getting "Reduce Glare", as I had already unlocked four nodes that day, each costing more than the previous one at that rank, and a Skill that used MP to provide magical sunglasses was not worth *1,094* Attunement, even if I'd had that much. It wasn't even worth the *216* that it wanted after the prices reset the next day.

Doesn't change anything about what you said.
