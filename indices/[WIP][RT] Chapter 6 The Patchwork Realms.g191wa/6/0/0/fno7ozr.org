Oh, thanks for calling out the change. I rarely re-read chapters unless a story goes on for years, so I'd have missed that and been confused when numbers in later chapters didn't match up. Also makes his choices a lot more reasonable.

Spending an extra 3% of his pool is a lot less of a mistake than spending over 50% at once would have been.
