I purchase a VPN, and use it to google effective ways to set a house on fire.

I withdraw cash, get something flammable to help set the fire, ammonia and bleach, a paintball gun and binoculars, along with things to hide my identity like a mask. I try to do this in a secretive fashion so no one knows who I am as I look outside, perhaps driving a fair distance to buy these things. After this I go to the house at 3 or so am and if necessary paintball any cameras outside while far away, check if any lights are on. I then set up mixtures of bleach and ammonia around any exits so that anyone escaping will get a lungful of toxic gases, set the house on fire, and leave the scene. If they escape they should be severely injured at least, and thus unable to threaten me further.
