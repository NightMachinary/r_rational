Max also seems to not move in space when she time travels, and nothing in her possesion does, either. This gives her the effective ability to teleport on a moment by moment basis to anywhere she can reach within five minutes. If she were driving a car, she could hit and run, and effectively teleport the car the distance it could drive in 5 minutes every second.
