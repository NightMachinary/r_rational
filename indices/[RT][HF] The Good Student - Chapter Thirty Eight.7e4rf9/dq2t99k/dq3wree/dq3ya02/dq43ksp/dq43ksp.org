How did you get it so high? I managed to get it up to /at most/ 20, by checking off the following:

  32, 35, 42, 47+b+c, 48, 49+8+a+b, 67+a, 71+a, 72+b, 79, 97.

In any case, I prefer using [[https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/3gw7wq/what_makes_a_character_overpowered_or_a_mary_sue/cu257fu/][Wildbow's definition]] of the term more than such tests: a Mary Sue is a narrative black hole, a character that bends characterization and established rules of the setting in own's favour. Being very smart doesn't count, as long as the character isn't literally superhumanly smart, and I don't think the rest fits Nic very well either. Can you offer specific examples?
