I'm up to date with this story. It's the most planned out work by Moody but in some ways his weakest. There is far more subtlety and less plot movement than in most of his other stories. A good chunk of this story is slice of life which I know can be a turnoff for more plot focused readers. As for Nic being impressively good I can tell you right now that it is the arena he excels at the most so it is believable that he is good with the academy.

You do bring up very good points though. Points that I noticed but hadn't really thought about too much because of Rule Of Cool. Up until now Nic gets away with far too much than his social station should have allowed. There's reasons for most things ending in his favor but it does feel kind of hollow. It's like he won a lottery rather than fixing his own race. I won't name examples and spoil it but the preferential treatment and bullshit messing with him, because he's a smart protagonist so he should suffer, for unjust reasons continue even in the last few chapters published. I'm going to conduct a Gary Stu test based on only given information and see what Nic gets. I'll post results below.
