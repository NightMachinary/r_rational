I'm on chapter 7 of this story (I'm not reading the other comments to avoid spoilers, so please don't include any if you reply), and I'm considering dropping it. Anyone reading this must have kept up with it, so I'd like someone to convince me to keep reading.

Here's why I'm not sure about reading more: So far, it comes across as fanfiction about studying. There's magic but the MC isn't interested in it (though I expect this will change at some point). I like the explanation that he's only learning so much in order to pursue Dizzy, because it's the only flaw that makes him believable. It just seems like he is constantly being praised and rewarded all the time for being so awesome. He's a total dickhead going around making an ass of himself by throwing the rules in the teachers' and librarian's faces, and he's rewarded for it. The teacher he rudely demands tutoring from ends up praising him for his clever plan and being very cooperative about teaching him. The librarian rewards him with a key to the library and 24/7 access when he demands to be allowed to take out books. It seems like the author is trying to create the illusion of struggle/adversity, but the MC instantly and decisively wins every conflict, and the people who were initially obstructing him end up doing exactly what he wants and more, while telling him how smart he is.

My question is, does it get better, or is the rest of the story like this?

Thanks in advance for any replies.
