/Can/ the demon kill itself? It's not a meatsack, after all, it's an Arcanum entity. Perhaps it can't be really killed except by specific processes, such as being consumed by another. I believe Tenner mentioned in [[http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student/tgs-chapter-8][Chapter 8]] that the demon would need a strong source of magic to do so, and albeit it was said to reinforce a lie, it was evidently plausible enough to be accepted by several smart people with education in Arcanum. Perhaps it's close to the truth.

And even if it can off itself, the specifics of death may matter. A man can throw himself off a building, but he can't exactly spontaneously digest himself with stomach acids, can he? Nic was supposed to become the door --- it's likely the demon needed to die in some highly specific way to achieve it.
