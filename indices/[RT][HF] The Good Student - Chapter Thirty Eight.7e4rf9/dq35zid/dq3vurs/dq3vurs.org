Nic needed to be made stronger to become the door. The demon was a willing sacrifice. Moody used the idea of fattening the calf before it was slaughtered and its pretty good metaphor for what the demon was trying to do. Now Nic is potentially more powerful than Simole after subsuming a demon but on the other hand the demon has made it so that he should become the door.
