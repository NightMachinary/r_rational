/Fascinating/. This chapter is fascinating. The joint battle scene / storytelling session was quite unique, something I've never read before; it also both demonstrated the demons' interesting characteristics, Nic's particular strengths, and served as the climax for Nic's attempts to study demons.

The double-twist at the end was nicely done as well. The hero's brilliant plan and the entire complex sequence of events leading up to it was actually /the villain's/ brilliant plan, but it ended up not being /quite/ brilliant enough, and the hero managed to partially succeed /anyway/ --- that's a pretty interesting trope, in my opinion. It has the villain being smart, the hero being smart, a convoluted but fine plan, and the convoluted plan's realistically inevitable failure. It's /optimal/.

And the twist about the demon being the true sacrifice! It did seem off to me that Nic specifically needed to be sacrificed. If he is an ordinary person --- magic-wise, at least --- as everybody keeps telling us, why doesn't the demon with its followers go find someone less sharp and tenacious to trick and sacrifice? I figured it had to do with the tether or the fact that it needs to be someone the demon is inside of.\\
The actual explanation, though, makes much more sense.
