Thanks, man. My biggest issue was trying to keep it unconvoluted (disconvoluted?) enough so it could be understood without simplifying it so much it became obvious. I think I could smooth it out some given time to edit---a few people got lost towards the end---but I'm very happy you were able to follow the central theme so clearly.
