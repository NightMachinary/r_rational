It's an online litmus test mostly used by writers to determine if they are favoring their characters too much. It is hard to not become biased towards making a protagonist awesome for most starting writers. You just answer a bunch of questions but they are geared towards the author. As such since I don't know about any of Moody's personal details I skipped those questions entirely so for all we know the Score could actually be higher if Nic is based off himself even slightly.

This is the one I used for the TGS [[http://www.springhole.net/writing/marysue.htm]]
