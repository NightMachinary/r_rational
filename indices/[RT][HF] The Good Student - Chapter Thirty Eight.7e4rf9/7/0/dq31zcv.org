The rest of the story is not like this. The true plot is revealed around chapters 16-18, and Nic is severely /underpowered/ for it, not overpowered. I suppose it is still "about studying", since Nic the main character is the good student, so he solves his problems by studying at them, but the other issues you've described do stop appearing, in my opinion.
