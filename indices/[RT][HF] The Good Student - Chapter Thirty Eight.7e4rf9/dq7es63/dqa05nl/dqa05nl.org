In a fantasy world with rare magic, a son of a maid scores second-best in countrywide exams through hard work, which lets him transfer to the school for nobility along with three other commoners. The school heavily discriminates against such rags-to-riches types, but outcompeting other students and out-rules-lawyering the facility quickly turns out to be the least of their problems as they find themselves in the middle of a nefarious plot involving demons for which they're sorely unprepared. Competence porn, deadpan-snarking, banter, and studying ensue.
