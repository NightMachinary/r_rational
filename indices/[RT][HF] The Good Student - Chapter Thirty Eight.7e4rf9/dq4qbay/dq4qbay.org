I don't mean to fangirl, but I'm coming off a bit of a high after binging this story over the past two days. I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure this is the best thing I've read, to date. I'm blown away. I have a couple of ideas on how this is going to end and regardless of how it all plays out, I think I'm going to be satisfied.
