Huh.

That brings up two questions:

- What happened for it to be the teachers to first realize that Ralph is dead, before the roommate even wakes up? I mean, why would they check in on the boys if it was a normal day?

- Was Ralph setting up an excuse to conduct experiments at night without Daniel knowing by having something else cause the snoring?
