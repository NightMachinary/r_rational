My first few comments:

Writing 300 pages is really impressive, especially when the prologue shows good writing quality. Big kudos for that. That said, writing 300 pages and THEN asking for concrit is going to be much less effective than asking earlier, and comes off as a bit disingenuous. I doubt you will get nearly as much response as you might have gotten otherwise.

Speaking of disingenuous, it seems incongruous when you make comments about "where should I post this" in which you suggest you're going to post it everywhere, immediately followed by "can someone help motivate me to post it?" If you actually are serious about needing help, then simply put the whole thing in a zip file and put the link up. Fewer people will go to the trouble of downloading, unzipping, and reading, but some will and the response should help push you into posting individual chapters.

When you advertise your story, avoid saying things like "it has intelligent characters and ... awesome fight scenes" and "I suspect it of being amazing." That's for the reader to decide, and it sounds like you're bragging. The kind of authors who brag on their work don't tend to be the kind that produce high quality work. (Actually, in my experience that's true of people in general, not just authors.)

The rest is written as I'm reading through the story:

The mythic tone at the beginning was pretty over the top, but it worked well for a few paragraphs of introduction, and the story steadied down quickly after that. Overall, nice effect.

You're very clearly writing anime; the dialogue has that style ("why don't you lift up that bandage and show us your right eye?") and the giant ball of explosion was very obviously modeled on an anime trope image. This isn't a bad thing, but you should be aware that it's visible.

For a story that claims to be rational, there seems to be some ball-dropping going on. For example:

- Danzo says "the Uchiha can control the Beast with their Sharingan", then Ibiki announces that Danzo has a Sharingan...and no one reacts at all. The entire issue is just instantly dropped, and not even Ibiki continues to push it. I would have expected something like "hang on, you have a Sharingan? Leaving aside how the hell you have a Sharingan, can you control that monster and make it stop killing everyone?"

- This bit: "Minato frowned. His first instinct had been to check on the location of Uchiha Fugaku, head of the Uchiha clan and leader of the Konoha Military Police Force, but that was meaningless since the shrewd man was able to use Shadow clones; they would find him with the refugees either way." Distinguishing between a shadow clone and a real person is trivial: punch them. If they pop, they were a clone.

A couple of minor points: - In canon, Minato summons toads, not frogs. Is that a deliberate change? - "irresponsive" is a word, but I had to look it up to know that. I have literally never heard it before and assumed that it was a mistake and you meant "unresponsive". Word choice matters, and it's typically better to choose more standard usage, as doing otherwise knocks the reader out of the flow of the story. I say this out of personal experience -- I've gotten a large number of reviews telling me that I obviously meant "the army /infested/ the town", not "...invested..." or "the genin /polished/ up the weapons their teacher had thrown" instead of "...policed up...."

I was confused by the ending. The Third tells us that when Minato and his Anbu attacked they scared off the person who was controlling the Kyuubi and the Beast had been "irresponsive ever since". We are then shown the Kyuubi tied down, controlled by hundreds of genjutsu, etc. That makes it sound like the ninja defeated it. I guess maybe what happened is that the thing froze and then everyone tied it down?

On that subject, you state at the end that "a hundred different genjutsu effects left [the Kyuubi] helpless", yet then immediately tell us that genjutsu hadn't worked on it during the battle because Kushina was dead. Which is it?

Given that your ending is "This is the story of Naruto Uzumaki" I find myself not holding out a lot of hope that the dangling plot threads (Danzo, the investigation into Madara, etc) will be resolved. I would have liked it if you'd continued straight ahead and showed us the fallout from the attack -- the Third resuming office, the cleanup, etc. That wouldn't be Naruto's story, though. My expectation based on the fact that it is named as such is that the next chapter is going to start with canon -- that Danzo is still around, everyone has dropped the ball on looking into who caused the attack, etc. If you actually have people behave sensibly based on the information you've allowed them to deduce then the world will be completely different. Canon was shaped the way it was because everyone thought the Kyuubi assault was a natural disaster, not a targeted attack. Given that you've let Minato deduce what actually happened, everything should look different. No more Danzo, no more Root, no Uchiha massacre, probably no kidnapping of Hinata and death of Hizashi. That would be a bold and exciting choice, and I hope it's what you do.

With all of the above said, I'll read more if you put it up. I'm curious to see where you go with it.
