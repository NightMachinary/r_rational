  Going to be very critical because that's generally better than being nice.

Sure is! Thanks for taking the time to write a long analysis.

  You're trying to come off as epic or mythic, but it doesn't work.

Good news - only the prologue is written in this style, so the rest of the story should be more enjoyable for you.

Anyway, other people have said the exact opposite, so I'm guessing this is a case of personal preference. Still, I do worry that maybe I'm scaring off potential readers by having the first chapter with such thick prose. I'll probably just tone it down a bit here and there...

  The entire prologue changes nothing. Almost the same result as canon, with nothing different except a battle scene with Minato, that is, frankly, not too exciting.

This is a much more worrisome criticism! The chapter certainly should not be boring, and I thought it did change a few relevant things. I'll have to see if anyone else feels the same way before I make any radical changes.
