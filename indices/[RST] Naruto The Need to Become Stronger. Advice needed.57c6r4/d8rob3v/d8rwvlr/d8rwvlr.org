  comes off as a bit disingenuous.
#+end_quote

I don't see anything disingenuous about being proud of your story on the one hand, and being nervous about posting it and asking for advice on the other. I'm sure you've felt the same at points. But I'll add a zip with the first arc in it to the first post, you're right that I should have done that in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  there seems to be some ball-dropping going on.
#+end_quote

The shadow clone poke wouldn't work, because Fugaku would leave his real body where it's supposed to be, and send the clone to control the Nine tails.

Now that you mention it, Danzo shouldn't even have Shisui's eye at this point in the story! I'll have to change it for that reason as well as it being confusing.

#+begin_quote
  A couple of minor points:
#+end_quote

Whoops, that should have been toads, thanks! I have heard irresponsive before but I agree with your point and you're probably right that I should change it to something else.

#+begin_quote
  I guess maybe what happened is that the thing froze and then everyone tied it down?
#+end_quote

Exactly right. But I should probably change it to be clearer all the same.

#+begin_quote
  yet you immediately tell us that genjutsu hadn't worked on it during the battle because Kushina was dead. Which is it?
#+end_quote

Genjutsu did not work on Kushina because she was dead. Genjutsu did not work on the Kyubi because it was being resisted using the Kyubi's chakra. But you're right that that's confusing. Hm...

#+begin_quote
  I find myself not holding out a lot of hope that the dangling plot threads will be resolved.
#+end_quote

That's the main plot you're referring to! Of course it will not be resolved until near the end, same as for any other story.

#+begin_quote
  My expectation based on the fact that it is named as such is that the next chapter is going to start with canon
#+end_quote

There will be major changes to canon, but maybe not enough? That's one of the things I'm hoping to get feedback on. My general goal when writing the story was to keep the Naruto world similar on the surface, but with different underlying logic and consistent explanations. So you'll see many familiar elements, but with a different twist.

Thank you very much for taking the time to write such a long review!
