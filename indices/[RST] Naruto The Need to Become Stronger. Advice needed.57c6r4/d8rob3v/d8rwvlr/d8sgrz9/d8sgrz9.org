  My general goal when writing the story was to keep the Naruto world similar on the surface, but with different underlying logic and consistent explanations.

You're conflating two different story approaches.

Approach 1): Everything is the same as canon, but you've come up with explanations that make everyone's behavior consistent with their goals, making the story rational. This approach may require slight tweaks to canon for things or inconsistencies you can't explain. You can then start the story whenever you like, but divergences might arise. It'd be very hard to keep the plot the same and everyone acting in a manner consistent with their goals. I think this might be also called a deconstruction, but am not sure.

Approach 2): Change things. If you change even a single important thing, e.g. Danzo being found out, then if you start the story when canon begins the world will not even appear similar. Either Danzo is dead, and the whole village looks different, or Ibiki and everyone who heard his claim are dead or slaves of Danzo. The Uchiha would settle for nothing less, and the village would rather have the Uchiha than Danzo; either way, the issue would be settled decisively immediately following the Kyuubi's defeat or capture.
