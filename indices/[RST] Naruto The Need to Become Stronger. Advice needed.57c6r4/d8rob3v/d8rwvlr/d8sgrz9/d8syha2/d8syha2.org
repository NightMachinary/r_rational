Not conflating, combining. What I do is first try to explain the elements that can be sensibly explained, then change the one's that can't.

I already said to someone else I would change the Danzo thing. However, even if I didn't, it's a bit quick to assume that rational!Danzo would do everything the same as canon Danzo. In canon he did quite a few idiotic things that he would not do here, so people would not see him as an obvious villain.
