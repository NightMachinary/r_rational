  Also, I wasn't going to bring this up because arguing on the internet is usually pointless, but you've spent a lot of time in this thread A) talking about your own story, B) saying that some people who didn't like your story are awful and C) Criticizing me as a person by saying I'm incongruous/bragging/dishonest.

I apologize if it came off that way. I certainly wasn't trying to hijack your thread, nor to question your honesty.
