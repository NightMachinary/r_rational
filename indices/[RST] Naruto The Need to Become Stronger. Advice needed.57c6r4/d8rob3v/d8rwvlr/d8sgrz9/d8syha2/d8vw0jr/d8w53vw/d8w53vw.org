Well, that's just the nature of feedback: Everyone has a different idea of where they want the story to go, and given that I have already written 300 pages of it (which might indeed have been a mistake on my part) of course criticism that would require me to change the entirety of the story's premise to fix it is not likely to get addressed. This is also why wise reading is so important: If you just say "X didn't work for me", then you're right 100% of the time, but if you say "You should write Y instead", then others may feel differently.

Also, I wasn't going to bring this up because arguing on the internet is usually pointless, but you've spent a lot of time in this thread A) talking about your own story, B) saying that some people who didn't like your story are awful and C) Criticizing me as a person by saying I'm incongruous/bragging/dishonest.

I really do appreciate the feedback of the story you're giving me and I hope you continue to do so! I liked your stories, especially Marked for Death, and so I take everything you say seriously. But the rest strikes me as a bit weird, and I hope you can see why.
