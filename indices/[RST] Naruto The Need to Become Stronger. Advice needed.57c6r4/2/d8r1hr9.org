If you post it on spacebattles, never mention the word rational or rationalist, and take any mention of those words off of your website. They're receptive to rational and rationalist ideas and plots, but have an intense hatred for anything explicitly labelled as such. As long as you never actually use the word or do quote anything that would show that you are affiliated with the rationalist tribe, you should be fine.
