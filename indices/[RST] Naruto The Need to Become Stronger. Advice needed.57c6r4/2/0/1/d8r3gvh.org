They don't, entirely, but there's a bad stigma attached because most of the initially-posted rationalist stories were shit, because people tried to use rationality as an excuse to avoid writing well. For most people its not an immediate hatred, but it's sadly become something of a warning sign. This story isn't anywhere near as bad as they were, but it's not good enough that people will overcome their bias.
