I'm not sure. I think it mostly grew out of a hatred of Eliezer Yudkowsky and HPMOR. However, their bias in incredibly strong. They reacted very poorly to Eaglejarl's Team Anko when he posted it, going so far as to invent reasons to dislike it. They interpreted everything in the worst possible light, and were utterly incapable of constructive criticism, or really anything besides flaming and insulting the author.
