It really was amazing how much vitriol I caught for that. Which is a shame, because I had gotten motivated to rewrite it -- polish the writing a bit, improve the ending, etc. That got 86ed pretty fast after the third or fourth page of hate.

So, yes, definitely avoid the words "rational" or "rationalist" on SpaceBattles. More generally though, I would suggest just avoiding SpaceBattles. The community has not impressed me and they've got hair-trigger mods with no sense of humor and no willingness to back down / lose face if they make a mistake. SufficientVelocity.com, on the other hand, has been the exact opposite. We've been over there almost a year now and I've been reading a fair amount of other fic on the site. I've seen mod text exactly once and it was applied very appropriately and minimally -- just a "hey, everyone cool down" instead of banhammers and infraction points.
