I have noticed a different character to the Sufficient Velocity community. I don't think it would have been possible to run Marked for Death on Spacebattles. It would have been overrun. Marked for Death is literally labelled as "A Rational Naruto Quest," and I don't think I've ever seen someone wander in and insult everyone there, which is honestly what I would expect on Spacebattles.
