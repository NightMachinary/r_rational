Going to be very critical because that's generally better than being nice.

My thoughts:

Starting off with the Kyuubi attack-- not a good sign. In general, lots of things are sticking out as meh or pretentious:

"Far above and away from the inferno, facing this most terrible of monsters was Namikaze Minato, hero of the Third Ninja World War and current leader of the Village hidden in the Leaves. Said to be the kind of genius that is born only once a generation, he was known around the world as the Yellow Flash, for blond was his hair and his speed was unmatched."

You're trying to come off as epic or mythic, but it doesn't work. That kind of style is very hard to pull off-- in general, try erring on the side of subdued rather than over the top.

"Well over a thousand ninja were engaged with the daemon, hurling explosives and throwing up barriers to make the beast pay for every inch it advanced into the village, yet advance it did all the same. "

Show, not tell. Why don't you describe what kinds of techniques people are using? Something like:

"Distantly, he saw Akimichi members engage the fox, bodies swelling as they briefly matched the fox's strength and pinned its tails. Another group rushed through handseals, and the ground under the fox softened to mud, trapping its paws. As the last group withdrew, 2 ninja slammed their hands on the ground in unison, and two enormous Rashomon gates slammed down on the beast's head and neck. He felt a brief swell of hope-- and then, with a roar that collapsed buildings around it, the fox broke free. " "To their quarries, it served to send a simple message: The Anbu have come for you. Your future is death."

Your prose is very dramatic. Fiction is not anime. Dramatic lines come off as pretentious, not scary.

"Through the still-burning streets of Konoha walked Namikaze Minato, who was said to be the kind of genius that is born only once a generation. The writing on the back of his white haori was covered in ash and dust, and his features were obscured but for his distinctive blond hair, yet none could have failed to recognize him now: For he was the only one in the village who did not seem to heed the flames, whose thoughts were elsewhere despite the daemon before him, whose eyes looked past the Nine-tails and beyond."

More overly dramatic prose.

"And if the Uchiha are the only ones possessing the Sharingan, then why don't you lift up those bandages and show us that right eye of yours... Danzō?”"

Basically no one in canon except Itachi, Tobi, and Orochimaru knew Danzo had the Sharingan in his right eye. It surprised Shisui when he confronted him, and Shisui was a high-ranked ANBU who had Danzo's confidence. Why would Ibiki know? If he did, why doesn't the Hokage just demand Danzo reveal it?

The entire prologue changes nothing. Almost the same result as canon, with nothing different except a battle scene with Minato, that is, frankly, not too exciting.
