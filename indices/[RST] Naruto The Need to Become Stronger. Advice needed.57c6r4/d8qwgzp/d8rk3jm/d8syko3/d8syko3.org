I hadn't said this yet, but thanks a lot for taking the time to explain what you like about the story! The rational community has a common pitfall where [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/][everyone lines up to say what could be done better, but keep quiet when they are positive]]. Sometimes it's great see a comment that is purely positive, just to be reminded that some people are happy with something as it is, which can provide even more motivation to finish and improve the story.

So again, thank you!
