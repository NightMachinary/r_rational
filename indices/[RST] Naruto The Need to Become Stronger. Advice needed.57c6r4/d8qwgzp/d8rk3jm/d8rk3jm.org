I guess this is a case of Your Mileage May Vary. I actually quite liked the prologue for its style, as well as the fact that Ibiki knew about Danzo's right eye. In a village where the Hyuga lived, I never quite understood how he managed to keep all his enhancements so secret.

The style of the story is, to me, refreshing. The dramatic prose is different from what I'm used to reading on this sub, in a nice way. The lines, dialogue, the descriptions... it gives the distinct impression that I'm reading a Naruto rational fanfic, not just any old rational story. It's unique, and it would be shame for it got away.

As for starting with the Kyubi attack; I think that's pretty much fine , as long as you follow up on the changes to the story we've seen here. The higher ups have known what Danzo's been doing for a while now it seems; the Third has also been alerted to the fact that the Kyubi's attack was not a natural event and, perhaps more important to the next few chapters, the Fourth sealed the Fox into Naruto in secret.

The only way I could really see this prologue disapoint me is if in chapter one we get to see the classic scenario of all the villager's hating Naruto because of the fox. Why would they know? Why would the Third tell people, after the Fourth went through all that trouble?

And also, of course, people know about Danzo, and the Third knows about The Enemy. I'm interested in how you'll show how the village is different from canon, given these changes.
