Well there you go, a nice 18k word drop to round out this arc of the story.

As promised last week I'll be going on a brief hiatus, both to finish moving and also to recover a bit of sanity and plot out what I /sincerely/ hope will be the final leg of this strange adventure.

Thank you so much to everyone who's reading along, everyone who's leaving positive comments, everyone who's leaving /intensely/ sourced Pathfinder rules lawyering, all the spellcheckers, the artists, that one guy who may eventually produce a translation of this whole thing in /russian/... you've taken this from a lark, a first attempt at writing something for the public that I thought wasn't going to go anywhere, and turned it into a passion project for me.

Posts will resume in October, unless I finish a surprise or two to drop on you in the meantime. See you there!
