Hot damn has it been a wild ride! The level of escalation that the arc got to was simply insane; you frickin started this story with a guy and his wife trying to talk down some rando cops and now they're facing down frickin zombie space marines with magical mind dragons! I'll be totally honest with you, if this was the end of the story proper I wouldn't be the least discontent (baring the juicy drop of that metanarrative pre-story super war, that sounds like a hella interesting plot thread). On the other hand, WE GONNA HAVE A PICNIC IN MORDOR WITH DELMUT! Woo! Thanks so much for the story bud. Enjoy your new house, moving is a pain but it's also pretty invigorating changing up your daily routine, at least in my experince.
