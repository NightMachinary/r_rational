(Theoretical) limits to this: Effectively all of the Blues are found in dungeons, limiting the crafters created to 5(assuming 1 escort). (This is stated in story but isn't anecdotally true)

Non-low level Blues are constantly stolen from dungeons by lower level combat parties escorted by a high with stealth, impeding planning and hurting efficiency. This is getting attempted right now in story. This is probably the most wasteful result of the current system, the vast majority of blues are spent upgrading existing people as opposed to creating new ones, even the relatively low levels.

I think the best change to explain the current state would be to change it so that any higher level help with Blues "claim the kill" and prevent anyone else from leveling off it. This would prevent escorts, would explain the focus on combat classes since you need to kill a higher level yourself, but I would expect it to lead to more team builds also. Your "first blue group" would all have the same level caps and general progression so it would be beneficial to plan to kill the next Blue together in the future.
