Blues aren't a limiting factor. Since you're apparently conflating 100 with infinity a NI (actual infinity) number of crafters can be leveled to "infinity (100)" using a single "infinity (100)" level monster.

And every single high (or even medium, going plaque tresholds) level character we've seen in action has demonstrated a detection skill. Most recently Velka about a chapter or 2 ago. Any of them can find a blue if they tried.
