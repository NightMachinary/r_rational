I think it's implied that this is what happened, and that's what the majistraal were- a large scale efficient society that had a good infrastructure for farming blues. They collapsed however long ago, and things haven't recovered yet; those innovations/developments haven't occured. It's said at some point that monsters get stronger with levels faster than humans, to the point that most high-level adventurers who try and raise their cap fail and die.
