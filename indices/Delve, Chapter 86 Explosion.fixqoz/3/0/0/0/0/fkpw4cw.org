Maybe. The way the system is set up does imply a cascade of soft caps, where the adventurer has simply got all skills that synergyze well/are useful/work for their build/have limited utility/make for decent party tricks.

As for "innovations" in leveling crafters, we see the infrastructure in place already. Crafter builds cage, crafter and peers pool money for a guild quest to capture a live monster and keep it subdued, crafter and peers poke the subdued monster for combat contributions points. Crafters make up their expenses by crafting and selling higher level goods.
