There's no interval, you just only gain levels up to the level of the blue you killed. The blue that got killed by his party was level 18, so he gets to level up to level 18, and is capped until he finds a more powerful blue and slays it.

It's why people with powers are so rare, and non-combat classes so dangerous.
