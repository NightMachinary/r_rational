Monsters are stated to scale better and be stronger than equal level humans, so their power and danger increase exponentially. Rain theorizes that they either have unknown advantages or just have better builds.

In addition to that higher level humans seem to be much rarer, so the pool of higher level guards also decreases while you need more and more of them for the same safety. Also you would expect less of them to be able to protect you, higher levels mean they are better at killing 1 target and defending themselves, not others. High levels seem extremely independent in general.
