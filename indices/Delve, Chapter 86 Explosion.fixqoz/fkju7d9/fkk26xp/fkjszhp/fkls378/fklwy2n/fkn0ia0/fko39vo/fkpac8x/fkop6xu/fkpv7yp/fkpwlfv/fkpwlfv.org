You're still basing on the idea that there is an effective unlimited supply of blues. That's not the case according to everything we've been shown.

Across the course of the story we've seen 3 blues: The musk wolf that Rain killed, the diremonk that Val killed, and the thing the Rain led a group kill on in the chemical dungeon.

Ameliah told Val/Rain/Carten that it would take weeks for the blue in the mine to respawn.

The Empire's beacons are all low level because the Empire doesn't want to waste blues on slaves. Their army does not consist entirely of gold-plates because there aren't enough blues to go around.

Blues are rare. It's not possible to have infinite numbers of infinitely-leveled crafters.
