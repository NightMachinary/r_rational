It doesn't matter. Any high level adventurer can go collect a monster 20 levels below them even with no real tools to work with. A hundred crafters can then poke the subdued monster until it dies, and each get 0.001% credit which is enough for the level. Some of those hundred crafters can then make the adventurer a pair of pants or sandals. With the sandals of might and pants of right, and maybe a cage of sleep spell, the adventurer can repeat the process for a higher level monster. Rinse, repeat, until the adventurer and crafters are all gaining level caps from the process.
