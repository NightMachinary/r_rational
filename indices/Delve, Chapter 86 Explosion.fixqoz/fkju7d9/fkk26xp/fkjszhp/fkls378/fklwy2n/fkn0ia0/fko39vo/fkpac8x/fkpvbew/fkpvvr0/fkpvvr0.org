  First monster we saw was a blue outside a dungeon

That's why I said "/almost/ never".

  and powerful detection and tracking skills are common
#+end_quote

Are they? Rain has Detection, who else have we seen with such abilities? I may simply be forgetting them, but I can't think of an example.

  Also the blues are rare where Rain is, not everywhere

Citation needed. Every in-universe evidence says that they are rare everywhere, and the meta is that they are rare because the author clearly wants powers to be relatively rare so that he doesn't have to write a post-scarcity story. He's done a really excellent job of building a magic system that allows for very powerful people, is open to anyone as opposed to only those with the right parents, yet has enough restrictions that magic will be rare and powers will be special. The key element of that is having blues be rare.
