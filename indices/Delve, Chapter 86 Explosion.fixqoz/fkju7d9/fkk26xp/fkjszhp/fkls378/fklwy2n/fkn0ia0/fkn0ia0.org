That non-combat class thing is kind of nonsense . You get together with all your crafting buddies to commission a live capture then you all poke it with sticks until it dies.

Heck, the guild directly benefits from having more high level crafters they'd pay for the commission themselves if gr's too expensive even with everyone pooling their money. They only have to do it once per hroup if they commission a high enough level monster but it enables a cascading effect where higher level crafters can make better gear enabling higher level monsters to be captured.. at that point adventurers would do the job for just the opportunity to buy the improved gear.
