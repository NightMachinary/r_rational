It actually seems like it's not that big a deal any more because of his ring. He did ~3200 damage at a cost of 1500 mp (20%) and 56 health (6%).

A mana-optimal approach using Focus with the same diameter would deal just over twice the damage per mana, so he's still going to run out of mana first. He'd â€˜pay' about 600 health for it, but also deal 35k damage. It's possible he'd need to alternate Refrigerate and Immolate to do this.
