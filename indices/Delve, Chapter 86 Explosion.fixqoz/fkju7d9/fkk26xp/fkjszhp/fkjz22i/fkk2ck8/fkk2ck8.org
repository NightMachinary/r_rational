Has the author ever mentioned what would happen if he just rapidly switched between the two auras at equal power? I mean clearly there's still a difference between the environmental effect and the actual target damage, else IFF wouldn't work. So the damage throughput shouldn't necessarily cancel out even if he switches every second.
