Even if it's just damage through heat and cold it would still essentially cooking and freezing monsters directly for a second or two each. Setting a flash frozen person on fire doesn't heal them.

Though then again the question becomes where does the damage source originate topically. Inside the enemy? On the enemy's skin? If two persons are naked and hugging and one of them is excluded through IFF, how much would either of them be damaged by Immolate or Refrigerate? Would the non-excluded one be protected by being partially enveloped?
