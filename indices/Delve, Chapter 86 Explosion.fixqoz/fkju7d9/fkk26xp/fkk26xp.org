So I know that the physical effects of heat and cold obviously cancel each other out. But what about the raw numerics of heat /damage/ and cold /damage/? If Rain were to switch between the two auras every 1-2 seconds, shouldn't the damage remain the same, but with much less collateral and self harm? At worst he'd also lose the status effect of immolating/slowing his enemies, but that doesn't really matter in situations like the one in this chapter.
