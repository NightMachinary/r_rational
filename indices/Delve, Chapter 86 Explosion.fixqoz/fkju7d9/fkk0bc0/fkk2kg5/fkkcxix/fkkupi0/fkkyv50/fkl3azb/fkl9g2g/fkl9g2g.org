This isn't a pure assumption. You can do some math to see what kinds of numbers are reasonable, both from what we've seen others do, and from how you'd expect the world to look if power scaled that quickly. For instance, take the first point wrt. my Prec lvl29 build, in which Rain moves at something like 10-20 km/s, much better than we've seen from goldplates, and can go over twice that in bursts, while simultaneously shutting down even goldplate spellcasters with Suppression.
