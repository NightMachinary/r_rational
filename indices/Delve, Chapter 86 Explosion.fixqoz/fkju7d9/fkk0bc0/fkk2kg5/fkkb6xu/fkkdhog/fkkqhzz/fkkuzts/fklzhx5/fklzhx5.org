Honestly the only thing I can think of is if Intrinsic Clarity / Magical Synergy doesn't give protection from mana burn.

In that case you could regen 86,500 mana but it'd kill you since you only have 10 'real' clarity.

As a side note, I want to see Rain mess up somebody using mana burn. Essence well dumping 10k mana into somebody who doesn't use mana (like Velika) should do a number on them.
