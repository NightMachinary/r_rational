See the ‘Animus 200% l18' and ‘Animus 100% l18' sheets if you want to check my math.

With Dynamo, Rain's 229 Clarity gets multiplied to 687 (300%) effective by Dynamo. Then Magical Synergy means 25% of this gets added to Focus, which amounts to 171¾ (75%). This is why Rain has more mana than someone who simply split 50-50 into Focus. It would be weird if the logic didn't work in the other direction.

IMO the problem is simply that Magical Synergy is a poorly-designed, overpowered skill. It would make sense at 5% cross coupling or so.
