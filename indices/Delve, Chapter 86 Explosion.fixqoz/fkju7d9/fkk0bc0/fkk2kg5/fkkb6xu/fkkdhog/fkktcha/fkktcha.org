the issue is that Animus can't sustain itself. it definitely would raise rain's top end damage by a massive amount(as far as i know) but how much higher(if at all) would it's damage be compared to Two aura's at once? cuz once Rain can unlock Prismatic Intent, he can run a single aura at max strength with full bonuses from all the modifiers 100% of the time and Winter aura for no lost mana. because don't forget, Rain's #1 advantage since coming to this planet is constantly soaking his brain in mana, letting the "overmana" help him adapt and learn faster.

or if he wants raw damage, two damaging auras simultaneously. he'd be trading massive versatility and sustained fighting strength, for an increase in burst damage that'd taper off much more quickly. and he's allready been established as a city level threat by the watch.
