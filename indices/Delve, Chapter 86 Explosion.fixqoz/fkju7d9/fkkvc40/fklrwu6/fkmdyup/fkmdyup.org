On the one hand, I don't think Rain needs to get a ultra-legendary class because monolithic clarity already has a known legendary upgrade that he's on track for. It's a bit like him becoming a double wizard.

On the other hand, I really wanna see Rain get that *Ultra-Legendary* upgrade. I want to see those stats to GO UP.
