My understanding is that Animus are borderline non functional most of the time because of their crippling lack of mana. I think an Animus aura build would just be terrible. He'd make his already problematic mageburn worse and would have zero mana for things like force ward or other support effects. Hell the mana cost from using Winter would probably overpower its benefit. (I believe that was true for Rain early on despite his dynamo build.)
