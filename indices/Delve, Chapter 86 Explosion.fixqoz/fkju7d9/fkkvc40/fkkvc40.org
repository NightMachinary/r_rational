I think the mine dungeon name was a bit of a hint as far as the world's system is concerned. Remember how the name started as generic, then switched around a bit as people figured out what to call it?

Now, consider the various Empire of <whatever> auras, and the fact that the world has an infamous Emperor. I think we may have an idea what the Emperor's build grew out of.
