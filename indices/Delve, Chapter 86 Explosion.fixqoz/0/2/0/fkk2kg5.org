Yes, Rain has been forced into picking up Offensive Auras due to the lack of a reliable and trustworthy party. That's not the true power of the build, though. It's always been the massive mana regeneration combined with Utility Auras and especially the ability to constantly keep Winter active, even as far back as chapter 15 when it's revealed that's the reason Lavarro let him tag along to the mine. Beacon slaves aren't going to have exactly the same build, because they're kept low level so they have to be very specialized with their few skill points and they aren't allowed to have offensive skills so they can't escape, but the core principles seem very similar.
