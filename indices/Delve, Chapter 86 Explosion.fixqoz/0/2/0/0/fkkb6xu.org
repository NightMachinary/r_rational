I think the bigger part is that he's a Dynamo with monolithic spirit. I know the empire uses monoliths a lot more than other countries, but there's no reason to assume they use /only/ monoliths. This is speculation since we haven't seen the Empire yet, but I think the empire slaves are part of the Worker (noncombat) class instead of Dynamo.

They get a raw boost of 50% better auras immediately, and Dynamo doesn't actually benefit them at all. It gives them more mana, but if they're just using winter or other auras they'll have more than enough mana for that. Force shield slaves also exist, but those would benefit more from int for the mana pool.

Since slaves can do their job arguably better by being a Worker and a Dynamo is a known (if rare) combat risk waiting to happen, they might even intentionally prevent them from being able to follow that build.
