  My understanding is that Animus are borderline non functional most of the time because of their crippling lack of mana.

That's the story explanation, but it's not reflected in the mechanics; Synergy means that an Animus at Rain's level with his stat boosts (+29 to both Focus and Clarity) will have 41,500 mp and regen at 11,500 mp/day. For context, Dynamo Rain has 7,500 mp and regens 22,000 mp/day.

A non-monolith with 50/50 Focus and Clarity would have 9,000 mp but regen only 6,000 mp/day! That's *less* than an Animus! There's an argument to be made as a result of this that the class boost for Animus might only be +100%, rather than +200% for Dynamo, but that still leaves an Animus with 8,000 mp/day regen, still more regen than a non-monolith.

This is already plenty of mana for general use, though it'll take three to four days to regenerate from empty, but then we take into account that Rain still has Winter. With that active, a +200% Animus Rain would regen at 125,000 mp/day, and a +100% Animus Rain wolud regen at 86,500 mp/day. This is plenty to justify wanting the much higher mana caps.
