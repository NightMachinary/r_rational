Well there you go. Either Rain can pump up Arcane Ward to insane percentages so he and his party can withstand the soulstrain of 30k EoWill Focus, or he can explode people's brains with 30k EoWill Focus and there's no saving throw, or it doesn't cause soulstrain and it's completely broken. However it works, Empire of Will seems like the way to go.
