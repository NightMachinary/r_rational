I believe this would fall under the category of Arcane Resistance that has been discussed at certain points in the story; IIRC this was the catchall resistance for any harmful magical effects. Soul-strain caused by a spell would probably count.

I believe it was mentioned as potentially providing resistance to velocity back around the mine-delve chapters.
