There are a few paths/plotlines that I see opening up. For one, the way he's unlocking every skill tree available is reinforcing his "soul", and there was a scene about how the Guard's lie detection didn't work as well on him because of it. I think once he unlocks everything available, it will unlock a special class at the level 25 upgrade point.

Also the scene about how he's speculating about how someone could learn the weapon Katas through practice (without the skills) leads me to believe he'll train to upgrade his staff fighting the old-fashioned way.
