Well, a short burst of an aura has been described as a Nova, which I would assume is the shortest possible use. So rapid switching, at a high intensity, would be pulsing hot-cold-repeat novas.

The issue, I would argue, would be Rain as the epicenter. He would be exposed to extreme heat, then extreme cold, on repeat. He could be exposed to each temperature swing, in full, before the environmental effects of his Auras could normalize.

The only argument I can think of against Rain by-definition taking environmental damage from pulsing opposing novas would be the time it takes to switch auras vs. the time it takes for convection through his 'soul bubble' (area immediately around Rain's body that is unaffected by Aura) and armor shielding.

If he can do it fast enough, sure, hot + cold = room temperature. If 'fast enough' is possible is unlikely / undetermined.
