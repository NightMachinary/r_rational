I don't think so and it's a good question. It would come down to whether the target damage is a direct magical effect or a result of the target's body getting cooked or frozen. Same question for the slowing or burning debuffs that get applied when there's enough damage done by Refrigerate or Immolate respectively in a short time - are they direct magical effects or side-effects of temperature?
