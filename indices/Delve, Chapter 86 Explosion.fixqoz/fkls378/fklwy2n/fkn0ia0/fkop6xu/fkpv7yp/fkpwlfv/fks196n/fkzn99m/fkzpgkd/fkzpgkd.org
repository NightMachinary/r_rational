On changing things, maybe, but then our main character wouldn't have gotten his level cap just for being startled by one and being a momentary meat shield.

I don't know how stealing dungeon monsters works, though I'd imagine the process of pulling the monster out would kill it. Then again, maybe the slimes we see in the sewer are actually escaped dungeon monsters. If it's possible I bet you could farm a dungeon by continually killing off all non blues it spawns and having a servant level into a class specifically built to misdirect blues that may spawn so they can be left alive to level up.
