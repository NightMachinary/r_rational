  What part of 1 monster, 100 crafters do you find so challenging?

As eaglejarl said two posts earlier,

  Blues are almost never found outside of dungeons, and there's a limit on the number of people that can be in a dungeon at a time, meaning you're limited in how many people can be part of the hunting party.

Dungeons seem to have an 8-person limit (which Velika could stretch to 9 but we don't yet know if that ability can be reliably acquired). So one blue gives you up to 7 crafters - if you can get an adventurer overlevelled enough to babysit 7 tourists. At higher levels that's unlikely so the ratio gets way worse (and the risks higher).

You're right that /if/ there's any chance of tracking down a blue outside a dungeon (/and/ there's no limit to the number of people who can "contribute" to a kill enough to count), then you can get your cheap crafter army. We don't yet have word-of-god that one or both assumptions doesn't hold, but the lack of cheap crafter armies around is suggestive.
