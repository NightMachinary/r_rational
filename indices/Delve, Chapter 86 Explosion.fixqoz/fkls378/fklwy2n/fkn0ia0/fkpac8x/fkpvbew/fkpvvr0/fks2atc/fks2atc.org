Velka a couple chapters ago, the guild boss and older Citizen in their fight both used them, guild boss's ex used them in most arcs she's appeared in, Amerys did, who haven't we seen use them that wasn't relying on a permanent party member instead? Only the low level people who are still working on collecting the basic skills for their build.
