  Not particularly rational at first glance (humans get placed in sensory deprivation for 3,000 years but they're still mentally fine when they wake up because of SHONEN FEELINGS AND DETERMINATION)

I don't think it's inherently irrational to accept the premise that people are turned to stone and then survive with their mental faculties intact when they manage to escape thousands of years later. Most rational fiction falls into the category of speculative fiction, and generally more attention is paid to how internally consistent a universe is than how realistic it is. e.g. we're okay with wizards firing magic missiles or conjuring fireballs so long as these adhere to some kind of internal logic (as they do in Harry Potter and many other fantasy stories), even though these things are "impossible" in our own universe.

At first blush, the mechanism by which the protagonist seems to escape his petrification does stray away from this a bit (as the rules surrounding it are somewhat vague, making the idea of an "internal consistency" a bit harder, though it is actually explained a bit later), but again I don't think there's anything inherently irrational about something like "emotions" being a mechanism that can effect things in a fantasy universe, again with the stipulation that these adhere to some kind of internally consistent logic. For a good example, see the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie where the heroes defeat the villain using [[#s][spoiler]], something that in a different context might look like a goofy and sappy cliche, but executed in a way that completely makes sense given what the film has communicated to us about that universe's magic.
