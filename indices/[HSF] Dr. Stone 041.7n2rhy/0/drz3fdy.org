So, this is a manga that I've never heard of before. Not particularly rational at first glance (humans get placed in sensory deprivation for 3,000 years but they're still mentally fine when they wake up because of SHONEN FEELINGS AND DETERMINATION) but there might be some more rationalist exploits later in? Doesn't appear to take itself very seriously... not seeming like my cup of tea personally as far as rational fics go. Is there anyone who has read more of it interested in giving me a reason to read further?
