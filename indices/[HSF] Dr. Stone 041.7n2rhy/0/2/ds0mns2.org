The premise isn't particularly rational, but as with most rationalfics, I take it as sort of a gimme. Aside from that, plots are resolved pretty rationally, and characters' abilities are consistent and follow logically from what they have available to them.

However, I find it helpful to also add one more thing to the "gimme" of the premise: that every person in the manga has the superpower of MAXIMUM COMPETENCE. That is to say, if the thing they're doing is theoretically possible for them to do, then they can do it, ignoring that in real life you get weird variability due to elements people can't control. So they do stuff that is theoretically but not practically possible, but they don't do stuff that's not theoretically possible.

The shonen stuff is really just (fun) window dressing.
