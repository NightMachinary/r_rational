I highly recommend reading this manga, since it's about properly keeping to a scientific mind-set in the face of what appears to be magic and rebuilding civilization from a prehistoric world all the way to the modern day.

The main characters are a little too unbelievable to exist, but considering the difficulty of the challenges they have to handle, Senku's genius can be allowed in the face of making the story better.
