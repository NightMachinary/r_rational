I read everything they've made. How do I keep reading it? Is there a way to have them email me when it updates? There's an RSS feed, but it seems to be for all their manga, and since I don't read all their manga that's not what I need.

Edit: It looks like [[https://www.mangatown.com/manga/dr_stone/][mangatown]] lets me subscribe.
