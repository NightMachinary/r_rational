Ffs, Senkuu thinks there's such a thing as a Bronze ion. Bronze is an alloy. It doesn't contain bronze molecules or anything like that. He also wants to create gunpowder when he has no use for it yet because he doesn't have even half the stuff needed to work metal.

Edit: Also, Taiji is shown multiple times as having lost his legs/arms while petrified. Wtf?
