Lots of pieces in motion now! Just some random thoughts:

- Someone remind what Daoine's deal is again? I know they have powerful Watch members that are bound to a god of some kind, but I forget why. Do they watch over the elves?

- On that note, what relation does the Golden Bloom phasing have with Diabolist? Referring to this: "And just like that, Diabolist kicks up the priority list."

- I don't recall the dragon general being named before, but regardless, General Catastrophe is an awesome name. Although I do have to wonder how his legion maintains morale if he's roasted, killed, and raised two thirds of them? I can't imagine that's standard legion practice either; maybe the Tower (and Black) just doesn't think it's worth the fight by demanding he hold back?

- Also, I would have expected the vampire general to be the necromancy-happy one, but oh well.

- Looks like the order of priority is Laure (Thief and the usurpers), which frees up Orim's legion. Then the 15th and 5th meet up with the 6th (Istrid) and 9th (Sacker) to beat back Summer. And after that they all convene on Liesse to deal with whatever Akua is cooking up. All the while hoping that the Golden Bloom stops... whatever they're doing. And that Procer stays put. And that Daoine either doesn't invade, or that the 4th and 12th under Ranker is enough to keep them back.

Ooooo boy, this is gonna be messy!
