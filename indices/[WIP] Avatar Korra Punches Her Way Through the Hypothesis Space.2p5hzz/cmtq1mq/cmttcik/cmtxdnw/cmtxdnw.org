Bend cylinders, 2 long and thin, these are your wheel carriers. Then bend 4 big short cylinders, these are your wheels, next bend a plate with 2 long holes on side, these are your steering and wheel supports, front hole is wider to make room for steering angles. Put long cylinders in holes, stick short cylinders on ends, secure with small rods where necessary. Push cart, receive cabbages.
