Cutting out Mako and Bolin is probably the right decision. I'm brainstorming for a Korra fanfic right now centered around Kuvira as the Avatar instead of Korra (Aang died early and the Red Lotus accidentally killed the Water Tribe avatar) and the first thing I knew when considering how the AU would work was that Mako and Bolin would not be characters. They really are fundamentally useless compared to how important the characters of ATLA were to the plot. I am going to use the Beifongs though since at least they had some political value between Lin as the police chief and Su as the leader of Zaofu.
