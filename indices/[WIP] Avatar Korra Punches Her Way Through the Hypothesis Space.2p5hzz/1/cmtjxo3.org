Or, /In Which writingathing Absolutely Stops Giving a Shit./

Fuck it. Just fuck it.

I don't even care anymore.

I can't fucking do this. I can't fucking make /Legend of Korra/ work. It's not just bad writing. The pieces of the show are fundamentally /broken/. They can't be fitted together in a way that /works/ as a story. You know what should be done with Mako and Bolin's characters?

Me fucking neither. They are fucking useless. Holy shit, you could literally erase Asami from the entire series and nothing would change, and even /her/ character is more relevant to what happens in the show than those two fuckers.

So fuck them. And fuck everything else about the show that just doesn't fucking work. I'm taking Korra's attitude and just not giving a goddamn /shit/ about any of this fucking stupid mess.

Korra's going to punch her way through the hypothesis space, and I'm going to punch my way through this story.

Is it rational? Who really gives a fuck but the answer is yes sort of maybe. Not your typical rational fic with some fuggin nerd who can't stop lecturing people in authority about how dumb they are because he's been in their world for all of ten fucking minutes and has that shit figured out. No, but this is going to be a story about Korra getting a head on her shoulders. She's half-Draco Malfoy (hpmor verson obvs), half-Hermione (ditto), half George of the fucking jungle. but with a bit of inspiration she's gonna bend the friggin moon i fuggin tell you

Air is the element of science. It just is. That shit's as canon as dementors being death is.

Asami's a physics grad student because I want to see her suffer even more than the writers of the show do. And she's being taught by professor Unalaq spoilers lol because fuck it half of season 2 should've been him teaching Korra stuff.

The dominant theory of bending is that the elements work by manipulating the fundamental elements of phlogiston, elan vital, corpuscles and luminous aether. lol korra ain't standing for that shit.

and in general politics! and intrigue! and factions! and good vs good! and not really taiping revolution! and...and...and motorcycles and puppies and kung fu and stuff!

Shit yeah.

so anyway what do you guys think a rational!Korra fic should need? let's get some discussion going here I WILL EAT YOUR IDEAS AND SHIT OUT FANFIC

oh that reminds me i will like totally pander and shit i don't even care you want korra to use ninjutsu she will be shadow cloning the shit out of everything you want her to make out with asami then she'll make out the shit with asami you want kai ground up into slop and fed to pigs then that's happening to that dumb little fucker WHY IS HE EVEN IN THE SHOW JESUS CHRIST WHO WRITES THIS CRAP

oh

oh right

it's the same people who did /Avatar: The Last Airbender./

well...fuck.
