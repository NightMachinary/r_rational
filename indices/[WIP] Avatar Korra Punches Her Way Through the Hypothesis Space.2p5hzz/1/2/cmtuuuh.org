To save useless characters, give them skills. Korra knows magic. Great.

Give your useless characters knowledge. Physics. Biology. Herbology. Toxicology. Chemistry. Geology. Okay, so you can bend Earth. I'm designing a mining complex. I want you to punch these holes in these orders. You can't affect metal, so we use that as dowsing to find veins and clusters. Okay, so you can bend Air. Suck the nitrogen out of it and stick it in the soil by these plants.

Change the characters, change the world. Your enemy mages should also have science consultants.
