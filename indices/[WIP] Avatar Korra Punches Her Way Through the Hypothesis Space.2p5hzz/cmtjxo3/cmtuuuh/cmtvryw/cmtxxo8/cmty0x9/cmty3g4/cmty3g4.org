Just to take hpmor as an example...daphne greengrass? Neville? None of these characters mattered in Canon. You have a detective type guy and a kind-heart-ed idiot, there's surely /some/ way to use them in a story. (Of course, there's nothing /wrong/ with just writing them out. I'm of the opinion that stories come naturally, like dreams, and you can't force them.)
