The problem with Mako and Bolin is that, like Ron, they really don't have a reason to exist. They're not just useless per se, but they don't have a role in the story and by virtue of their personalities and abilities /shouldn't/ have a role in the story. At some point they just become OCs, and ones forced into the story just to conform to a superficial aspect of the show. If I ever need a pair of minor male characters to do something they'll probably be named Mako and Bolin.
