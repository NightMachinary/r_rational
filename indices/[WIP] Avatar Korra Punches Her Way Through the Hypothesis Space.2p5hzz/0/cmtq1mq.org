Wait. No more "People Whom the Stars Watch" ?

As for my two cents on how to make a rational Avatar-verse, you would have to start at the beginning. The original HP canon makes some modicum of sense, people use magic to communicate, to travel, to build and enchant houses and even make food (house elves count). But every time benders don't use their powers for solving basic problems and situations is a demonstration of irrational behavior.

Lack of rock cars, rock houses and plumbing everywhere in Earth Kingdom, communication towers, and even better roads is failure of rational expectations. Omashu and Ba Sing Se are the two place in all of EK where some of the obvious bending potential is shown, but even then its a small part. And even so how did the Fire Nation plan to take over the EK? Destroying it does't do shit. 2 EK benders can rebuild a town in a day, or even make a deep underground town. Good luck setting it on fire when the enemy can leave whichever way they want. Or defending against attack from the rear.

FN techno advancement makes super sense in this context, but what little technology we see in ATLA is insufficient to deal with overwhelming earthpower of EK, to say nothing of attacking the water tribes while staying in water. Air ships should have been present from the beginning and the sole reason why FN could have killed the entire Air Nomad population.

You could make make a rational LoK story if you go with the idea of benders having too much power in society that depends too much on them. In which case Hiro Sato making technological breakthroughs and working with the Equalist movement is a good idea. This could maybe even works a Good vs Good plot of EQ wanting a better power balance and white lotus working to integrate bending in every faucet of life as a means of making lives of everyone easier and better.

Man I write a lot. Anywho this is all a 5 sec thinking done in terms of rational Avatar, im sure there are lots more things I missed.
