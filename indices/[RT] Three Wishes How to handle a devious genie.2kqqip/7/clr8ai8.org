That's a nice genie strawman you've got there. Be a shame if something were to happen to it...

Like, if someone pointed out:

- that the genie never said he /had/ to grant your wishes, even if every word he said was true. He wanted to play the "genie" game with you and you blew it. Assigning the same rules lawyering attempted here to his opening statement would result in him (/at best/) noping out and you losing all three wishes. How many lives could you have saved with those again?

- or that there is no rational reason to believe that he wouldn't kill you for acting like an autistic, smartass lawyer in front of a being of huge and mysterious powers. That's what /all/ the actual historic writings on genies suggests would happen, after all. Your assumptions should include that information before you go off on some blithering rant.

- or that your assumptions about how logic, syntax, and grammar work when talking to an ancient Arabian demon sealed in a bottle are correct given whatever mystical translations is clearly occurring. Maybe it only listens to the first 31 words of your wish. You don't know that it works with legal statutes as written by teenagers.

- or that its abilities might simply be bound by its own limited (pre-scientific) knowledge, and you just head-crashed the genie and get no wishes at all. You know, like if you tried this shit with the cashier at Walmart when he asks for paper or plastic. No, not that one: she has a degree in law. The other one.

- or that you aren't in a psychotic break, lying on the floor drooling next to the lamp you just found. Because that is much, much more likely a reason for your lamp to act like that.
