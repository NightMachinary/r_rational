Absolutely. And I've escalated the dickishness as I've been further provoked. I think I made myself clear here, though, which is why I didn't pursue it any further.

If I didn't entertain or called someone out rudely for something they didn't do, I will of course apologize. I do not think that my original tone was out of line, either, and it got a very odd response.
