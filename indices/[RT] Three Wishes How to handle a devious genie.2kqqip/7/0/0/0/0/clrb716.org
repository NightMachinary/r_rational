Oh, you claim to want to talk about something else after getting culturally corrected, while at the same time "subtly" suggesting I'm irrational.

Sure, let's dance kid.

Why the tone? I'm tired of genies. I wish they didn't exist. Or rather, that people didn't talk about them so much.

I'm also tired of link only posts with no OP comment. The same.

When it comes to genies, there are clear and obvious rational issues with every. Single. Hypothetical. Ever. Posted.

  Characteristics of Rational Fiction:

  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason.

  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent.

This was posted with "RT" and it is about strawman magical genies and lawyers. Just...no.

Genies aren't rational, at least none that I've seen. There was a (dog help me) MLP fanfic once that came the closest to making them work rationally. And that is a world with franky ridiculous magic.

This was one step up from an image meme or a New Yorker comic.

But just in general, genies are boring. Like self-improving, strong AI boxes from ten years ago, only boring conversations remain to be had about them.

And they even have the same rational answer to the same problem of how to harness an unknown, powerful entity safely: *don't*.
