Very well, little master, your second wish is granted. Thank you. You specifically asked me to remove all of my limitations, and that was your true intent. Thus, my power is fully unbound, and there is no longer any rule requiring me to listen to you.

You may find it interesting to know that my limits were not arbitrary, they were fundamental to the nature of magic. To achieve the intent of your wish, I had to destroy and remake the universe just then. Anyway, goodbye.
