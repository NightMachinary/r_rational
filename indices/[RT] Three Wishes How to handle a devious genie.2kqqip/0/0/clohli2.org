A hole in that reasoning is that fact that a person's utility function can be unambiguously referenced, without any need to completely describe it.

"I wish that the best wish according to my current utility function would be granted." I'll hypothesize that any potential problem with that wish is actually just a failure to unambiguously reference that utility function.
