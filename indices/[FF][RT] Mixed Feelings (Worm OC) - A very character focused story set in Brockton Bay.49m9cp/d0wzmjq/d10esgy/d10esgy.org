  I am having a hard time getting inside the mindset of the Dad.

He was similarly abused by his own father. He does not perceive it as abuse (and neither do Astrid or Lance). Just tough-love child-raising that has made him strong. He's merely reproducing the same pattern (with an extra layer of awfulness because his children must also grow into tools for the Mission). Why wouldn't he? He knows how to do it and he knows it works.

This is how real-life abuse works, unfortunately.

Lance is probably going to grow into the same kind of parent, and Astrid partially so (well, she would've if she hadn't been yanked off that path; now hopefully she'll learn new norms).
