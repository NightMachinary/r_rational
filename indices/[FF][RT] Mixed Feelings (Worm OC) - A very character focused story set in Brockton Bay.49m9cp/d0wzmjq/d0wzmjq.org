I'm writing this as I read, for myself mostly.

This is the most paranoid person I've ever read, awesome. I am enjoying the dramatic irony of the first chapter where we get to see her emotions and her attempts to conceal those emotions from /Gallant/ of all people. I guess she wasn't paranoid enough, if she didn't consider the possibility he was getting a direct line into her brain. Hahahahahaha.

Also, judging by her reaction to the iron, she might counter the hell out of Kaiser.

As a hero, Gallant has encountered abused people before, I would imagine. So, he might plausibly know exactly what is going on.

  Dad's lips thinned, his eyes glinting coldly as he tightened his grip on my shoulders; fingers digging in hard enough to leave bruises.

He's not a very skilled abuser, is he? The author should have said "almost hard enough" in my opinion. As it is, I don't see how he's going to continue to get away with this for longer than one minute. I had been assuming up until this point that he would have to be very smart and skilled at emotional manipulation, but I don't see how he can be smart if he's choosing to leave bruises right now or undisciplined enough to not notice that this would be a mistake. Surely it should be on his radar that the heroes might have found her, right? The possibility of them doing a follow-up seems obvious.

The military references might mean that he works with a foreign government and has access to powers somehow. Otherwise, I don't see any possibility for a realistic protracted conflict here.

A gang, huh? I don't see how that can work unless this gets pretty AU with lots of new capes.

I am having a hard time getting inside the mindset of the Dad. I don't understand people like that. Obviously, but let me be more specific. To me, there is sometimes more power in creation than destruction, because it is harder and thus rarer. A good soldier is not a soldier who is so terrified she can't even think. An effective military unit would communicate frankly, and the free exchange of information would be incentivized rather than penalized. Dad calls her weak, but all the aspects of her weaknesses that I see are of his own making. Is he brain damaged somehow? I think that is true of people like that, literally, but even that still seems inadequate to help me understand him. Even blind people can understand that others see shapes and colors. So why can't psychopaths, adrenaline junkies, and control freaks grok the concept that their ways are not always the best ways to achieve even twisted desires like their own?

Also, fuck Gallant for being so hands off in a situation like this. I choose to blame everything that goes wrong on Gallant, as the only person who is reasonable and understandable enough that I can consider him a human being. Gallant is literally the worst hero ever. Worse than Scion, or Armsmaster even.

  Ignoring Lance completely, I focused all of my attention on the delicious, delicious bacon roll. (Protein, gluten, starch, sugar, fat, salt, various elements and minerals... Wow, gluten was really elastic. I bet it would be fun to play with.)

She would be almost a tenth as scary as Panacea could be, with a differently oriented training, I think. I wonder if she can create simple biological materials. Or a poison of some sort. Knockout gas? It seems her power can't manipulate gases or liquids, but that is potentially different than turning a solid into a gas or liquid. Or she could use mundane means in combination with her powers.

I hope she chokes her father to death. I'm really mad.

  Pain flared in my scalp as my head was jerked backwards. He'd grabbed hold of my ponytail, I realised, and even amidst the fog of fear and fury that shrouded my thoughts, I couldn't help a distant flare of vindication. (I knew long hair was a bad idea in a fight. I fucking knew it.) A sharp blow to the kidneys made my knees buckle, but I loosed my grip on my power, just a little, support lines lashing out ahead to keep me upright. My neck felt like it was about to snap like a twig, but both it and my lines held. Bracing myself, I flicked out a hair-thin cutting wire as I pulled my head as far forward as I could. My scalp burned, but that didn't matter one bit. What did matter was that my hair stretched taut between my scalp and Dad's fingers, giving me space to slice the wire through.

  (Pretty fucking extreme way to get a haircut, I couldn't help thinking, with a certain bleak humour.)

That's badass. She should also consider using her own hair as a weapon. Maybe at some point she'll lop off her own arm and use it as a club.

I wonder if she could make or use magnets somehow. They might give her some kind of limited macrokinesis. Might also help with her electricity block. Then again, her electricity block might apply to magnets instead.

I like the suggestion of one of the commenters to call her father The Thing. His power is like a mix of The Thing and Mr. Fantastic's from the fantastic four, I think. He's basically an immortal rubber rock human shaped object. You could still suffocate him though, I expect. Maybe he wants her to kill him and that's why he is teaching her suffocation techniques? Or he wants her to realize that suffocation techniques would be a useful part of her arsenal.

If I were her, I would be hoarding rare and precious useful metals, hiding them inconspiciously on my person. Can she make things denser?

  “They took your mother from me,” he said, quietly. “I'll be damned if I let them take you, too. No matter what lengths I have to go to to make sure that you can protect yourself.”

Okay, so her mom is probably Purity then? 1. She is blonde and tall. 2. Her daughter's name is Astrid. 3. Racism. 4. Somebody, possibly the Empire, took the mother away from Dad. If so, this would explain why he doesn't want to work with them. I'm not sure if the mother and her Dad ever even had a thing, though, or if he was just a creepy background lurker who somehow stole her daughter.

  I wasn't going to kill those people. Of course I wasn't. I couldn't. More importantly, I wouldn't. It was... It was wrong. They hadn't done anything. They weren't hurting anyone. They were just living their lives, going about their business, trying to do the best they could in this sorry little scabrous shithole of a town. They didn't deserve this. It wasn't their fault that there were people out there that hated them just because of the colour of their skin.

  It wasn't their fault that Dad was a fucking nazi!

Here is an alternative!: Go kill Kaiser right away, instead of doing your Dad's plan.

  Oh God. I was really doing this, wasn't I? I was running. Again.

Take Lance with you! You will regret not taking him so much...........

If I were her, and I joined the Wards, I would shave my head as symbolic protest.

I wonder if her Mom, whoever she is, was actually a totally awful person. Maybe worse than her father. She seems to idolize her mother very much, and it might hurt her a lot to find out the true details.

Gallant's powers would be so awesome to have. Actually understanding people, perfectly empathizing with them. It would suck to experience their negative emotions, sure, but the pragmatic awesomeness would be awesome. Literally perfect social intelligence.

Gallant seems kind of shady to me now for not disclosing to this obviously paranoid girl that he can read her emotions.

Hopefully, she gets to talk with Yamada eventually.

  “If you say so,” Gallant murmured, sounding a little disconcerted. He took a breath. “I was wondering,” he said. “Would you like to meet some of the other Wards? I know at least a couple of them are around at the moment, so I was thinking I could introduce you. I mean, I'd have to check with them first, but I'm pretty sure they'd be interested in meeting a potential new team mate.”

Oh God, is she going to be best friends with Shadow Stalker?
