I don't know if you read .epub or other, similar formats. If you do, the Fanficfare program, available as a [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221][plugin]] for [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] or [[https://fanficfare.appspot.com/][on it's own]] converts many websites' of fanfic into .epub - and it will work for spacebattles or sufficient velocity forums, if the threads have either an index post or are using threadmarks (this story uses threadmarks).
