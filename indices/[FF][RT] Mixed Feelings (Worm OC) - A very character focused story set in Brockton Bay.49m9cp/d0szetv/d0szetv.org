Stumbled across this on [[/r/WormFanfic]], lost an entire afternoon catching up to the most recent chapter, and am shocked it's not more popular. Seriously great writing. Like 9.5/10, and the -.5 is just because /it's not finished yet and I'm impatient./

Fair Warning: Astrid's home life is /brutal and awful/, so if you're particularly sensitive to seeing teenage girls suffer physical and verbal abuse, you might want to sit this one out (as well as Worm fanfiction in general, actually). Seriously, the first arc's tone is not for the faint of heart.

However, Astrid is incredible, and I bet you guys would love her. She's clever, creative, driven, has (and is) struggling to maintain her rationality and morality in the face of strong external pressure to change (her father's a Nazi of some kind). Her powers are also a munchkin's wet dream - and are understandable and predictable within the actual science of chemistry and physics, rules the author seems to have gone into a great deal of effort to get right.

In that regard, character and wordlbuilding is astounding as well. The military-esque protocols and attitudes feel incredibly genuine (which may not mean much from someone with little actual experience/knowledge of military), but the author seems to go out of her way to make sure the features of the setting are actually deep and connected.

Oh, and it has updated with ~10k word chapters every 3 days /or more/ since it started in Feb. No idea if such a pace will be maintainable in the long run, but so far it seems so. And that outpaces just about any other serial fiction I think I've ever read.
