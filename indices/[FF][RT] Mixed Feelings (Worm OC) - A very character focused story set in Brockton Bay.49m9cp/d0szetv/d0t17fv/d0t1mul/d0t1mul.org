I love watching protagonists suffer horribly, and some of my favorite stories of all time are an angst-filled trauma fest. but I /mayyyyybe/ am an outlier in that respect.

Watching how Astrid copes and thinks and works through that suffering, though? Much more palatable than just witnessing it happen. And that's definitely where she begins to really shine as a character.
