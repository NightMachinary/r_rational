This may be just my opinion, but I think it is because people who experience abuse don't, or rather cant see themselves as the logically and obviously stronger.

This can be seen in some examples of parental abuse that go on even into adulthood, or even those situations when males in relationship are abused by females who aren't strong or even big as the males.

Psychology plays a big part in abuse, so I think that's whats going on here.

But to SPOIL the plot a little SPOILERS!!!(Astrid does get angrier and eventually fights back her abusers, either due to realization of her powers, or by shard mental manipulation)SPOILERS OVER!!!
