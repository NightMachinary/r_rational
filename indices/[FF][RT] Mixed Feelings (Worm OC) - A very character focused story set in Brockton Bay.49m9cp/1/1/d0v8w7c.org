I feel like I should read this because it's so well written, but because of that it's just physically unpleasant to read. The things it's describing are uncomfortable and harsh. And it doesn't start off easy, let you get attached and then ramp it up, no you get dropped in right away.

Because of all that, despite it's probably literary worth, I just don't feel like putting myself through that.
