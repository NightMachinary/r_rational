Oh shit. This is brutal. This makes Wildbow look like J.K. flippin Rowling. The protagonist starts in a horrible situation, with no possible escape and no hope for a better future.

The thing is, it's not just very, very intense abuse we're shown. It's vicious. The protagonist's father has years of experience at abusing and manipulating people, and it shows. What we can see is /optimized/ abuse, horrible, relentless, and creative both in the physical and the psychological department.

Seriously, I have caught up to the current last chapter, and I'm feeling awful. This is really well written. I don't think the author is going for Wildbow-style escalation of awfulness, and I think that Astrid's situation will get better. I hope. Please?
