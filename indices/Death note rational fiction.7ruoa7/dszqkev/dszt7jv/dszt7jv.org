You can just change the order of events. Let Light go on his killing spree uncaught for a while. People will still detect that there is a Kira going around mass killing criminals (due to the sudden unnatural rise in death rates among criminals, no matter how accidental they seem), but L would have no idea where he is.

Then enter Misa, who self-proclaims as second Kira and is as incompetent as she is in canon, leading to a race between L and Light to track her down. L wants to catch her so he can figure out the murder method, and then use that knowledge to hunt down the first Kira. Light wants to catch her before anyone else does, because they could publicly announce the murder method and then everyone would hide their real names, forcing Light to either trade half his lifespan for Shinigami eyes or have a useless Death Note.
