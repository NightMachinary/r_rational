Depending on your interpretation of the Note, you could get around the motivation issue by having them die in ways which encrypt the Bitcoin wallet private keys as some other, more mundane action. Say you can get access to the security camera footage of the hours before the guy dies somehow, then use the order in which he does specific things which he would do otherwise to extract the keys from his mind.

Setting up a system like this would probably require cramped handwriting to fit it all on one page, but given that the Note can already process natural language, thinking it can parse conditional statements isn't too insane.
