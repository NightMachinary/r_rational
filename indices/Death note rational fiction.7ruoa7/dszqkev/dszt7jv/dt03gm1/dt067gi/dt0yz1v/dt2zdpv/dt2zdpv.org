this seems more than plausible IMO. Light embedded a secret message to L in an acrostic in the notes he had prisoners write. The ability to manipulate them seems extremely detailed and subtle, and given the 23 day rules you could be controlling their actions for weeks before hand. it should be trivial to get a target to leave funds in an untraceable form you can collect anonymously. hell just have them create a new account with the credentials you specify and leave the money there to be withdrawn at a later date.

also details can be written across more than one page according to the rules. only the name has to be on a single page.
