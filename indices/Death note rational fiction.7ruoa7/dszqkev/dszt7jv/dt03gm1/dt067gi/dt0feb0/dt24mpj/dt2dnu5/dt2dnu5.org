It'd definitely be a rewrite the character, much like HPMOR. Redoing deathnote with Light being identical I don't think is very interesting; he's already pretty smart, and makes some mistakes but this is human. I feel like cannon Light got the treatment he deserved in the original. Any fanfic needs to branch off in a significant way, and making Lights motivation more rational seems like the best way to make it a rationalist fic.

The problem the deathnote poses to an ethical, humanist rationalist is interesting. One of Elizier's big tennents he put in bold letters was THOU SHALT NOT KILL THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH YOU. Killing is taboo as a solution to a problem in his worldivew.

This makes the deathnote troublesome as a tool. Can someone remain ethically centered while killing for utilitarian gain? Is killing - other than self-defense- an acceptable utilitarian act in the right circumstances?

I feel like these questions were ignored entirely in cannon. Light committed 100% to killing people he saw as evil from day 1. He had no qualms, and in time went further into psychopathic megalomania. This makes for an interesting character, but it ignores the moral questions or struggle.

Making Light a more cautious person trying to do good is interesting unexplored territory. He will obviously need to use the deathnote for the story to progress, but these questions can be sources of ethical turmoil in way they weren't in cannon.
