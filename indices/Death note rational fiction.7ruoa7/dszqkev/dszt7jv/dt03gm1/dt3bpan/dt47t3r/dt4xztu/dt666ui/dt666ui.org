that's a good question! It depends on how L comes across the case.

My outline so far has L being hired to take on a case from an influential businessman who is paranoid he is going to be killed. He has noticed a pattern of several of his associates dying in suspicious ways that appear to be accidents. L is intrigued, and starts investigating. His search eventually leads him to what appears to be a global conspiracy involved in a range of killings and consolidating power and money across the globe. But he will, as you suggest, also notice that many of these killings seem to be ethically motivated, and be faced with his own moral dilemma on whether or not it should be opposed.
