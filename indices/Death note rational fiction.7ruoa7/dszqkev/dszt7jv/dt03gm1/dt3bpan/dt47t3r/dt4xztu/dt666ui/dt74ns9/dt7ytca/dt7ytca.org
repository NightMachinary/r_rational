Yes, I think L's primary motivation is boredom/curiosity and drive to win, more than ethics. So there will be a struggle, but with a much more ambiguous morality - Light is killing people for what appear to be pure intentions (at least from a utilitarian perspective), while L is chasing him to enforce the law based on mostly selfish motives. While cannon has Light as a clear villain, I think this ambiguity in who is really doing the right thing is interesting.

As far as how L can make progress, as others in this thread noted any use of the deathnote to accumulate traditional forms of power is traceable to some degree, no matter how careful you are. the best strategy is not to be targeted in the first place, but once they are on you it's mostly a matter of time if they are persistent and smart.

There are also ways to throw more chaos into the mix of course with Misa and other characters. I'm imagining the final part of the story will take a pretty sharp turn and depart from the cannon cat and mouse game in big ways. Assuming I ever get there, of course ;)
