  Have some unethical Bitcoin owners hand over their keys untracably then die of accidents.

  You want to reserve the note for cases where the behavior manipulation is useful, because that's actually its strongest power.

On the other hand, it is also the most traceable power. Remember the hidden rules of the death note that Light discovered via experimentation: the actions that you make the target do must be something that they can do, and have a motive to do. So you can't just write "Do X Untracably": your target will just get a heart attack and die without doing X if they don't know how to do X untracably. At best, you can write "Do X as secretly as possible". But then remember that your targets are usually pretty stupid, since they were stupid enough to commit evil crimes *and get caught*. How well do you really think they can perform task X without being traced?

And even if you get past the traceability issue, there's still the motive issue. You are not a mind reader, and you're often targeting strangers you barely know anything about. (If you target a non-stranger, that's a link to you.) So determining whether someone has a motive to do X can be very difficult depending on what X is. And it seems especially unlikely that they have a motive to do X if X is something like give you all their money, since you are just a random stranger to them. Guess wrong about whether they have a motive and they just get a heart attack and die without doing X.

  Influence major business decisions to manipulate markets you invest in. Set up networks of influence in gangs/dictatorships by having the right people assassinated and cronies put in power. You want to build financial and political power than can be used to do things other than just kill.

This is literally what Higuchi did, and he got caught *fast*. Granted, in his case he had the disadvantage of the note's powers already being known, but the fact that someone is getting rich very quickly though very coincidental deaths is a red flag. You wouldn't get L's attention just yet since you haven't done any mass murders, but this is leaving a trail that he can follow back once you do get his attention.

Also, wouldn't this require murdering *innocent* people? It isn't like there are evil criminals crawling all over the business market. (Okay, there probably are, but most of them are hiding it well, so you wouldn't be able to tell who is innocent.)

  Then use your money and influence to enact humanitarian policies, end wars, encourage investment in science etc.

Are you changing Light's values in addition to making him more rational? Because he doesn't really care about all that. He is a son of a policeman, and so is obsessed with enforcing justice, not utility. He values creating a world without evil much more highly than anything else.

Enacting humanitarian policies and investing in science would increase standards of living, but would it eliminate evil? That's hard to say for sure. Industrialization happened and yet we still have plenty of the same sorts of murderers and rapists as we did back in the stone age. And it certainly won't be as effective as the mass supernatural murder of evil criminals, which would directly eliminate evil criminals as well as terrorize most villains into acting good, or at least more subtly, which greatly decreases the amount of harm they can do since they are constrained by the need to maintain secrecy.

I mean, it is your fanfic, so you can change Light's values so that he no longer wants to mass murder criminals, but then you would lose Misa and L completely. Misa only became second Kira after being inspired by the first, so no Kira = Misa just continues her normal idol life. L only became interested because he wanted to solve the puzzle of the mass murders. So no mass murders = Light's case is utterly boring = L doesn't care. You would end up with a 1 man story of Light doing Light things.
