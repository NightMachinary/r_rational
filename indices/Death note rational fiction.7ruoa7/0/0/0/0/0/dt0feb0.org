I agree with most of your points and they are exactly what would drive the plot.

A few clarifications: yes, I'm changing lights motives to a degree. At the very start, he states he wants to improve the world. I'm starting from there with the rational rewrite. I don't think a smart, rational light would see mass killing criminals as the best way to accomplish improving the world. Its a dumb plan for so many reasons. Terrorizing criminals won't eliminate crime. The best bet is to improve the human condition and invest in sociological study of the root causes of criminality. So from the outset his path is different and more humanist, just like HJPEV. His rise to power consists of the first section of the story.

Secondly, yes financial and political influence is traceable, but without the mass murder no one is looking for it until very late stage. Light will already have money and power through surrogates and aliases by the time L starts on his trail, but he will be able to look back and find the path of bodies as you suggested. This is the detective cat and mouse game, which comprises the second section of the narrative.

The third final section involves some other twists and bringing in more characters to increase the action.

A few other things:

I think the death notes ability to manipulate is stronger than you imply. In the anime he has criminals write specific messages in their own blood before killing themselves. Having someone buy Bitcoin and leave their keys in an anonymous dropbox is easy. There's no question of motive in the show, he makes people do things against their will all the time. Not sure where that is coming from. This power gives him really subtle control and access to tons of sensitive information and resources.

EDIT: I rewatched those scenes to refresh myself. You are right that he was unable to get the criminal to leave a message directly referencing L and Kira, since the prisoner had no knowledge of the events or people mentioned. So the subject can't do something completely outside what they know already. However the pentagram and specific messages with an acrostic embedded through 3 different notes are extremely specific and certainly not something they would have come up with on their own. This makes the limits of the Deathnote's power somewhat fuzzy and likely exploitable.

He would obviously not use this as Higuchi did to personally climb a criminal network. He would use surrogates anonymously, basically offer through an intermediary to help them rise if they stay indebted to him and feed him information and do favors. Then show he can kill people in their way via traditional looking means. They would be both in his debt and aware he could kill them, but have no clues to his identity, probably assuming he's kgb or CIA or some other big crime Lord.

This is one of the things L would eventually pick up on though- kaizer soze like rumors of a criminal overlord running everything behind the scenes. But he'd also note that really nasty crimes, like child trafficking, were getting shut down from the inside very aggressively.

Anyway, I think there's plenty of material for a smart ethical light who doesn't take the path of cannon light at all. The power of the death note is barely explored in cannon imo, he uses it very brute Force when it has so much more potential.
