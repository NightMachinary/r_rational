That's a fair point, though I don't think the change is as severe as you are imagining. The R!Light would retain much of his basic personality and abilities pre-deathnote. He is still ambitious, highly intelligent, and somewhat egotistical. The main things that are changing is that he pursues his goals more rationally, and that extends to how he sets his intermediary goals.

Cannon!Light's goal at the start is to reduce crime and increase justice throughout the world. He decides the way to do this is to kill criminals publicly and make it obviously supernatural.

I don't think a truly rational Light would take this path. He would realize

a) the incidence of killing innocents would be high if basing it merely off publicly available suspects (not even convicts)

b) people aren't very motivated by fear of punishment in a general sense. the existing justice system already threatens to kill people for murder; yet murder occurs. Even if Kira were killing thousands of additional criminals per year, it would barely make a dent in the some 800,000 annual murder rate.

c)acting in this way has a high chance of getting caught, resulting in an inability to act further in the future.

d) as a corollary to c, at some point Kira will die or stop operating. What happens to humanity then? He has not changed human nature or society; just applied a temporary pressure to disincentivize crime. Once that pressure is gone, crime will return to prior levels, or worse. To have a lasting effect, he should aim to change human society and institutions in a permanent way.

So, take essentially the same Light from the start of the series, before becoming a mass murderer-- intelligent, bold, driven by a strong sense of justice, and somewhat egotistical -- and give him better big picture vision and foresight and a more rational approach to the problem, and you have the character I envision.

I don't think a new character is necessary to fill this role; Light's familiarity is still useful for a fanfic.
