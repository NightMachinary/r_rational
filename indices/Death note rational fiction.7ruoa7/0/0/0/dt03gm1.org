Misa is a good wildcard to create chaos for sure.

Thing is I wouldn't even have him killing criminals in a way that indicates a supernatural force. Step one would be use death note to carefully acquire more traditional means of power and influence. Have some unethical Bitcoin owners hand over their keys untracably then die of accidents. Influence major business decisions to manipulate markets you invest in. Set up networks of influence in gangs/dictatorships by having the right people assassinated and cronies put in power. You want to build financial and political power than can be used to do things other than just kill. Killing alone is a limited tool. You want to reserve the note for cases where the behavior manipulation is useful, because that's actually its strongest power. Then use your money and influence to enact humanitarian policies, end wars, encourage investment in science etc.

What L and the international law enforcement orgs would start noticing is this steady consolidation of more traditional power and elimination of people with harmful ideologies on a global scale. The game would be much further along by the time the patterns emerged, and L would be competing with an extremely powerful opponent, his only advantage being his own stealth. I think it would be interesting but the cat and mouse would take a very different form.
