The problem with this is time and resources. I agree about this way being more consistent with an attempt to improve the world, but this requires way too much planification and knowledge about the internal institution he wants to act on. Furthermore, I don't think that money and power is enough to change that much the world. The main reason why the death note was effective is because of the fear of a supernatural punishment. Randomization of the criminals he kills and the hour at which he kills them would cover the tractability problem he had.
