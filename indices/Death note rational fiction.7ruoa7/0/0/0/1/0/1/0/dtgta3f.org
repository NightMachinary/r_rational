  I dont think that using law enforcement will work as cause of death, first of all, i dont think manipulation of other people is within the scope of the Death Notes powers

In cannon several people die of car accidents. This requires the death note to manipulate the events around the target in a pretty far-reaching way, and does impact other people not named. My reading is that so long as the situation is can plausibly occur in the time allowed, it will do so. So if you say "killed in a police raid" with a time of 5 minutes, it's a heart attack. but if you give them 20 days to actually prepare and arrive, and it can plausibly occur based on all the surrounding state of affairs, it will work.

the questions on how to treat immoral and corrupt police and officials is a good one that will take a lot of exploration and create moral gray areas. Good subject matter for the story =)
