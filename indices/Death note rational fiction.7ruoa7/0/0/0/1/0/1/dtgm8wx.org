I dont think that using law enforcement will work as cause of death, first of all, i dont think manipulation of other people is within the scope of the Death Notes powers, since it is already limited to something the death noted person CAN do and otherwise it will result in a heart attack, so it is death noted guy cant magically have a surprise raid unless he orders it himself. Secondly, it is unlikely that all police officers are going to be clean, especially in developing countries, and even in developed countries you have police brutality e.g paris police rape, american police shootings, so iys lokely that criminals would have the police in their pockets, especially the higher ranking ones as they are probably ones who make major decisions like raids and such, also how are immoral police treated, those who get off scott free due to protectionism of police departments,

Another aspect to think about is how you'll treat the corrupt government officials, those who make lawa or regulations that are clearly against the people but they become legal, how will Light handle this?, and this beggars a bigger question, what about corporations, clearly immoral, and try to get away with as much illegal shit as they possibly can, many of them cause a shit ton of second or third hand deaths,e.g. dumping toxoc waste in water sources, harmful emissions, tobacco etc, And also the exploitation of workers etc, How will Light deal with them, there is no single person you can blame, the CEOs, the shareholders, the management,

And then also, what about nations, there are some countries waging wars that have no clear meaning, war on terror?, state sponsored terrorism? But who is to blame for this?, what about the assassinations carried aout by certain intelligence agencies, how will Light judge them?

Theres a lot to think about if you want to dive into criminal organisations
