I don't think that random killing of criminals would have the impact Light expects or even what the anime shows. It would simply drive more crime underground. Fear of punishment doesn't deter crime today, nor did it when most people believed in the supernatural and heaven/hell. I don't believe human society would respond as represented, with "war ending" and "murder reduced by 70%". It's absurdly optimistic.

There are some places where the deathnote would be an extremely effective tool, of course. Osama bin laden could have been killed in a day. Targeting known terrorist leaders and authoritarian dictators could dramatically improve some of the most oppressed parts of the world. And the control the deathnote gives over the manner of the death is extremely powerful and under exploited by Light.

For instance, rather than just killing random criminals and suspects, say he gains information about organizers of sex trafficing rings, and writes their names with "dies of gunshot in surprise police raid on their office, while compiling a list of clientele for blackmail."

Light could use conventional law enforcement to his advantage rather than working against him by subtly manipulating events to weaken organized crime and provide key evidence. This is just one example, of course.
