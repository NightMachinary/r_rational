After reflexion, I think that you are right. But would it still make sense for L to chase Light? The same way saying that killing every criminal in order to improve the world is stupid, chasing someone who genuinely improves the world with a mentality of ''a murder is a murder and murder are wrong no matter how much the ratio benefits/life cost is" sound pretty stupid too.
