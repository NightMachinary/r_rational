This needs a few more constraints. Is this just an otherwise normal non-magical/supernatural world? In general, you're fucked because time travel is super OP.

What alternative goals does the defender and time traveler have here? Just survive? The most reasonable way I can imagine though is if you can somehow hide your identity and location at all time. If the time travel has information, that's all they need to kill you. So the time traveler's antagonist couldn't let his real name/birth certificate or any information about where he is be easy knowledge to obtain.
