Immediate thoughts, setting the interesting 'paradoxes can not exist' stipulation aside for the moment:

So, you've just learned that there's a person with time travel power who's (possibly) hostile towards you.

If you coincidentally already have a rock-solid past that they have no easy way of finding out about, then great! This presumably means that they already have no knowledge of your identifying details (since otherwise they could just go back a day or so to when you were clueless)--KEEP IT THAT WAY. Let them be hostile to you without ever allowing yourself to do anything that would let them gain information about who you are, no matter what.

What if they know who you are already, though? Then the moment they go through time is the moment you lose the initiative completely. Any ability to change the past is the ability to muck about with the world with you none the wiser as to what they want to do to you, since you've only just learned. DON'T LET THEM TIME TRAVEL.

Further 'don't let them time travel' thoughts: fake their future. In a book called 'Paradox', someone assassinated people who could see future memories by planting entire simulated futures into their minds first. Here, act as fast as you can to stop the possible enemy from having a chance to time travel to the past while *also* being prepared to spin a convincing alibi for them that they survived significantly longer. (Points for style if you can plant clues in the future that the person went undercover for a period of time and then popped up as a new identity, except for that other identity to actually be their own person. Failing that, just have them prepared for their own possible future death at a time and place completely different from when you actually strike.) Keep in mind that the normal-chronology police should not be underestimated when it comes to acts against others, depending how much normal-chronology social power (or other power) you can freely wield. Obtaining the ability to time travel for yourself could be helpful.

Paradox-aversion thoughts: As a starting point, consider the possibility that you're effectively already dead--there's a secret poison or other trick already planted inside you that only lacks immediacy for the sake of avoiding paradox. More generally: get an idea of what defines the limits of a paradox. Is this "I actually can't time travel at all, because a few grains of sand would shift and the gravitational waves would influence the particles that would later time travel and that would be a paradox", or is this a special locked-in state that isn't applied to all parts of the timeline consistently?

Keep in mind that even if everything is locked in, trying to change your subjective past through present actions is still reasonable, as with a deterministic-future perspective and Newcomb's problem. "Am I to be a puppet of fate without implanted poison who stops a time traveller who wants to plant it or am I to be a puppet of fate with implanted poison who doesn't even try to stop the time traveller who plants it?". Making your predetermined choices according to your own preferences is how you find out the predetermined shape of the future.

I'm afraid my thoughts about how to deal with a paradox-limited time traveller go straight to "Okay, what exactly are the time traveller's limitations? If I'm the time traveller, what are MY limitations? If I try to muck about with the past, how do I tell which actions violate causality and won't be allowed, and which actions are fine? I can think of lots of actions which obviously violate causality--surely I can think of lots of actions which don't obviously violate causality, but are mutually exclusive and so can have only one set not violate causality? How do I tell the difference, how does it get decided?". Determine /that/ and maybe there's quite a bit more to work with. (Really no easy way out other than the new-timeline resolution...)

Edit: More thoughts, backtracking. No paradoxes means that whatever you're about to do when you time travel already happened. Another way of looking at this is that you can predict what sort of time travel you will do by checking the state of the world--whatever time travel you do will already have left its effects, so it doesn't matter whether you know it or not. Everything suits you because of and to the degree of effort that you put into detecting and time-travel-implementing self-serving modifications in the future. For someone with a hostile time traveller, you could likewise check for actions taken against yourself to check whether the time traveller will successfully act against you, but realistically a time traveller who had the chance to not be defeated by you could already have killed you in the past and dropped off a coded message to their future self that they'd better kill that person to avoid unfortunate consequences. Worried about the original source of information for the time loop? Does the concept even have meaning for a paradox-free world in which the consequences of time travel have already happened? There is no 'there was a problem, so I changed the past, so the past was already changed'. There are only actions in the past which you're going to make anyway, and whatever reasons for your actions in the past you'll be satisfied with making them. If you're the sort of person who's happy acting as your own puppet, maybe you'll have a particularly happy existence. If you're the sort of person who isn't, maybe there won't be that many messages to yourself, or maybe they'll be really convincing ones.

I'm going in circles a bit--time to stop for the moment.
