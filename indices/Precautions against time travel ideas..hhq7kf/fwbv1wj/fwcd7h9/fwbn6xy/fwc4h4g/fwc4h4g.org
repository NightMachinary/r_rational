Paradoxes being impossible means that events have to play out the way they did originally? Assuming the hostile enemy is in the future, falsify information about the present so that they try to act on incorrect information when avoiding paradoxes and thus make mistakes. Also, erase information about yourself so that they can't look you up in the future. Even more cleverly, falsify information (that is in your future and their past) that you want to come true, such that in trying to avoid paradoxes, they make your information become true.

For example, make a memorable false obituary for yourself dated in the far future (or better yet if you have programming/social engineering skills, set it up to be automatically posted at a far future date), so that time travelers will believe you cannot die before that date without causing a paradox. To make it work well, you will also need to ensure that any actual information about your death is erased.
