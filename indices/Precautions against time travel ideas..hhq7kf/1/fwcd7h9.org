How do you defend against a time traveler? Easy mode: the same way you defend against any lone attacker. Hard mode: exhaust their time-travel budget.

First, be hard to find for a while (go on vacation under a fake name, etc.), ideally without letting on that you know you're being hunted.

Then, pop up in an obvious way (register to attend a conference, send out a social media invite "Hey, I'm back!" to all your acquaintances, etc.).

When the enemy seizes the opportunity to go after you, it turns out you got someone else to play your body double. That's when your hidden friends or bodyguards jump out to grab the time assassin. (Make sure your "reappearance" is at an indoor conference or party, so an attacker has to get close to you to grab or shoot.)

To cover up the records in the future, get your friends to report your "death" in the papers, and go underground with a new name from then on.

It's easier if the traveler thinks the future can't be changed, that is, all records they have on you are trustworthy. Then a fake obituary will "force" the traveler to go after you then, since they "know" that's when they kill you.

Hard mode: the enemy may have (a) future technology or (b) information from past tries to kill you.

Now you need decoys. Body doubles, fake sightings, changed vacation plans, whatever. Get the enemy to waste attempts, waste lots of attempts. Get them to go after you in several different times and places, each time discovering you're not there, so that you can get an idea of their capabilities.

Because your best weapon against a time traveler... is their budget.

Time travel's expensive. Run down their budget.

No, really. You know time travel is hard. How do you know this? Because your world isn't already overrun with time travelers and poorly-explained jumps in technology.

So the traveler probably doesn't get that many attempts, nor to bring in that much future technology.

Ironically, this means your ideal strategy against a time traveler is to /run out the clock./

You just need clues what their particular limited clock is: tries to kill you, time spent in the past, amount of technology used.

Oh, you think they get infinite loops? Sure, that's a good movie. But rationally, your world doesn't look like a world where people time travel an infinite number of times, does it? So: run out the enemy's budget.

Now, there is another great weapon against a time traveler...

The other time travelers.

Did you think there was only one? That makes no sense. No technology has ever had only one user. So you can probably find traces of other travelers and make contact.

The only way there could be only one time traveler is if, somehow, you're super-duper important, and so the time-travel budget for your historical period is all being assigned to you.

But if you're that important, then you're worth negotiating with, not just senselessly attacking.

Either way, if someone is spending their time-travel opportunity on attacking you, you can pretty much guarantee that the person attacking you isn't the brains of the time travel operation.

Think about it. Suppose you had the chance to change 1930. How dumb would you have to be to put "shoot Hitler" as the /only/ change you tried to make? Pretty dumb, or at least pretty subordinate - either way, not the true authority.

Anyone who can work around paradox enough to kill you should be able to work around paradox enough to do better things than kill you.

So - set up body doubles. Run down the enemy budget. Try to provoke the idiot time traveler into talking about just why they want to hurt you.

And then set up negotiations - with the real bosses, who aren't the idiot that's after you.
