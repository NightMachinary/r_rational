Look up your future obituary. Looking at the future causes events to lock. Then plan to fake your death if your funeral is going to be too early.

I guess this presupposes that hostility means death. Instead dedicate a fair amount of money to a data time capsule that you log in acts of major aggression, retrieve it from a point sufficiently far in the future, and avoid the listed event, falsifying it for your future self to watch out for. With any luck you'll ensure a stable timeloop where you warn yourself of events that you never actually suffer through.

Fight foresight with foresight.
