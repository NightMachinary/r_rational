I assumed the "no paradoxes" mean they can't change the the past, thus you just need to protect your information going forward, your birth certificate isn't that big a liability because they can't go back and kill you as a baby. You would still probably want to destroy it and the government records so they can't use it to track you going forward but it isn't an instant game over like it would be if paradoxes were possible.
