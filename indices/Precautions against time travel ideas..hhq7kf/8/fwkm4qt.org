Exactly what does it mean, that no paradoxes can exist?

Does that mean that:

- It is not possible to change the past
- It is possible to change the past, but not so much that it has much of an effect on the present
- It is possible to change the past, but not so much that it prevents you from being born and deciding to attempt those same changes to the past?

In the first case, you're (mostly) okay. You can't stop the time traveller from coming back and doing what he always would have done; defend yourself as against any lone attacker. (/He/ can't stop himself, either).

In the second case, your best defense is to publish (after the fact) every last thing you found out about time travel from this guy. That means that, by merely /revealing/ himself to you, he's triggering a long-lasting change in the timeline... so he can't reveal himself to you. Thus, he can't attack you in any way that allows you to figure out that you are being attacked by a time traveller.

The third case is a bit more tricky, because he /can/ make changes - he just can't retroactively prevent his own existence, and he probably /does/ have access to news footage of the time in question, which gives him a powerful informational advantage. This can be turned against him, if you can find some non-obvious way to base your future actions on his present actions (or his present location) - as he moves about, he will see the futures change and with no clear reason /why/. This will disorientate him, and hopefully allow you to achieve your aim(s) before he sorts it out.
