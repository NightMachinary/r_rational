Reading that one fucked me up. I was not OK for several days.

Also, any Ted Chiang thread should point out that last year's film /Arrival/ was an adapting of his short story "Story of Your Life."

Basically everything he does is quality, but my personal top 5 would be:

- The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate

- Exhalation

- The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling

- Seventy-Two Letters

- Hell is the Absence of God
