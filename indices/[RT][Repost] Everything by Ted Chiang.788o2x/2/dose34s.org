Absolutely amazing author! Pretty much all his works are short stories that are /very/ well written. My favorites:

- Story of Your Life. (Goes without saying, that story was incredible)
- Tower of Babylon
- The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate
- The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling

If you haven't heard of him before, definitely give his works a shot. His many Hugo, Nebula, and Locust awards are very well-deserved.
