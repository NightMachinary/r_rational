*Rain should've chosen Worker instead of Dynamo*. He gives up the tripled base mana regen and the ability to get XP from combat, but gains a 50% boost to Purify, Winter, Detection, Velocity, Essence Well, and all Aura Metamagic and Magical Utility skills.

While running Winter on himself, he would have much higher mana regen than as a Dynamo, and there would be a whole host of other advantages.

- Winter would get a 50% boost to its effects, going +150% (from +100%) and increasing its base range to 15m (from 10m).\\
- Combined with the improved Extend, it would reach 30m (vs. 20m).\\
- Aura Synergy would be acting on the same number of aura ranks but has a greater effect, (2.2x instead of 1.8x), bringing us to 330%@66m (vs. 180%@36m).\\
- Amplify is boosted: 825%@66m (vs. 360%@36m),
- as is Channel Mastery, for 2062.5%@66m (vs. 720%@36m).\\
- Aura Compression is boosted twice, from the increased range and the increased bonus per meter, bringing us to 6146.25%@0m (vs. 1238.4%@0m)

Overall, he has given up 3x mana regen from Dynamo and gained 5x mana regen from Winter with increased metamagic.

If he chooses to use Aura Focus for a Singularity, then things start getting silly.

- Start from the Channel Mastery calculation for 2062.5%@66m (vs. 720%@36m).
- Aura Focus is 4x instead of x3, which gives us 8250%@264m (vs. 2160%@108m)
- Aura compression is doubly boosted, which gives us 73590%@0m (vs. 6825.6%@0m)

Furthermore, Intrinsic Clarity is a x4 bonus instead of x3, and Intrinsic Focus and Cross Coupling are similarly boosted. Immolate and Refrigerate only directly benefit from the increased metamagic, but Aura Synergy being 2.2x instead of 1.8x is a 22% boost to damage and range regardless.

--------------

*TL;DR*: Rain has a synergy-build, not a mana-regen build. He would've been better served by taking a 1.5x boost that stacks half a dozen times to almost everything rather than a 3x boost that applies once to one thing.
