With Winter 1 and Intrinsic Clarity 2 (which is what he had when he chose a class), he would be gaining 0.40x as much mana as a Dynamo. I'm not sure how significant that is, especially given the lower XP requirements of non-rare classes.

Leveling Winter is capped by the number of hours in a day, but IC isn't.
