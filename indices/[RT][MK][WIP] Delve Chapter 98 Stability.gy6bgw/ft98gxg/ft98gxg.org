Prediction: The Artifact runs on something like a programming language, which nobody else in this setting has had any experience with. This lack of familiarity is part (but not all) of the reason why using the artifact is so difficult. Rain attempted to get a degree in video game design (or something like that) so he should have some understanding of coding.

That, combined with his overmana boost to learning, will let him learn enough of the programming language to use the artifact. There will also be one (1) to three (3) other complications making this process a bit more difficult.
