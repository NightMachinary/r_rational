  I wonder what % of the dome's mana came from Rain himself, not counting winter? He presumably produces more than 8 focus mages combined, but I wonder how he compares to non-mages. He could very well hold up the barrier himself.

Rain might produce as much mana as the rest of the Awakened in the town, even excluding his effect on others via Winter.

Compared to a Mage with balanced stats, he has double the clarity and 3x the regen per point of clarity. This is an x6 multiplier.

If he keeps up Winter (13.38x mana regen) half of the day, it would be another x7 multiplier to the mana he generates in any given day, bringing him to 42 mage-equivalents of mana regen. (Winter Singularity gives him 70x mana regen, bringing him to 420 mage-equivalents if he uses it 24/7).

I'm assuming that most of the mages have Intrinsic Clarity, Intrinsic Focus, and Cross Coupling. This would be a more effective boost to them than to Rain because they would get +25 Clarity compared to Rain's +2.5, but they likely don't all have it, or aren't all fully-leveled, so I'm saying it's a wash.

Warriors have essentially zero mana regen compared to Mages. They have 1/10 the Clarity and 1/3 the regen per point (due to lacking Intrinsic Clarity), giving them 1/30 Mage-equivalent mana regen.

Are there 21 Mages and 630 Fighters around level 18 left in the town after the big fight?
