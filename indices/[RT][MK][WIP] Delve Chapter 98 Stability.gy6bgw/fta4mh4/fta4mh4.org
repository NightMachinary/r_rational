I wonder what % of the dome's mana came from Rain himself, not counting winter? He presumably produces more than 8 focus mages combined, but I wonder how he compares to non-mages. He could very well hold up the barrier himself.

We don't really have much information about how the dome's mana works do we? It announced and drained at the start but doesn't seem to have been draining anything since, even when the Empire was trying to crack it. For all we know it could be single use, is now discharging, and is at an unknown percentage.

Also Rain may be able to drain the barrier using mana manipulation or area damage.
