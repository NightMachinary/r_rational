Did Val just yeet himself out a SIX story building?! He's just turning into a Link clone in my head the more he shows up. Goddammit, he's the hero we all expected, but not the one we got. On that note, Carten is turning into a beanbag with a face painted on at this point. Poor guy.

I think I've been reading way too much Brandon Sanderson because I was starting to get excited at the thought of rich people intrigue and scandal. I may need to recalibrate my expectations here.
