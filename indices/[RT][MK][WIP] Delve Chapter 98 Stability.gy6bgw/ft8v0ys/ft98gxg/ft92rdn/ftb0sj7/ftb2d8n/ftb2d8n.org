There's just one issue. The text for the Worker Class says:

#+begin_quote
  *Worker* (+)

  Common

  Requirement: None

  Effect: 50% boost to non-combat skills

  *Warning*: Experience may no longer be gained through combat
#+end_quote

Meaning that the 50% boost is only meant for /crafting/ trees. So it wouldn't apply to Offensive Auras, Defensive Auras, or Aura Metamagic trees at all.

There could be an argument that it can apply to Utility Auras and/or Magical Utility but they are support for other combatants or improves the user's mana.

So while Worker is better for Rain's build by the numbers; in practice, it's very doubtful that any of the skills would be considered non-combatant.

EDIT: Oh wait, you explicitly only talked about the Utility Auras, metamagics, and Magical Utility. So you were already aware.
