Did Mlem try to use his special skipper plates or whatever they were called already? That is still one way Rain might skip out of the barrier without actually bringing it down. also I don't think he has six weeks. Velika is probably willing to try killing everyone else to escape. But she would need time for the mana to drain out.

once out of the barrier though I feel like with what has to be a rank shift happening, that will play a role in what Rain has to deal with. Maybe leading to his next blue kill?

I am pretty interested in what will happen when he gets another chance to meditate and reach into the chaos he caught a glimpse of.
