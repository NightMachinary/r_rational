I doubt Velika would kill everybody. She's pretty insane but she looks to be really out of it, there's really no point in killing everyone. If she does do that and is the only one that escapes, every faction is going to scapegoat her. She's the DKE representative that took over a Watch city and slaughtered a bunch of guildies and Watch members. They'd definitely kill her, and the DKE was already plotting to sacrifice her as the Sadanis rep anyways, so they'd likely kill her too. The only real concern is the food problem and rising temperatures, Velika is most likely going to be passive.

I really do wonder what's going to happen from here. Is Rain going to discover something from his meditation or from whatever's going to happen to Dozer, or is he going to find a higher level blue? I'm curious to see how the barrier is going to be handled, since there appears to be a powerful guardian and difficult to even turn off.
