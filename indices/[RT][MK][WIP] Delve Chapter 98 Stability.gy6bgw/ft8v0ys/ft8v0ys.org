You kinda gotta feel for Velika. She's an asshole, but Westbridge really did fuck her over.

Well this neatly narrows the plot down. Rain has 6 weeks to figure out how his soul works and turn off the barrier. I just wonder how many chapters it's going to end up taking.

The possible interesting developments are what Ameliah is doing, where that empire army went and what Val is up to. Fairly sure we'll get enough plot development for there to still be some major objective even after the barrier is down, so something's gotta happen other than Rain just meditating all day.
