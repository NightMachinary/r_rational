I get what you're saying, but the resemblance to blaxploitation films was entirely intentional on the creators' part. It wasn't just a matter of adapting the comic books, they specifically chose to homage the genre while also modernizing it in some ways. People smarter than me about this have pointed out that Luke is kind of conservative and isn't meant to be a representation of all black people, saying as much himself in the show.

I would even argue that the story is more about living in an crime-ridden neighborhood than race relations. I don't think you're wrong, the show certainly doesn't advance the conversation about race in the US, but I also think the creators did exactly what they intended to do without screwing up the theme of the story.
