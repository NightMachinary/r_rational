It's not that you have a cultural blind spot, or at least not one that should be relevant today - I think Luke Cage has unintentionally ended up as a revival of 70's-80's era views on race and racism in America since it has its roots in the blaxploitation genre that was popular when the character was invented.

I'm no expert on race relations in America aside from just being black, but to me it feels like Luke Cage's cultural weirdness is down to the fact that it portrays a caricature of Harlem/Black America rather than anything resembling actuality. It feels mostly like it was constructed based on the "Black History Month" view of black people in American history than anything else.

It's an unfortunate truth that for all that black Americans have contributed quite a lot to the cultural history of the country, they simply haven't been significantly involved in the development of most modern economic, scientific, or governmental institutions. Acknowledging that fact would be politically problematic since the obvious conclusion is that this fact is a consequence of a continuing history of systematic racism in America, and so social studies classes in America instead seek to present an alternate version of history wherein black people really are and have been important in the country's institutional development.

As a result, every February, teachers try and convince students that Crispus Attucks being in the wrong place at the wrong time was as important a part of our country's founding as if there had been black people in the Continental Congress. They teach that George Washington Carver was a genius on par with Leonardo da Vinci because he did a lot of things with peanuts, and that Martin Luther King was basically a saint while Malcolm X was basically Osama bin Laden.

Mostly this is meant well, meant to both make it clear to white kids that black people have played an important part in developing the country and provide black kids with examples to aspire too.

Unfortunately, since people live outside of the Black History month social studies classroom for most of their lives, they have to reconcile two disparate sets of facts. Black History Month paints a picture of history where there were politically active, educated, and wealthy black people all the way through the country's history. Day to Day Life shows that black people massively underachieve on academic and economic measures, and are far more likely to end up committing (or at least being changed and convicted with) crimes than the majority white populace.

As a result, there's a particular view of black history that's waxed and waned over time, but was strong and informed the formation of the blaxploitation genre in the 1970s of which Luke Cage is probably the most prominent comic book example. Summarized roughly "Sure, the institutional racism of the past provided a massive disadvantage to black people - but as the examples I've been given show, it's always been possible for black people to be successful. Now, we live in the promised age of freedom and equality for all, so black people's failure to be successful is just down to them still feeling psychologically oppressed even if it's not true anymore."

Luke Cage is weird because the dialog about race relations in America has mostly moved to a discussion on implicit bias and how the structural aftereffects of institutionally sanctioned racism continue to affect black communities, but Luke Cage appears to be written from the earlier viewpoint.

Cottonmouth and Mariah have really weird conversations about how their ancestors would feel about what they're doing (Supporting the view that racism is over and they're squandering the opportunities of their freedom by continuing to engage in criminal activity)

Detective Knight is "one of the Good Ones" - black people who come out of the same environment as the "Bad Ones" but make role models of themselves, like the Black History Month examples. This is the purpose of her scene at the basketball court - establishing her character history. It supports the narrative that it's really a matter of personal characteristics that distinguishes life outcomes.

Luke himself is similar, and his character arc is largely one of him becoming "one of the Good Ones". We start out knowing that he has a criminal past and a lowly occupation as a paid under-the-table janitor/dishwasher, but over time find out that he's well read (in the canon of black authors who wrote culturally significant pieces in reaction to the racism of the day) while his foil Cottonmouth's most prominent cultural symbol is his portrait of Notorious B.I.G.

Luke calls Crispus Attucks "one of our greatest" heroes and objects to one of Cottonmouth's thugs calling him nigga more strongly than that thug /pointing a gun at him/, and again laments how black people are just throwing their opportunities away. And then we get a scene where Luke and Cottonmouth make dueling speeches and symbolically present the people of Harlem a choice between their reactions to the circumstances they find themselves in. Cottonmouth speech is all about seizing personal power by any means necessary and Luke's is about how really they just need to fix themselves up before worrying about getting involved in the outside world.

After the backlash against blaxsploitation films in the late 70's, these ideas faded and haven't really been relevant to race relations in America for decades, but Luke Cage has failed to adapt its narrative and the characters end up doing weird things that I can only explain as being in support of a race relations narrative that might have resonated 40 years ago but falls completely flat today.
