I got that feeling from Luke, but I just assumed that was because he was too stoic for me to read him since everyone seemed to love him. The characters where it really bothered me were the villains. I couldn't process how Cottonmouth could be both a psychotic mobster and a pillar of the community, and be seen that way by both himself and much of Harlem, while Mariah said she hated being involved in his crimes but still willingly supported him at risk to herself. Even with their backstory, I just didn't get it.
