Both of those things made sense to me (although there were a number of things in the show that didn't.)

Most criminals aren't sociopaths. Most arms dealers view themselves as semi-legitimate businessmen; most murderers see themselves as having a legitimate grievance, of having been /driven/ to kill by an unfair world. Most mobsters don't see anything wrong with what they do. There's nothing really stopping them from playing the respectability game and owning nightclubs.

Mariah lent her cousin some money. She viewed it as a major favor to him, even though IIRC she was making money on the deal. It /was/ a major favor; it allowed him to make a major deal, but exposed her to a small-to-moderate amount of risk. I'm pretty sure she disliked being involved in crime because it was risky, which is pretty reasonable - it /is/ risky. But the normal reasons for doing someone a major favor apply - they'll hopefully repay it, it strengthens your relationship, and you altruistically get to help someone you (presumably) like and care about.
