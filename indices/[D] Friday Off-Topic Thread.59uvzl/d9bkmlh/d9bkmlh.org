Luke Cage is my least favorite of Marvel's tv shows so far, but that's probably because the culture it's representing is completely alien to me. I still enjoyed watching it, but I didn't understand the mindset of any of the characters so I couldn't get past how irrational they all were. It's possible that I'm freaking out over nothing, this has happened before with popular stories and I blamed my autism, but I loved the other Marvel Netflix shows so I'm blaming it on how white I am. Is there a way for a middle class liberal white man like me to fill in this cultural blind spot I have?
