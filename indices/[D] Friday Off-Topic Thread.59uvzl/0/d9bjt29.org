A few nights ago, I had a dream where I was a vampire. I went to a meeting of vampires where it turned out that Peter Singer was a vampire. Singer explained to an auditorium full of other vampires why vampirism was ethical and moral on utilitarian grounds, and then he fought a magical duel with a witch using his magic powers, which he won. Then he flew away.

I don't even know. This is your mind on Unsong, I guess?
