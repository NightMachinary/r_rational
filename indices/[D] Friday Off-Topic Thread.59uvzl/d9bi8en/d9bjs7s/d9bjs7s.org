A friend of mine got great results teaching himself a new language by watching children's news programs online (after having the basics down through more conventional methods). Which makes sense to me - they'll use a relatively simple vocabulary and enunciate things clearly, but it's about actual things which will usually be more interesting to an adult than children's literature.
