I'm currently studying German. Are there german rationalist with whom I can connect? Any show/book/fanfiction you recommend watching?

More in general, I've tried using Duolingo, Babbel and Bliubliu. Everyone has a different approach, but no one feels complete. Do you have tips on how learning a language effectively? English is my second language, and I feel fairly confident in it, but I reached this state by watching/reading everything in english in the past years.
