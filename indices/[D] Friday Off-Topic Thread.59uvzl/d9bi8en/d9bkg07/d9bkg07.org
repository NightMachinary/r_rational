I'm a german native speaker. But I can't really give any recommendations for german media because in order to learn english better I'm also using your way of immersion in the other language and only consume english media.

edit: I used to read a lot of fantasy books and one of the better writers is also a german native speaker. Hohlbein (hollow leg translated). Can't say from memory how rationalist the stories are but they might be a bit much for language learning.
