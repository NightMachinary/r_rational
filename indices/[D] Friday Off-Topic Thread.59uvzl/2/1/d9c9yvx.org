I only did a few minutes of googling for my own interests and therefore can't be trusted, but here's my best answers to your questions:

The common ancestor seems to have lived over 5,000 years ago, so with ~25 years per generation (arbitrary age of mother when she gives birth) that's 5,000/25 = ~200 generations as an upper-bound. Of course there's no way that anyone actually had 200 generations without any siblings. However, I found that ~20% of the population nowadays are an only child which is a contrast to several decades ago which were ~10%. So pick the number of generations you are interested in (5 here as an example), and I'll just go with 15% as an average. That means 0.15^{5} = 0.0000759375% of the population who have a N value of 5.

No idea.

The thing you have to notice is that while low N implies inbreeding, it takes very, /very/ few generations to counteract it because with every stranger a family breeds with, it 'dilutes' the gene pool by half under ideal conditions. To me, it seems to imply that once a family gets past some low N value of like 3 or 4, all Ns are essentially equivalent and a value of 5 is the same as 100.

  greatest N?

That person would probably be Chinese due to China's one-child only policy.
