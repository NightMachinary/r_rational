As I understand [[/u/LiteralHeadCannon]], N-value is equal to the number of generations that an individual can go back without having any repeated ancestors, not the number of generations that a person could go back before they're related to everyone in the world.

So our hypothetical pure European wouldn't share any ancestors with a pure Asian, but that doesn't affect his N-value because he would have "repeated" ancestors at some point.
