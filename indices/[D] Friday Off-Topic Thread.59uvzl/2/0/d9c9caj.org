The most generations you could possibly go back without any common ancestors would be ~30, because 2^{30} is approximately a billion, which was the world population for a long time. That's the absolute upper bound. That equates to something like 600 years depending on how long you think a generation is, which is (naturally) much closer to us in time than [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_Eve][Mitochondrial Eve]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Adam][Y-chromosomal Adam]].

If you have a village with a population of about Dunbar's number, its population probably falls between 2^{7} and 2^{8} ... but the size of an individual generation is maybe a third the size of our population, so maybe more like 2^{5} or 2^{6} as an extreme. More likely, the average N in a village of ~200 people is going to be between 2 and 4.

The biggest thing that N value measures is probably mobility of ancestors, which might act as a proxy for a lot of things which aren't necessarily genetic. You'd expect a higher average N value in multicultural societies; if the average Jewish person has an N value of X and the average African-American has an N value Y, you would expect the average Jewish/African-American union to have an N value of the lesser of X and Y, plus 1.

But /historically/ you would have seen very low N values at the highest social circles; if you're a princess, the pool of people you can marry and have children with is in the double digits.

(My N value is 5, as my grandparents were first cousins.)
