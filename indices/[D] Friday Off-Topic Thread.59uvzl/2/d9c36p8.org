Let's say every sexually reproducing organism has a value "N". This value N is the maximum number of generations you can go back and have no ancestors repeated. For example, someone with parents who are siblings has an N value of one, and someone with parents who are first cousins has an N value of two. The fact that there's a single common ancestor of all life indicates that everything has a finite N value.

Some possible discussion questions:

- What is the average N value of living humans?
- How does average N value vary between demographics like ethnicities, nationalities, and social classes? How about between species?
- Does N value correlate with good things like intelligence and health among humans? Clearly the lowest N values correlate with very bad intelligence, health, and so on, but is the reverse true for the highest N values?
- What is likely the greatest N value of any living human? Obviously genealogy isn't good enough to get this as an actual example; I'm talking about estimates, here. How might this compare to the greatest N value of any other living creature? Do highly numerous creatures like flies have greater average N values, or greater variance, or both?
