On my phone at the moment so no links, but IIRC inbreeding depression is important for humans only at second cousins and closer. And at second cousins it's very low. Even first cousins are pretty safe in terms of birth defects-- it does seem to lower IQ a bit though.

Then there's out breeding depression. It doesn't seem to happen to people (though it'd be difficult and controversial to test) because different races/groups are not divergent enough, but people and chimps obviously wouldn't have very fit offspring. So there's some upper limit at which point divergent mates are not a good idea.

There may be a degree of hybrid vigor in mixed race offspring in people or hybrid depression but of there is its very subtle because no one has noticed it until now.
