Weekly update on [[/u/ketura][ketura]]'s rational Pokemon game. He's not able to write this one up today thanks to the failings of technology, so he asked me to fill in. I'm afraid I'm not in a position to make an update as comprehensive as ketura's accustomed to making, but there are still things to talk about. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing][You can find the discussion links and previous weekly updates here.]]

According to ketura, he's spent this past week working on the underlying hex grid and tracking of entities on said grid. Right now his goal is to be able to have the player run around and walk into things, which is always harder than it sounds.

The biggest development on the theory-crafting side of things is the creation of our [[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B0LYycfi-K18bUpWUWw3T180SFU][Story Bible]]. It's only got a few pages now, but over time we'll record the many pieces of lore and worldbuilding here. It's open to editing, so if you have an idea you think would fit in the world, by all means go and make an entry for it or leave a note in the 'unfinished ideas' page.

We also discussed a lot about the nature of Pokeballs and TMs. Right now, our running idea is that the technology for storing Pokemon has been around for a very long time, but in the form of large basketball-sized orbs that you'd more likely keep in your living room in case of threats than lug around on a journey. It was then only in the last century or so that people started improving the Pokeball and making journeys more than a rite of passage to find yourself a single partner Pokemon. In modern times, the Indigo League has its own subsidized line of 'generic' Pokeballs (the canonical Pokeball, Great Ball, etc.) which are sold at Pokemon Centers, while you can find more specialized Pokeballs in shops all around town. There are plenty of traits to care about with Pokeballs, from their mass limit to how long they'll lock on to the targeted Pokemon to the failsafes if it gets damaged, so there will be a large amount of variety in your selection.

For TMs, we've mainly eschewed the idea of TMs being software-defined modifications on the biological structure of the Pokemon, since that opened technological doors in-universe we decided shouldn't be open just yet. Instead, the purpose of a TM is to induce a micro-evolution in the Pokemon to give it an organ it normally doesn't have. So to give your Rhydon Flamethrower, you'd take cells from the oil gland of a Charizard, mix them with some Rhydon cells and some Fire Stone dust in a special formula, and then give the formula to the Pokemon. This isn't something you can do yourself without disastrous results, but for large amounts of money you could commission the creation of new TMs that don't already exist.

Lastly (as far as I remember), we talked about the distinction between Ghost and Dark type Pokemon. Specifically, if Ghost types live in the distortion world, how exactly are Ghost type attacks different from raw distortion? Our current idea is that Ghost types suck up distortion like a vacuum and separate it into two non-distorting energies. One of them is used to phase between dimensions, and the other is weaponizable into things like the Shadow Ball we all know and love. The current question is whether some regular Pokemon will be able to execute the same process if given an access to distortion. We could give Pokemon like Ninetales and Marowak a slight ghost typing if we say that they gather in places where distortion naturally accumulates and consume that distortion in the same way a Gastly would.

Of course, there isn't enough game to implement /any/ of this yet, so if you have an objection or idea about more or less anything, we'll listen to any compelling argument you make. You can do this at [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server]], the story bible we just made, or right here in the comments if that's more comfortable.
