I spent a good portion of last night making [[http://imgur.com/a/cxoLH][this map]] of local space, since [[http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/12lys.html][this one]] which is the only decent one I could find online, doesn't include distances. Fortunately, you can generate the distances by dumping the stars in Wolfram Alpha.

Just to make sure you guys know Sideways in Hyperspace is still going places. Oh, it's definitely going places. I don't have a definitive date for when I'll start posting again, I want to, but I need to make sure I have sufficient slush between the stuff I'm currently writing and the stuff I'm posting.
