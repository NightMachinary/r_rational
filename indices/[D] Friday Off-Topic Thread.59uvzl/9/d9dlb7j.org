As a result of a conversation with a friend where the weirdness of chariots in the Iliad was explained to me (chariots had mostly phased out of warfare by the time the Iron Age poets were composing the story, but they knew their ancestors had used them, so chariots are there but are used more like taxicabs than as weapons), I'm interested in understanding the Bronze Age better. Anyone here have experience with good general-audience introductions to the history of the period, especially How Civilization Worked back then?
