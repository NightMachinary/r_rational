Fair points, but I still found it odd that Wilson Fisk was so afraid of being caught that he had anyone who spoke his name murdered while Cottonmouth was able to throw a man off the roof of his own building without attracting any attention from the police. Fisk actually controlled more police officers and was still more careful about avoiding suspicion than the mobster with a reputation on the street who's related to a politician.

As for Mariah liking Cottonmouth...I still have trouble believing that she was willing to work with him despite consistently voicing her displeasure with it. She didn't seem to like him very much and he didn't provide a service she wanted. Also, shouldn't the investigation into Crispus Attics have found some evidence linking her to Cottonmouth? His money and men were in her campaign headquarters, yet all she was asked to do is resign.
