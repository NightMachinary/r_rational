  The most generations you could possibly go back without any common ancestors would be ~30, because 2^{30} is approximately a billion, which was the world population for a long time. That's the absolute upper bound. That equates to something like 600 years depending on how long you think a generation is,

This isn't right. If all of a person's ancestors were European (going back to 1416), they wouldn't share any ancestors with someone whose ancestors were all Asian.

In order to see why, at year 0, imagine two small groups of 50 people. Both groups only have children with people inside of their group. Assuming they kept up this practice, it doesn't matter how many generations pass, every person in the first group would only have ancestors from the first group.

If there aren't any restrictions, then the probability that a person doesn't share any ancestor with someone else falls dramatically, but the only absolute maximum is the first life form. It's unrealistic, but statistically true, the best kind of true.
