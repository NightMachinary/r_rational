  That person would probably be Chinese due to China's one-child only policy.

That's only been in effect since 1979. That's maybe 2 generations, max. The effect would be negligible.

The greatest N would most likely be a biracial child. Of all theoretical biracial children, I'd guess that a child of a a Native American and a Sub-Saharan African (or maybe European?) would have the highest N, but full-blooded native Americans are probably close to non-existent at this point in time, so who knows?

Edit: Now that I think about it more, the more multi-racial the higher the N. Being biracial stops your parents from having a close common ancestor, but being quadra-racial would also stop your grandparents from having close common ancestors.

Also, none of this is a guarantee, because that quadra-racial person could always have had great-grandparents who were cousins, giving them a lower N than most people.
