You can also get like 9 books in the series + various Grantville Gazettes +etc for free legally. Baen some time ago had a fairly generous policy of occasionally bundling hardcovers with CDs that had electronic copies of books in a series or by an author. These CDs had extremely permissive copyright notices - basically, the copyright notices boiled down to "feel free to copy these CDs and share them around but don't make money off of it or change them". You can download copies of those free-to-distribute CDs from this website: [[http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/]]. The top one, 1635: The Eastern Front CD, has 9 of the 163X series and a few Grantville Gazettes and some random other books. You can also pick up a lot of Weber, Ringo, Mercedes Lackey, and several other authors; I particularly like Chris Anvil's Interstellar Patrol short stories.
