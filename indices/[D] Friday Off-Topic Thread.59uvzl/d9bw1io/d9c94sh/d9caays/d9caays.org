The only one I've read is /1632/, and that reading was several years ago. I don't remember liking it particularly*--IIRC, it focused too much on the characters, rather than on the technology, for my liking. (Was I supposed to want to read about a kid who married a woman a few days after fighting to save her from being raped by mercenaries [or something like that]?) I may be misremembering, however.

*Three out of five stars = "Meh. I guess it was better than /nothing,/ but I didn't /like/ it."
