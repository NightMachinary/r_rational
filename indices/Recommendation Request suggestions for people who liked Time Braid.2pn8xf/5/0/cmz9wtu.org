Haigeki just reminded me that I find depictions of behavior modification using operant conditioning extremely disturbing. On some level I know that the character in question will eventually escape or be freed and the Brainwashing will thereafter receive at most cursory mention, but I can't bring myself to fully believe that it works that way. The whole work basically shifts genre to horror from that point on. Does anyone else feel that way?
