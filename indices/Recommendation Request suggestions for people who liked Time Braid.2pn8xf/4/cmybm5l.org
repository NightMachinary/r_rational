Totally out of left field here, but the good adventure, badass protagonist and similar themes to the locked up in your own head parts of TB, I would recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]].

The romance is more central, and certain sections need trigger warnings, but it is a well written story with a smart (if not rational ... but probably rational?) protagonist.

If nothing else I remember thinking most of the story was as well crafted as Time Braid, although perhaps TB had a stronger ending.
