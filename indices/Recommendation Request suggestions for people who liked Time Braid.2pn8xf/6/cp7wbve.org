Stumbled on this again: If you haven't seen it elsewhere on this sub, [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents][The Fall of Doc Future]] and it's sequel [[http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/111819789111/skybreakers-call-contents][Skybreaker's Call]] share the focus on the whiz-bang flashiness of really clever characters confronting ridiculously powerful obstacles. (There are some other similarities as well; sex is all offscreen, but 'how do overpowered people manage sex without doing massive harm to their partners?' is a question that is given screen time.)
