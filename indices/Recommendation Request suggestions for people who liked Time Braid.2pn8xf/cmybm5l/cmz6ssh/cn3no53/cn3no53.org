You might also like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4545558/1/][Five Kingdoms For The Dead]] which is all about mindscape fuckery and plays with the Inner Sakura mechanic.

Also features smart!Sakura, although I haven't read it recently enough to judge whether she was rational or not.

I found I just ran out of interest about 200k words in, but I enjoyed most of the fic. Unfinished, but plenty to read.
