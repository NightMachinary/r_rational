Worth finishing I think. It seems like the author rewrote a bunch of chapters and posted them (start to finish) as a new story, make sure to read that one.

My review: good writing, characters mostly believable, story was interesting. The weakest parts were things that happened in the background, they didn't get enough exposition to explain what was happening.
