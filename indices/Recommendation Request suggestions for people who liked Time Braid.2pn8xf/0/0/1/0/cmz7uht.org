KBDH works best with some knowledge of Haruhi - the author doesn't go for all that much background explanation. I personally suggest the anime as it's quite good for what it is, viewed in airing (original broadcast) order - this is because it paces the thing better and makes certain parts more mysterious and more interesting. Some helpful soul of questionable ethics has caused the entire thing (both seasons) to show up as a list on youtube as the second entry when googling "the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya broadcast order" without quotes. I personally prefer subtitles over the English dub. There's also a related movie. Regardless, if you do start reading KBDH I suggest quiting when it starts to bore you - the work slows in plot progress and does /not/ pick back up, merely slow down more, so if you are tempted to abandon it I suggest just doing so rather than trying to press on in hopes of it improving again. There's a lot of good stuff there, but it does slow eventually, and since the author's demise there is no hope of a satisfying conclusion or anything paying off more than it already has.

If you were really into the fight and action scenes of Time Braid, some of the best such scenes in fanfic I've read are in Jim Bernheimer's Harry Potter fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]. It has really awesome fight scenes and combat and similar action sequences. It also has a reasonably good romance in it. Unfortunately, there's a few weird decisions (bashing the Weasley twins of all people?) in the plot, but the action scenes are quite frequent and good enough to excuse other failings to an extent. The thing doesn't have as much in the way of training scenes as things like Time Braid.

Best of luck!
