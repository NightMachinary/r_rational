Thanks! I read Ra, and quite liked it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as "If you liked Time Braid" (Ra requires a significantly different mindset - it's more thinky and mind-blowy, less sit-back and enjoy the flash), but regardless it still belongs high on the recommendation list for anyone who found their way to this forum.

Does Big Damn Hero require knowledge of the source material? I've enjoyed what little I've read of Durandall's works.

The Void Trilogy sounds good - not wanting to spoil the 'magic' because they're plot twists is a great plus in my book, so I'll take your word for it, thanks!
