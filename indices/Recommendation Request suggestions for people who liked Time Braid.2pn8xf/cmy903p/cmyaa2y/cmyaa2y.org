Yes, as Timewinders says, they imported some of Oh My Goddess's multiverse for Time Braid. However, I don't suggest reading OMG if you enjoyed Time Braid's depiction of it - the canon (both TV and manga) is a rom-com/sit-com that is attenuated to the point of madness and made a bunch of very infuriating plot points / plot decisions. I can't really recommend it that highly over others in the magical girlfriend genre; the only fanfic that I've seen of it is, well, firstly Time Braid and secondly some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/17993/Davner][Davner]]'s stuff - see Scordatura, Amants, and Haloes, and a few others, though his work is much more romancy things and less into fighting/combat, it tends towards doing romance well and also having really good comedy segments at times. Scordatura especially has a funnier zombie apocalypse than /Shaun of the Dead/ and is just really great in general.

A few other things like Time Braid that came to mind.

[[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]], by Sam512 technically fulfills a bunch of your stuff pretty well. It just ended recently and reactions to the ending are severely mixed to say the least. The praise for the earlier sections is a lot more uniform, at least - a few people didn't like it but most enjoyed it a lot.

The computerlike multiverse and mindscape stuff isn't present but most of the others are in multiverse crossover fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Sleeping With The Girls]] and sequels; this is a SI fic where a guy wakes up after every time he falls asleep next to a different character from various anime in various universes, and while that premise sounds /amazingly bad/ it is actually pretty good. However, the fic is probably extremely dead/discontinued without an ending, which is sad. As a bonus, features an Oh My Goddess segment that is sort of neat.

Another discontinued/unended fic that might qualify, especially in early to mid segments of it, is Brian 'Durandall' Randall's [[http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/kbdh/][Kyon: Big Damn Hero]], a Haruhi fic. This fic had a lot of neat stuff along the lines you are interested in, but ultimately became too stretched out and overlong for what it is and lost focus and failed to progress any major plots at a reasonable rate, and the fic is extremely dead (the author took his own life...). In this case the source material (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) is actually pretty good and itself possesses some attributes not entirely unlike Time Braid at times, so you could do far worse than checking out either the light novels or the anime adaptation (which is really well done, both in technical quality and overall merit - I prefer broadcast order for watching these but opinions vary. Also, there is a definite long section of the second season which you will know when you reach it when you will want to skim and skip through parts; I urge you to indulge this desire).

Peter Hamilton's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_Trilogy][Void Trilogy]] has a bunch of stuff you may be interested in as well if you liked certain aspects of Time Braid. I don't really want to spoil a bunch of major and important plot points but it's got a lot of stuff in it that reminded me of good bits of Time Braid, and a slice of it manages to almost deconstruct Time Braid which is an especially neat trick considering that the majority of the trilogy was published before Time Braid was a thing that existed. The rest of Hamilton's work is rather a mixed bag, I liked his standalone Fallen Dragon and his Commonwealth books (that are technically prequels to the Void books, but the two series can be read independently) but Hamilton's Night's Dawn stuff is hopelessly self-indulgent, too long for what it is, and is very silly in central conceits.
