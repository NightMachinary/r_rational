[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is an original story that's very similar to Time Braid. The main character is stuck in a time loop and does everything he can to learn about what's causing it and be prepared to deal with the antagonists. There isn't any computer-like multiverse though. I think that was just a crossover with Oh My Goddess in Time Braid. And unlike in Time Braid, the main character gets involved in the main plot early on because it starts in a really obvious way with the antagonists attacking his city. There is still a lot of time spent on "sidequests" though. The prose is pretty rough and there are some grammar issues but the story is fun and the main character is pretty clever.
