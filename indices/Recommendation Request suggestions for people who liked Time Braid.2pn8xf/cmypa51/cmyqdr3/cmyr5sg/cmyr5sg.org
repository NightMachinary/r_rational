Well, I myself have read /Partially Kissed Hero/ twice and greatly enjoyed it each time, as well as /Chunin Exam Day/ three times (though only the first two-thirds or so on the last two readings). I found /CED/ pretty unequivocally awesome up to maybe around Tenten's wedding (and still retaining a good deal of awesomeness even when the harem shenanigans and Sasuke-bashing ramped up to become too much for me to stomach), and /PKH/ was awesome throughout, in my opinion, since Dumbledore's and Snape's villainy was cartoonish enough that it didn't even annoy me, and all the world-building (Cauldron of Plenty, rivers of Hades) was cool as well.
