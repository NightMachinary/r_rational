Here's a recommendation: [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset][Hard Reset]], a good MLP time-loop, which I enjoyed despite having only watched 4 episodes of the show. Like Time Braid, it starts off Time Loopy, then shifts its focus to new and interesting magic and plot mechanics. (Read: it doesn't spend 50,000+ words in loops with no permanent threat to the heroine). As a bonus, Twilight's characterization would greatly appeal to HPMOR/LW fans, and I had the impression that the author was already part of the community. Come to think of it, I would safely categorize it as a "rational" fic.
