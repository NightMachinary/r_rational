Most of those are met by the two excellent stories below. I'm not sure why both focus on Ranma - except that that canon is all about excellence in combat - but I'll leave it here, where I can give both a 10/10 recommendation.

  Ranma must discover what he wants and who he loves in a neverending day that is a spiritual journey to maturity. What might he do with boundless time?

This would be the best /Time Braid/-like fic I've read - it's old, but good. Ranma 1/2, with original extensions to the setting.

  His friends kidnapped by magical girls, Ranma is pushed beyond his limits to retrieve them.

Ended a genre for me; it's that good. The definitive "someone gets turned into Sailor X" story, and it is /epic/. Draws beautifully on alternative concepts of excellence.
