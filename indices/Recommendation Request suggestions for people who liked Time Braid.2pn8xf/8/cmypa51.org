/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7183151][Vulpine]]/ (100k words, complete) is a sort of homage/parody of /Time Braid/--it incorporates a lot of the elements, while being a lot more joking in its manner. I don't really have any suggestions for stories that can approach /Time Braid/'s unparalleled awesomeness, though.

You might want to read /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ (300k words, dead), the story that inspired /Time Braid./ The first two-thirds or so are pretty good, before the story descends into goofy shenanigans.
