I was about to post another /shudder/ at the mention of Chunin Exam Day, but you're right: I honestly /did/ enjoy most of the story up until Tenten's wedding. It was a little heavyhanded with the angst, and the author's notes didn't help any, but beyond that it was maybe worth the read.

While I'm being honest, despite the fact that I'll never get those hours back, I don't exactly regret reading past that point either. Looking back today, I can laugh at the story, and laugh at myself for reading on in vain hope the plot would go anywhere.

I'll give Vulpine a look.
