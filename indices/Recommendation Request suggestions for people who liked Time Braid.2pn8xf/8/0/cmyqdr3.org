I thought Vulpine was really mediocre; without having the supporting elements behind e.g. Sakura's skills developed in Time Braid, inserting them from nothing in the fic was just sort of jarring and felt really forced. Time Braid had a lot of neat establishing background stuff that Vulpine lacks.

And I strongly reccomend against CED and everything else that author has written under that pen-name (Perfect Lionheart) or his alt, Skysaber. There is nothing in those fics that is worth suffering through all the bad parts. It's a vast plain of worthless rubble and fragments, where you may happen to spot a few tiny golden flecks that in the distance may seem attractive, but invariably when you finally get there you will find out that they are actually iron pyrite.
