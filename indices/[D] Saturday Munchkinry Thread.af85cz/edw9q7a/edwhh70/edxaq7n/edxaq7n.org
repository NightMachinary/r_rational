Zinc allomancers can open successful restaurants with little work. Just amplify the hunger of everyone near your restaurant, and stop only after they finish eating your food.

But if making money is your goal, there's a better method: horse racing.

Bet on a horse, then amplify the feelings of fatigue felt by all of the other horses. Since they are horses, they won't understand that their feelings are being manipulated by an outside force and won't resist the fatigue. And horses, considering their ability to be trained in various ways, are definitely sapient enough for fatigue to be rioted. You will be able to win money with ease and become filthy rich.
