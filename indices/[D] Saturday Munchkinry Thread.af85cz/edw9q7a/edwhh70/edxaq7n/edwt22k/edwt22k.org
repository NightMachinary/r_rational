Probably contrary to most other people, but I don't think tapping zinc would be that powerful. You'd do better on an IQ test, but only in the pattern recognition and quick math parts. Being able to instantly come up with consequences for events is good for chess, but in real life you don't have a hard time limit like that and don't get very much of a comparative advance by thinking of drawbacks sooner since large, important events will have hours of thought put into them anyways.

I imagine the symptoms of storing zinc would just be something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo][sluggish cognitive tempo]], which is already a real thing...and which can be treated by ADHD stimulants to good effects. On Earth you'd have to find someone to sell you some Ritalin, but you could negate the worst of the drawbacks while storing mental speed for later.
