Information hazard.

you have an envelope. inside the envelope, is an information hazard. anyone who sees this information will be affected by it, and rendered comatose. excluding destruction of the information, what is the best course of action?

for reference, we can say that this is a picture of medusa's head. not a mirror-reflection, but an accurate representation of what her head looks like. pictures of this picture retain the same effect, as does video feed of the picture, however a loss of picture quality may reduce or even prevent the effect.
