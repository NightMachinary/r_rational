possible problem: some people print their email. what if they manage to print the link in that span of time? (look away as page loads, hit print button on instinct, look back...)

also, this only really hits targets stupid enough to click unknown email links... you may want to confirm the targets behavior with a less risky email first. if they dont click, then how long will the trap sit there? what if an idiot (not the target) is reading their mail and clicks it instead?

overall a very interesting approach to the information hazard problem. an alternate trick, may be a virus that shows the image just once, when the screen saver is next bypassed via password.
