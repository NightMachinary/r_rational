Having limitless mental speed is clearly broken beyond belief and could easily catapult the user to a position of significant power and influence incredibly rapidly, just through superhuman social-fu.

Just feruchemical Zinc is incredibly powerful, though. If you spend all of your private time storing, you could do a pretty decent Zinc compounder impression in public. Even increasing your speed by 50% while in public would be a massive boon. This is a power which allows you to save a valuable resource you aren't using for later, even moreso than most other Feruchemical arts.
