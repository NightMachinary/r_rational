*Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 6: Zinc*

And we're back! This is week six of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for general overview of the magic system, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/][part one]]. I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 5 can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/][3]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/][4]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/][5]].

/Spoiler note/: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

This weeks metal is zinc. As always I'm interested in what a zinc twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

*Allomancy*

Allomantically, zinc closely mirrors brass. Where brass allomancers can weaken (soothe) emotions, zinc allomancers can intensify (riot) emotions. An allomancer burning zinc can focus on a person or a group of people to increase the intensity of the emotions those people are feeling. Rioters can riot all emotions at once (which causes the target to become anxious and stressed) or pick one or more individual emotions to riot.

What counts as an emotion for Allomancy is fairly broad, it includes things like fear, anger and happiness, but also hunger, pride, feelings of loyalty and even someone's sense of fatigue. Note that loyalty here means a generic feeling of being loyal, it does not allow you to pick and choose whom the target is loyal to.

This ability is not mind control, zinc allomancers have to be subtle if they want to use their abilities to influence unwilling targets. Once someone catches on that you are playing with their emotions it is fairly easy for them to resist it.

While zinc does not allow you to lower the intensity of emotions, skilful allomancers can achieve a similar effect by subtly rioting other emotions that are vying for the targets attention. If you want them to overcome their fear, for instance, you could riot the targets anger and pride, making their fear stand out less.

One other thing that perhaps goes without saying, but while the effects of allomancy are temporary, you can still use it to influence what people are thinking in the long run. For instance, if you want someone to freak out about some new piece of information, you can riot their fear and anger while you tell them about it. Then once they remember the conversation after the allomantic effects have worn off, they will remember being angry about it and the brain's desire for consistency might kick in and justify their reaction by making up some kind of reason why the things you told them were a big deal.

The maximum number of people you can influence at a time is dependent on your skill as an allomancer, but a rough upper bound might be a large room full of people. You do not strictly need line of sight to your targets, but it does make things easier.

Any aluminium placed between your center of mass and the targets head prevents you from targeting their emotions and extremely strong emotions in the target can interfere with (though not outright block) your abilities. Non-humans are susceptible to soothing to an extent directly proportional to their level of sapience (so you're not going to riot an ant, but you might be able to riot a gorilla or a dolphin or even a particularly smart dog).

*Feruchemy*

Feruchemic zinc allows you to store mental speed. When storing mental speed, a feruchemist becomes slow to react and make decisions. Completing every day task becomes harder and keeping a coherent train of thoughts becomes very difficult. For instance, a feruchemist storing mental speed while drinking soup might take a second to realize that in order to move the soup to their mouth, they first need to scoop it up with their spoon. Their body is no less capable, but because their reaction time is so slow, they often come across as confused, sluggish and not quite there.

When tapping the resulting metal mind, the feruchemist becomes capable of making deductions and drawing conclusions in record time and their reaction time becomes vastly higher. It's not quite watching the world go by in slow motion (that's more feruchemic steel's thing), you just need less time to figure things out. For instance, a zinc feruchemist /can/ actually think through the consequences of their discussion partners arguments on the spot and come up with counterarguments (or be convinced) in real time.

Worth noting that having a higher mental speed is not exactly the same as being smarter. If you can't solve some particular mystery or puzzle given enough, tapping zinc isn't going to help. It's just that if you could solve it, tapping zinc helps you with the "given enough time" part.
