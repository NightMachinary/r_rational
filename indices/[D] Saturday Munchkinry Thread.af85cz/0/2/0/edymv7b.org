I think that the point is that during high stress real time activities, like any conversation, you're going to be as convincing as you would be if you had as much time as you wanted to pause and think things through. That's a pretty big advantage for the average person, simply due to the confidence boost of not feeling rushed to come up with something, let alone the benefits available to someone who's prepared. A lot of social interaction can be improved with a couple principles, the trouble is integrating that stuff so you don't have to remember a list in the middle of the conversation. Which, again, this helps with.

I'm not saying that this would necessarily make you superhuman, but it would let you /always/ put your best foot forward.
