It would be useful for covert email assassination.

Setup a trap website. When a trap website is first visited it displays the infohazard in such a way that it is constructed by javascript and not stored in cache. After a short period of time (but long enough for the image to take effect) the infohazard is removed and the webpage transforms into a perfectly innocuous page removing all evidence of the infohazard. Subsequent visitors do not get the infohazard and just get the innocuous content.

​

To perform an assassination you would just have to setup a trap website and send an email to someone crafted so that they will click on a link to your trap. Investigators are unlikely to expect that your seemingly innocuous website had anything to do with the coma unless you make an obvious pattern.
