As a weapon, this is both less effective and more dangerous to the user than a gun, so becoming an assassin is right out. I suppose you could carefully make a copy, then leave it in a room that is soon to host, like, a violent Islamist convention or something, but that would just create a ton of martyrs and would be no more effective than planting a bomb. Plus, that would put the image squarely in the hands of various unspecifiable malevolent actors.

I think just burying the envelope in a randomly selected area is your best move.
