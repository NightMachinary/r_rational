I found this video a little annoying, in part because it's not really talking about hard or soft magic systems, it's talking about /rules/ in the general sense. You could break these into different categories:

1. The rules are known to the characters, and to the readers
2. The rules are known to the characters, but not the readers
3. The rules are not known to the characters or the readers
4. The rules are not known to the characters, but known to the readers

I'm not sure that I've ever seen an example of 4, but it's included here for the sake of completeness.

I think there are two reason that /Harry Potter/ gets lumped in with "hard magic".

1. In-universe, magic is largely a known quantity; it's taught in schools without much mysticism, there are rules that you have to follow, there are "laws" that are referenced, and people have a general understanding of what is and is not possible. It slots pretty neatly into a bureaucratic framework.
2. Individual pieces of the magic have established narrative-level rules to them. Throughout the books, a spell/potion/item will be defined in the first act, then used in the third act. In this sense, the magic can feel hard.

Fullmetal Alchemist would be another example of a magic system that I think people confuse as being a "hard" magic system (or where definitions get tricky), because while the series tells us all the time that it's a complex and precise magic, we don't really know any of the rules that govern it, and a lot of the characters have a technique or ability that sets up a "rule" no different from how a lot of superheroes have their own unique powers, and which doesn't naturally derive from what we know about the magic system those powers are supposedly built from.

(This is aside from the question of whether a show/book actually keeps to their rules, or whether the author knew the rules as they were writing, which are different questions.)
