The original "hard magic" stories would be /The Incomplete Enchanter/ by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt. In each of these stories the hero, one Harold Shea, journeys to a different fantastic world and has to work out how magic differs in that universe. In one world magic requires poetry, in another it's powered by gods and their relics.

The other influential early hard magic series is the Lord Darcy series by Randall Garret. Darcy is a royal investigator aided by his loquaciously pedagogical assistant the forensic sorceror Sean O'Lochlainn. Magic is the science and technology of the Angevin Empire of Darcy's world, and Sean never fails to explain how scientific magic works as he provides the critical clues for Lord Darcy to solve each puzzle.
