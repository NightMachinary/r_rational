It's hardly a limit when you admit in the video that the limit can be removed. Also, I shouldn't have to watch a /second video/ to evaluate the validity of the first. Perhaps if it was created as "Part 1 of X" then that might be the case, but if it can't stand on its own don't try to defend it by saying "Well, somewhere /else/ it makes sense!"

--------------

As for *EE*, I gave you an in-universe example of a statement, and /several/ in-universe examples of it /failing/ in application.

In your /own/ words, you state: "/A hard magic system, on the other hand, has clearly defined rules, consequences, and limitations that govern what one can or cannot do with magic./"

There is only one "rule" in FMA, and more like a mythical guideline--*EE*. There is nothing else. There's no system for the characters to use, abuse, or get tripped up by. When they pull off things that make no sense, it is simply handwaived away. Sure, it's /one step more Hard than Harry Potter/ (because at least it /tried/ to establish a rule), but it's still firmly on the Soft side of the scale.

Claiming otherwise and failing to back it up with examples doesn't change that. If it was "/far toward the harder end/" you'd be able to give more examples of such than a constantly restated false statement within the series.
