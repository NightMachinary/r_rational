Neat! So, my original comment then? Alright, let's get to it.

*A hard magic system, on the other hand, has clearly defined rules, consequences, and limitations that govern what one can or cannot do with magic.*

That's a quote from your video. Harry Potter does not meet this criteria. The /only/ limitation seems to be whether or not you need a wand to cast. There is no detail as to where the energy comes from or what 'cost' is paid to use it. Some wizards can kill with a word. Some can mindwipe you with a phrase. Some can do some terrible things with your nerves. There are weird, spells that have almost no use outside some ridiculously specific situations ("Serpentsortia" creates or conjures a snake. OK, but why? Even if you can talk to it and tell it to attack, it's useless in combat against a wizard. Might be good for extracting venom, though). There's potions that affect /luck/, of all random things. There's no rhyme or reason behind it, it's all mysterious, because it's /meant/ to make one have a sense of wonder. It's specifically soft to keep most poor Muggle readers on their toes. But when you look at it in detail, it all falls apart, because it's incredibly Soft. Having a single limitation doesn't change this.

--------------

As for *Fullmetal Alchemist*, you have to decide whether you want an in-universe statement or one obtained by rational thinking.

If you want the former, go watch the end of Brotherhood again. Specifically the last episode. In it, Edward straight up states that the concept of Equivalent Exchange is wrong.

If you want the latter, however (and since this is the Rational subreddit, you'd best expect it), I will break it down for you.

--------------

*EE* can be deconstructed on the simple level by attempting to answer /what is defining the value/. It specifically states that something of /equal value must be given/. It's certainly not subjective, because if the person valued what they were giving up as much as they value what they were getting, they'd never make the exchange in the first place. The problem with "value" is that it is entirely relative. A man lost in a desert values water more than a man in a city. So who, or what, is the judge of the 'value'?

--------------

*EE* can be deconstructed on the more complex level due to the fact that many effects in Alchemy require some /outside intelligence/ to function. IE: They're not transmuting concrete substances, but abstractions.

The easiest example of the above is at the 2 minute mark in your video, where Al transmutes a broken radio. Does Al know how to make radios? Does he know the intricate details of their circuitry, the careful balance of voltage and amperage? Does he understand the concept of electrical length in antennas or the concept of reflected voltage when transmitting? On the more practical level, does he know /exactly/ which direction every diode faces? No. He just slaps his hands on the ground with the transmutation circle and the radio is magically repaired.

Read that: Without any knowledge of how they work, he rebuilds one using Alchemy (magic). How does the magic 'know' where all the parts go? Every part, in detail? I could believe it if it was, say, a single broken metal rod, or maybe even something with a hinge. But the complexity of a radio restored to functionality by a person with no experience in them? Even if he did, he'd have to keep the entire schematic in his mind as /well/ as the physical shapes and positions of all the parts. Either the writing is bad or some /outside intelligence/ is doing the work.

This isn't the only time this happens. In one of them (can't remember if Brotherhood or the original), Scar has a bunch of torn up papers with code. The Elric brothers figured it out the hard way, but Scar just slaps his hands down and it makes an orb that /decrypts the code for him/. He doesn't possess this ability naturally.

Every time one of the alchemists creates a complex machine, this effect sticks out like a sore thumb. It's even worse when it comes to Winry complaining about Ed making weapons out of his Automail. He doesn't know how to make the stuff, but given what Al did with the radio, he should be able to repair it at any time!

--------------

Finally, *EE* can be deconstructed by the fact that it is self contradictory. Namely, it brazenly and shamelessly breaks physics while claiming to be a 'law' of their universe.

One of the best examples, slightly spoilerified, is in FMA when Colonel Mustang, a man who generates "fire" (oh ho ho, try explaining that one) by snapping his fingers, gets into a fight with a living construct. This living construct has a power source made from the condensed soul energy of /hundreds of human beings/. Each time he burns parts of it away, it quickly regenerates.

Now this man continues to snap his fingers and create so much 'fire', over and over again, that he /burns out a power source that should have at least 100x more power than he does/. He looks exhausted after the fact, but as he was critically wounded at the time he did this, it's kind of a tossup as to which was making him more tired.

Tell me... what did this series of attacks cost him? What 'price' did he pay aside from snapping his fingers over and over?

--------------

The fact is that *EE* seems to apply only vaguely to matter, and not at all to energy or abstract concepts. It's applications are arbitrary and poorly explained, and at the end of the main series in which it is used one of the most experienced practitioners of that magic system calls it out as being false.

Fullmetal Alchemist, while having neat /application/ of its magic system, is a /Soft/ magic system, not a hard one.
