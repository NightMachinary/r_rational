Hey! I'm the guy who posted the video. Thanks to whoever shared it - it was really cool to come across it here. I wanted to respond to the first comment. Harry Potter is only referenced in an example of a magic system having limitations and costs like that potions require ingredients or generally wizards require a wand, but as explained far more in-depth in the second video - Rowling actually has a relatively soft system on the whole. It was my mistake for letting it be misleading, but it was just an example I felt everybody would be familiar with. I think having the full context would give you a better understanding of what I said. As for Fullmetal Alchemist and Equivalent Exchange, it DID work. If you remember from the series, the entire story revolved around attempting to bypass it. The whole point was that it DID work and the Philosopher's Stone they wanted didn't exist.
