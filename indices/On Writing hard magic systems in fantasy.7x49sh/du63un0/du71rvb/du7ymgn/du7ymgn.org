In that case, he doesn't know the difference between hard and soft magic.

Harry learns some magic, but he almost always relies on his old "Expelliarmus" (sp) standby. Why a disarm spell has such a stupidly long command word is beyond me, you figure if wizards have to battle with magic, they'd be using the least amount of speaking and flourishes possible to get the job done. As it is, you could replace his wand with a M9 and he'd be more effective.

Saying its "similar" to hard magic doesn't hold up well when comparing it to other systems. LotR has far less magic than Harry Potter. Only the really powerful, unique supernatural creatures can even use magic. Gandalf isn't an old man with a long beard and funny robes, he's the functional equivalent of an Archangel in his universe. The Rings themselves are basically Artifacts crafted by demigods. We don't see the rules detailed too well because the magic system is limited to very plot-specific side characters and it's not something used by the main characters unless it's in the form of an enhancement to an item they carry. There's no real "system" or set of rules because there doesn't need to be, the story follows people who don't have access to it and aren't usually fighting with or against it.
