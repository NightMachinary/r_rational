Actually, the subjectivity of value only comes into play with Human Transmutation, where the 'cost' is determined by God/Truth, in a poetic sense (Ed looses his leg, which he stands on, and without his brother or his mother he has noone to rely on anymore - he can't stand up to God anymore, because he dared to do so by doing Human Transmutation, Mustang loses his vision for daring to look idealistically to the future, Izumu loses her womb, so she can never create life again etc.) These are the softer parts, but they hold very interesting messages. I think it's perfectly fine to sacrifice a bit of the rigid consistency of a totally hard magic system for the sake of a powerful message.

Re the technology point you made, that is a very reasonable assertion. But you answer it yourself - Ed can't transmute his auto-mail back into shape, because he doesn't understand it. He can put Al back together because he knows where all the metal goes. With Al and the radio, maybe he does know where all the parts go and their exact nature (plus it's just broken, it wasn't as if it was a pile of atoms, so he likely didn't need to know the directions of all the diodes etc, since they were probably still intact), but even if he doesn't, that's more on poor writing, than an inherent flaw in the magic system.

Equivalent exchange works as such - you can only transmute one object into another, if you preserve their elemental composition. It is why he can't turn metal into water, but why he can coat his steel with a layer of graphene/diamond, due to it's diamond content. With the radio, it was showing us that he didn't create a new radio from thin air, or from dirt, he created it from the same materials - in fact pre-existing parts, so an even less complex transmutation. You also see that in the freezing alchemist in the first episode. He can order the H2O molecules to either be very rigidly ordered, turning it to ice, or giving them kinetic energy, turning it to steam. Each specific transmutation requires it's own circle (At least in Amestrian Alchemy). In alkahestry, they work on broader concepts of deconstruction and reconstruction, but they still need to understand the materials behind it - which is why Scar's broad deconstruction alchemy requires him to know the material before he deconstructs something.

In addition, what you mentioned regarding Scar in what was the 2003 adaptation - the rules for Alchemy were a lot softer in that version; equivalent exchange truly didn't exist. It's bad to point to that Anime as I would say that was a soft magic system that put on the facade of a hard magic system in universe : as in everyone thought it was a science, but in the reality of that story, it wasn't.

Colonel Mustang doesn't generate fire - you misunderstand his power, although reasonably so as it was only explained in the Manga and the 2003 version, not the 2009 adaptation. His powers work like this: His gloves are made of a material called spark-cloth, when he snaps his fingers, he generates a spark (which is why without his gloves, he used a lighter instead). Then, using his transmutation circle, he alters the position and concentrations of Oxygen and Hydrogen in the air to create currents through which the spark can travel. He doesn't generate fire, he controls the 'direction' of burning. In the same episode, he was able to completely disassociate the hydrogen from oxygen in a puddle of water to create hydrogen and oxygen gas, without having to create a different transmutation circle - this shows us the transmutation circle on his glove is specifically designed for hydrogen and oxygen, not for fire, or plasma, or other flammable materials.

Thus, he didn't need to generate 100 souls or whatever to kill Lust (you also forget Lust has likely had to use up some of her stone when previously fighting mustang, and getting shot repeatedly by Hawkeye), he just needed to direct all that energy towards her.

Soul's are the only things to don't directly abide by equivalent exchange, because they are intangible, ethereal, subjective things. But they still have a limit - you can't constantly avoid Equivalent Exchange off of one soul. With Father Cornello, when his stone was running out - he tried to make something that was out of the realm of the Stone's power now, so it tried to use part of him in the reaction - turning him into that horrid fusion. Lust can only heal of her wounds so many times before her stone runs out of juice so to speak. They still abide by the rules, it's just that the value of soul isn't explicitly defined, because no mortal could truly comprehend the value of a soul - only God/Truth can,
