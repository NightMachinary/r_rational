You're totally right. Harry Potter does not meet that criteria, and the video never states that it does? It merely used HP as an example for what constitutes a limit or cost. If you watched the second video, you'd see I explicitly say HP has a soft magic system.

As for EE - I prefer in-universe statements and was speaking about such. The principle of EE is only broken in regards to human transmutation (where relativity of value comes into play a little). Ed wasn't commenting on the rules otherwise. All magic systems sit somewhere on the spectrum, and FMAB is definitely far towards the harder end.
