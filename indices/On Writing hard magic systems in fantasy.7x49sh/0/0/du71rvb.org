He also uses Harry Potter as an example in his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVrnfniQiS8][video on soft magic]].

I /think/ a fair summary of this guy's take is that the Rowlingverse has a soft magic system because J.K. is pretty liberal about making up new spells and creature powers when the plot needs it; but the Harry Potter books have elements of hard magic because the reader is following along as Harry learns new spells and finds new items, so we have a pretty good idea of what he's capable of at any given point in the story.

Also, this particular Overton window is probably pretty skewed within the community of [[/r/rational]] readers. I can totally see putting HP magic in the harder half of a scale that has LOTR and Narnia on the softer end.
