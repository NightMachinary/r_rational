If you do want to watch an LP, I highly recommend [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kL6tclhB0&list=PLN9s4vA_ONwAN8v3nAFNv4WdRdkg2b5Jv][Dan Burns' (CannibalK9) Let's Play]] of this game. He shows every bit of text and lore in the game, and provides quite high-level commentary and context throughout. Semi-scripted, and pretty funny at times. On top of that, he completes every single puzzle in addition to finding every easter egg.
