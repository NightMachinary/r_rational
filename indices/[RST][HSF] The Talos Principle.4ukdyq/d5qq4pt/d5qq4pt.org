Personally I didn't think the story was particularly interesting, being just a retelling of The Garden of Eden with some Tower of Babel and some scifi elements we should all be familiar with mixed in, and the characters stuck pretty closely to those archetypes with little character development up to the point I stopped playing. The puzzles were pretty fun though.
