Information isn't lost, except if it fall is in a black hole if I understand right.

Author makes a mistake thinking we would need historical writings and data to recreate Will, when the only thing we need is proper physics model and time to check if simulation fits with our world data. There was a Slate Star Codex blog post doign a similar story better, but not with intent to save people, rather just testing if simulation program works or something like that.

However even if information is lost, then all a computer really has to is recreate a full-blown simulation of a various humans, crosscheck them for paradoxes and functionality and put them back on line. sort like a computer model of multiverse only for sapisentient beings, eventually you would have all sorts of people, and if multiverse theory is right IRL then you would actually create real people who exist somewhere.

As for characters speech, I dont mind, this isnt a story, but rather an idea presented in story format for Tumblr and general normie audience (normie as mainstream who havent read a bunch of scifi books detailing similar concepts). Either that or Will is drugged up to keep him calm lol
