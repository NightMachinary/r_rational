If I were Will Long myself, I would have asked about if any of my own friends or family would be recreated as well. They just said how there was difficulty in recreating him due to how little information of Will Long existing. Therefore, it's very unlikely for any of Will Long's memories of his peers (Brother Stephen, Laurence, and Hugh) to be correct. If they were, then that should be sufficient to recreate them as well.
