Am I the only one who's never been bothered by the "is it really me" nonsense? The only downside there could possibly be to having more of my mind in the world is that it increases the chance of me getting tortured, so as long as every copy has an off switch (something I think people should have anyway, provided it was effort-intensive to push so folks don't suicide on a whim) I'm ecstatic to have more of me running around pursuing my goals.
