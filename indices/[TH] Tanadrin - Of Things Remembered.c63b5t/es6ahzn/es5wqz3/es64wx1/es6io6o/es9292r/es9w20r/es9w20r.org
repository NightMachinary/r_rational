I'm not bothered by “is this duplicate really /me/?” per se, but I'm low-grade suicidal a fair amount of the time and that might be having an effect.

As for the simulation idea, that's a different flavor of “is this really me?” In that case, the problem which the sim would be meant to solve is not “is this duplicate a fake double that lacks Authenticity Quarks?” or whatever, but “does this duplicate's mind actually correspond to the mind of the person we are attempting to duplicate?” If we are trying to resurrect the dead, then it matters whether we are re-constructing old minds (through a laborious trial-and-error process, admittedly) or constructing new minds that remember writing some poetry but in all other respects don't correspond very well to the mind of a particular English monk.
