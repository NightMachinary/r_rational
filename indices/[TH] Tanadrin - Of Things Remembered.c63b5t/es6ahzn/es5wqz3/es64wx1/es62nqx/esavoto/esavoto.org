I understand that the expectation on this sub is usually that everything about the world should reconcile in some way with the world rationally, but at some point that kind of world building may just detract from the story.

You're judging it for it's perspective on how singularity was achieved, but I think the portrayal was more of an emotional ideal of the treatment of individuals in a world where everything is within human power. The civilization in the story has both power and the organizational power to choose to use that power only when appropriate.

I do find that this story is enjoyable and valuable. I don't want to get to the point where the only stories we like are the ones where we agree with the perspective of a character inside the story or find the world building meets our current understanding of physics.

Moreover, I think this does have value on [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. I'll agree that those are the criteria we usually use to find common ground on this sub, but the philosophy of value that informs our rationality can be enriched by stories about our tropes.
