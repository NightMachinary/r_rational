Hi there!

This is an old 'story' I wrote which was more of an extended thought experiment than an actual plotted story. You might notice how the 'power level' ramps up as the time travel hijinks get more and more complicated and more and more overpowered. In an actual superpowered time travel story, this doesn't make sense.

Of course, other than a slightly unsatisfying one-sided clash, we also don't see adversarial time loop logic. (and only hint at a hilariously bad application of an Outcome Pump-esque trick)
