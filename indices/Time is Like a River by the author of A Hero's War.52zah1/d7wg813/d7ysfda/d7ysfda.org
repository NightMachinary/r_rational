I shan't answer the spoiler.

As to how she broke free of the mind control, her friend Cheryl has the ability to 'resurrect' people by reversing time on an object. This of course undoes everything, including death, mind control, memories, etc.

Anne was rewound all the way back to the point where her older self appeared in the police station.

EDIT: It wasn't ever presented in-depth, but the existence of a time reversal power allows an Anne-Cheryl combo to pull time loops of objects that never existed.
