The total Cheryl-time from learning time travel to the destruction of the missile base is maybe three months? I never plotted a timeline to that detail, but it's not a significant span of time.

How long she spent under mind-control was not given in the story. By Anne-time, it could be very long (although clearly not long enough to age her). By Cheryl-time, it was two weeks.

Doesn't matter once she was reset.
