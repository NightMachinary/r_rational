I never played or read Continuum although I was aware of it's existence.

TiLaR doesn't use the concept of frag and history preservation. In a sense, the time travel here is both more powerful and more restrictive than Continuum's.

Anne can't change history but she can constrain what happens into a limited set of possible futures arranged by her own time travel. This allows her to function like an oracle machine, which is the source of most of the crazy overpowered feats she performs (Butterfly Effect Genie is just the most obvious).
