Interesting story, I will admit I got completely turned around and confused by some things but I think that's more due to my lack of familiarity with causal reasoning and time paradoxes and such than due to any particular flaw in the story.

Spoiler question: Did the unnamed, mind controlling man sexually assault Anne when he first encounters her? I ask because the story is rated K but that's a fairly dark thing to hint at, so I wasn't sure if I was misinterpreting him "reaching under her dress".

Also what age is the Anne we start off with? We know sixteen year old Anne is the one being mind controlled into setting off a nuclear war. And how exactly is she broken free of the mind control, to come back at age 24 and help save the world? I got soooo confused, won't even lie. Like I thought the movie /Predestination/ was confusing but that doesn't even hold a candle to this. Overall a good show tho, must admit.
