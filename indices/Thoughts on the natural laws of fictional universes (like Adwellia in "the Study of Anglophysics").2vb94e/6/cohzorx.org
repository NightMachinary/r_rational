[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/][In this post in LessWrong]], Eliezer defines the supernatural as having "ontologically basic mental things, mental entities that cannot be reduced to nonmental entities." (Also giving credit to [[http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com/2007/01/defining-supernatural.html][Richard Carrier]], though that exact wording is Elizer.)

That struck me as a really useful concept for writing fiction with magic. How do we make magic something other than alt-physics in a funny hat? We make sure it's supernatural, by the above definition - so a wizard can't summon "fire," the visual cue that combustion is happening; she can only summon /fire/, the contagious manifestation of anger, which will get distracted and chase you down if you splash water at it.

If we want that second kind of fire, that implies ontologically basic anger, because it makes no sense for summoning fire to drag in a kind of anger that requires a substantial portion of a human mind to run on.

It's okay to have ontologically basic anger, so long as the rest of the world behaves that way too. It would be too bizarre a coincidence for you to have anger in your head as a product of brain chemistry and for it to also be an atom of its own right, so human anger has to be made of that same atom, not neurons and hormones.

That applies for the rest of the stuff in a human head too; there can still be an organ that looks like a brain that holds all of the thought-atoms, but it can't behave like a brain. Brain damage in this world has to behave differently. Maybe brain damage means gradually losing the capacity for different feelings and thoughts, then coma and death. For changes to human physiology, we might actually be able to limit it there.

There's also the side effect of having ontologically basic mental building blocks where it's easier to create something that can think. Human evolution was probably shorter, if we even evolved (and skipping evolution might be a good idea). But it also means that more and more varied ones of these blocks are available elsewhere. I'm pretty sure that the answer there is just a generous helping of animism. (Though I'm falling asleep faster than I can expound on that thought.)
