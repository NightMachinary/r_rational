How about a universe literally built out of the four elements: water, earth, fire, air. Everything would be built out of combinations of elements like in the game "Alchemy" where combinations of the primary elements lead to secondary elements, which can be combined to form tertiary elements, and so on. Water, Earth, fire and air are like quarks which combine to form mud, alcohol, cloud, lava, dust and plasma particles which then form larger particles by combining with primary elements or other elements.
