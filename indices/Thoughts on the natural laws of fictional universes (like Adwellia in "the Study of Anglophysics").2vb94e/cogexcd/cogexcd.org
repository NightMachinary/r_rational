The universe of "Three Parts Dead", by Max Gladstone, runs on contract law.

Discworld, famously, runs on "narrativium" - or something. I /think/ it's supposed to be a regular physical universe with atoms and such, and magical consciousness-reactive physics enforcing storybook logic on the world; it's mostly an excuse for the setting to run on every narrative cliche simultaneously.

The setting of "Mage: The Ascension" runs on whatever the majority of people think it runs on, for as long as they think that. I'm not sure if this is possible, or exactly how it works, though (there seems to be a range limit?) Some people can temporarily mess with the laws of physics in their immediate area by believing hard enough or coming up with an on-the-fly explanation for why an effect /should/ happen, that they know to be false but is convincing to everyone else.

The /Keys to the Kingdom/ series, by Garth Nix, take place in a world that /mostly/ seems to run on regular physics (complete with alien races;) but with bits added by God for administrative overhead. It's been a while since I read it, but IIRC, people have a little XML tag listing their official rank in the universe's hierarchy, and people with higher ranks can create magic items in a sort of do-what-I-mean visualization (as well as getting a bunch of physical bonuses to their bodies, and some sort of mental compulsion.) Also, there are a bunch of pocket dimensions and teleporters and stuff that can be reconfigured to /resemble/ mundane technology, but actually work because their functioning is specified directly in the laws of physics.
