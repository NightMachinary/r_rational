Many of Ted Chiang's stories have interesting, well thought out, alternative laws of nature. For example in 72 letters Chiang takes the idea of "rabbis animating golems to demonstrate mastery of the art of permutating letters" and takes it to its logical conclusion and builds a dna like concept for animating matter and describes how evolution and biology would work out in that kind of scenario.

Or Hell is the Absence of God, where Chiang presents God exactly as he is depicted in the Bible and similar monotheist works: inscrutable, all-powerful, beyond any human comprehensions of good or evil. Then he set out to explore the actual consequences of that idea.
