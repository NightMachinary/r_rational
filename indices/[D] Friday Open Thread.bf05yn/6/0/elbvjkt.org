I have a friend that can just look at the shape he needs to cut, and can cut something that fits well with minimal measurement. I get the impression that some peoples' brains are just wired for physical tasks better than others. Things you own that are handmade by others are more likely to be made by these kinds of people than otherwise. So as a conjecture, while there are probably things you own that are slightly off, most things should be pretty accurate.
