A few excellent boardgames have had Android ports without shitty business models. They are noticeably more expensive upfront, but you pay for quality.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czechgames.tta&hl=en_GB][/Through the Ages/]], excellent civilization-style optimisation card game. Currently ranked [[https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame?sort=rank&rankobjecttype=subtype&rankobjectid=1&rank=3#3][3rd best boardgame of all time]] on boardgamegeek, and I tend to agree. Very good port

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.czechgames.galaxytrucker][/Galaxy Trucker/]]: a frantic real-time spaceship building phase, followed by an extensive scoring phase where your ship will go on adventures and slowly fall to pieces.

- [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fowers.paperback][/Paperback/]] and/or [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.fowers.hardback][/Hardback/]], two solid deck-building word games. /Paperback/ is the simple clean design, while /Hardback/ has more complex boardgame mechanics.
