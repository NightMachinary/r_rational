This is going to be very damaging for my productivity but does anyone have any paid android games to recommend that don't have ads or IAP? I'd much rather pay $4 for a decent game than get a "free" game that requires me to buy gems to make decent progression or sit through ads in between every two levels. I don't want any of those games that you pay an IAP to remove the ads but there are still other IAP for extra "clue scrolls" or whatever shit, and though I'd love a completely free game I'd also love to support a more "honest" business model.

My recommendations:

- Achikaps, a real time strategy game. The free version has 50 levels and no ads. The paid version has ~150 levels, no ads, and more features

- Mini Metro, a puzzle game. I don't think it has a free version but it's extremely addictive even if there's a bug at the moment that makes some of the achievements almost impossible to get.

(And yes, my phone is rooted and does have an ad blocker)
