I would most likely run it on sufficientvelocity.

Quests are games where the QM controls the world and npcs, while the forum/players control a single person. Most quests work by having the players work on and vote on a plan together, with the QM replying with how the plan turned out in the form of an in universe story.

It's a LOT of fun ^{_^}
