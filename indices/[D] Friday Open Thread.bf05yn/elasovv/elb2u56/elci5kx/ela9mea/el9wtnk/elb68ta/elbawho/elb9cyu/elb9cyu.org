The amazing free Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup has an android port. Rougelike, eg. terrible graphics, permadeath (no save/reloading), high replay value, focus on interesting decisionmaking. Grinding is against the games philosophy, there is for a example a button for autoexplore, autotravel, you have ingame-wide search.

Highly addictive, but great for inducing flow (and rage!)
