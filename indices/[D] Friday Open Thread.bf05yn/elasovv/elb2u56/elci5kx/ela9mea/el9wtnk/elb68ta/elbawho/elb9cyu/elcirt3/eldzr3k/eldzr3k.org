I have put Through the Ages on my wishlist - it's expensive but if it's good then I'd love to support it!

And the "related" games that show up on the sidebar give me some more places to poke around.

I've got the old Androdominion deckbuilder (not available anymore, but the apk still is) on my phone which is fun to break out every now and again, so Paperback and Hardback might be perfect for me!

Galaxy Trucker isn't grabbing me. I wish Android had a more lax refund policy because if I had a couple of hours to try it out instead of 15 minutes I'd be willing to take a gamble on it. Still might do it though but again another wishlist one.
