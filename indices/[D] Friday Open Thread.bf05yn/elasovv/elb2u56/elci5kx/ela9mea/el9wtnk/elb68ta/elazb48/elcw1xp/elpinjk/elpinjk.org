Anyone know how difficult it would be to code a solid forum designed specifically for writing? When I do get time to write again, I would like a decent place for it, and I can't find anything I like.

Some features that I would like to see:

- Authors have full control of their threads.
- multiple sub threads for each fiction thread.
- heuristic reading suggestions based on other people who like things you like.
- heuristic moderation so the community can moderate itself.

For instance, if I create a thread for a story, I will have three sub threads. Beta. Release. Edited.

Beta could be password protected. Release would be open to all. Edited could be password protected.

Each subsection would have a full thread devoted to each chapter.

Chapter threads would actually be properly threaded, in the old school News Net style, so multiple unrelated conversations could happen without diluting everything.

I believe that heuristic moderation would end up requiring some sort of user validation.

Perhaps a fee of 1.00 per month to validate accounts, and allow comments and liking/disliking?

Perhaps redistribute those membership fees back to active writers based off of who the paying customers read?

Allow users to donate at will, to individual authors or to the writer's pool as a built in feature?

In essence, I would like a site dedicated to both writing and reading fiction, at multiple stages, with automatic protections to prevent botters and zergs.

I want this enough that I might even consider paying to have it designed.
