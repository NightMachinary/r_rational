I too enjoyed that game, though my all-time favorite idle game is [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shirobakama.logquest2&hl=en_US][Logging Quest 2.]] Similar to Merchant, the game is about sending adventurers to go on an adventure, but the adventure is actually given details, with each action recorded real-time on a log you can view at any time. It's much more combat-focused, so instead of managing and crafting items, you spent your time on costumizing your characters' stats and tech tree. You can even built instructions for your npcs, the extreme being making a flowchart to fully control the combat. There's not much to do once you've sent your party off to an adventure, though you can check the adventure log to see how they are progressing and follow along.
