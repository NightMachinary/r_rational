Should I apply to business school next year? Help me identify my cognitive biases and gaps in my thinking.

Background: Will be attending law school next year. Original plan was a dual JD/MBA. Years of work experience in running my startup, tech, and automation.

Long term goals, in order of importance: My personal happiness, financial stability (I never want to be poor again), maximized global utility.

I never intended to practice as a lawyer so the JD-only path was unexpected. I had vague thoughts of legal tech, e.g. automation tools for lawyers and clients to increase availability of legal service for all. Not committed to this path.

After only being accepted to law school, I realized that I could accomplish my legal tech goals without an MBA. I'm not sure how much if that is post-hoc rationalization.

Pros for MBA: Relatively easy re-application. I only need to rewrite a couple essays. Foot is already in the door because I'm in the JD program.

Cons: 1 extra year of my life. 65k tuition. Unsure of marginal utility of JD/MBA vs. only JD.

I'm leaning towards reapplying because the application process itself is quite easy. However, I want to fully think through whether I even need/want an MBA before submitting an app and mentally locking myself in.
