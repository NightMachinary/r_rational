You need to look at whether a MBA is going to get you anything that your experience of running a business hasn't already gotten you. Degrees are fundamentally about giving you the tools you need to be successful in the realms you want to pursue. If you already possess those tools, then the degree is thousands of dollars that is unnecessarily spent. Seeing as you also don't seem to want any kind of professional certifications either, the degree is only providing tools. Masters programs in general are more for people who want to go super specific down one lane of their expertise, and honestly I think you already have that with JD. What you want to do seems to rely more on the understanding of legal processes, and while an MBA might give you the tools to achieve that faster or to a greater success. It's not gonna give you tools that you can't necessarily gain on your own.

Personally, the Cons seem to be very big long term things, whereas the Pros seem to be very short term benefits. I would personally just stick with doing the JD in your place. But at the same time, if you think the tools an MBA would give is worth more than the costs, go for it.
