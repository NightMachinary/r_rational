It's not just that I'm unfamiliar with the tropes, rather those tropes (the red ones) are something I wouldn't want to see in the stories I am reading.

  that list takes out 99.9% of Chinese novels

What if the full-translation bullet point was more of a hope\wish than a requirement, and the trope blacklist can be ignored if the author somehow manages to do them really well, does that change anything?

#+begin_quote
  The Chinese translation scene is fairly new .. just skip Chinese web novels while waiting for the scene to grow

That's what the two titles I've tried left me feeling too, like the genre wasn't old enough to become self-concoius about itself an its use of tropes yet, in contrast with what's happening more and more now with the Western fantasy / sci-fi stuff.

Also, thanks for the reply. I've also picked out /Against the Gods/ and /My Disciple Died Yet Again/ based on earlier references here, so I think I'll try starting these several stories and leave it at that, for the next several years.
