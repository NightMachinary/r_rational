Can someone who's familiar with the Chinese & co. web-published literature shelf give me some pointers?

Recently [[/u/DR_Hero]] mentioned some titles here, and I decided to try out [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/demons-diary/][Demon's Diary]] first, thinking that maybe it would be from the perspective --- or the eventual perspective --- of a demon writing down how it became what it currently is ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/4q9b4u/cn_demons_diary_chapter_139/d4r608x?context=3][not the case]]).

In this story there was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/4mrty0/glossary_of_terms_in_wuxia_xianxia_xuanhuan_novels/][a bunch of tropes]] so deeply ingrained into it that the author often didn't even explain in detail what they were about. It felt like reading a fanfiction, only the origin itself wasn't a singular title, but rather maybe the Chinese wuxia genre and a bastardized version(?) of the Chinese belief system / wordview.

After that I tried starting [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/cdindex-html/][Coiling Dragon]], but the writing style felt kinda childish and based on [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CoilingDragon][its tropes page]] it seemed like it would have a bunch of Deus ex machina / major lucky Natural20 moments for the hero.

Anyway, I am looking for translated titles that:

- 1. don't have [[https://imgur.com/a/Sp5Et][any of these highlighted elements]] in them;
- 2. don't have [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWritingIndex][Bad Writing Index]] tropes, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][idiocy]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills][tropes]], etc;
- 3. don't deal with harem and fanservice, poorly concocted romance and drama;
- 4. are well-written in general in terms of writing style and plot design (e.g. no filler chapters);
- 5. hopefully are fully translated.

Also, if you know any such stories please give some details of your own. The summaries that come with the stories are usually not that helpful.
