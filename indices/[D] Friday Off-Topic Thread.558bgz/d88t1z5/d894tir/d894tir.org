Wow, that list takes out 99.9% of Chinese novels. The Chinese translation scene is fairly new, not including classic Wuxia(Martial Hero) novels. Novels with everything you are looking for are probably not even translated. As for tropes...

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/legend-of-the-cultivation-god/][Legend of the Cultivation God]] pretty much walks you through every step of the way, and should do well at introducing you to the wuxia tropes.

[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/heaven-awakening-path/][Heavens Awaken Path]] is the best I can think of without many tropes. It's... ok, and early in it's translation.

I haven't read much of it, but [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/chronicles-of-primordial-wars/?pg=3][Chronicles of Primordial Wars]] might be good. Although there is reincarnation to start it off. It's a very common trope. The author cheekily named himself Lazy Clich√©.

Coiling Dragon is written by a popular author known as I Eat Tomatoes. There is no plot, only inexplicable power ups.

--------------

Without Trope knowledge, I would just skip Chinese web novels while waiting for the scene to grow and look for some Korean or Japanese ones. The Japanese translation scene has been around longer and has a wider selection, but I'm not too familiar with it.

The Korean web novel [[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/][Evolution Theory of the Hunter]] isn't bad. Although you may be frustrated with the MC not noticing a girls affection. It's so obvious that I'm pretty sure he knows, but doesn't want to change the relationship.

I wouldn't go in expecting gold, and I may be missing some unknown genius novel out there that I haven't read. I won't claim to have read even half of the translated asian web novels out there. Female targeted historical romance novels are also a big part of the Chinese translation scene, but I haven't read much of them.
