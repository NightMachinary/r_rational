Against the Gods will leave you disappointed. The author regularly spends 5+ chapters describing how peerlessy beautiful the newest girl he will eventually bang is, because no girl can resist a main character.

My Disciple Died Yet Again is a bit of a parody. Lots of comedy, and it avoid a lot of the common tropes.

Histories Number One founder is another parody if you find you enjoy those sorts of novels.
