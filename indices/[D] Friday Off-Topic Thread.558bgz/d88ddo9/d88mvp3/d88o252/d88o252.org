I actually just barely finished an essay on that very subject, which [[http://reddit.com/r/rational/comments/558bgz/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d88dbhu][I posted higher up in the thread]].

TL;DR is: build the game around the role you've chosen, make sure rules interact with one another in logical manners, and try to build a metagame, whether it's single or multi player.
