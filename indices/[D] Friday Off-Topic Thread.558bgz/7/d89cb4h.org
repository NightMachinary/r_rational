In a Dungeons and Dragons game I'm playing, I'm playing a paranoid wizard who is deathly afraid of mind magic. Among other precautions he has taken, my vision of him has him using a "Post mind affecting magic exposure flowchart", to help determine if his will has been compromised. Obviously this wouldn't work on more complete forms of mind control (Dominate Person), but I feel it would be rather effective against magical diplomacy and charm person.

I've made a mock-up of said chart, but as I'm roleplaying a character both smarter and more motivated than myself, I feel he would have done a much better job with it than I have.

Are there any obvious improvements/flaws I should add to/remove from this?
