Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, which for now is work on the data creation tool Bill's PC([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=drive_web][previous threads here]]):

So it looks like I managed to get about 80% of what I planned last week completed. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Co3cS6p_5h6HGs3tzjbJRRbUFd-vI2njVGjYyz8jwE4/edit?usp=drive_web][The documentation is now up]], though it's already somewhat out of synch with Bill's PC itself, which I guess is just the nature of the beast. If you can't run it, the docs still have some useful info like a breakdown of the meaning of stats and a liberal application of screenshots.

The Bahavior and Size sections were added to the species definition tab:

The height and weight were pulled from the stats and placed here since they're so relevant to how the tile calculation works. Someone on the Discord server pointed out that the behavior toggles would work much better as sliders, and so that change still needs to be implemented.

Speaking of Discord, [[https://discord.gg/sM99CF3][come join us]]! A #pokengineering channel was created that is dedicated to discussion on the game and has become invaluable to me for idea bouncing, but even besides that, it's a great community filled with other denizens of [[/r/rational]]. Special thanks to [[/u/InfernoVulpix]], [[/u/Cariyaga]], [[/u/UltraRedSpectrum]], and Aabcehmu for all their feedback and help so far wrangling the design to something managable.

I'm currently in the middle of redesigning the Respect/Loyalty mechanic, as some awkwardnesses in its design were brought to light. [[http://i.imgur.com/k3x7pLol.jpg][Here is a graph]] showing off some tentative values for the replacement system, with size of the bubble being aggressiveness.

Goals this week are to bring the documentation up to speed, finish hammering out the design issues with RESP/LOYAL, finish polishing off the last few features in these two new sections, /possibly/ add a generator to the graph screen, and then start working on the move tab (finally).

I also finished my rational game essay, which I put in a separate comment for simpler discussion.
