I'm curious why you consider a value system, which assigns a higher value to certain people based on their familiarity, far-fetched. Valuing different persons' life differently I find quite intuitive, as both the words 'person' and 'life' are arbitrarily chosen points on a continuum (not that there is anything wrong with that). Consider the following problem:

Would you save one person who has 11 years left to live, by killing two with 5 years each? What about two with 6 months? Or a week? A second?

I would, even if I understand many people disagreeing. Going further, what about other species? Should one assign a cow more value than a human? Two cows? A hundred?

With cows there is, of course, the argument of intelligence. Anothing scenario: Would you sacrifice a human to save a member of some species with higher intelligence somewhere in the galaxy? (A hundred humans?)

Again, I don't think it's clear. And if the answer is 'no', then there is already a bias towards those near us. Saving Chloe is just a matter of moving the point on the continuum a bit further.
