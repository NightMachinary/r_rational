This is an interesting analogy, but I don't think it holds here. There is the implication that there is a 'true' territory, which the map tries to describe. Calling a value system invalid is to me equivalent to calling the statement 'the universe was created a second ago by an orange unicorn' invalid. The latter cannot be disproven, of course, much like one cannot infer the wrongness of a morality from just logic alone. In practice, we consider statements based on whether they are useful. Similarly, I /do/ think that calling moral systems wrong is perfectly valid, but it is always from a certain perspective that defines one's goals. As long as other systems do not hinder my goals (which may include things like the survival of the species) unreasonably /in practice/, I'm fine with that. So, my point is that in theory, the systems differ in just a few constants and not in principle, and in practice, they converge for most probable situations.
