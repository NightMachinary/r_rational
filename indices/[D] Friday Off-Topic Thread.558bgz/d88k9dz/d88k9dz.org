The below comment is a repost from a previous Monday, General Rationality thread. Didn't get much responses (because I posted it days later) so I decided to re-post it here and see what responses I receive:

This comment will contain massive spoilers for the game /Life is Strange/. If you are playing, or want to play the game, then I would heavily suggest you avoid reading this comment. Normally, I'd spoiler-text it but then the entire comment would be pretty much black and I don't want to do that. So I'm giving you fair warning here. Spoilers lie ahead.

Ok so, long story short, Life is Strange is the story of a small town girl, the protaganist, who somehow acquires time reversal powers (think Prince of Persia time rewinding as opposed to /Back to the Future/ type travel) and rewinds time to save her best friend, Chloe, from being shot in an altercation in a school bathroom, which you do in the early stages of the game. It's a game sort of like Heavy Rain, so more of an interactive movie than anything else. The game's heavy on allowing you to make your own choices about things, and will give you stats on how you chose compared to the other players.

As the game progresses, Chloe dies several times (with you rewinding to save her each time) in increasingly far fetched (though nothing straight out supernatural) ways. Think Final Destination. Each time, you have to go further and further to save her, compromising your morals just a bit more in some scenarios. The game's climax is a standard "fate is real" sort of thing. Chloe was meant to die in that bathroom at the beginning of the game. Time does not like you mucking with it. Cue supernatural superstorm coming to wipe out your hometown. The game gives you the choice: Go back in time and let Chloe die in that bathroom or allow the storm to wipe out the town. The implication is that, once the storm wipes out the town, the universe will be satisfied and Chloe's fate will 'reset' so if you save her, she'll actually be saved. No fatalistic trolling. So...what choice do you make?

To me, as I'm sure it is to most rationalists, the choice is clear: *Let Chloe die.* There's simply no way to justify sacrificing hundreds (possibly thousands) of lives for one. However, literally every single person I've asked this question of in my life (3 close friends, 4 coworkers who I'd call acquaintances) said they'd save their friend and let the town die. Once I added the caveat that we would assume everyone you know in town is elsewhere and so left inside it are just thousands of people you don't know, the hesitant no's became resounding yes'. And this perplexed me.

I understand the impulse; from a human stand point, we suck at caring for things that aren't right in front of us. I know this. But I just thought, intellectually speaking, everyone would be able to suck it up and rise above their basic nature. And....I was swiftly proven wrong. And also called a bad friend for not being willing to sacrifice hundreds of innocents for my own selfish desires to keep my friend alive. GG.

I mostly wrote this to see what some of your opinions/insights on this would be. And also what you would choose in the scenario. Actually, any and all discussion that could branch off from this is cool with me. Go nuts!
