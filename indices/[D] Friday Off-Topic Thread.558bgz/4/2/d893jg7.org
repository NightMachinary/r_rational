Have you looked at the rules for [[https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140163/pandante][Pandante]]? It's technically a hold'em style game, but at the end you use special powers based on your hidden cards suits. Which you can bluff, but if called you either pay a sidepot and lose the power or reveal the suit (the cards are built to reveal the suit w/o showing rank) to win a sidepot and still use the power.

(And you can call a suit you have and then pay the side pot as a double bluff).

Has other features of interest. You have to claim early on the hand you have (or better) and can never lower your claim, and call also draw and discard to cycle your hole cards, but the cost depends on how high your claim is with respect to the highest claim, and also has a joker that you (sometimes) discard because using the joker costs you money.

Lots of interesting ideas in Pandante.
