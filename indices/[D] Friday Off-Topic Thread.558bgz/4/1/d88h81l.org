As part of the third-and-a-half rule, I not only want the dice to affect the cards, but the cards should affect the dice. As a simple option, maybe each player has the option each bid to spend one of their cards to roll a die, sacrificing their resources for the possibility of changing the current environment for everyone. (And maybe they even get to keep the spent card if the roll matches its suit.) This seems reasonably likely to make dice-rolling expensive enough that the common cards are at least generally stable, while not being absolutely reliable; but also seems like the sort of thing that would need actual playtesting to find out whether that's the case.
