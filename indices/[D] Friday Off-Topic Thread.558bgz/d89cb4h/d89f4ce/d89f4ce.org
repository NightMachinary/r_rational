The flowchart is a bit redudant. The first two items are "did a non-friend cast on you?", then "did a friend cast on you?", which could be condensed. Most of the chart is basically "Did your opinion about something change after the spell was cast, and do you think the change is based on rational reasons?", which is kind of useless.

I'm not sure how to put it, but detecting a bias is harder than just wondering "am I biased about anything at all?". It's more about double-checking every choice you make, asking other peoples for insights and different perspectives, and avoiding rash actions. So, more like a bunch of good habits to keep than a flowchart you can check every so often.
