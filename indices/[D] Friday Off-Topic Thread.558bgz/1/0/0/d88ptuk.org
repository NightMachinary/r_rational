After trying to use the web client for fanficfare to get hpmor from ffn, I can comment on this somewhat.

- fff doesn't seem to export pdfs.

- It seems to take a really long time. 20 minutes later it hasn't finished processing. Omnibuser handles something the size of hpmor in about 5 minutes. Omnibuser also caches stories in a database, so the second (and all subsequent) person to request hpmor will receive the file almost instantly, only waiting for omnibuser to check if new chapters have been posted and create the actual file.

- Omnibuser is prettier and has an /awesomecool!/ progress bar so you know how long things are going to take.

- Omnibuser does not require you to give it your email address.
