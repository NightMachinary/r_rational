Hm. My language of choice is C#. I just looked into that.

It can add methods to existing classes, change/add operators in my own classes which if they inherit could be interchangeable through polymorphism, list methods/parameters through reflection.

But I think modifying existing methods/operators for things like string for example is not possible. Seems very powerful like a part of Aspect oriented programming for cross cutting concerns but also extremely easy to abuse. Almost like goto.

Is that sometimes a problem in the Ruby community?
