I've made a [[http://www.omnibuser.com/][web-based tool]] for downloading fanfiction in a variety of formats. Right now it supports downloading from:

- fanfiction.net
- fictionpress.com
- sufficientvelocity
- spacebattles
- questionablequesting

This is very much still in beta. I just finished rewriting a bunch of backend stuff today, even. There will definitely be bugs, and features that could use more polish. In particular there are some serious performance issues that I need to sort out.

But I think it's at the point where it should work most of the time for most people, so I'm throwing it out there for anybody who might find it useful, with the above caveats.

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for feature improvements, please let me know!
