I love Ruby. It's really fun to write code in for a bunch of reasons. It's pure object oriented... The expression 1 + 2 is literally calling the "+" method on the object "1" of class Integer and passing the object "2" as an argument. It also gives you total freedom to extend or modify standard library classes, for example you can completely redefine that "+" method, which I've never seen allowed in anther language but is sometimes very useful. The syntax is really pleasant too, the docs are good, and the community is great.

Rails is a pretty good web framework, and there's a lot of Rails jobs in my area (Dublin). Neither Ruby or Rails is perfect, but I've been enjoying them so far.
