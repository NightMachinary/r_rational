From a utilitarian perspective, this translates into a 2 player Game. Assume both you and your friend value the total number of people who survive, and all people have the same value. Then if strategy 1 is "don't pull the lever" and strategy 2 is pull the lever, the payoff matrix is:

10 25

25 20

The pure Nash equilibria are (1,2) and (2,1). Obviously, one of you pulls the lever and the other doesn't, this creates the best situation. 25 out of 30 people will survive. But with no way to communicate it's not clear how decide this. There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium, which has both players pull the lever 3/4 of the time (and not pull 1/4 of the time). This strikes me as the most reasonably achievable solution, and has an average score of 85/4, or 21.25 out of 30 people will survive. Just flip a coin twice, and only pull the lever if both are tails. If your friend does the same, you get this result.

Although if there any any implicit biases that we could exploit to choose a street and only have the person with that street pull their lever. For example, is Sidestreet A literally called Sidestreet A? Does it have a proper name? Pick whichever street shows up first alphabetically, and that person pulls their lever. If everyone follows this strategy, we get the optimum 25 out of 30 survival rate.
