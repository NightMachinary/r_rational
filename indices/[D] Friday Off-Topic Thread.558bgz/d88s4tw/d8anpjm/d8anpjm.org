Pull the lever. This kills five people, and "kills" another five when my friend reasons likewise. Ten deaths are worth it to save the 20 people in the cars.

(Honestly, I have no actual idea what I'd do in this situation. Freak out, probably.)

To be clear, the two side-streets /don't/ connect, right? This is very similar to a meme version where they connect, and thus both of you pulling the lever would kill /everyone/.
