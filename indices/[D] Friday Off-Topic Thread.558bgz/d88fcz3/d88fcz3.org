*Seeking help: designing a new poker variant*

I'm trying to work out a novel variation of poker, for potential use in one or more [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/][rat-fic]] stories. I have a few general approaches in mind, but I'm having trouble clearing up some details, and could use some help. Anyone here up for a gab on the topic? Or know where else I can ask?

--------------

I've pinned down three vital details, from which the rest of my thoughts flow. First, the game has to be something that might be carried around in the pocket of a post-apocalyptic survivor, and/or an 18th-century hobo. So a fixed deck of cards, dice, maybe a simple board on a piece of cloth; nothing mechanical, let alone electronic. Second, it needs to include at least some aspect that's familiar to the reader, so they have a hook to start understanding it; I'm thinking of poker hands. And third, the whole point of the game, both in-universe and as a narrative tool, is to focus on flows of information: who knows what, and how that affects their behaviour. (I suppose third-and-a-half would be at least some minimal level of good game design. :) )

At the moment, I'm considering an extremely modified version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_variants#Oxford_stud][Oxford stud]]: with community cards, face-up cards, /and/ hole cards, there's a rich selection of info and potential secrets. But I don't want the players to be completely, passively stuck with their shared environment and their individual resources; I want to include at least the occasional possibility of a player having a choice about whether or not to modify them (said decision thus adding a new piece of information for everyone to mull over), as well as the option to share secrets with each other (voluntarily or otherwise). So I'm considering adding some dice labelled with the cards' suits; perhaps each player gets to roll 3 such dice, and if they wish, toss out any cards they can see that matches one of the dice's face-up suits, to be replaced with a freshly-dealt one. I haven't figured out what mechanism would let one player peek at one of the hole cards of another player, though the dice would likely be involved. I also haven't figured out the overall rhythm of the game - ie, which cards are dealt when.

(I'm also thinking of stealing a bit of fluff from another traditional game, and using the [[http://www.ericharshbarger.org/dice/#crown_and_anchor][dice]] from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_and_Anchor]["Crown and Anchor"]], which already have the 4 standard suits on them, as well as the titular symbols; and adding those two logos as another two suits of cards, ala the [[https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic311930_md.jpg]["Empire Deck"]] published a few years ago.)

Any thoughts come to mind?
