I strongly disagree with that kind of thinking. There's a line between "morality isn't important to me" and "morality isn't important". Even if the selfish choice is more realistic, or more likely to be picked by most people, I would not be okay with anyone else doing it. I /might/ do it, then I would hate myself for it.
