As someone who prefers the "Save Chloe" ending, I think it makes sense. It's easy to make the utilitarian choice when when you don't know any of the people involved. But I would make the choice that satisfies me, not a choice that I think is necessarily "right". I might feel guilty letting innocents die to save someone I care about, but that wouldn't outweigh the fact that on my personal utilitarian scale someone I care about is worth thousands of strangers. I think most people agree, especially when it comes to their kids. At the end of the day morality is something people follow when it doesn't inconvenience them too much
