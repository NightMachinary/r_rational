LIFE IS STRANGE SPOILERS My thoughts on reaching that ending were basically just "I'm not buying this nonsense. If it was a clear cut choice between Chloe and 1000 people that would be one thing, but I haven't seen any firm evidence that convinces me that killing Chloe would stop this storm." The supernatural events in that story were always quite strange and never closely tied together. The best example of this for me was the moon duplication. That is very clearly a major worldwide event that can't clearly be tied back to you. While there are some signs that you mucking with things was tied to the storm, I didn't feel like the game made a good enough case to kill a close friend based on so little. I can't say for sure, but I think it is quite possible that some of the people you have talked to got the same sort of vibes from those elements of the story even if they didn't articulate them in your discussions.
