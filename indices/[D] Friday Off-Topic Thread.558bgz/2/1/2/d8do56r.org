That's basically how most people deal with ethical dilemmas. Instead of evaluating the pros and cons, they convince themselves that there is no dilemma.

That's why there are people who believe raising the minimum wage has no drawbacks (or that eliminating it will have no drawbacks).

That's why there are people who believe Big Pharma is greedy and can be forced by governments to produce more medicine at lesser cost (and also people who believe abolishing the FDA will sort everything out with no bad consequences).

It's very difficult for people in real life to bite the bullets, so to speak, but we can at least try not to do that in fiction. [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/bwp/please_dont_fight_the_hypothetical/][Don't fight the hypothetical]].
