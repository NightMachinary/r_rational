The first thing you mentioned was taken care of by the caveat I added, in which I let the people I asked the question to assume all of the people they know had already left, which somewhat fits with the game as the protagonist is there for boarding school, so most of her close friends/relatives are elsewhere.

The second and third things are vastly outweighed by the cost of human life, to 99 percent of people I'd imagine. Those things are annoyances compared to that. No one's going to care about losing possible references for college applications when they basically let hundreds of people die out of their own selfishness.
