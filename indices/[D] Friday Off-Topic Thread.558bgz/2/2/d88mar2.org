My understanding from reading Spacebattles was that most people picked the utilitarian option first, then the "save your friend" option to see what it's like.

But yeah, obvious right choice is obvious. Therefore very difficult to explain or justify.

Maybe with follow-up questions?

- Either your friend dies, or everyone in the town. No one has been evacuated.

- Same choice. Your friends have been evacuated.

- Same choice. Your friends have been evacuated. Their families haven't.

- Same choice. Everyone has been evacuated, except for children under the age of ten. They will die violently, most of them in horrible pain, and none of them will understand what happened or why they have to die.

- Same choice. No one has been evacuated. Not your friends, not their families, not the children.

Also, Chloe is really kind of an awful person. [insert awful natural selection joke here]
