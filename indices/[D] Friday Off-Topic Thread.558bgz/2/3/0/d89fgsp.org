I think saying "Morality is unclear, therefore you can't say this moral system is invalid" is wrong, because it means inferring an uncertain territory from an uncertain map. I tend to think that morality is ultimately subjective, and I have no good answers to aggregation questions (like the "one person with 11 years vs two with 5 years" one). But I still think that the "Kill your friend vs Kill a thousand people" choice, with no other information, has only one acceptable answer that all human beings should choose.

There are several arguments, like the fact that the friend you're saving also has friends and a family you're condemning, or that the only way you can view saving your friend as acceptable is by ignoring the deaths of very nice people you could probably be friends with if you got to know them. But I mostly wanted to make a point about the "uncertain territory" thing.
