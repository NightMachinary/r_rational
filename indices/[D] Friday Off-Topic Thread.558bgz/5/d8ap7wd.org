I just watched the "Zerg Attack" S2:HoTs trailer, that takes place in Paris and Versailles, and I thought... just once, I'd like a movie alien invasion to take place in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_D%C3%A9fense#/media/File:Panorama_La_D%C3%A9fense.jpg][La Défense]], which is the closest thing France has to a New York style skyscraper city.

La Défense is a major business district northwest of Paris, and most notable for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_D%C3%A9fense#/media/File:Grande_Arche_de_La_D%C3%A9fense_et_fontaine.jpg][Grande Arche]], and its 30 hectares "slab", on which most of the buildings are built, which is a giant construction over which only pedestrians are allowed, while cars circulate in roads built under/inside the slab (it's less cyberpunk-y than it sounds, but not much).

But most movie alien invasions only take place in the USA, and then only in New York or sometimes San Francisco. The rare worldwide alien invasions only occur in Paris, and then only in the immediate area around the Eiffel tower. I want my La Defense urban war!

Edit: One recent movie that broke this mold was /The Edge of Tomorrow/, which mostly took place in France and UK, with the climax taking place in The Louvre (I think there wasn't even a Eiffel Tower shot in the whole movie, which was so fucking refreshing). Actually, this movie was really fun to watch as a french guy. It even had a shot with François flippin Hollande!
