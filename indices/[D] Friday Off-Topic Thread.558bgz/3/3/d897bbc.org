I'd pull the lever. or at the very least do my best to force myself into it.

People will find it exceptionally difficult to murder others and considering that I'm not friends with sociopaths (to the best of my knowledge), I can't trust that they will pull the levers. Most people find it easier to chose to do "nothing" even if it leads to more people dying. However, I would consider myself responsible for the deaths even if I didn't pull the lever.

So in summary, my model of general human nature and of my friends' natures tell me that they will be very unlikely to pull the lever, so I should pull the lever myself.
