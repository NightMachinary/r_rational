A trolley with ten people in it is hurtling down Main Street, where it will collide with another trolley with ten people in it, killing everyone on-board. You may redirect the trolley down Sidestreet A, where it will run over five people tied to the tracks. Your friend across town, who you have no communication with, may redirect the other trolley down Sidestreet B, where it will run over five people tied to the tracks. If the trolleys don't collide, the people on the trolleys will survive.
