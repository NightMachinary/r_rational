I think the worldbuilding is the most solid part of the fic.

Story wise, I'm well aware of that trap some authors hit where they put all their skill points into worldbuild and none into the story and characters. And since this is my first story, I went with following the mechanics instead of trying to subvert or throw a unique twist into it. The worldbuilding has plenty of twists already covered.

So I studied and banked on the standard hero's journey formula: A duo of mismatched talents gets tossed into an ordeal that forces them to work together and overcome their separate flaws in order to survive.

The main lead is a tech gremlin who's got a wild childhood that's warped his common sense. Excellent at tech, terrible with general fighting, and far too curious for his own good.

The side lead is a grizzled old veteran who's terrible with tech but the duo's heavy hitter, and a staunch traditionalist that all things engineering and 'scholarly' is a waste of time at best, and liable to get people killed at worse.

Both character look down on each other at first but slowly grow to work together as a real team.
