A lot of world building in this chapter, and I have a theory. Spoilers for chapter 20 below.

So the Deathless are memory-less invincibles that randomly arrive in the world. Well, given the post-apocalyptic nature of the world, what if these Deathless are actually people from the pre-apocalypse, who found a way to survive either by cryosleeping far beneath the ground and continuing life in VR, or maybe they all uploaded their consciousnesses to a data server drifting around in space, either could work.

But of course, people get bored of VR existence, and so they invent something fun to do with their time. They've figured out a way to transport themselves back into the frozen wasteland of earth (nanobots or something, idk), were they can have fun, dungeon-delving adventures for as long as they want before eventually returning to VR land. Naturally they have their memories wiped before this experience so that information about the lost generation isn't spread and endangers their existence.

That is all, thank you for coming to my ted talk.
