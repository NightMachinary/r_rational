I tackled it like an engineering problem, bought a few of the most recommended books detailing everything that the big writers have learned up to now. Then studied it all applying each lesson one at a time into the whole thing. Kind of like a newbie cook following a tried and true recipe for cream puffs, with a focus on making sure all the ingredients and steps are followed. I only started releasing chapters once the whole was already complete and every lesson had been incorporated.

I'd like to think of it as an experiment in finding out if solid fundamentals can make even the weakest author write a solid story.
