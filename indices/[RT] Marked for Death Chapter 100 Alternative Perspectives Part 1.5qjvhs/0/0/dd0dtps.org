Good, sounds like we've written him right if you're responding emotionally. As to the specifics, please keep in mind that he's a 13-year-old boy with insecurity- and mild body-image issues.

On a related topic: I often find the genin hard to write because it's always a balance between "here is how my model of a a 13-year-old would react" (which is based on experience with 21st-century American kids) and "here's how a child soldier from feudal Japan would react" (which is based purely on guesswork).
