So I'm putting more weight on the anti-astronomy policy being an attempt by the Knids to hide doing some sort of astroengineering to either remove the atmosphere or make something that can drop the entire army.

President Definitely-Not-A-Sentient-Table was likely a Knid that managed to enter the atmosphere by accident or by non-scalable technology.

Further theorycrafting: CHOCOR was an attempt by Charlie to engineer enough superscientists to fight the Knids. The election of Kalan Kare-Amil, someone who will be of no help against the Knid menace, spurned him into reopening Pandora's box despite the massive dangers.

Further further theorycrafting: Kalan Kare-Amil was not just the lucky beneficiary of a lone Witch, but a purposeful choice to install a lone idiot into the White House as part of an alliance between the Witches, now on the edge of extinction via mouse-based assassination, and the Knids, who will kill all children in their planned genocide.
