A couple of users in the AW discord figured out Matilda might be Tide Honey's mother.

  Miss Honey was the name of Matilda's adopted mother, and Small Matador would have been a piece of fiction related to Trunchbull, with Matilda the titular small matador. Mother's name is M.H., for Matilda Honey. Though Honey is her last name and Tide is her first name, if I'm reading that right.
