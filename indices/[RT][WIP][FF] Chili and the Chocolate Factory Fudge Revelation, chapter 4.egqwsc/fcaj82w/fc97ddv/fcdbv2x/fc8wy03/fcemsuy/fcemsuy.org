So, just a thought, but there are clearly multiple Dahlesque influences in this story. I've noticed the BFG-style giants popping up, for example (not to mention the Witches).

But this implies a universe in which /all/ the Dahl book happened. In which James rode a giant peach across the Atlantic, and a little girl called Matilda once developed psychokinesis because her giant intellect was insufficiently stimulated. In which Henry Sugar can see through a card and tell you what it is in under three seconds (and is, as a direct result, banned from just about every casino in the world - not that the casinos necessarily know how he's doing it).

I do find myself wondering just what Matilda's up to in this timeline...
