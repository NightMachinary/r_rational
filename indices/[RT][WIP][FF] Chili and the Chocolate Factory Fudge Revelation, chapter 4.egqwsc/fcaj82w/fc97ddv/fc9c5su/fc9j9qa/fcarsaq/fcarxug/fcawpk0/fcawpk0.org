I think there is an answer, but I got this idea from another user, not myself: The riddle is “what do I like best?” which implies that there is a single answer, but the variety of winners shown so far implies there must be multiple answers. I think the solution is not necessarily /something/ you like but instead something you like /the most/. So you only win if you like something more than all the other billions of people like anything. Only the top six most extreme people will win the contest. Which is quite fitting for a Rational!Wonka, in my opinion.
