You think? I was thinking that anti-astronomy was created to avoid giving the knids any potential material to safely breach the atmosphere with, since even one getting in would likely end the world. However the existence of knids was so classified that even the anti-astro department itself doesn't know the reason why they suppress any interest in space and exploration, leading to shenanigans.
