Interesting. The first chapter was funny, the third onwards were not particularly moving (though I was disconcerted that Misaka was about two years older while Index was the same age) (though the events were different, they didn't strike me as that distanced from the sorts of events that regularly happened in the original), and the second chapter was awesome to the point where I find myself wanting to see a J.C.Staff anime adaptation of it.

Reflecting on my own motivations, I can separate this into 'I enjoyed a lot the anime battle scene where Index goes up against a golem (with the 'jellyfish' song background music)' and 'I really want to see that camouflaged plainclothes Index (doing things effectively--see golem point (the different mobile church approach was also nice))'.
