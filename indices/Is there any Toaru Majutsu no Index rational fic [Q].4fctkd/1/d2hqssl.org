Raildex "scientists" are, regrettably, beyond salvasion. They don't follow any kind of scientific method other than "prod it with a stick". Mages are a lot more scientific, ffs. And it kinda makes sence, since Academy City is ultimately ruled by one of the strongest mages in the world.

I think it'll take a full rewrite on the science side to turn Raildex into rational fic. The characters are good, at least, and magic too.
