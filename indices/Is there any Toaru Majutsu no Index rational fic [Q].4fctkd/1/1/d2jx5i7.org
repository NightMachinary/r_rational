(In a way, Kihara science reminds me of (Heterodyne-like?) steampunk, in terms of 'throw enough gears/tech at something' -> '???' -> 'Physical laws bend down and grovel'.)

More generally, an emerging pattern for Kazuma Kamachi works (at least the later volumes?) is 'Strange thing are happening!' -> 'What if those strange things are caused by /this specific far-fetched hypothesis pulled out of nowhere!?/' -> 'The hypothesis was absolutely right!', or else -> 'Oh no, it wasn't that hypothesis after all! That means it's probably this other, even-more-far-fetched hypothesis also pulled out of nowhere!' -> 'The hypothesis was absolutely right!'.

--Ah, and for Index I feel compelled to report my initial impression of 'for rational!Index, Accelerator would have rendered Kamijou incapable of standing with ease'. Then again, rational!Kamijou might try a more effective method of interacting with rational!Accelerator than trying to punch him.

Hmmm. Thinking about the overall matter, what I find I'd really like to see out of a rational Index fiction is to really get inside the head/software of Aleister, and actually see his grand self-correcting plans in detail while still being believable to the reader. This would also lend poignancy to those parts where he or others are showing emotion about his plans, since we could see /why/ he felt he had to or that he wanted to do those things, rather than have it all be vague hand-waving. Difficult, however, as I'm not convinced there's a coherent narrative that can believably explain the events Kamijou goes through (as serving a purpose for deliberate manipulations, even if separating intended and unintended phenomena) other than 'because reasons'.
