  Interesting. I've never really gotten into SCP, which means that this isn't intentional.

A common pattern in a lot of well written SCP logs/protocols is to start with something just slightly out of the ordinary that builds up to something impossible and bizarre. As it reaches the climax, additional information lets the reader make some sense of what is going, while also revealing an additional level of horror, bizarreness, and/or impossibility. It seems like you've executed 2/3s of this structure really well, which makes me excited for the conclusion.

  You mean they're screwing with the /narrator/ (Mike). As chapter 0 suggests, the /author/ might actually be Cio :)

Ah.., yeah I forgot about the ambiguity of the in-story author's identity.
