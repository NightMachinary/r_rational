Mike is receiving "unpublished" recordings from Sein. That's the nature of the library. One of the audio logs is recursive in this manner because it has Sein reading a book he came up with himself: The index.

The library is a place where the line between reality and fiction is blurred. That's what I've gotten out of the clues in the prose.
