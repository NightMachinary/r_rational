We're getting closer and closer to the end. Next week, there's only going to be a single chapter, but don't worry. It's going to be a big one :)

I'd really like to know your guesses at what is going to happen next. What's the resolution regarding the mystery of the library you expect to see, and what might be _sein_'s fate?

Also, to settle an argument with a friend: I know I mix up British and American English (somewhat intentionally, even). Is this disorienting to a native speaker?
