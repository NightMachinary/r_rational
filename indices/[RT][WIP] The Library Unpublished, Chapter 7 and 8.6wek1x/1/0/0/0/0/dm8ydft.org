You know, I didn't like TNC ending on my first read, but after letting it sit awhile, in hindsight, it was actually pretty good... the anticlimactic ending gave it a sort of realism or verisimilitude that made the surreal parts better. Anyway, I'm sure I'll enjoy it even if it breaks off from the formula I'm expecting it to follow.
