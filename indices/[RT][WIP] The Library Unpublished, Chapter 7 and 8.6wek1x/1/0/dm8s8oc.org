Let me first state that the ending is already written and won't be changed based on your opinions and suggestions :)

#+begin_quote
  the suspense in the writing reminds me of SCP recovery logs

Interesting. I've never really gotten into SCP, which means that this isn't intentional.

  Cio or /sein/ are screwing with the author as part of an elaborate prank.
#+end_quote

You mean they're screwing with the /narrator/ (Mike). As chapter 0 suggests, the /author/ might actually be Cio :)

#+begin_quote
  The narrator is making up the events for his own ends
#+end_quote

Hmm! Very interesting. An unreliable narrator is, of course, always a possibility, though I don't think the foreshadowing to pull it of in a satisfying way is quite there.

Thank you for sharing your theories. This is why I post my stories in chapter installments :)
