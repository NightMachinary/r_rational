So current theories for the origin of the books:

- AI, either as a complicated scheme (if the AI is superhuman), or simply learning to write with different styles (is the AI is dumber, but still superhumanely fast at writing). Possibly an attempt by an AI to break through the meta layers of reality to our world by generating lots of meta-text?

- Books commissioned by a cult/society/club of rich eccentrics (is Sein a member) or a single rich eccentric (possibly Sein).

- SCP-foundation style reality fuckery going on (the suspense in the writing reminds me of SCP recovery logs). Or just straight Harry Potter style magic turned to a particular application. I guess just straight up magic would be slightly boring compared to some of the more convoluted explanations. Sein is a wizard (or reality warper if SCP-foundation style fantasy) or was leaked the books by a wizard/reality warper/occultist.

- Cio or Sein are speedwriters and are screwing with the author as part of an elaborate prank.

- The author (not the real author but the in-story author) is making up the events for the own ends. Attention? An attempt to sell off Tom Riddle's blank diary? IDK....

The least satisfying option (in my opinion) would be to leave it unexplained in a mix of [maybe magic maybe mundane](TV Tropes not linked to save your time) and Magical Realism. The Northern Caves ended this way and as interesting as that story was, it was less satisfying than if the suicide inducing nature of the revelations imparted by binge reading TNC had been explored more.
