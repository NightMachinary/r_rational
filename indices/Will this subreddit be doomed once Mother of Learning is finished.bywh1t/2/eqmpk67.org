Nope. It's slow going because the community isn't that large, but people keep updating either ongoing (origin of species, MOL, PgtE, etc.) or newer (I quite liked the psychic comedian that was uploaded a couple weeks back) stuff, and more people keep lurking for them (such as yours truly).

It's not a party, but this sub is certainly alive.
