Mother of Learning is just one serial that frequently posts to this subreddit; that I can think of off the top of my head there's also:

- Worth the Candle
- The Optimized Wish Project (I don't read it)
- The Practical Guide to Evil
- Pok√©mon: The Origin of the Species (I don't read it)

Why do I point out the ones that I'm not reading? Because it highlights that there's more to this sub than just my experience.

And then we've got the weekly threads, one-off fiction, and random links. I'm sure that once one of the current crop of serials wraps up, someone will start posting another serial to fill the void.

(I have one serial three-quarters-written and one in planning, which will be posted here when they're done. The 3/4-written one is seasonally pinned, so it can only be posted on a certain date, but the other one would be more free-form.)
