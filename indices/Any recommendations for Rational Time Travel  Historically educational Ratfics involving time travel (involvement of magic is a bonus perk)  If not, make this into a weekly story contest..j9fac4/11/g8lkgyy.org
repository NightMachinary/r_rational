The Xeelee Sequence features heavy use of internally consistant time travel, and the author is a physicist, but is very hard to get into and is all over the place. For example, one book is about a secret society in ancient rome, and then another is about tiny people inside a neutron star, and then a massive alien war, and then a mission to proxima centauri across a multiverse. I genuinely do not understand what is going on anymore.
