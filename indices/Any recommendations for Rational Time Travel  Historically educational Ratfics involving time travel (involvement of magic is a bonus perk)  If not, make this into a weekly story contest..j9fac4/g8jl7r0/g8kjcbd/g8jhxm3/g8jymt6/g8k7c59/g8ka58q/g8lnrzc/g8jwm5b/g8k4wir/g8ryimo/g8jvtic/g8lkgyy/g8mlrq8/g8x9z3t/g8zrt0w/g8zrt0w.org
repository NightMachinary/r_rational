*Lest the Darkness fall* - a classic about a modern linguist stranded in the final years of the Roman Empire, and trying to prevent the cultural decline. Not really a rat-fic but close enough: the protag is a smart and reasonable guy, mostly makes rational decisions, and only fails due to lack of information not bad thinking.

*Cross-Time Engineer* - an engineer from 20th century is stranded in 1200s a few years before the Mongol Invasion, and decides to use his technological knowledge to fight them. Again, not a typical rat-fic, more like a engi-fic (the protag sees all problems as engineering issues to be solved with technology, and fails more often at things like [politics and diplomacy)? Not sure if it is a pro or con, but it is also the /most Red Pill and masculine series I have ever read/, easily beating Conan in that regard.
