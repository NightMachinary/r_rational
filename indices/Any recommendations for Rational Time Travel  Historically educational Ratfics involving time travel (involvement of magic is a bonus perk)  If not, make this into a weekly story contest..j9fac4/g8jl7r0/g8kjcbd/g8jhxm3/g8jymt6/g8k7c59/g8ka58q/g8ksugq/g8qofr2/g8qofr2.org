That it is by Stephen Baxter and is a sequel to The Time Machine is a good point. Out of curiosity, why emphasize that it is an authorized sequel? They feels to me to be the least useful part of the recommendation, typically having to do merely with legal formalities, and not about the quality of the work itself. (And is doubly irrelevant in this case, as The Time Machine is in the public domain.)
