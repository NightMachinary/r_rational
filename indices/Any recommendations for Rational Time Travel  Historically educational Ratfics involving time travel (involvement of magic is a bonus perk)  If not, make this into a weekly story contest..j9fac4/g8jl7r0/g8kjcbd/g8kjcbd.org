Timeline by Michael Crichton sounds like exactly what you're looking for minus the magic. It's about a group of history students who travel back to 14th century France to rescue their professor.

Crichton, best known for Jurassic Park, is also well known for investing heavy research into his works and it really shows in his construction of the historical setting. From the language, to the customs and combat, it's so realistic that I was able to choose this book from a pre-approved list of books to write a report on back in high school history class.

It's not like the ratfics usually recommended on this sub as it's a traditional Sci-fi novel with no magic. However, it's definitely rational-adjacent and educational with a compelling plot.
