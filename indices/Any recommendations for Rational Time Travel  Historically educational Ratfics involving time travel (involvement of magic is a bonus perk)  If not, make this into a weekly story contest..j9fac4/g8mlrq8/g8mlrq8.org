I have to recommend the /Time Scout/ series by Robert Asprin and Linda Evans.

The basic premise is that a bunch of rifts opened up to past times and places, some of which are stable, some aren't. The Time Scouts go on to new rifts and try to figure out where and when on Earth they come out. If the rift is stable and goes to a hospitable place, companies start setting up tours to the past, and there's a lot of discussion about the kind of preparations you're asking for.
