I'm probably beating an undead horse here, since it gets recommended so often on this sub, but I just started reading it myself: [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], 823k words long.

I'm on chapter 8 currently and really liking it so far. The main character is a wizard student who is stuck in a month long time loop and he doesn't know why.
