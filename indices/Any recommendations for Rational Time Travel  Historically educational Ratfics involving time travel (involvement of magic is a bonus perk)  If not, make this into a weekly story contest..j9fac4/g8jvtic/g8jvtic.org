It's been more than a decade since I read it, but The Redemption of Christopher Columbus by Orson Scott Card was pretty good for this iirc. First part of the book is the invention and prep, second part is the actual travel and you see more of the prep as it takes place. I feel like it ended with a hint of a sequel that never really happened. Anyway, decent book from what I remember.
