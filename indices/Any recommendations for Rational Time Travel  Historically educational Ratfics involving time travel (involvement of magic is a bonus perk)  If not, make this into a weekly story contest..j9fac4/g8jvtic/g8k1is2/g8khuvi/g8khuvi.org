Card has this seeming obsession in shoehorning his Mormon beliefs into his work. It's so annoying, as once you start to see it you can't really ignore it, and it really ruins the story, at least for me. The spreading of religion among the American natives was such a dumb idea that it undermines the entire rest of the story. It's obviously there just there because his religion hypes the idea of Jesus having come to the Americas.
