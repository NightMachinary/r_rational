Orson Scott Card... yikes....

So much wasted talent on a bigot. Ngl, after reading the wikipedia summary of The Redemption of Christopher Columbus, I'm more upset over what this book could have been.

The time travelers come up with the following ideas on how to strengthen the Native Americans:

#+begin_quote
  They use genetically-engineered viruses to spread immunity to Old World diseases...
#+end_quote

...yes, yes good..

#+begin_quote
  and work to strengthen Indian society for the coming European contact, including by spreading a pseudo-Christian religion among them...
#+end_quote

BIG FUCKING YIKES

#+begin_quote
  and outlawing human sacrifice.
#+end_quote

Love the implication here that all native Americans are inherently obsessed with human sacrifice.

You could write this off as it "being a book off it's time" with it being written in the ancient time of 1996 /s but seeing as the author is OSC I very much doubt it.

Columbus also seems to regret the monster he would inevitably turn into but may I ask why would you want to redeem Columbus to begin with? Like if we wanted to redeem baby Hitler, I doubt many people would enjoy reading it besides people who already /want/ to forgive Hitler aka nazi apologists. Columbus is viciously hated for a reason by native Americans. Proselytizing is bad actually.

I also have to acknowledge that while this is an alternative timeline story, it pretends as if everything pre Columbus going to America is fact and not revisionist. Like no, Columbus was always a huge fucking asshole and everyone at the Portuguese court hated him.
