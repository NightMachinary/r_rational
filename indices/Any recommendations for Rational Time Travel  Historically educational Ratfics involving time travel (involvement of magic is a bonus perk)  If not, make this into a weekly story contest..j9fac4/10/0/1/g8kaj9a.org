That's a pretty strong opinion there, considering you haven't read the book.

The Aztecs did have a lot of human sacrifice, didn't they? I thought they've found tens of thousands of skulls in some places. So what's wrong with outlawing that?

The religion thing made total sense in the context of the book; they had very limited "levers" they could use to gain influence as complete outsiders, so using religion seems like an obvious choice. It did not come off as preachy, and I say this as an anti-theist.

I read the book before I knew anything about OSC's personal views, so maybe I'd read it differently now, but from what I remember it's a /fantastic/ example of what OP is asking for.
