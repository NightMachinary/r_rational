And that is why you build substations and multiple generation sites. Our current power grid is a hot mess, but at least its a hot mess that can usually get power back up within the hour. Although, if theyre going to really have this take off theyre going to need to invent transformers to do step-up/step-down shenanigans to properly propagate electricity without melting the cables and towers they use. Let alone the fact that theyre probably using single phase AC power, which is even less efficient (im assuming its single phase AC, we have no idea how detailed Rain went into the subject of electromagnetism Staavo, and 1-p AC seems the simplest generator to make to me). Theyre looking at many city fires in until they can really work on their safety measures and get 3-p AC going.
