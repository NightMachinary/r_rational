I still can't wrap around how talent can get you nowhere in this world from what we seen so far. Even choosing new awakened was based off a lottery system. Isn't it more rational for a nation to hold tournaments for the unawakened to choose who gets awakened? Like tournaments for the best swordsman, the best crafter, or the best smith. It should be commonplace already but the people in fel sadanis did not even mention anything about it or a nation doing so.
