Your phasing seems similar to ours only we have phase 1a 1b etc numbering... our first 1.5m doses (=750,000 of a 25m population) go to:

Quarantine and border workers

Frontline health care worker sub-groups for prioritisation

Aged care and disability care staff

Aged care and disability care residents

In the next phases we have things like Indigenous people getting a little higher up in the queue (which is good, very disparate healthcare outcomes) and it going by age and comorbidities too.

I'm in the second last phase - children under 16 are very last.
