I actually mostly agree with you. The thing is, your version is more of a recipe for a Standard Good Life than for a Munchkin Life. It probably boils down to a different definition of Munchkin we could come up for Real Life.

Being a millionaire is nice, but does not make you obscenely powerful (standard Munchkin goal). That takes billions as well as a solid heap of social/political influence. IMHO, Elon Musk is the lowest bound for a succesful RL Munchkin.

Beling optimally healthy is nice, but won't make you immortal by itself (nor even particularily long lived). Unless you plan to live for centuries, how is it Munchkinism? But if you do want to live for centuries you have to beat cancer and heart disease completely, because your chance of cancer/cardiac death approaches 100% as you go past centenarian.
