Hehe, how old are you ? You sound like me when I was in my late teens ;P

​

Becoming a billionaire is immensely difficult, aiming for it is bad for many reasons, it's unlikely it'd be like expecting to win the lottery, the overhaul benefit of it is negligible compared to getting to 8-9 figures and exponentially more difficult.

​

You're also ignoring basic evolutionary tendencies. We change as we age, our interests shift, our goals change, our biological imperatives change. Those should be accounted for.

​

For instance as a male while you're younger you're more inclined to take risks, in your 30s your brain changes into fatherhood mode, your testosterones levels drop, your risk tolerance falls, going out chasing skirts becomes too much of a chore, your body naturally shifts it's focus into childrearing.

​

Yes optimizing is optimal, yes you should aim high and all, but your goals should be more reasonable than relying on something less likely than winning the lottery. Maybe take inspiration from real people rather than fictional characters, you're not going to become a billionaire in your 30s unless you inherit the money like that character did.

​

Remember evolution optimized you to live long enough to breed and raise children, not happiness, not self actualization, not minimizing your pain and suffering or anything else, take that into account, our default state is stress and suffering, trying to avoid it is like trying to run from your shadow. What you should do is optimize the types and the nature of the stress and suffering you face.

​

Read biographies, look for mentors, productivity books, habit formation books, self help in general that's grounded and not based on silly stuff like 'energy' or other such nonsense.

​

PS. Stock market is arguable long term sure, but FX is just bs, nobody actually makes money on that, same thing with daytrade, just think about it for a second, if you could actually have positive returns daily by trading, where are all the billionaires? Surely with the exponential growth expected there'd be at least some, but alas they don't exist, also why would they need to sell courses? They could use their time and get better returns by 'studying the market' or actively trading.
