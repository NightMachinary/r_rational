*I have some idle thoughts about how to Munchkin real life.*

What would be the goal of real life munchkinism?\\
IMHO:

- to achieve maximum power over self

- to achieve maximum power over others/universe

- to achieve maximum possible lifespan

- to achieve maximum possible life satisfaction.

Basically, as you would want to become, as Tony Stark had it: " *Genius*, *billionaire*, *playboy*, *philanthropist"*

If you set a goals like that, it is easy to break down your life-plan into topics:

1. *Power over self.* In the absence of magic and super science, you are bound to use chemistry, regular technology and memetic techniques:\\
   - Learn and memorise the basic Methods of Rationality\\
   - Learn advanced mnemonic techniques, speed reading, speed learning and luminosity techniques.\\
   - Learn to meditate to achieve better emotional self-control\\
   - Use biofeedback devices to achieve better body control\\
   - use nootropics, steroids, and mild amphetamines to achieve mental and physical peak.

2. *Power over others/universe.* In the absence of magic, the two options here are power via politics or money. Aside from some rare circumstance I would ignore politics, as it is a rather slow and laborious route, not fit for a Munchkin. Lets focus on the money then.\\
   The two ways to make money fast and exponentially, in a ridiculously OP way fit for a true Munchkin, are:\\
   - the stock exchange (and related issues like currency exchange, FoRex and bitcoin)\\
   - and software startups. everything else is too slow to make you a billionaire.\\
   Rationally then, the only route that makes sense for a Munchkin is to create a startup company that sells, admins and troubleshoots software used for stock exchange/bitcoin sale. Everything else is too small potatoes.

3. *Maximum possible lifespan*. This requires a two-pronged approach:\\
   - slowing down ageing\\
   - defeating the two main killers: cancer and heart disease.\\
   Slowing down ageing requires both research and investment in various medical and experimental procedures, the main ones being: stem-cell infusions, CRISPR genetic therapies, blood transfusions, oxygen therapies, simulated calorie restriction, and finally, lifestyle adjustment. These options combined should keep you alive easily until your 120s, when more advanced technologies emerge (like brain uploading or cryonics).\\
   However, either cancer OR heart disease is going to kill you prior to that. Your no.1 priority then is to monitor your health and investing in experimental therapies to keep both at bay, or if possible find a permanent cure. Bonus points in that being the billionaire that funded the cure for cancer and for heart diseases will also give you more social power. So, fixing cancer+heart disease+ ageing is your goal.

4. *Maximum possible life satisfaction.* With the maxed out brain, body and income you are already very close to it, but there is still room for improvement. First of all, lets focus on "life satisfaction" which is long term and long goal happiness, not just momentary pleasure (which is nice and important as well, in moderation). You won't be binging on heroin to be super happy for a while, you want a solid century or more of Good Life.\\
   Statistically, what things make a person long term happy? Lets tackle them in logical order:\\
   - job satisfaction: well, your goal is to be a near-immortal self-made billionaire that heroically fights cancer, so this one is covered\\
   - relationship satisfaction: studies show that greatest relationship satisfaction comes from good partner choice, lots of sex, low amount of drama (especially jealousy), and good relationship with your family/kids. Good partner choice can be solved by applying yourself to Pick Up Artistry and Seduction Techniques early on, until you can reliably seduce whatever partner you want.\\
   Statistically, marriage , divorce, cheating, financial trouble and child rearing make you most miserable in a relationship, so your plan should be to /not get married/ and live in a jealousy/drama free open relationship with a person(s) you meet late in life when you have the money and time to rear children in peace. The latter will allow you to rise your kids in a rich, positive, and low-drama environment which is good for their happiness and your relationship with them.\\
   Note: unwanted pregnancy is one of the greatest sources of relationship drama. If you are a guy, consider vasectomy early on, that you will reverse once you are a billionaire tired with the playboy lifestyle. Munchkin women might want to research semi-permanent hormone implants for that purpose.\\
   - spiritual satisfaction. This one is complex: you do not want to engage in religion, since most forms of it will prevent you from achieving other forms of satisfaction. IMHO, the form of spirituality most compatible with Munchkinism is Dark Buddhism, as it combines practical self-empowerment with satisfying spirituality.\\
   - Social satisfaction: studies show that engaging in friendships, social events, and group activities actively umps your happiness by a significant factor, and also is good for your health. Especially if said activities include nature, being outdoors, displays of empathy, gratitude, meditation, sunlight and physical exertion - all of which increase happiness and health as well. Solution: regularly go hiking, boating or do team sports with your friends.\\
   - stress evasion: the most common sources of stress are: death of a loved one, divorce, marriage, major injury or illness, jail and job loss. All of those are already covered by your other preparations, except injury and jail: so be sure to lawyer up and wear a seatbelt!

Now, not all of the above might be to your liking, but all of the above options tips and goals are statistically most practical, optimal, likely to work, and achievable in the real world. You might pick a different path, but then it is likely you will achieve sub-optimal results, especially when it comes to happiness. Even if you think that the lifestyle described above is something you do not want, you are more statistically likely to be wrong about your own preferences, than the statistics being wrong.

*So, to recap:* You want to become a /Genius playboy billionaire philanthropist/, by first upgrading your brain and body within realistic options, then starting up in the financial software industry, then setting up to beat cancer, ageing, and heart disease, become a world-class seducer, starting a low stress happiness-focused friend group, relationship and family, and finally achieving a close approximation of immortality. Everything else that actively wastes your time or detracts from that goals is reducing your life happiness or shortening your lifespan.
