I disagree, but regardless, if after you have made the money you determine the rate of development in the life extension area is not fast enough you can get involved. Nothing in my proposal stops you from funding it.

Worst case scenario you do cryonics, but unless you're in your 50s I wouldn't worry. The potential technological development we could face in 30-50 years is immense, everything from AI to fusion energy is in the cards.
