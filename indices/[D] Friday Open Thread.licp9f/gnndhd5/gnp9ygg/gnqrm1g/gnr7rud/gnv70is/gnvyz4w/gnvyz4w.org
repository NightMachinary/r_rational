I don't really want to write an essay but..

  IMHO:

  - to achieve maximum power over self

  - to achieve maximum power over others/universe

  - to achieve maximum possible lifespan

  - to achieve maximum possible life satisfaction.

Given these goals, most tactics would be similar. I wouldn't try to become a billionaire, as I said it's too unlikely / effort compared to the benefit you'd get from it. Better to optimize for 8-9 figures, more likely, less effort basically the same outcome as a billionaire.

It'd be very unlikely for you to cure cancer before people that have been trying to do it for 30-40y+, probably not worth the effort. Also pharmaceutical companies have more resources and money than most billionaires could viably spend on it so there's that..

Also you're unlikely to die from cancer if you're fit and take proper care of your body. 1/3 of people will get it at some point statistically but if you're aiming for optimal health and wellbeing it shouldn't happen to you. The rate of cancer on people that exercise and take good care of themselves is much lower than 1/3.

Life extension is pretty much a guarantee depending on your age if you don't die prematurely and accumulate enough wealth at this point, so just relax focus on what you can influence. Use seat belts, avoid driving at riskier times, buy a big car that's more secure.

A small level of fame is beneficial, local fame or niche fame is ideal. Too much fame is detrimental.

Then you can just focus on life satisfaction while taking into account the points I made about it, and how evolution will get in the way.

Also, books are very useful, research and lessons learned from people with good lives condensed into 200 pages of useful content, while also being very cheap..
