  My plan still implies immortality, just having other people figuring it out, it also implies cancer will be cured, just other people doing it.

that implies there are other would-be munchkins doing the job for you. Might be true for cancer, but is not true for immortality research, in which money is strongly decoupled from will to do it (ie for some reason Bezos is not funding Aubrey deGray or other Life extension Research, and apparently wants to be mortal?)

As strange as it sounds, life extension research is not funded by even a single billionaire, or a single government, and remains a hobby for young academics teams and small startups.
