take note that this comment was not about how to become a happy, relatively normal person. This was specifically about becoming a RL Munchkin.

Munchkining IRL makes as much sense as it does in games: a type of power play that takes most of the enjoyment of the game while creating optimal conditions to win. If you truly WANT to Munchkin, this is how you do it. Bud I did not say you have to want that: most people don't.
