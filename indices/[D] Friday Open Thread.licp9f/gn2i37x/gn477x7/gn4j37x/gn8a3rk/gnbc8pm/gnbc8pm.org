I'm kind of puzzled at the obligation to wear it /outside/. Like... what's the point? That's the one circumstance where it's unlikely you'll spread it anyway, unless you're going to stand in a crowd. I think it would be easier to get these various rules obeyed if they had more consistency and focused on really avoiding certain scenarios while conceding more freedom in reasonably safe ones. Of course, as long as the rule is simple - complicated rules with lots of exceptions beg to be ignored.
