I think there's pretty solid evidence at this point that outdoor transmission is pretty much non existent. The virus can't overcome the sheer diluting effect of all the air and wind currents and so on. I guess droplets might be a bit of a bigger worry if you get close to people. I agree it might happen, but again, masks aren't a 100% sure protection either. The objective is always to abate transmission statistically, so the question is, if demanding compliance outdoors too tires people more to the point of reducing compliance /indoors/, where it most matters, is it worth it?
