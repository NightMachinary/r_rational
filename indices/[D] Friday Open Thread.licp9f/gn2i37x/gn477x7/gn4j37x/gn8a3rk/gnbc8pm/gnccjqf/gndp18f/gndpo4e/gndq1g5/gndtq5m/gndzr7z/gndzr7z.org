Well, there's a limit to en masse enforcement, yeah. But when a policeman comes across someone who's not wearing a mask, he can just say "Oi! You! Put a mask on!" - and give him a mask if necessary. But if the other guy can then say "But look! I'm more than <mandated distance> away from everyone else!" then you have an argument, that just wastes everyone's time for no good reason.
