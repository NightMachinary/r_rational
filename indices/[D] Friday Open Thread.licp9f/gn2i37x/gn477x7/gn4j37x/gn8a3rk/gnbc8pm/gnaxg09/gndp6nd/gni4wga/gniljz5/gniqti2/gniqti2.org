Don't we know it.

How's the vaccine situation going in South Africa? I hope you all get it soon :(.

Australia's just today had its first shipment of vaccine land, it needs to be tested and apparently first needle in arm is next Monday. We've got ~80,000 doses, and hopefully they can get to our quarantine workers which should insulate us from even the tiny trickle of covid that escapes quarantine.

But apparently the whole country will be vaccinated by the end of the year?
