  Over on this end of the world, it's currently illegal to not wear a mask when you're in any sort of public area. (I understand that you can only actually get arrested if you continue to refuse a mask after a policeman has told you to wear one - and given you one if you do not have one).

That was the case here, too! We had a couple of arrests reported but it's always, like you said, the people who refuse to accept masks from the police.

We have had two weeks with no cases so we're re-opening back to the "covid normal". I'm going to spend 6 hours watching UFC in a crowded sports bar in a casino with no masks, ha :)
