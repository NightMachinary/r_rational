We have a three-phase vaccine rollout. Phase one is health workers - doctors and nurses et. al. People who, by nature of their profession, are on the front lines.

Phase two is people who are vulnerable to the disease. Elderly, people with comorbidities, and so on.

Phase three is everybody else.

The first Phase One injections are apparently going to be administered starting from this week Wednesday. (I'm Phase Three. It might take a while).

We /did/ have one major problem, though. We started out buying a whole heap of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine; only by the time it arrived, we had the results of a study showing that it was really not /that/ effective against a mutation of the virus that's cropped up here. (We fortunately also had another study showing that the Johnson&Johnson vaccine /is/ effective against that selfsame mutation, so that's the one that will be administered from Wednesday onwards - I understand there was a /lot/ of frantic scrambling behind the scenes to get that here fast enough).

Mind you, the Astra-Zeneca vaccine apparently /is/ good against the baseline virus. Just not so much our local version.
