ah, i would say the rate of non-compliance is much lower than that during our mandate. I went on a run this morning and everyone I went past (okay, 3 or 4 people) were masked up appropriately - and this is after 2 weeks of 0 new cases, with the mask mandate ending at midnight tonight, so I wouldn't altogether blame someone from "rounding up" and not wearing it walking their dog in their neighbourhood.

So, I guess, the answer is that the fact we only have been doing this a week or two means we've got higher compliance. Yikes.

In terms of geographics/demographics, our premier (=governor) has an 88% approval rating - and that's /after/ it dipped several points because of our current "outbreak". His facebook announcements are full of people fawning over him for protecting us from covid (and, you know, he did listen to health advice and as a result it's been more than 10 months since community transmission). He's up for re-election in mid-march and the opposition party is struggling to campaign against him.

But yeah more pragmatically our state's population is more than 30% of people born in other countries, so many of us have family in other countries, especially England. So we all know exactly how lucky we are to have had a normal life this past year and that makes us more willing to do it. Even the people whining about masks will about 30% of the time follow up with "...and I feel sorry for people in other countries having to wear them for like a year now".

We had a lockdown in march/april/may that was definitely largely followed which is how we managed to prevent community transmission taking hold. But we benefit from our extreme isolation (one major airport in the entire state, and only two paved roads in, both of which aren't anywhere near somewhere you'd want to go).
