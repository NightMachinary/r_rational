It gets... a little better, maybe, if you're in a geographical area that's vaguely pro-reality? Honestly, the best you get in the USA is work-from-home semi-mandates with no teeth and largely-unenforced restaurant closures, and the fatigue is very real. Even as deaths continue to climb, people shift further away from a sensible posture.

At least in San Francisco it's only about 1 in 10 people on the street who are nosedicking or chin-strapping their masks, and mostly they manage to shift it back onto their plaguespreader before they get within six feet of you.
