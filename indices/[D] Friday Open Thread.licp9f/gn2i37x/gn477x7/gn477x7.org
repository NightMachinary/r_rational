"Covid coming to a post-covid state update": it's been almost two weeks since our first in-the-wild case in 10 months was out with no new cases detected (not even his housemates), so in 24 hours we'll be back to living the pre-covid life. No more mask mandate!

I was on board with the masks at first but they are a bit of a pain. They seem like they would obviously be a good idea in an actual active pandemic and no doubt if we had had people incubating the british strain as we feared they would have really saved our butts.

My colleagues were /so bad at it/. People in active pandemic areas, does it get better? Like people were taking masks off to talk, to make phone calls, or just to sit at their desks. I understand that these are all very bad??????
