Munchkin-ing as a /life/ framework misses a few things; the first that comes to mind is the "volcano lairs with catgirls" argument, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d3WgHDBAPYYScp5Em/p/Py3uGnncqXuEfPtQp]]

Past that, there are many, many more mental models to use; munchkining is /really hard/ in real life, because many things /respond/ to munchkining by getting even more complex (see "[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/11/the-phatic-and-the-anti-inductive/][the phatic and the anti-inductive]]").

Another thing I was reading this morning that more fundamentally challenges what you've listed out: "[[https://us2.campaign-archive.com/?u=6b601ddd13ae676e0c4d8b6a2&id=781f0f22aa&e=d459df1287][faith vs works]]" (related to questions like: why reward anything except results? why are non-genius playboy billionaire philanthropists still valued as people?)
