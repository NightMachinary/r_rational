  volcano lairs with catgirls

adendum: I found that argument deeply unconvincing, as it was built, almost in its entirety, on a False Alternative. I posited that replacing human relationships with Catgirls was sub-optimal: which is obvious. But it completely ignored the more optimal solution that is supplementing your human relationships with Catgirls. There is nothing contradictory in having a volcano lair filled with Catgirls and live there with your girlfriend and kids. Who knows, maybe she would be into FM+C threesomes?

Same applies to the other Munchkin arguments. There is no contradiction between Munchkining your life, and still enjoying the non-munchkin aspects of it, in moderation. You can easily optimise for both; in fact, it will mostly happen inevitably, since "normal life" requirements also happen on the optimisation spectrum, just earlier on the progress line.
