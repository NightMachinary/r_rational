Interesting reply, I will have to read into it. Several points do come to mind though:

- while munchkining IRL is realy hard, NOT munchkining at all is harder (ie: irt leads to such sub optimal results that your life becomes harder and more complex than average, because average person at least tries a little munchkin at times).

- The vast, vast majority of humans already under-achieve, and their life plan (if exists at all) is not even close to optimal. So realistically, we do not need to worry much about individuals or societies becoming monstrous OP Munchkins or destroying themselves in the process. 99% of humans suffer from too much akrasia to become munchkins, and an attempt at munchkinism is just going to be enough to combat the existential inflation caused by said akrasia.

(to use an example: almost nobody who starts their own company in IT industry is going to become a billionaire financial munchkin, but some will manage to achieve upper Middle Class life thanks to that. You got to aim high to fail gracefully.)

- "why reward anything except results?" Is that even a serious danger that we under-value non-results? Most of our rewards go to cultural and social posturing and make-work. If anything, we focus too little on rewarding actual optimal results, and too much on rewarding socially approved "social game points" that respond to what our tribes demand.
