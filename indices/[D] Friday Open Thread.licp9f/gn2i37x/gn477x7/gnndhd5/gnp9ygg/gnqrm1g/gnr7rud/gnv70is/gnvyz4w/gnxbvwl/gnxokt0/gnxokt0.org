You don't have to solve everything yourself..

My plan still implies immortality, just having other people figuring it out, it also implies cancer will be cured, just other people doing it.

You seem underestimate how much power you can exert and overestimate how much money would be necessary. If you have say 9 figures, +100kk dollars, you almost certainly did it through a business of some sort a business of that size is very influential in many different ways.

To use your wording, you hold a lot of power over your employees, your market, maybe even your country depending on where you're from, add to that a couple other powerful friends and you have more power and influence over more people than most emperors ever did.

But if you mean being feared, or having people intrinsically obey you, just look at the mob.. Or you know, take your money and influence, move to a country where you can buy the government with whatever means necessary and do it..

If you live forever and don't lose your wealth, but are actually able to make it grow, soon enough you could be making colony ships and becoming a living god in some space colony, if that's what your goal is.
