I'm not exactly sure how things are being ordered /within/ the phases here; what I do know is that there was a bit of a speech earlier about no-one being /forced/ to take the vaccine but there are also a lot of politicians pretty much saying "well, I'm taking the vaccine, so you should too!" - which tells me that various anti-vaccine conspiracy theories have snaked their way around here.

As I understand it, each phase will allow anyone who wants the vaccine to sign up for it. How it will be sorted into order once signups are complete, I do not know; it's definitely plausible that there are some sort of subcategories that are ordered in a specific order. The /aim/ is supposed to be to get two-thirds of the country vaccinated by the end of the year, which should be enough to stop this thing spreading anywhere near so easily and therefore will hopefully allow us to join you in the COVID-free country category.
