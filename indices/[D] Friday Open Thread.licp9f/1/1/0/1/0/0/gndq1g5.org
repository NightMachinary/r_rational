Droplets when you get close to people are the small chance that I'd alluded to, yeah. As long as you're a long way from anyone else, it shouldn't make a difference if you wear a mask or not outdoors - but if you go walking down the side of the road, then sooner or later you're probably going to meet some guy walking in the other direction, and pass each other, and there's a droplet danger for, oh, couple of seconds, maybe.

Sure, you can say that you can go without the mask as long as you're say, at least five metres from everyone else, but that sort of condition is going to make actual /enforcement/ a pain.
