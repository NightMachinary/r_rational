[[/kmoonlightmask][]] It gets worse as people get fatigued.

Over on this end of the world, it's currently /illegal/ to not wear a mask when you're in any sort of public area. (I understand that you can only actually get arrested if you /continue/ to refuse a mask after a policeman has told you to wear one - and given you one if you do not have one). And most shops are not allowed to permit entry to maskless customers, so it's hard to get groceries without a mask on. Unfortunately, there are so many people who are simply ignoring the rules - or are wearing it improperly, such as around their chin.

So, yeah, you get idiots dropping their masks on the /flimsiest/ of excuses - or even on no excuse at all.
