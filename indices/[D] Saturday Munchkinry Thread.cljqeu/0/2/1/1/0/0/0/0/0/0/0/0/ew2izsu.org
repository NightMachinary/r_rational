  But the pressure isn't beyond what human musculature can survive (if it was, it would already be crushing your feet)

Consider a filled water balloon. It doesn't take much crushing force to break this balloon; you could do it in one hand trivially easily. Now put this water balloon in some water. Presumably you can see that the balloon would not burst. Increase the pressure of the water. At what pressure does the water balloon break?

The answer is that it doesn't. You could put tens of tons of force on this balloon and it would be perfectly fine, because the water inside the balloon is incompressible and raises in pressure with the surrounding water. So if you take the force over any piece of the balloon shell, it is balanced out between the force from the water outside the balloon and the water inside. There is no net force anywhere where there isn't a change in pressure, at least at these macroscales.

A similar thing happens for humans. Our lungs are fine being crushed as the air inside them shrinks, and most of the rest of the material in the body doesn't particularly change with pressure. Since the net force around any piece of bone is zero your bones aren't going to be breaking. An example exception would be if your bones contained air pockets, like a bird. Presumably birds shouldn't go scuba diving further than they've evolved to withstand.
