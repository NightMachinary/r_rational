The issue with legal exploitation of this power is that standard jobs are designed for standard humans and nobody is going to give him a special job without knowing that he's special. This means he would need to turn his power into something profitable more directly, but in an age with cars and internet access, arbitrage opportunities are low, and the transport improvements he can bring are marginal.

I would suggest he get a normal job instead. If he's willing to take the risk, he could sell his services privately to some rich person.
