I wanted it to feel like there was a real filter on the opponents as you went forward, like they were the genuinely in the best 1/2^{n} of a wide range of contestants, and had correspondingly learnt from their previous battles, but after a while I could have just started cheating since exponential power scaling means the earliest rounds become much less important. I would have had to put more optimization effort in, but that wouldn't have been a show-stopper for a while.
