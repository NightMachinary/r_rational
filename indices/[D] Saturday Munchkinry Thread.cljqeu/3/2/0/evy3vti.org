Given the distance, I don't see that being too effective. A 5 degree spread is something like a factor 100 lower intensity (energy/unit area) at 100m, and that's a pretty optimistic measure since it assumes the whole beam is reflected perfectly. I also have no idea how Felicity could have built that with the tools available.
