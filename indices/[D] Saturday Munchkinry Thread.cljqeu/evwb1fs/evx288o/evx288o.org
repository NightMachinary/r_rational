My MC has two powers:

Teleport: He can travel instantly about 10km to any place he can accurately visualize, ie he's seen it before. He can do about 20 jumps a day but that would wear him out. He can bring along anything he can carry, and he can't break things by teleporting, ie if he holds onto a steering wheel of a car he can't teleport. (tying a rope to him and the floor would be enough to hold him down)

Disarm: if someone draws a weapon on him, he can reach his hand out and the weapon will leave their hand and launch towards his. This is unreliable, depending on his emotional state this could result his being hit by said weapon at high speeds. If he's being attacked with bare hands the power will attempt to rip the arms off and if he's sufficiently agitated it will succeed.

There is a shadowy, unethical, competent agency seeking out people who have weird powers. These kids range from 1-14 years old, MC is 13 when he first has to go on the run.

His goals are to have a secure home in which he can relax, then to find kids with powers before the agency does, then make enough money to basically give them anything they want with the constraint of keeping them safe.

He lives in London in 1993.

I'm thinking he starts off camping/squatting and stealing food by taking groceries into the bathroom and teleporting out, then becomes a bike courier with someone he notices uses illegal immigrants as a signal they might hire a minor? Using teleporting to cheat by going from deserted alley to deserted alley he's scouted before?

Eventually a kid he rescues has the ability to make people who aren't on a whitelist unable to process the existence of a place so it becomes reasonably secure/easy to squat in indefinitely.
