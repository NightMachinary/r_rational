- You can have up to a dozen active spells, but power is a zero sum game. More spells =/= more power.

- Three hours of casting at max power. Then you're out of mana and you can't cast any more spells.

- Triggers (including wards/shields) drain a small amount of mana continuously, plus more when they activate.

Total spells don't matter, what's important is how much mana goes into them. More mana = more powerful spell. You can only use so much mana per second, and that mana is shared between all your active spells. Each active spell does have an additional soft concentration cost; the most you could reasonably maintain is a dozen or so. But each of those dozen spells would be 1/12th as powerful as if you only cast one spell. And they don't drain mana any faster than the one powerful spell.

You've got enough mana for a couple hours of continuous casting at your maximum rate. Once you're out, you can replenish through meditation (requires peace, quiet, and time). Or you could take a fallen enemy's cache and use that.
