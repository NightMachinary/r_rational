  There aren't "self buffs" but yes, if you're warded and you walk into a spell it'll stop the spell from working for a few inches around you. The spell will still be active and drawing mana but it won't be doing anything until it breaks through the ward.

So, wait, if I walk up to an opponent, and he has a shield but I'm warded, then I can just step right through the shield? And then punch him, and he can't use magic to stop me?

Sure, he might punch me first; but either way, it seems that unarmed combat may be the way to go here...
