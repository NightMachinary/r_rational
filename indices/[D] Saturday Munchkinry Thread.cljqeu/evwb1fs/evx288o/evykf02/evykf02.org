*/Ender's Game/HPMOR battle strategy & tactics/*

You are one magician on a team of six. There are two other teams and your objective is to "kill" everyone not on your team. You are allowed to fly, but no more than twenty feet off the ground. Aside from that, there are no rules. Two teams can gang up on a third, for example.

Once you "die", you're blinded, and deafened. You can neither move nor speak until the battle is over. There is no way to "resurrect" a fallen teammate. You are considered dead once an enemy spell has broken through your ward, or once an enemy projectile has come within a foot of you. Other cases (like stabbing someone) are dealt with on a case by case basis, but in general the emphasis is on realism. Note that nobody actually gets hurt, so combatants are encouraged not to pull their punches.

Battles are held outdoors in mountainous forest, or indoors. The exact details of the battlefield change with each battle, and you aren't always told in advance what they'll be. Sometimes you're told where the enemy team is or given a map, sometimes not. You may start in a fortified area, or in an empty clearing.

You are required to wear suit of armor (helmet included). The armor isn't medieval-style armor, but more like police armor, lightweight and flexible, able to protect from scrapes/cuts/etc, but it won't do much against knives or bullets.

You are always given a pair of compasses. After one hour has passed, the compasses will point to the nearest enemy combatants from each other team. The compasses are infallible and cannot be fooled.

You have no other starting equipment, but you are allowed to use anything in your environment.

​

What clever tactics would you use to win? I'm looking less for specific magical exploits and more general strategy. For example, HPMOR Hermione tricking everyone by pretending to be fair. You can define the battlefield details, if you think of something clever that requires a specific setup.

Magic wise, the two most important things are wards and shields. You can ward yourself, preventing any magic from affecting anything within several inches of your skin, and you can shield yourself, deflecting all incoming projectiles in all three dimensions.

Wards break after absorbing ten times their mana in incoming magic. This means that ten mages working together can brute-force kill a single mage, and there's nothing that the lone wolf can do about it. This is similar to HPMOR's /Finite Incantatem/ brute force counterspell, but skewed much more heavily in favor of the defender.

​

Other than that, you can do the following:

- Manipulate matter by conjuring small, simple items or disintegrating them. Complexity is determined by the size of the molecules involved. You can only conjure/disintegrate one type of molecule at a time, and you need a source for conjuration. So, for example, you could conjure water easily (hydrogen + oxygen), but not plutonium.
- Manipulate heat by transferring it from one place to another. You can start small fires, boil a pot of water, or freeze it. You aren't powerful enough to incinerate a person.
- Manipulate force by pushing objects around. You can deflect bullets, pin someone down, crush a skull, etc. You aren't strong enough to stop a car. You are strong enough to fly.
- Perceive other spells.
- Counter ongoing, active spells, removing the spell from existence and cause a brief flash of pain for its owner.
- Prepare triggered spells, binding together any number of conditions and a single spell. The spell to be triggered must be the same no matter what conditions occur, you can't stick a "variable" into the triggered spell. Additional conditions are harder; you can hold up to eight conditions across any number of triggers. Attempting to add more causes you to black out. You can bind a counterspell as a trigger, but each counterspell must be precisely customized to the spell it's countering so you would have to know in advance what the spell to be countered is, how much mana it's using, etc. /Wards and each dimension of a shield require two conditions. This means that full defenses use up all your conditions./
- Losing consciousness immediately removes all your active and triggered spells from existence. Losing skin with your cache (a piece of metal that contains all your mana) immediately removes all your active and triggered spells from existence.
- You have (for the purposes of the battle) a metal rod containing effectively unlimited mana. However, you can only use a small amount of mana every second. Don't worry about the math, the rough ballparks I've outlined above are close enough.
