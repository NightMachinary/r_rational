I was doing things on demand, so nobody won. Only 16 of the 1024 contestants had been simulated, and not to any significant degree, since I was only doing in-advance simulation to reduce bias. My notes literally just consisted of this tournament structure plus some stuff in my head. Not that the order of the matches that have happened has been randomized, but future matchups have not, and I was going to add more characters to the mix before the next round if you had won this one.

The first we have is Felicity. You know this one.

Your first opponent wished to be able to throw things really well. This was a bit of a silly idea during brainstorming, and I'd assumed they would be eliminated before you encountered them. But after you got paired I thought about how effective this would be and actually ended up pretty happy with the idea---brute force at range is generally a good strategy, and most wishes would lose to it at this stage. It even comes with implied good aim.

The next two opponents wished for speed and to be... a great warrior. I was actually pretty unsure how this should play out. The issue is that speed isn't that effective at this level (~100x less wish power than yours), so it didn't give the qualitative improvements that larger speed boosts give, but still allowed for good evasion. I don't remember how this was settled, but eventually they would be forced to duke it out, and since the ‘Gr8 Warrior' was the only one who could realistically hurt the other, they would have to win.

Then, unfortunately for you, this ‘Gr8 Warrior' got concerned enough about that fight to specifically tune herself against it: fast reflexes, fast limb movement, and lots of bulk. This is why I assumed you would lose if you had wished for speed and reflexes in that round. Making things tanky and locally fast seemed like it required less magic than actual superspeed movement, so although you could have run much better than her, you would not have had many angles of attack.

A side point that you never observed is that Arlene's warrior skills were mostly magical supplements, not fully integrated, which is why she was still standing while overdosed on hallucinogens. You wouldn't have been able even to knock her over, even though she was mentally out of it completely.

The next two had materialization (create physical objects out of thin air) and immateriality. Immateriality would have been really strong later on, but at this point I couldn't justify making it particularly effective, so although materialization was also pretty nerfed, all it took was materializing a gun and shooting the other a few times.

After that success, I had this concept of a creative, artsy individual with this contestant, so shapeshifting seemed like an appropriate follow up. The “+Enhance” refers to wanting the shapeshifting to extend to physical attributes (strength, speed) beyond physical plausibility or mass conversion.

The next two wished for flight (the magic, superhero kind) and “effect reversal” ([[https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Izanagi][Izanagi]] style). Flight seemed like fair play, and quite a nice choice. “Effect reversal” meant undoing any damage they received, to which I was like, yeah, I guess that's fine, but at this level I'm not going to let you play this game forever. Since they were unable to hit their flying opponent, I assumed they would have to lose eventually.

Not very impressed with her opponent, they flying contestant then just wished for better flight (that's what the “speed” means here) and laser beams. My conception here was just /Captain Marvel/. Most of the wish went into the lasers, only a little into flight improvements.

When the artsy shapeshifter fought Captain Marvel, I was really rooting for the shapeshifter. That kind of flexibility is awesome, and would have been really fun after another wish or two. But what ended up happening is despite a small stockpile of weapons and armour, and being able to turn into a gun-toting bird, it really didn't stack up to magical flight and lasers. After a LOT of missing their marks, and a handful of times the shapeshifter patched up wounds, Captain Marvel took the fight and decided she really needed a steady aim and less fear of stray bullets. Hence the next wish giving her sharpshooting and tankiness.

I'll note here a couple of important bits of information. First, most players were only making wishes that focused on one key idea, and this was on purpose. Felicity was the only one to make split wishes from the start. However, after the flying contestant wished for ‘Speed+Lasers' in a combined ‘Captain Marvel' package, it felt reasonable that she should have pushed a bit further here, which is why her sharpshooting and durability wish was a dual one. Second, she was out of frame when she entered the arena because she was flying high in the sky, not because of invisibility of teleportation or a specific displacement wish.

This is taking a while so I'll stop here and write up the other 8 later if people care.
