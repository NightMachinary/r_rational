My DM has recently given us The Hole. It is a very flat oval 25cm x 35cm, it weights around 1kg and has one side completely flat. On the other side, there's a pitch black entrance into a different infinite universe. In this universe, neither light nor sound can travel, but everything else works normally. Gravity points inwards, but is of normal strength. It's full of normal, breathable air, but it doesn't generate it. The universe is infinite and empty. Inside this universe, you cannot go behind the hole, you always end up exiting through the hole somehow. The Hole is indestructible. The edges cannot be used to cut things.

We're planning tying a rope somewhere, putting it into The Hole, and then hide some people inside. What other fun stuff can it be used for?
