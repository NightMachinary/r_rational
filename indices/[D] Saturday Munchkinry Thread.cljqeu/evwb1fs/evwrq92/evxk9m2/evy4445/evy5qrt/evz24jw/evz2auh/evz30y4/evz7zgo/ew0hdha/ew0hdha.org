You're misunderstanding how pressure differentials work. Consider the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdeburg_hemispheres][Magdeburg hemispheres]], which demonstrate that the air alone has huge amounts of pressure, that are not throwing you around like a ragdoll because every part of your body is receiving pressure roughly equally in all directions, and this cancels out. When you are deep underwater except for your head, the upwards pressure of the water is not fully cancelled out by the downward pressure from the water and air, so your body will on net be pushed upwards.
