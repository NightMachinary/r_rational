I disagree to some degree with the second premise - the water is different to solid matter because it is /flowing through/, not stationary in position; and thus, very little of the pressure on that water is being transferred to the diver.

However, I do agree that there will be a force pushing the Diver into the Hole; and that force is his own buoyancy (as compared to the weight of the water pushing down on the top of the hole). Fortunately, it's easily dealt with; he simply needs to hook the Hole over his shoulders (assuming that they are sufficiently broad). If the pressure is significant enough for the Hole to push into his shoulders hard enough to damage them, then he's deep enough that the pressure is dangerous even /without/ the Hole; and if the pressure is /not/ significant enough for the Hole to damage his shoulders, then his shoulders will be able to hold it up.
