  Start with the first premise.
#+end_quote

OK.

#+begin_quote
  Add turbulence that has water flow past the body and the neck-snug Hole.
#+end_quote

Not quite sure how this works without a cause.

#+begin_quote
  Add a second ring-like 25x35cm Hole around the neck-snug Hole that causes this flow.
#+end_quote

At this point, it's indistinguishable from the final arrangement. There's a lot of pressure on your body, pushing you up into the hole; though little of the pressure on the water around your neck is transferred to you (at least not in a pushing-into-the-hole direction - most of that pressure is coming from beneath you). But the pressure isn't beyond what human musculature can survive (if it was, it would already be crushing your feet) so as long as your shoulders are broad enough that they don't fit into the Hole, you should survive...
