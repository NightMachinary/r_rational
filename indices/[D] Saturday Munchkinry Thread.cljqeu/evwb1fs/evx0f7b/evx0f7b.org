You could make a pretty nice spacecraft with this, assuming you could get it into a vacuum. Just build a turbine 24cm in diameter which is fitted into The Hole at the middle, with piping (for air supply and disposal) in the remaining oval surface. It serves as a combination air supply (full of an infinite amount of air) propulsion system (the air rushing out into the vacuum serves as propellant) and power supply (the turbine generates electricity as the air exits), so all you need is food and water, which can easily be produced onboard using hydroponics.

It would also work acceptably as a power turbine/waste disposal for an underwater base, operating on the same principles.
