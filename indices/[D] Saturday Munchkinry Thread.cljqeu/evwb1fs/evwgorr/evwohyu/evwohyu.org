Hooooly shit, your edit is absolutely incredible. I WILL do that. It's genious.

Regarding the insulation thingy, it most likely won't work, since the hole is filled with air. I think it's for the better, I don't want to overheat in there!

All the other potential uses are amazing too! We considered draining a lake, but it'd work only when it has no way of refilling. 25x35cm is quite small, after all.

Although definitely useful in defence, especially as an anti-wizard thingy. Imagine catching a fireball with it!
