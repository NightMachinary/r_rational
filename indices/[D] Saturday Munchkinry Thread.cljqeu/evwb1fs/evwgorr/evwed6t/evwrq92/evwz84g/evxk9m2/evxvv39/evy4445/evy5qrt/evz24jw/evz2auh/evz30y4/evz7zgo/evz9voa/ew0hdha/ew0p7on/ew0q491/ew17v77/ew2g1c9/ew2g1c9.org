Indeed, but the forces transferred are immense.

If we integrate the forces around the human, and assume the water around the sides is prevented from flowing (eg. there's some strong object between them, like a steel cone), the imbalance on the human is the size of the cross section of the neck where it crosses the barrier. Let's assume that to be aboud 10cm by 10cm, the force at 100m depth is about 10kN, or the same force as from one ton of weight.

If you remove the object preventing water flow (or it collapses), things become even more dire. The water pressure on the upper half of the body reduces, as the water is rapidly flowing into the hole. However, the water pressure on the bottom half has not yet reduced by much. Therefore integrating shows a larger imbalance, closer to the whole area of the shadow of the hole onto the shoulders of the human, probably around 25cm by 10cm.

This much power would easily break one's shoulders to push you through the hole.
