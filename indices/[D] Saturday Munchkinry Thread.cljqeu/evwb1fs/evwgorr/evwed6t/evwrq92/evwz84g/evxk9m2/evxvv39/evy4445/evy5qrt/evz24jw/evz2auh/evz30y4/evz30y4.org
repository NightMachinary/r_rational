The case of it fitting snugly around the neck is given merely to establish that there is a configuration of matter that would have you squeezed through. The second premise is the water flowing past the cone that is currently at the Hole is no different than solid matter as far as pressure is concerned. The conclusion is that you will be squeezed through with a force of perhaps 10 kg per metre of depth, which increases if that pressure manages to increase the extent to which you impede water flow through the hole. Do you disagree with the first premise, second premise or logical consequence?
