Start with the first premise. Add turbulence that has water flow past the body and the neck-snug Hole. Add a second ring-like 25x35cm Hole around the neck-snug Hole that causes this flow. Remove the boundary between the two Holes and merge their extradimensional spaces. We are now at the second premise. At which point does the water stop squeezing you through at 10-60 kg per metre of depth?
