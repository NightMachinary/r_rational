Use the perfectly flat side to manufacture other perfectly flat surfaces, helping to kickstart a revolution in precision manufacturing. See if you can start a cult via the perfectly level surface [[https://youtu.be/w-wbWGwZ7_k?t=20]]

How sturdy is the level surface? You could do float glass process on it if it can stand the heat. Though if your characters try to go that route, they can just invent lead float glas, its seem medieval accessible technology.

How thick is it by the way? Depending on friction coefficient and sturdiness of the flat side you can do tons of stuff with it. Improvised sled or ice skates, you can use it as a non-stick pan.

The perfectly level side will strongly bond to other perfectly level surfaces, so you'll have to be careful or risk having the hole stuck. This sticking effect can also be used to rather ardously climb the the sides of a glass castle maybe or artificial iceberg.

If your world has a race of blind, deaf, flying, magically sustained sentient beings you can sell them infinite living space.

Stand at water shore, put hole over head and with just light pulling strain on your head you have a relatively safe way to cross flat water. Maybe needs a contraption to keep water from falling up your nose. If you go too deep the pressure differential will make this a rather spectular failure mode.

Depending on the magics of "doesn't generate air" - has the empty universe just infinite amounts of 1 bar air? Does the pressure differential cause air to cross? You can use this device to create a stream of breathable air at spectacular high altitude. If no air crosses, you can revisit the diving apparatus idea.

Social stuff: blackmail gods or mundane rulers for you to destroy the hole, or you will throw it into the ocean and doom the world. (Don't actually blackmail gods). Offer the hole as endpoint of the capitals sewage system, keeping streets and rivers clean. Generally garbage dump for dangerous materials, like sealed demons and Djinni.

Use mirrors and/or arm to find out whats on the other side of the hole in the empty dimension. If its a perfectly flat surface of normal material too, you can use that as anchor point for stuff in the universe. Like, tie safety net to the tablet or you can noch use the tablet as foundation for a building - you can use compression strength material aka bricks instead of tension strength material aka ropes as building material for a very small tower.
