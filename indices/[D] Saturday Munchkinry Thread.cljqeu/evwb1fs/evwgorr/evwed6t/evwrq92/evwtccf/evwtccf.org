At what pressure and temperature is this air? This matters a lot in how it acts, since large pressure differentials cause large flows. If it normalizes to the surrounding pressure and temperature, dangerous exploits happen.

What happens if you try to hook something over the inside edge of the hole? How does it end up coming out whole?

The most powerful exploit I can think of it to use this to generate arbitrarily large, continuous thrust. Put a heavy weight on a strong rope, attach the other end of the rope to a large X-shaped metal bar larger than the hole, and drop the weight into the hole. The weight will pull on the X-shaped bar, and all the force will result in motion of the hole. This should be easy to steer, and can produce as much force as the hole, bar, or rope can withstand before breaking. Just don't go into space with this, that could be bad.

I'm not sure how to slow it down without cutting the rope, though, so it's possible that a careful counterbalance is needed to make this practical and not-world-ending once you go beyond small thrusts.

There are lots of lesser obvious uses (eg. trash disposal, transportation of large objects, getting through small gaps, air supply, mere weightlessness), but I'm trying to focus on the broken stuff.
