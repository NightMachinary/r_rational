The pressure differential is actually a huge deal unless it's magiced away somehow. If the Hole's air is at sea level for example travelling to above sea level will cause air to start blowing out and travelling lower will suck air in. Since it's infinite inside with enough time it will make the air pressure at whatever altitude it's at approach the Hole's pressure(this would take a very long time for Earth). My physics knowledge certainly isn't good enough but here's some math:

Sea level (0m) = 1.03 kg/cm^{3} 1000m = 0.997 kg/cm^{3}

So the hole at 1000m would be blowing air out at a pressure of 0.033 kg/cm^{3.} Which I can't simply multiply by the hole's cm^{2} area or convert into a wind speed. These pressure differences would be greater on higher gravity worlds or with denser atmospheres also.
