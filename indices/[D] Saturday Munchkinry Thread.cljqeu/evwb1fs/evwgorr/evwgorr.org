You could assemble and hang ready to fire ballista in the hole to be used for combat. Drop the hole into a lake to drain it. Maybe use it as armor piece or a small buckler since it is indestructible and attacks that go in the hole wont do any damage. Since light cannot travel in it thermal radiation can't happen so you can store objects in there to help insulate them.

Edit: Just came up with something.

Lower a rope on a heavy weight inside the hole. Tie the rope to the ground and turn the hole upside down. The upwards force of gravity inside the hole will keep the rope in tension letting you climb the rope. I made a [[https://imgur.com/a/yZ09Wck][drawing]] to show what I mean.
