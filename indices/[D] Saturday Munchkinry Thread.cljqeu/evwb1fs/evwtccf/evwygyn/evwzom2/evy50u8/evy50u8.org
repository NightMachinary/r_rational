Perhaps space is warped to make it work like that: If you go away from the Hole, space stretches you laterally (but your body keeps you in one piece, you merely feel a stretching force like when you spin around your axis). If you go closer to the Hole, space squeezes you laterally. If you move without changing your distance from the Hole, nothing unusual happens. As you go further from the Hole, the amount of space there is at the same distance from the Hole as yourself increases exponentially. If you fly into it, lose orientation, and fly upward, you'll end up right at the Hole. If you drop something, it is extremely lost.
