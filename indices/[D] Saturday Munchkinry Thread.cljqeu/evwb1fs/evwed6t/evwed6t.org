With enough rope, you can use it to generate "infinite" power. Just tie the heaviest weight that will fit through the hole to one end of a rope, run the rope through a pulley system attached to some gears, and drop the weight down the hole. As the weight falls, the rope turns the pulleys and gears, and bam, infinite mechanical power, though only as long as the rope lasts. Add in a locking/braking system for the rope and you have power on demand.

It would take a pretty specific set of circumstances for infinite mechanical power to be useful in a dnd campaign, but one use might be in siege warfare, for winching up trebuchets or catapults extremely quickly and easily.

Also, if really heavy, strong rope is obtained, then you could use an even bigger weight (just make a long, cylindrical object that barely fits into the hole). The bigger the weight is, the more torque can be produced, which can be translated via gears into whatever speed is needed. This is helpful because it means that you only have to drop the weight a little bit each time you want power which means you overall need less rope to make things work.
