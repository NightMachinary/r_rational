Hmmm, this is where you need to go on a quest to capture a giant magical spider, so that it can continuously produce incredibly strong silk ropes. If the weight falls slowly enough, due to the output gear being hooked up to a sufficiently large load, then the spider might be able to produce rope at a rate sufficient to keep the system working. That would be more useful for making a fixed power plant though, which is probably less relevant for adventurers.
