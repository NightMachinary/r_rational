This is part 6 of the mini battle royale quest I've been running. It's somewhat low effort, there's no voting, and it's intended to be simple fun.

The attacks were coming at quite a pace, bombarding the fortress more often than not, but at Felicity's speed, even that left her time. She caught the paper plane while it was still unfolding into existence, and tore to work.

Her fortress didn't have mirrors per se, but it had sheets of shiny metal, which seemed good enough. She wanted to make a retroreflector, but didn't seem to have the tools. An approximate retroreflector would just be reliably terrible, so she took a single, thin sheet of metal (anything larger was too heavy to carry quickly), hoping it would offer protection and retaliation.

She then took canisters of poisons, a net, and a case of bullets off various traps, and lugged them close to the entrance. No more than fifteen seconds had passed since the round began.

One hand held the metal plate above her head, another held a fistful of bullets, and around to her waist a canister of gaseous poison was tied. She abandoned the net, which seemed too difficult to throw well, not built for human-powered artillery.

She was going to run outside, find her opponent, throw the bullets like buckshot, and shield her way back to the base. The she would repeat. Felicity took a calming breath, though she wasn't sure how much good it would do for her slowed circulation, nor, now she considered the issue, was she sure why her breath didn't cause tornadoes. But it helped.

The moment there was a pause between attacks, Felicity slammed open the door, which flew from its hinges, and ran. She scanned the surroundings, still running, and then the sky. Six or seven seconds later she found a small mark in the sky, hard to distinguish, but perhaps her target. She threw the bullets like buckshot, which probably went wide, and brought the metal plate between her and the target in the sky.

Then her surroundings went white, and she couldn't see. Her skin started to burn, and just as she grimaced from the pain, she disassociated, and the pain became abstract.

She ran in a direction she hoped was the entrance, but hit a wall, the world still white, and stumbled.

*Felicity Knight defeated!*

Sorry, you had terrible luck here. You bet your opponent didn't have an aiming wish, which was reasonable, but after her last fight that is indeed what she had figured she needed. A retroreflector would have been neat, if I could figure out how to build one, but probably wouldn't have worked since your opponent was bulkier than you and the retroreflector would have had to have been very precisely made to hit such a distanced opponent.

Feel free to ask questions or make suggestions.
