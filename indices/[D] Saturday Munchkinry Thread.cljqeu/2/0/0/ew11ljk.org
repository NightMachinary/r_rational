I /love/ the raindrop idea. It's not even really an exploit -- if you can do it with raindrops, you can do it with acid or some other nasty substance.

Shields activate on fast moving objects, so the booby trap idea would work just fine. The wiring idea is also clever, though it would be a little too lethal since magic can't stop electrocution. Maybe I'll be able to use it elsewhere in the story.

I simplified a lot of the mechanics. Sorry. I didn't want to overwhelm people with an enormous essay.

Nothing would actually happen in the handshake example.

There aren't "self buffs" but yes, if you're warded and you walk into a spell it'll stop the spell from working for a few inches around you. The spell will still be active and drawing mana but it won't be doing anything until it breaks through the ward. If the warded person moves away, the spell will resume heating or whatever it was doing before.

So, to use your stoneskin example, only the hand would be un-stoned, and as soon as they stopped shaking it would be re-stoned.
