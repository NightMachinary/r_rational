Getting up close shouldn't be too hard most of the time; after all, /my/ Shields and Wards are perfectly functional, plus I can use all my magic (aside from a little bit to fly over any inconvenient canyons or other obstacles) on my defenses; if me and one friend each push 50% of out mana into out Wards, then the full team of six opponents can't get us and certainly can't get us /quickly/. I wonder how many of them the two of us can punch before they start punching back?

(Of course, they can still try dropping rain on us, but that's what the upward-facing wide-area shield is for stopping)
