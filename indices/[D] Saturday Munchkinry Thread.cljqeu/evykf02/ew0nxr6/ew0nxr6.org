Ooooh, /here's/ a potential exploit.

First thing, summon up a whole lot of raindrops, twenty-five feet above the battlefield (i.e. above maximum Flier height). Allies don't need to defend, because they're just raindrops; several enemies are taken out immediately, because they're 'enemy projectiles' and it's not going to be easy to prevent that many raindrops from landing within one foot of yourself. (Try to do this before the enemy has their shields up).

--------------

This will only work in the first battle. Either the rules will be patched (raindrops don't count as missiles, no, nor do hailstones, nor grains of sand) or people will start throwing up shields and/or diving for shelter first thing.

So, next trick. Lithium is a good electrical conductor, while diamond is a decent insulator made of only one type of atom (carbon); both are lighter than oxygen and thus should be conjurable (though you might need to bring in a bit of Lithium with you, I have no idea where to find it naturally). It should be possible to create a network of underground wiring such that you can zap an opponent with electricity the instant he steps on the wrong place. That should pass both shields and wards.

As should anything else that gets inside the shield and then explodes. How does it get inside the shield? It looks harmless and innocent until the enemy moves close enough (the shields /can't/ be pushing the ground away, you pretty much have to let things in by walking towards them).

The enemy can get around this by perma-flying, but perma-flying turns them into targets. (Alternatively, conjure something heavy on /top/ of their shields and let gravity slowly work through their mana supplies).

--------------

A ward prevents all other magic some range from the user's skin, breaking when ten times the magic put into it is used. What happens when two freshly-Warded people shake hands (thus pulling their skin in contact with each other)? Do the wards both break, do they cancel out, do they ignore each other? If one of them has a Stoneskin spell (or other self-buff), does the other one's ward cancel it? All of it, or just around his hand?
