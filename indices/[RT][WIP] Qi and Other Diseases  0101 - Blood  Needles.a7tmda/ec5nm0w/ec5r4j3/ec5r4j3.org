This is pretty good so far!

/Forge of Destiny/ and /White Collar Cultivator/ are the only xianxia stories I've ever read, but I will probably be familiar enough with the genre to be able to appreciate the deconstructive elements. The fact that it is apparently also horror and mystery is intriguing.
