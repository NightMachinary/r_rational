The originality is excellent, it's very well written, and the plot-to-text ratio is really good. All of that makes it very refreshing for those of us who have read way too much Naruto fanfiction.

That said, I skipped through most of the chakra/shadow clone number crunching, and found a lot of the canon-bashing off-putting. But it was still probably the best Naruto fanfic I've read.

Now, TimeBraid. THERE is a story that gets way too much praise for inexplicable lesbian-related reasons. It took me five tries just to get through the first few chapters. Ugh.
