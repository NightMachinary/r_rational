TimeBraid is a fanfic I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed in the beginning but grew to despise. I feel dirty after reading it...the pervasive mind control (to be fair, at least both males/females are equally influenced...), the grimdark world, the over-the-top bashing (especially of Sasuke, who is completely unrecognizable even before we see Looper!Sasuke), and everything else.
