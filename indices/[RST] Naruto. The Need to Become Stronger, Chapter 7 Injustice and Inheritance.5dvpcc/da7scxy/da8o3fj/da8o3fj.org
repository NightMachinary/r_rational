Heh. I feel the same way about the Waves Arisen as Yudkowsky did about 7th Horcrux: "How dare this author steal ideas from my story that I haven't published yet!"

The basis for most of these chapters was written years ago. Might be that something slipped in during the edits though. I remember changing the intro of this chapter to show more of Naruto's reflections on the main plot, so it's possible.
