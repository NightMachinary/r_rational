Hey all! This chapter is one of my personal favourites, as it introduces one of my favourite characters. Very curious to hear what you all think: Did the character come off as suitably interesting/impressive? Did the writing and prose strike the right chords?

I'm also experimenting with different chapter titles. I'm currently going for alliteration, in an effort to give them a common theme. Alternative title: Innocence and Ignorance. Not sure which is better.
