It's a complete (!) Naruto fanfiction with technically quite good prose (!) and some interesting ideas. That alone is pretty rare. Of course, I also find practically every character identical, most of the dialogue unbelievable, the major deviations from canon (which seem present only to facilitate a power fantasy) uninspiring, and lots of plot points unrealistic even within the story's universe.
