Oh wow, a full chapter-by-chapter review! Awesome.

  Guessing that means you're going with less ninja durability than in canon, then.
#+end_quote

Yup. Rational stories require a certain degree of realism to work, and realism and cartoon physics don't mix in my opinion. In Naruto you basically have the rule of "Blunt damage does nothing + knives never hit".

  Because having callous assholes with superpowers in your village is a bad idea...
#+end_quote

I agree, but then, Mizuki IS a callous asshole, so he thinks differently.

And in my opinion, he is still totally right about the hypocrisy of Konoha using child soldiers and then still pretending to be the 'nice' Village (even though, relatively speaking, they kind of /are/).

  I'm guessing this means you're going with lower ninja power levels, or at least more closely clustered power levels, which means ninja life is more military than in canon, since militaries rely on interchangeability.
#+end_quote

Indeedy! Nice that you noticed that. But yes, I feel like rational fiction requires lower (maximum) power levels, since otherwise you'll be relying on idiot balls to prevent certain characters from winning everything instantly. See also: The masked man in canon.

  So memory suppression is a thing? Having it be commonplace is a pretty huge change.
#+end_quote

I don't think just having Inoichi being able to do it makes it commonplace. And note that despite his incredible expertise, it still didn't quite work in this case.

#+begin_quote
  Not a fan of your Sasuke. He's a complete dick, even if Naruto is annoying and starting a fight. He's very different than canon!Sasuke
#+end_quote

True, but I think that in a way, this does follow from his boosted rationality. In canon he just closed himself off from everyone else and minded his own business, focusing only on his own strength. In NTBS, he realized that that is a stupid idea, and so he forces himself to act the part of the "Last member of the noblest Clan of the greatest Country", and is rather bitter about the whole thing. His core personality should still be fairly similar.

#+begin_quote
  I'm guessing you've depowered the Bjuu a bit, or made them more vulnerable to people.
#+end_quote

Yes, partially again because power levels are toned down in NTBS and Kurama is one of the worst offenders in canon, but also because I've generalized the whole "Sharingan can controll Bijuu" thing. Given that the tailed beasts as well as summons seem to be unusually vulnerable being controlled and can be summoned much easier than humans, I just went ahead and made it a general rule that spirits have less "magic resistance".

Thanks a lot for the long review!
