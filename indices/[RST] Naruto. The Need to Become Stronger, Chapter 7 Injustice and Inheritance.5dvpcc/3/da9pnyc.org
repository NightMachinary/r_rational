As usual, your writing is technically quite good.

Gonna comment on past chapters, because I'm catching up:

Chapter 4:

"When Naruto got up, Iruka was lying face-first on the forest floor, a large shuriken embedded in what looked to be his spine, only his right hand twitching slightly as he lay in a steadily spreading puddle of his own blood."

Guessing that means you're going with less ninja durability than in canon, then.

"“Though, you don't learn that at the academy anymore, do you? I apologize for that... if I were actually allowed to teach you children something, then I would have given you all a kitten to care for at the start of the year, and made you strangle it for graduation. Perhaps then you would have come to realize that the life of a ninja is not supposed to be fun. But alas"

Not sure why that makes sense. Desensitizing people to violence makes sense, but pushing people to callousness seems pretty stupid. Why? Because having callous assholes with superpowers in your village is a bad idea...better to raise them with beautiful ideals, strong friendships, and emotional ties, so that then one of them is particularly powerful (ninja strength varies by orders of magnitude) they have an incentive to stay with the village. I'm guessing this means you're going with lower ninja power levels, or at least more closely clustered power levels, which means ninja life is more military than in canon, since militaries rely on interchangeability.

"here you have the difference between those with access to forbidden knowledge and those without. If I had that scroll at your age, I might have been the Hokage by now!”"

I'm not sure if Mizuki is speaking truthfully or not. In canon he'd be wrong: strength mostly comes to those of favored bloodlines, high intelligence (Kakashi and Orochimaru are good examples), and innovators. Maybe here, knowledge is more valuable than in canon. Interesting changes.

"Something was wrong, terribly wrong, but it was getting harder and harder for him to remember what it was. “Mizuki,” he heard himself say, even as he started nodding off. “What... what happened...to him...”"

So memory suppression is a thing? Hmm. In canon its quite hard-- I think Sasori does it, and Shisui's MS can create false memories, but that's it. Having it be commonplace is a pretty huge change.

Chapter 5

Not a fan of your Sasuke. He's a complete dick, even if Naruto is annoying and starting a fight. He's very different than canon!Sasuke, who provokes Naruto rarely in Part 1, and usually, actually, to help him (as when he makes fun of Naruto for freezing up in a fight, which strengthens Naruto's resolve.)

"“Of course I can sense your pain,” Sasuke said, sounding offended. “How else could it amuse me so?”"

Bleh. I think Sasuke is less of a dick than I initially thought, so I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions, but I'm still surprised he's a dick. Nice job on Kakashi-- his dickish persona convinced me until he passed Team 7.

Also, nice ninja poem at the end.

Overall, I like where this is going. THe AU divergences you've chosen (seemingly much weaker ninja, less gap between ninja ranks, more sneaky ninja, etc.) are not my favorite, but that's a personal preference, and you're making it work. I'm not a fan of some of your characterization choices, like Mizuki and Sasuke, but others, like Kakashi and Sakura, are different but still good.

Chapter 6

I'm guessing you've depowered the Bjuu a bit, or made them more vulnerable to people. Kurama/Kyuubi is good. Not bestial, which I like. Not hugely compelling, because we don't learn much from that interaction, but a fun character so far.
