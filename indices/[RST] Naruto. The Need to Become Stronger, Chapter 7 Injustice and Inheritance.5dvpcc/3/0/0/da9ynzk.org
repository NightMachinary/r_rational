Yeah Naruto ninja are hilariously durable. See: Iruka surviving shuriken impalement easily, Sasuke surviving senbon pincushioning, Kakashi casually getting his hand stabbed, Sakura getting impaled through the gut in part 2, Zabusa fighting at a hilariously superhuman level after being seemingly mauled by Kakashi's dogs, genin in part 1 surviving being slammed through trees, into solid rock, etc.

Ninja are kind of glass cannons in this verse, then? Able to deal lots of damage but unable to take much. A bit like Waves Arisen, which had ninja dying left and right but also being not too far from canon levels of damage dealing, though it did nerf them there as well.

Re: Child soldiers.

Hmm, I don't think canon treats them as child soldiers. My conception of canon is that it makes more sense to view hidden villages as extended clans that have a kind of honorable warrior mentality, an extended family mentality. So kids aren't really child soldiers-- they're child warriors entrusted with power, given responsibility, etc.

In my conception of canon hidden villages are very distinctly not military-- see Kakashi's speech in Wave that ninja don't take on just any mission, see the deep bonds between ninjas in canon, the flexible discipline powerful ninja are treated with, etc. This is a function of large differences in power levels. An S-rank is practically a village in fighting strength, so you can't compel them with threat of violence-- they have to stay because they genuinely love the village. Because of the inherent unpredictability of which ninja becomes an S-rank, villages treat all ninja with quite a bit of freedom/caring/etc. and value them individually much more than modern militaries value soldiers.

I think canon!kids are distinctly prodigal to a degree that exceeds real-life prodigies: Itachi at 13, Kakashi at 10, Sasuke/Naruto/Sakura at 16. You can make an interesting argument with selection there: if we take as canon 1000 years of Warring Clans era, then we might imagine a strong selection pressure for fast-maturing, emotionally resilientn and devoted to clan/family kids. 1000 years, if the selection pressure is strong enough, is strong enough for some interesting effects on a population.

Good point re: Inoichi. I was just pointing out that having that changes quite a lot. Glad to see its limited in availability and effectiveness. Otherwise there are lots of parts where a reader will justifiably point out "why don't they suppress the memory? plot hole!"

We've seen summons get controlled by Sasuke (Manda) and Obito (Kurama) and Madara (Kurama.) No one else, IIRC. Not too easy. All of them (the controllers) are immensely powerful, so it doesn't seem strange/OP to me.

That said, I understand the change. In a toned down world, its hard to fit in 100+ foot toads, 300 + (?) foot snakes, and gargantuan slugs without making them the centerpiece of combat. It introduces a kind of rock-paper-scissor dynamic if they're weak to illusions, which should be interesting.

Yeah, Tobi is probably the plot hole that's hardest to fix in canon. His teleportation is...problematic. My go-to explanation is this: Tobi is very mentally unstable. Half his body is a plant, he got hit hard by a giant boulder as a kid, and he's only halfheartedly devoted to his cause. Therefore--> inconsistent actions.
