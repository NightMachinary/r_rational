- When your opponent is someone who knows how you think. For example, in the first season of Elementary, Holmes was up against an opponent who could predict his every move... so he handed the reins to Watson, who was less rational but also less predictable (and had an outsider's protective).
- When trying to use the Theory of Mind. Most people aren't fully rational. To understand how they think, you'll have to simulate irrationality. See also: method acting (which is applying the Theory of Mind to a fictional character whom you're trying to impersonate).
- Leisure activities. It's not rational to pay money to get on a rollercoaster, be yanked around at high g-force, and scream your lungs out, but it's /fun/.
- Maybe borderline, but I'd say that cognitive behavioral therapy is acting irrationally towards a rational goal: you're trying to replace your existing instinctual emotional reaction to a stimulus with a different one, which can't really be done by reasoning with yourself; you have to condition yourself by exposing yourself to the stimulus and calling forth a different emotional reaction than the usual one. You don't get over a fear of heights by talking yourself out of it; you do so by going someplace high up and causing yourself to be /excited/ by it.
