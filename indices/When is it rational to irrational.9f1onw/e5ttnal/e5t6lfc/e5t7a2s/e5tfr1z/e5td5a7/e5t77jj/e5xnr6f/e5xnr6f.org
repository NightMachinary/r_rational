Assuming you mean when is it Ok for a character in rational fiction to behave irrationally:

​

When choosing the rational option would be out of character.

Most likely causes would be: they lack the education, time, or emotional stability to analyse the situation adequately to see the rational choice (Can be cause by charcters of limited means or by really complicated/emotional situations that are hard to analyse), they aren't in possession of enough information to make a rational choice (one door leads to freedom the other to certain death, tehre aren't any convenient guards you can ask tricky questions, you juts have to guess), or they juts don't care about the stakes enough to bother making a carefully considered choice (Now that i have begun eating my salad it occurs to me that I like Honey-Mustard dressing slightly more than Cesar and probably should have asked if they had it rather than order the Cesar, oh well).

​

Often it'll be a combination. Like right now the character is emotional or stressed about something and as a result they care less about some details than the normally would and they miss an obscure connection because they juts didn't pay enough attention. That sort of thing happens to people all the time so it happening sometimes in rational fiction as well would be expected provided the emotional state / stress is not just fabricated out of nowhere for plot convenience but rather is an internally consistent consequence of events in the story leading up to now.

​

Assuming you mean more genrally when is an irrational choice the rational choice:

​

Never. By definition an irrational choice cannot be a rational choice.

The closet this comes to being posible is when you actually have one person calling a choice irrational because they don't undertand what it was suppsoed to achieve, and it is in fact rational in context of that goal. For example somone trying to sabotage an organization may appear to be acting irrationally while they're really acting rationally just against the best interests of their employer because they want their employer to fail.

​

Assuming you mean when is a straw Vulcan irrational choice the real rational choice:

​

Pretty darn often. Most zero sum games of nontrivial complexity have examples, notably chess. The thing here is straw Vulcan rationality isn't very rational. It's usually an embarrassingly shallow analysis put in the mouth of a 'tell don't show' intelligent character and even when it's not it will often make the mistake of assuming the outcome justifies the decision ("I bet the orphanage's yearly budget on one round of roulette, but I won, so take that mr. i won't shut up about the odds!") which is not ra very rational viewpoint.
