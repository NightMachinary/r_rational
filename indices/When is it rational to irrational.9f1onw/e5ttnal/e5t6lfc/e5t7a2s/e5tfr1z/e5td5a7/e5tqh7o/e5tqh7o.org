  Simply put, when the rational action moves you away from your goals instead of towards them. Or when the rational options gives you lower returns than the irrational ones.
#+end_quote

I feel like this needs scare-quotes around “rational” and “irrational” to emphasize the difference between rational (adopting strategies and meta-strategies likely to lead to reaching your goals goals) and the pop-psych/pop-sci idea of “rational” (using lots of sciencey-words and long numbers and then inevitably still being wrong / being shown up by the protagonist who understands what it Really Means to be Human)

E: I know I'm just agreeing with you loudly but phrases like ‘when the rational option gives worse results' are so frustrating. If one of the options gives worse results, *it isn't rational to fucking pick it*! The universe doesn't give a shit how loudly you shout that you're being rational!!
