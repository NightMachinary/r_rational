I feel like this post misunderstands what rationality is all about. Emotion is the opposite of rationality. Rationality is fundamentally based on emotion; emotion is what helps us actually decide what we want and what we value. Acting emotionally isn't fundamentally irrational, in the same way being cold and calculating isn't always perfectly rational.

Rationality isn't using tons of long words and running calculations and droning on and on about logic. Rationality is simply acting in ways that help you achieve your goals, and that's that. All the stuff about strategies and tactics and cognitive errors, are just ways to do just that; achieve your goals.

It's never rational to be irrational. It is often understandable to be irrational, especially in moments of crisis or heightened emotion, but it's not really rational.

I like the Ice and Fire books precisely because of how it approaches rationality. In the book series, people really do act to get what they want, and to uphold their values, and it is the conflict between those two desires that makes the characterisation so interesting. Sometimes characters are interesting because they want something incredibly important (to protect their family and to win a war, for example), but also highly value things like honour, which prevents them from being entirely pragmatic about it. Still rational however, because rationality allows you to limit your possible actions to what you deem morally acceptable, but not pragmatic. And some characters want similar things, and value almost nothing, and so provide conflict with their terrible actions. I like ASOIAF because it shows us how it's possible to be ignorant, but rational. Or foolish and naive, and yet still rational. To not give away too many spoilers; if you make plans assuming that your followers will be perfectly loyal and wont betray no matter what, those plans can still be rational, even if one of the main beliefs you're working around is wrong. Rationality is about making the best plans you have, with the information you have.

I'd argue that Ned Stark was rational. He was naive to trust Littlefinger, but the plans he made under that assumption were effective and smart, and would have worked if he was dealing with a similar situation in Winterfell. Ned could be taken as a textbook example of a rationalist who failed to update his beliefs to match his new surroundings, and paid the price for it, and the ASOIAF books are full of this; characters who are capable of being smart and clever, but set to many variables to a constant, and get wrecked for it.

To me, ASOIAF is about all the different forms rationality can take in different people, with different goals and values; and it shows that even rationality can look really, really irrational from the outside looking in.
