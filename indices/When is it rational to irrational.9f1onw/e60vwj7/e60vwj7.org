Depends on the character's goals and priorities. It's perfectly fine to have characters whose goal is to maximize their own access to some kind of resource, especially when they believe someone else is going to save the world or whatever. (Long-term you come out ahead with that strategy as long as someone actually does save it because there is nothing to gain from it except loss prevention that affects everyone equally)

Your premise that mere humans are incapable of consistently figuring out their best move when it comes to their own interests is flawed. Mistakes do happen, usually when a situation prevents the person from fully engaging in the moment or when someone is out of their depth, but they aren't the default.
