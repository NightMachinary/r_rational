I agree with you, you should read the example in the link bellow, on the blog posts thing.

EY's point is the same as yours. It's just that in this example the rational choice actually gives you worst results, because the results change if you pick the rational choice. His point is that it'd be rational to pick the "irrational" choice in this case.
