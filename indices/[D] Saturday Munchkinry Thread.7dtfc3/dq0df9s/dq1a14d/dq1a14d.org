I'd say keep use of the power to a minimum. Sure, you can do flashy things and kill people and possibly steal large amounts of money, but that draws attention and thus risks yourself.

Instead, keep your head down and consider it a source of immortality. Live a full life with little risk taken, and when your body starts to fail jump to a young body. Prepare for this in advance. Have that young person set up as your protege and successor, keep their contact with others to a minimum so the sudden change in personality won't be as obvious. Make sure they take care of their body. Switch when they are a young adult and you can pretty much continue where you left off. Repeat as often as needed.

This allows you to act on a timescale far beyond what normal humans usually do. Go for a slow and steady approach to your goals. Focus on mental and social tasks, rather than physical, as those will transfer more easily through body hopping. For social, make sure that you act as a representative for your house/organisation/kingdom/etc rather than as yourself, so that you can keep any prestige and influence as you change bodies over the centuries. You are not concerned with getting things as fast as possible, but eliminating risks along the way.

Ultimately, you will want a different source of immortality, since your power isn't fail-proof (and ethically problematic since you are definitely killing people). So invest in science and study it yourself. Research your power, but be careful not to disrupt it while you do so. It does break the laws on known physics, so figuring out how it works would presumably lead to new theories which then can be used for awesome technology. Finding other people with powers is also useful for this, since it means that you don't have to experiment on yourself. But it's dangerous, so be very careful and use proxies.
