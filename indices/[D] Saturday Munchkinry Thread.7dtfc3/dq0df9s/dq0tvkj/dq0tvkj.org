Partly it depends on whether someone's brain (Alzheimer's, stroke, intelligence, autism, etc.) changes how you think, but the basic plan doesn't change: find someone rich and evil who you consider an acceptable target, possess them, fake a stroke or whatever, and keep finding targets to possess until your chain ends. Keeping the mysterious dissapearance matched with someone getting a stroke and losing their memory should be kept to a minimum, so traceless assassinations are going to be kept to only once every few decades, but that's probably enough.

Is sight your only way to possess someone, or are your other senses (hearing, touch) sufficient to target someone? I'd assume so, since telescopes let you possess someone, but it's good to be sure.
