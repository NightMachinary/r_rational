These are based off a series of books, but a power.

You have discovered a book that teaches you hypnosis, by careful control and practice over what you say or how you make eye contact with someone you can send them into a trance where you can give them any command you want and they'll follow it. Naturally you're limited to the person, they're still limited by their own body and mind so even if you can do things like make them forget things they're not going to be solving the mysteries of the universe any time soon.

Now, some additional rules and explanations.

- You learnt from a book, this means someone wrote the book, it did not magically appear one day, you just found it in a library or second hand book store or something.
- Hypnosis is still widely believed to be fake, evidence for it being real not much different than real life.
- Strong anger can make someone unable to be sent into a trance.
- It does not work via recordings or broadcasts.
- It can work over the phone.
- It can work on anything which can see or hear you. Animals, humans, doesn't matter. Animals tend to be easier however, simpler minds and all.
- It can fail if there is enough distortion in what the target sees or hears.

So, what would you do? You have the ability to hypnotize people to some degree, it's likely you personally aren't the greatest out there, and you don't know who out there might have it too. How would you try to use or abuse this?

There's more rules, tricks, and possible explanations too, but this was long enough and figuring out your own is part of the point of this right?
