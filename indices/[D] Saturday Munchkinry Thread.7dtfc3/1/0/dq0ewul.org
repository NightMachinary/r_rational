Assuming it's not magic (but that brains have a backdoor), if broadcasts don't work but the phone does, then that's probably because you need to interact with the target, tailoring what you do to how they respond.

One tactic is to hypnotize anyone, teach them hypnosis and have them use this tactic. One challenge is how to control the infected. If it's a password, any hypnotist could presumably extract it from any infected. If they're to obey any command known to be given by me, they know me. If each infected is to obey their sire or a password they generated, commands propagate slowly and taking anyone over takes over their descendants. Obeying commands known to be cryptographically signed by a certain public key might work.

More robust than a command channel is a fixed policy, such as "maximize the chance of FAI". One elegance of this is that one needs not specify that they infect others - many will understand that infecting others maximizes the chance. One drawback is that stupid people might pass on mutated policies, summoning Malthus to crush us all under the heel of that policy which best spreads to others.

Others will have considered all this. For all I know, someone has already taken over the world, and I am hypnotized to turn myself in depending on where this thought process ends. I do not expect a world like ours to remain without infection for long. If there were more than one infection, I do not expect I would be permitted the time for this thought process, because it could have been spent desperately getting the upper hand over other infections (unless I am to gather armchair intel, in which case I may as well do so, since more direct commands could also have had me gather the same).

The world does not look optimized as a dictator would, so perhaps they only took over the world so nobody else could, prefering an apparently free world to an optimized one. This presents me with a Newcomb problem: If I am the first person following this thought process, I could take over the world for my own ends, or to freeze the status quo. If the status quo has already been frozen, I will presumably be rewarded if I decide to freeze the status quo and/or punished if I attempt to optimize the world. The rewards of hubris are great enough that I fail to see a disincentive that wouldn't defeat the purpose of an apparently free world. That my version of optimization is positive-sum for everyone might help my case. Okay, let's optimize. /eyes go blank, turns self in/
