That would work until you started hitting the targets of other hypnotists or the hypnotists themselves. Remember, it's a book, so you're definitely not the first to have figured it out. Based off the source material there's at least one person already doing that, and they'll happily kill you to get you out of the way if you pose a problem. They wouldn't exist themselves unless you were in that world I guess, but the threat is real.

Experimentation would be warranted too, there's some leeway within the rules which may not seem obvious at first. Counter hypnotist techniques will be important if you want to reach those levels.
