I'd get into life coaching.

This gives you the power to fix stress, improve memory, and give people good habits. That's hugely valuable.

I'd probably also include a suggestion to make people remember some other treatment modality, but that's mostly to avoid ruining my private life via rumors of mind control powers.

That business, once it got off the ground, would give me more than enough money and power to achieve my goals.
