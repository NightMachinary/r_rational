How to best use this body-hopping ability?

- You can hop into a person's body on line of sight; this doesn't work through photographs or video recordings but does work through solid objects like glass or some optical fiber cable setups. Only humans, no animals.
- You do not get any episodic memories or mental skills from bodies you hop into, but you do get faint muscle memories and emotional/relationship memories of the body you're currently in. You can't learn languages, passwords, personal histories, or academic disciplines by body hopping, but if you hop into a professional athlete, you'll move in a somewhat more trained way than a total novice, and you'll always know if you're interacting with someone or something your current host felt strongly about, and how they felt about it.
- When you hop out of a body, it vanishes, transmuted into an equal quantity of air. This effectively means that hopping into someone's body kills them, because they no longer have control over it and when you leave it will die.
- You don't know if there are any other people with powers on the Earth, but it would be fairly easy for your power to get exposed - seeing as people vanishing into air is so visibly abnormal.
