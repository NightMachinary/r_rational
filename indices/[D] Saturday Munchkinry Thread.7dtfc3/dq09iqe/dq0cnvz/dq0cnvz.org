I'm not sure the insanity thing is necessarily something the majority of the people who go through this would end up with, and that's more of a trope about how people assume trauma works. There's no reason to think that having a tremendous amount of memories causes a person to go insane, and anyway if it did then since you remember all those people's lives there would be no people who managed anything useful after all this.\\
So this brings things back to trauma, making it useful to note that getting actual PTSD after extreme trauma is by no means universal or even necessarily something that happens in most instances. Who gets PTSD seem to be pretty heavily genetic so it seems very plausible that whether you are able to handle this will just be down to your genetic luck. I'd also note that people getting more extreme forms of insanity from trauma is almost certainly similarly genetic, because it's very clear that some people can go through incredibly terrible things and eventually be recovered to the extent where they can function normally in every regard.

My point being the insanity thing is probably not something you have to worry too much about, and either way it's not something it's clear you have much control over.

As for what you can accomplish during the resets it's not clear that unless you were a genius starting out you are likely to be able to make more than a few chance breakthroughs (probably low hanging fruits that would have been noticed soon anyway). Given only a day to coordinate anything it's also not as though you're going to be able to do any new experiments either so the only chance of you getting somewhere here would seem to be to just be lucky enough to be the kind of genius who can make significant breakthroughs in theoretical areas.\\
Mainly the main productive thing you'd do is sorting through your memories in order to figure out how things fit together and what was most useful. Near the end you would then want to come up with a script for you you to act out over a day, make sure it was the best possible highest bandwidth script and then practice it and perfect it over centuries/millenia. Basically you would plan on finding a video camera on the last reset and using all that time to record the most useful information you can in >24 hours.

One thing that seems like a good plan once out of the loop (following the plan laid out by previous you) would be to figure out the right people to convince (having learned and perfected the exact right ways to manipulate certain important people) using your knowledge of their intimate internal thoughts in order to convince a government entity to work with you utilizing this information (which would include lots of very valuable government secrets). Since their power would let you maximally leverage your knowledge. One of the other things you would want to do is try to rehearse arguments to yourself to convince the next person who goes through this (and gets your memories) to join in with your little secret club.\\
More importantly however you will want to rehearse arguments for why future loopers should cooperate with you, but also what specific information to pass on in their final loop sharing the expertise you would have gained from your own. You would also want to have people working with you to rehearse this information as well to minimize the chance that a looper only get the information late in their loop, as well as potentially making it more convincing by having them get in multiple times from multiple perspectives.\\
Of course I would also track down every looper I can to get whatever information they may possess which may have not been included in my recording, though since I would have had their memories there's not likely to be much they know that was /that/ important and wasn't already in my recording.\\
Trying to get future loopers going along with your plans is really important here because once you can start doing that then you can start exploiting multiple loops of iteration in order to accomplish your plans. As well as having any future loopers have plans for the best course of action devised by previous loopers working with experts.

Also it should be just obvious to say that I would use untraceable insider knowledge to make massive amounts of money for myself in the stock market. Though I might not actually bother becoming a billionaire because if I successfully convinced lots of powerful people to help me accomplish whatever goals I'd devised then I wouldn't necessarily greatly need massive personal resources.

The video I would record in order to transmit maximum information bandwidth would have some talking which is designed to explain things to my oblivious self and explaining how to decode the rest. However most of it would probably by incoherent babbling combined with flailing body motions, since I would want to devise my own languages of sign language and speech which would absolutely maximize information bandwidth.

When it comes to my inevitable loss of memory I would be rather distressed by it, however if my past is anything to go by I've already basically settled on the kind of person I'm likely to be for the rest of my life (I've never been one to massively change except by getting more competent) so I would be most concerned with the loss in useful knowledge. Though luckily the personal insights that would be most useful/important to me could be encoded in the video message.\\
I also don't have a theory of identity by which massive memory loss would actually correspond to the processes that is me continuing to have experiences so I wouldn't actually be fearing death.
