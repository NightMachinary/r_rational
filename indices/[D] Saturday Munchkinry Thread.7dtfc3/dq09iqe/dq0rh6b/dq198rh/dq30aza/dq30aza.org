So, the only thing that lasts, long-term, is one days' worth of actions with the accumulated memories of seven point six billion people?

I guess at first I'll be frightened, curious, wondering about how things work. I'll try to set up something visible to confirm my intuitive belief that anything I do on that day stays happened (a reddit post at a particular time would do) and then be very surprised when it turns out that that /doesn't/ happen in future resets. (Before I discover that, I'll have a lot of people leaving helpful little notes for their future selves, none of which will do a thing).

But, after over /two million years/ of consequence-free /everything/, I'm not going to be the same person anymore. I probably won't even realise when I get my final day as 'myself' - it'll just be another strange body, in another strange place, I wonder if this one has any good books on his shelf?

If I /do/ keep track enough to realise that this is the day when I can actually do things that have consequences, then I'll quite possibly send a whole pile of anonymous emails. For that one day, I know /everyone's/ secrets /and/ who best to tell them to, and so people engaged in investigating large-scale corruption might just get anonymous messages telling them where the proof they're looking for is.

But more than likely I won't - and that one day will probably be spent just messing about, doing things in the firm belief that there will never be any consequences for any of it and probably messing with people whose secrets I know of to some degree.
