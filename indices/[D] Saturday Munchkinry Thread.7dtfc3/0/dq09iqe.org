You repeat the same day over and over, but as a different person each time. You do /not/ know the rules that govern this innately, but may be able to figure some of them out over the course of several resets.

- You wake up as a random person each time, but never the same twice. (with one exception that I'll get to)

- You will have been everybody in the world by the time this is over. There are almost 7.6 billion people in the world. Buckle up, this is going to take a while.

- The first time you experienced the day was as yourself.

- The day starts when you woke up, and lasts 24 hours. This means you will sometimes start and end in the middle of the day, depending on timezones.

- You have all the memories of the person you currently inhabit, as well as your own. Muscle memory doesn't transfer.

- You keep these memories as you go through resets, so you also have all the memories of all the people you were so far.

- You will gain memories of terrible things having been done to you, and having done terrible things. You'll spend time as a baby, with little you can do. You will spend days tied to a hospital bed. You will probably die many times. You'll have many, many lifetimes of memories which may be difficult to keep straight. Your first challenge is staying sane.

- Assuming you are still sane by the time you get to around the 5 millionth time you relive the day, you find somebody who knows somebody who has gone through the same thing. By around 100 million you have the memory of a person who has gone through this. From this you can figure out the following rules.

- After having been everybody in the world, you will relive the day one final time as yourself.

- The next day, you will only remember that final day. A lot of the things you remember doing or thinking that day will make little sense to you, because they are based on information from previous resets that you no longer remember.

- This happens once a year to a random person in the world. Many of them go mad during their resets, which just means you have a day when they are acting crazy but don't remember why. Some try to give themselves notes on incredibly advanced technology or solutions to world problems, which they are rarely able to understand the next day. In the cases where they did, it lead to breakthroughs in technology, billion dollar companies or miraculous peace deals where all attempts had failed. Some have tried to retain their memories of the resets, but failed.

Challenges:

- How do you avoid going insane?

- During the resets, you have more than twenty million years at your disposal, and a lot more than that to draw experience from. You have a unique insight into humanity as a whole. Yet nothing physical you do lasts more than a day, and in the end only the last reset counts. What problems would you try to solve?

- How can you convey your solutions to your normal self in a way that they can understand?

- Can you find a way to retain your memory after the last reset? Otherwise you'll pretty much die when the resets end, replaced by a much earlier version of you.
