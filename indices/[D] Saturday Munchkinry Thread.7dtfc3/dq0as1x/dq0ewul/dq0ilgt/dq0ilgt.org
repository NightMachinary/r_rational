You've guessed password locking commands, go you? First to do it at least. Passwords do work, and are a proven and used technique in the series this was based off. They have been countered, but it was via social engineering stuff, know the people well enough to guess what the password would be.

Nobody tries things like self propagating hypnosis, probably be a pain to setup without leaving giant trails leading back to you, and a lot of people just aren't going to be very good at hypnosis. Villains in the series seem to favour mostly just hypnotising well connected or rich people, with only a small group of hypnotist underlings. They do exist, and have already established themselves however.

That said, this is basically magic. One of the possible tricks which is possible based off what I based this off is only possible if you're not just exploiting a backdoor that happens to be in every human and animals brains. That might even be enough of a hint, but this can be taken beyond just exploiting a backdoor in someones brain.

As far as if this was based in the actual series? Status quo seems to be the way things go, once you start taking on celebrities or politicians you're likely to run into a hypnotised one very quickly, and they're all password locked commands. There's three levels up there too, the figurehead, the master hypnotist who is a wealthy public and politician, the hypnotist who controlled them into making a run for president, and a third level controlling the second person. He was doing in order to create secret mines in the US for magic gems which allowed hypnotists to travel through time. I deliberately did not mention any of the ways of using hypnosis to manipulate time here however.
