Well the fact you found a functioning book on hypnosis tells you there are probably at most a handful of people with this knowledge and they aren't tremendously competent (given the world looks the same).\\
So realistically while you need to be cautious and paranoid you're at least safe in the knowledge there's probably no major surveillance likely to notice your actions unless they're stupid and obvious.

First off you're going to want to just start using hypnosis on as many important people as you can get access to (using them to get access to even more powerful people ad infinitum) until you have a large powerful network of people who've been commanded to be totally loyal to you. You will then want to outsource a great deal of your planning to a bunch of genius experts who are really good at dealing with the relevant planning (hey they're totally loyal and more hard working and competent than you!), at this point since they can just learn hypnosis the only thing you will do is have them ask you about your preferences since fulfilling them is their biggest goal.\\
The plan they will likely come up with will probably involve wiping all non-essential information/memories from everybody under your control, as well as having them bear no ties to yourself and communicating using anonymous methods of communication such that if anyone else gains control over them they could never trace them back to you. Still that's something of a worst case scenario since if other hypnotists were competent to stringently check everybody they hypnotised for extremely subtle signs of previous control they would probably have already achieved world domination.

Anyway the next phase of your (or well your experts) plan will probably be to discretely check as many powerful people as you can in business, politics, etc in order to see who has been previously controlled. Anyone found to be someone else's pawn will be probed thoroughly for any useful information and then memory wiped such that they bear nothing to tip off their masters to my actions. I'm also going to want to scour around to find the source of the book and sniff out the locations of every hypnotist or recording of hypnotism I can. I will be able to detain hypnotists using any number of means (the people hunting them wearing earplugs), and once I've done so I will be able to hypnotise them (drugging them, or just exhausting them until they can't maintain the anger needed to resist) getting all the information they know about others.

Once I've tracked down enough my next plan will simply involve rapidly taking over the entire world. Given everybody in my network has mind control and everybody mind controlled is totally loyal unless someone else mind controls /them/ I should be able to rapidly sweep the globe with the network setup in preparation for this. Taking over the entire world this way should honestly be something I could accomplish in days at the most, and people would never even understand it was happening since I would control the flow of information during it.\\
It's certainly possible other factions could fight me on this, however anybody else even playing on this level of strategy just doesn't exist given what can be observed in the world (unless by massive coincidence they just happened to also be in the planning stage of a similar well hidden world domination scheme).

As for once you've achieved world domination well you can do far more good than even what your usual world domination scheme allows for. It's not just that you could form a strong world government, or make the individual ones more competent. Fundamentally once you have this sort of absolute control over humanity you don't need militaries or justice systems because courses of action you want to forbid just won't be attempted. Honestly it's hard to conceive of just how much you could affect the world with absolute control over all of human behavior and it doesn't matter that much to you anyway since you won't be the one actually running things.
