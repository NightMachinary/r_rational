With practice you can hypnotise a crowd by giving a speech to them, and a character uses a giant lens to make their eyes seem bigger to assist in hypnotising crowds. There's a chapter dedicated to group hypnosis in the book pretty sure. And strong anger isn't too bad as a limit, it just makes hypnosis near worthless as a tactic for deescalation really.
