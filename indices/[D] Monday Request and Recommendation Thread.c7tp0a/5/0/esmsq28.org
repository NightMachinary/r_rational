Tentatively recommending [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]].

It's a major part of the setting that when our protagonist goes to monster hunter school, she learns that the monster hunters permanently gain abilities from the monsters they defeat.

The immediate consequences are explored: the first thing they have you do at monster hunter school is kill a small monster that consistently grants regeneration, elder monster hunters are terrifying with collections of unique abilities, etc.

If you like it, there's a lot of it and it's ongoing with frequent updates.

I stopped following it week to week. It becomes a bloated ensemble cast, and the writing isn't top quality, and it's not the most rational work.
