I don't know if I can recommend an "inspiring story". The power is rather OP, which makes it hard to write about. The incentives are set up so that it quickly turns into a battle royal or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film)][Highlander]].

That said give [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/quicken-worm.369576/][Quicken]] (Worm fanfic) a try. Emma Barnes gains powers by killing other parahumans.

[[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] is centered around absorbing powers ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7dhr5m/rtdc_heretics_edge_by_cerulean_a_magical_high/][discussion on this sub]]). Takes place in an academy for future monster hunters. There are even hunts arranged for students to get powers.

I haven't finished both, but I look forward to your story. Good luck!
