Since Alicorn's stuff is obvious, I'll plug The Steerswoman's Road series. Basically it's nice family-friendly enlightenment evangelism up until the book The Lost Steersman, which is a really really good sci-fi book that's preeetty emotionally draining.

For non-Anglo cultures, it's a pretty high percentage, even for English language works. On the other hand, maybe you don't want to count Jorge Luis Borges or people from Norway? Forty Millenniums of Cultivation is probably "other" enough, though, so let's go with that.
