  enlightenment evangelism

What does enlightenment envangelism mean? Does that mean one of those books super crammed with philosophy?

#+begin_quote
  it's a pretty high percentage, even for English language works

Unfortunately I don't believe I've read that "high percentage" - or if I did, it's not been a high percentage of what I remember. I mostly remember American, British, and Australian writers. Even though Ted Chiang is American, his works are full of really diverse influences, and I really enjoy that, so I was hoping for more diverse influences which will create very different stories than I'm used to (e.g. Three Body Problem).

I will investigate the ones you mentioned, thank you!
