  I will give luminosity a go and then eschew the sequels !

It's a difficult call to make. The first part, /Luminosity/, and the second part, /Radiance/, have different narrators, but they tell one long story. Once you finish /Luminosity/, you may find yourself wanting to read /Radiance/ just to find out how the story ends. (Personally, I agree that /Radiance/ is not as strong as /Luminosity/, but I still think that it is worth reading.)

On the other hand, the third part, /Flashes/, is a collection of short stories set in the same universe and is entirely optional.
