  What does enlightenment envangelism mean?
#+end_quote

It just means that it promotes the values of the enlightenment. The first two books are books for teens that have a story where intellectual curiosity is good, humans are fundamentally similar to each other rather than foreigners being other, science is cool, etc etc etc.

Just like a book where characters resolve their problems by faith might be considered religious evangelism, a book where characters resolve their problems by curiosity and inquiry might be considered enlightenment evangelism, especially when that book is accessible to kids.

And yeah, if you haven't read Borges, read Borges, just for the sake of quality. I think that if you want "diverse influences," where someone is born is an informative but imperfect indicator, and you might want to narrow your search in other ways first (like maybe you want something on the standards of Ted Chiang's work, in which case you narrow your search a lot faster by looking for literary quality first and /then/ reading short summaries or snippets, and maybe never needing to ask where someone's from - this point actually doesn't apply to gender IMO, which is such a cheap thing to find out that it's almost always worth taking into account when estimating idea diversity).
