I feel like the SI is all over the place. One minute he is calculating with no emotions and the next minute he is ecstatic for completing a dream for talking to a girl his 15 year old self always wanted. Now hes acting very immature in front of the justice league making jokes out of situations for conedic purposes.

I liked the emotionless calculating SI that we saw the first couple of chapters and the interactions with the mage who approached the SI wanting his star essence. I wished he acted the same in front of the league but now I feel like the SI is acting like a typical OP, wish fulfilment, fix-it SI whose morals values equates to which girl has the most problems he can solve so he can add them to his harem.
