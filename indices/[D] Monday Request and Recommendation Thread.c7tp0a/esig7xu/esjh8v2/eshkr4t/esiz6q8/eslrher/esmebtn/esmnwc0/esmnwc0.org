  Had that reply a few times in the comments and still find it weird. "Completely lacks attachment not by choice or nature but because you just lost everyone through amnesia, and then meets a sympathetic person and becomes attached to them" is "inconsistent" to you? I'd use the phrase "logically follows".

It's pretty weird. Normal people don't just latch onto the first person they come across when they're feeling adrift and lacking in attachments, unless they're feeling vulnerable and looking for security, which isn't your SI's problem. They're liable to be dragged along for lack of anything better to do, but not immediately get emotionally invested.

I'm not one of the people who dropped the story, but it definitely stood out as really weird to me.
