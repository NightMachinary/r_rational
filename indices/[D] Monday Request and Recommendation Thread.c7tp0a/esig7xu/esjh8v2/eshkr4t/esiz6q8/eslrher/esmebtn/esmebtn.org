Had that reply a few times in the comments and still find it weird. "Completely lacks attachment not by choice or nature but because you just lost everyone through amnesia, and then meets a sympathetic person and becomes attached to them" is "inconsistent" to you? I'd use the phrase "logically follows".

To the above comment, when talking to the mage he specifically mentions being in character as a mysterious being. Of course he would change his tone when around friendly persons.
