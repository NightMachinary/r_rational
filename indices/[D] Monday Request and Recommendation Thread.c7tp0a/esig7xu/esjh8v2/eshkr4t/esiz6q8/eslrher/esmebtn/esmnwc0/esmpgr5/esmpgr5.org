What part of the text gave the "latch on" impression? The "kill the one who caused this" part? Because this wasn't caused by the woman personally, he hadn't even known about millions of people dying in an attack before they spoke. If you arrived in our earth at say 2003 and found out about 9/11 from a victim's family, would wanting Bin Laden dead mean you were latched on to this family specifically?
