Interesting. I'm looking forward to more. Bit confused about how he was injured by Doomsday now, but I suppose 'I cast Punch' has always been weirdly powerful in DC. If Wotan is similar to the one in young justice him getting unlimited power isn't a great thing. I did think he was a fun character so far, and kinda hope he isn't super evil.

I would definitely enjoy him exploring the villainous side of DC verse a bit. I feel like powerful SI's in particular have difficulty with that side of things. Sometimes the justifications are just highly inadequate, or the heroes are evil dumbledored, or the SI is just cruel and impossible to empathize with. JL all seem in character so far though, and your SI is sane and has a very good reason to be wary of them.

I like how you have depicted the cosmic fights so far. I am wondering if you set up the cubic mind prison just so the MC matched that pic.
