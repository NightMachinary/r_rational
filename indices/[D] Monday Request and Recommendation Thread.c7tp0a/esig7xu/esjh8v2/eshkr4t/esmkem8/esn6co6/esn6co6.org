Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, if you're looking for a rational work and don't mind the issues of translated Cultivation novels.

The Solo Leveling manga or One Punch Man manga/anime are fun takes on things if you're OK dropping the â€˜long form works' part of things and just want some easy fun reading.
