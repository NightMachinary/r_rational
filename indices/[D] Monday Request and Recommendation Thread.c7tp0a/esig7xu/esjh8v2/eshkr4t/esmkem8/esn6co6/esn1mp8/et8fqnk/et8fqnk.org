Yeah, a lot of series struggle with that. Especially when someone makes a trilogy of fantasy books where by the end the main characters are literally at the level of being godkillers, and then they decide to make a second trilogy about the same characters and they're just so absurdly overpowered there's not even any real conflict or danger, you just get silly "the 10 most powerful people in the world, some of whom could wreck continents with a thought, trying to quietly sneak past two guards" situations with no real drama. (David Eddings books can be especially silly that way, and I can't recommend them for that reason.)

There are a number of well written fantasy series and webnovels where the main characters end up absurdly powerful, but they usually do that by having the bad guys be even /more/ powerful to maintain a sense of conflict. (Things like Wheel of Time for example.)

If you want a good story about a character who's actually too overpowered for his own setting, then I really can't think of many, that's really hard to do and maintain a sense of conflict and suspension of disbelief, other than maybe some old Superman stories.
