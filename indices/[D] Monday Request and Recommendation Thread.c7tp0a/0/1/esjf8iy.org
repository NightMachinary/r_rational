Luminosity: If you aren't interested in romance / character relationships as a focus, you probably won't love this. I personally loved it overall. There were some really interesting ideas and it was pretty well done overall. However, the sequels were ... disappointing.

In particular, related work Effulgence was overall not worth the amount of time I spent reading. Effulgence in particular starts off with some strong and interesting ideas and a unique format (glowfic) - they're written through roleplaying between two different authors. The format works really well in allowing 'cute' dialogue and adorable romance back-and-forth between characters. But the fact that neither of the two authors seem to be noticeably in control of the plot lead to a plot that gets pretty out of control and derails and becomes way less interesting than it's potential starts out seeming. The derailing of an interesting setup into shitty mediocrity happens repeatedly. Basically, it's all full of set-up and great ideas and no follow-through or committment to those ideas. In the end, it's millions of words that never really reach a tenth of the potential that you hope for, as intriguing set-up after intriguing set-up are always let down and deflate rather than reaching a climax.
