oh wow, TIL that's what glowfic means.

That's actually how a great deal of my on-again off-again vampire romance story is written, but I edit it extremely heavily after the fact and we'll often retcon a few lines of dialogue if we don't like where the story is going. It sounds... irresponsible for an author not to do that ? (That said, it makes the whole process take a FANTASTICALLY LONG TIME, so you know).

Anyway, thank you, I think I will give luminosity a go and then eschew the sequels !
