[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/im-made-of-stars-dc-si.762731/][I would like to recommend the story I am currently writing in SpaceBattles.]]

It is a DC self-insert with a lovecraftian twist where the protagonist finds himself over the earth with a physiology that makes him look as a person made of night sky.

My biggest influence is this sub, so maybe you guys will like it. I think the world and characters are rational so far, even if the protagonist is still off-balance, and will strive to keep them so.
