RA has mixed text and images sections. See [[http://romanticallyapocalyptic.com/0-1]]

If that it isn't it then I don't understand what you can be looking for. I'm not familiar with Dinotopia. You can either make the text on on the images or separate from them. If the text is on the images then it needs to scale and shift alongside the image to make sure it stays in its allocated space and doesn't obscure the rest of the image or cause alignment problems. This means that mobile users will need to shift and zoom in to view text.

If the text is separate from the images then it can be resized separately so it is still visible at mobile size when the images are shrunk. It results in a layout that consists of alternating image and text sections like in the linked RA page.
