Currently reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/myrmidon-naruto-hunter-x-hunter.554373/]], a fantastically written HxH/Naruto crossover during the Chimera Ants arc. I'd classify it as aspiring rationalism, last chapter has one of the most fantastically written battle scenes I've written.
