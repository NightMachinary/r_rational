I agree HxH is great, though I want to note that ‘as shonen manga comes' still means ‘not particularly rational'. As far as anime goes, I'd say it's still beaten in rationality by Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Fate/Zero, and Attack on Titan, since it still has a bunch of nonsense tropes that those three are better at avoiding. Probably the most rationalist shounen I've watched would be the first arc of Zetsuen no Tempest.
