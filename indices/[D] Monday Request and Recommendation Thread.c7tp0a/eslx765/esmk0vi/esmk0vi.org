I've not actually /written/ any of the stories I've thought of that have something like this, but to me the best course of action seems to be just nerfing the shit out of it. Even so reduced, the nature of the ability makes it more than competitive over time.

There's also a few Worm fanfics with this power. Just go on [[/r/wormfanfic]] and search power copying or something.
