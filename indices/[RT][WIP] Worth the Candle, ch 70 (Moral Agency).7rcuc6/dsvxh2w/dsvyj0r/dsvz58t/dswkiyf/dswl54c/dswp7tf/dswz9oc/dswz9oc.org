That's just it. The reason the laws of the universe back me up is that consequentialism means using the best cognitive method you have available to determine the probable outcome that the laws of the universe will generate.

You may be wrong, but any prediction can be wrong, you've gone out and systematically tried to make your prediction the best one, and will update it with each outcome.

Other forms of morality, you arbitrarily decide that something is "wrong". Like killing babies. Making that decision without modeling what the /universe/ will probably do as a consequence for your action is by definition acting irrationally, as you're ignoring the actual consequences in favor of feeling good that you haven't killed a baby. (admittedly that's also a consequence, but if you're talking about killing baby Hitler...)

The root cause of this type of morality is the belief that an invisible deity is judging your actions and is going to do something in response to you after your death.
