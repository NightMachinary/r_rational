  And the laws of the universe back me up.

Wait what? What the 'laws of the universe' are is precisely the question. Given the observation "killing baby Hitler registers as an evil act", you must assume that either your conclusion of the ethical math is missing some variables or that the system evaluating the virtue of the act isn't consequentialist.

*In this specific conversation* 'rational' isn't about evaluating the system the universe 'ought' to use, it's deducing the system the universe is using, given the observations we have.
