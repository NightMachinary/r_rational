The target was that Consequentialist ethics can be practiced as rational thought applied to ethics, making it the only valid standard. Not just /reasonable/, but valid, in the same way that hitting on 20 in blackjack is never a valid strategy unless you have foreknowledge of the next card, assuming your goal is to win.

If your goal is to make good things happen/minimize bad things happening, /whatever/ those things are, taking actions that do not maximize how often those things happen is unethical. Anything but choosing from your "Q table" the action with the highest probability of maximizing your terminal values (which isn't precisely consequentialist ethics) is by definition choosing to lose more often than you have to.

And I just got annoyed that this isn't a formal debate, I am under no obligation to stick to one argument or topic, and claiming I am moving the goalposts, etc, does nothing to diminish the validity or not of my individual statements.

And when I talk about "idiocy", I don't really mean that I think the IQ or ability to reason of people who disagree is low. To be intellectually honest I think even some religious people are clearly able to reason, they are clearly sentient. But they are completely wrong and arguing with them would be like arguing the laws of physics with a 3 year old. They have nothing useful to contribute.
