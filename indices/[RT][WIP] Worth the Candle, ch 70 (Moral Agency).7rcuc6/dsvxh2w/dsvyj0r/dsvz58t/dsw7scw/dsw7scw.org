I think in this case it's a balance of Objective versus Subjective. You can be subjectively evil, but objectively good. Or subjectively good, and objectively evil. (ie Killing an 'evil' baby)

In this case, the evil hero has carte blanche to torture and kill in order to keep his position as demi god. It's not about the city per se. It's about the power associated with helping the city. In the eyes of the townsfolk he's going to be a person that gets things done. As opposed to the good hero to who wasted time and resources to achieve essentially nothing.

I'm kinda interested in what the evil affliction entails. I'd guess it makes corruption, bribes and snitching more likely. Sell your grandmother out style stuff.
