Here lies another problem. The simulation needs to be not unbiased, but heavy biased instead. Last time i checked, there is no such thing as "objective good" or plain "good" in the terms of universal constant.

It's as you said a question of scale and target group. Cause saving millions of *people* may kill another species entirely. It may cause a planet destruction, but all "human" life forms are saved via migration to another planet. Whole planet worth of life forms might be nothing on a cosmic scale. Plus it defaults the worth to "quantity" of humans, individual connections might be worth more than just plain number of people.

It all comes down to a particular situation and actual tools at your disposal. Having a chance to do something, doesn't even mean you will succeed even if you give it everything you've got.

For our story. What if they decided to kill the demon baby, but failed? Would that count as being "bad". I guess it's not evil.

Conclusion of simulation - *Aliment systems suck*
