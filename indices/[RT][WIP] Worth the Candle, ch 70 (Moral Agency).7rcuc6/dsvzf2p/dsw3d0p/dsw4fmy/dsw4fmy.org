As i said, it can come with the territory per say.

Pen & paper adventure offers freedom, but at the same time it seems a lot more limited than an average video game nowadays if you only make you characters murder\fight stuff. Plus, you can put only so much talk about morality and intricate plot if in reality it's enemy-kill-rest?-enemy-kill.

Even if Junipers "real world" friends in the respective segments talk about tropes, decisions, freedom of choice and it certainly gives the worlds creative freedom, it limits the Aerb world to a narrow path of D&D adventure of a group that only solves problems one way.

It's easier to feel for the characters and appreciate the world when it feels real and lived in.Otherwise at some point you either don't care about what happens to anyone or see the repeating pattern and stop being invested.

Even the most delicious meal if served every day becomes stale.
