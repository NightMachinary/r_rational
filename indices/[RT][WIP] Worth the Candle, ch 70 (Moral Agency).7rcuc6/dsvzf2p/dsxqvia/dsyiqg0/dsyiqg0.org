This is an important distinction. They could have family that didn't try to kill them. Friends from before or new allies that are not party members. Who is exactly this named Neutral person outside of the party that they interacted with and is not a vendor or one time few sentences mention?

Edit:

My point is every member of the party can be effectively removed from the Aerb and no one would grieve about them. It is essentially a D&D party that can drop in and out without consequences to the world. They all were exiles in some way with 0 people being on friendly terms with them. Junipers or anyone else would needs no one to train them, if they need something it's a vendor and new Soul "mentor" is not a connection to be formed, but a nuisance to be killed.

Just noticed that, so you give essentially *infinite possibilities* as an example of what i'm saying when my problem is *4 very limited ones* (5 if you limit vendor definition).
