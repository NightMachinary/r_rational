Thanks to *nohat* saying something in the previous chapter discussion thread, i was able to form a more coherent thought on why the party gives me a strange murderhobos vibe.

This comment of his especially

  The cosmic horror of the game and the narrative are well done, though I'm not really a fan of the sorta intrinsic fourth wall break, and in universe forced narrative structure really puts me off

All members are effectively [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan][Conveniently an Orphan]]. Plus I realized that every person the party interacts with ends up dead\betraying them, a "vendor NPC" or a party member. The only exception could be the helpful bone mage, but it falls under the vendor category. Is there any named individual with more than a few sentences to their name that doesn't fall under this pattern? As far as i remember, anyone not dead is an enemy, vendor or at best a quest giver\objective.

I guess this is due to the story and author having roots in being a D&D campaign and dungeon master. The same can be said about the world. Locations are for all intended purposes are separate, autonomous and the world is VAST. It gives room for putting stuff in, but now it feels disjointed and empty for the places that were not mentioned. It just occurred to me when Juniper mentioned the map in this chapter. Teleportation allows to visit different locations, but at the same time it's like jumping from set piece to set piece without knowing how\if they connect.
