Hmm. Okay, the inescapable conclusion from the perspective of the soul mage that just did that examination is that Joon was powered the heck up using the exclusion zone that excluded skill transfers. Presumably, since he is the bodyguard of a princess and not a moral monster (the soul mage can see his values directly!) with the aid of volunteers found in hospices.

Assuming he is a loyal citizen of Parsmount, this will not blow up in their faces in the short term, but it absolutely is a plot hook that can show up at any arbitrary future point with the official soul-mages showing up and politely inquiring where that exclusion resides.
