I really suspect that, whatever Fallatehr's plan is, it involves a de-powered Joon. The obvious thing is to subvert one or more of his allies without Joon being able to check. In this situation, although Fallatehr's knowledge of Joon's learning rates may not be perfect, it is a known unknown. If Joon has an ace up the hole, it is probably his tame demon.
