I think that:

-Fallatehr obviously was the cause of all of this. Fortunately, this is mostly because he lacks the understanding of how Joons genius works. Clearly, Joon can simply re-learn essentialism now.

-There have been many cases where Joon has gotten a skill above 20 by simply practicing on his own -- I'm thinking of rifles, bone magic and skin magic at the least. I think that Joon should talk to Fallatehr to learn what's possible, and then go off to train on his own. It is simply amateur training as opposed to actually using the skill in novel contexts which get blocked at 20. If he went off on his own and tried new things / experimented, he could learn without help. Evidence supporting this theory includes the lack of a "(Skill can no longer be increased by amateur training.)" after the essentialism level-up.

The alternative (which would be amateur training) would be, for instance, if Fenn told Joon to move her value assigned to, say, the color green, up and down repeatedly to grind the skill.
