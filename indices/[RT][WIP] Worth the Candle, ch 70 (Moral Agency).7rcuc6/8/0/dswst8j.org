That implies that Fenn both knew that Joon could dodge a soul magic test (and how he would do it), and that she was willing to give her own description to the cops. If her goal was to spike Fallatehr, why not just give descriptions of him and his group alone?

The cops were given 4 descriptions (2 were definitely Joon and Fenn), and each party has four members, for 8 people total. Even if it /was/ Fenn, she would have given them at least 1 more description -- Fallatehr and his 2 remaining loyal minions + Joon and Fen make 5 descriptions, not 4.

  “Last night we were anonymously informed that an unregistered soul mage was set to visit Parsmont,” said the Abswifth. “We were given descriptions of four individuals, two of which are a match for the two of you."

My best guess is that the remaining 2 descriptions are for Mary and Grak --- which would allow Fallatehr to avoid giving away that Grak is compromised (which would have been a big hint in that direction if the Abswifth had said 3 descriptions, not 4). After all, theoretically Fallatehr doesn't know that they already have a (now) reliable witness to events that first day.
