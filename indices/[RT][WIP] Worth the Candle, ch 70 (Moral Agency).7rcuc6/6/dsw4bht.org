Lawful Evil: What can I do, while keeping to the bounds of some defined system of honor or law, which will have not the greatest utility for everyone collectively but instead the greatest utility for ME?

Well, if the greatest utility for ME is to be continually voted into being superman so that I have great personal and political power, then performing acts which result in the populace deciding to continually vote for me would be best. So...y'know...being a great and effective ruler, almost exactly as if you were 'Good'....just Not out of any sort of idealism.

Though like the earlier chapter examined, there'd probably also be sideline investigations into the whole 'bussing in people whom you convince to vote for you and then murder' as a way of ensuring permanency of being superman.
