Great chapter, but... the dude yanked twenty skill points and didn't get to put them somewhere else? Didn't even seem to try? That seems strange.

Especially since nothing we've seen about this system would make "reduce a skill to zero" ever a beneficial change (outside of this specific sort of situation). We haven't seen any global skill caps or diminishing returns for one skill based on rank in another, etc.
