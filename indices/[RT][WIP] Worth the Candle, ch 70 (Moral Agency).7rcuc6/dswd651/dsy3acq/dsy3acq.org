  We haven't seen any global skill caps or diminishing returns for one skill based on rank in another, etc.

Interestingly, Joon has not done any experiments related to a wide variety of possibly-undocumented limitations across skills. For example, maybe there is a limit to how many different skills can increase on a single day? Maybe higher skills reduce the skill gain rate for other skills (maybe only those with same or different primary stat?)? Etc.
