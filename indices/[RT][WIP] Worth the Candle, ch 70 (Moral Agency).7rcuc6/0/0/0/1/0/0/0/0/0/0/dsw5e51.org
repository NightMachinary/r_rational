We will be going in circles at this point.

This "rational" is exactly the problem, cause it's determined by someones specific value. The whole situation is a problem since it's hypothetical only.

Every real problem would have a set of parameters to work with and success might not be achievable anyway.

I was talking more from a real world problem solution stance, but it kinda touches the "logical super AI" possibility.
