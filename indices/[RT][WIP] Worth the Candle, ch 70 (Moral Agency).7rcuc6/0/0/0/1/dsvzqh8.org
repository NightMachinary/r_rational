Hm or you are evil if you immediately jumped to killing people, without searching for an alternative.

Hell, you don't even need an alternative if you have a 100 people willing to do it, cause they want to save someone or we have 100 people waiting for an execution, cause they done some very heinous acts. In Aerb depending on the soul destruction\hell after death, your experiment might be a mercy to criminals.
