Specifically, I'm implying that consequentialism is actually the only correct system of morals because to do anything else is not a rational decision.

Really and truly, only outcomes matter, as predicted to the best accuracy possible. Just like real experimental data trumps philosophy and thought experiments.

This is "new", I guess, I understand philosophy and ethics goes back a long way, I'm just saying that all of the other forms of ethics are irrational bullshit. Same as other ways of doing things pre formulation of the scientific method.

And the laws of the universe back me up.
