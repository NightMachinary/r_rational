Using heuristics is fine. Making a choice where you are very certain of the consequences but can't make the optimal decision because it's "wrong" is not fine.

That was kind of my point. We are very certain, as far as certainty can be, that there is no life after our personal deaths, and thus when we make choices that are suboptimal we are causing the greatest crime in human history*.

Note that when I say this, I don't mean it's an absolute fact that there's no afterlife, nor do I mean that there is no doubt that brain preservation works at least some. Reality may disagree on both points. (umm, what I mean is that it could be in reality that an afterlife exists, it could be in reality that brain preservation preserves absolutely nothing. But the odds are very small that either point is true, at least based on the credible evidence we have collectively been shown as a species so far)

What I mean is based on the /evidence/, the vast overwhelming majority of it, that evidence says there is not an afterlife and that brain preservation is better than doing nothing.

So based on what we think we know, to do anything but preserve the minds of the soon to be dead is a very, very, very poor and suboptimal choice.

So in my book, 99% of humanity are objectively speaking, idiots. And I have actual evidence for this belief.

By the way, this is a case where non-consequentialism forms of ethics fail catastrophically. Specifically, other forms of ethics think that preserving the brain of someone who is about to die is "murder". This is grossly incorrect.

*Let's say we could have preserved the brains of half of everyone who died in the first world over the next century. That's going to be more than a billion people we could have saved. At some future date our species will have proof that it would have worked, and can calculate just how many people were killed as a result. Probably easily north of a billion.
