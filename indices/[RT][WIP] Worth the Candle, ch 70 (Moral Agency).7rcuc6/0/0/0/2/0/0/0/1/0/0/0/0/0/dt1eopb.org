My actual point was that rational thought applies to morality just as much as it does anything else. That's all.

Our current society has "protected" beliefs. Politics, religion, morality, etc. We have somehow decided that we have to "respect" people being irrational. We don't respect irrational rocket scientists or bridge designers or electricians, since their shit blows up, collapses, and sets fires, respectively.

We shouldn't.
