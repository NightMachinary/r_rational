#+begin_quote
  It took me about 5 seconds to come up with (A) and thirty seconds to go from realising I should add (B) to writing up arguments. I say this not to boast but to point out how easy it is to come up with counterarguments, even for someone who broadly agrees with you.

The trouble is, and you know this as well as I do, it may in fact be trivial to create counter-arguments. The mental flaw is that arguments are not equal just because they take up the same amount of words. Any more than mishandling classified emails is equivalent to a lifelong history as a con man.

Humans who weight the arguments equally, instead of applying weights proportional to the evidence, are stupid and irrational.
