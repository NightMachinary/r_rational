  I don't think I can do this one more time so I've got to ask, are you perhaps willing to consider that perhaps not everyone who disagrees with you is an idiot?

If they disagree because they have an actual leg to stand on based on substantive arguments or facts, then yes, I would agree they are not an idiot.

And I accept there are many limited domain individuals who are reasonably smart in some areas but idiots in others.

I have concluded you're an idiot because you keep arguing back with obvious fallacies like "moving goalposts". Changing one argument is not an argument of incorrectness.
