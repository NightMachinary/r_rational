My personal understanding of pen-and-paper RPG alignment systems is that Gᴏᴏᴅ has nothing to do with what /humans/ prefer either way. Gᴏᴏᴅ is, rather, about the terminal values of (a certain subset of) /the gods/. (In this setting, maybe all the gods; metaphysical Eᴠɪʟ seems to be contained exclusively in the Hells.)

The usual "thing" with the Gᴏᴏᴅ gods in RPG settings is: they prefer that people be /rule utilitarians/. They value philosophies and modes of thinking that make people /always/ act in certain simple, predictable ways that shake out---across entire populations---to /statistically/ greater chances of satisfying the gods' preferences over time. (Presumably because, in such populations of simple-to-model actors, it's much easier to predict how any /changes/ you make---such as introducing an empowered champion of Gᴏᴏᴅ---will affect the outcome.)

Come to think of it, legislators, judges and police tend to prefer that people be rule-utilitarians, too. RPG gods, Gᴏᴏᴅ /or/ Eᴠɪʟ, would probably /hate/ the idea of jury nullification.
