  But then if the "Evil" hero gets better outcomes, as measured by a set of terminal values that both the Good and Evil heroes share, doesn't that make the Evil hero more "Good" than the good hero?

Obvious answer: Evil delivers better outcomes /for specific groups/. The people who vote for 'Evil' vote because it gives /them/ better outcomes, even if in a /universal/ sense, it gives worse outcomes.

And of course, lies would cover why the victims were justified or whatever, to rationalise screwing outsiders and other demographics. That happens all the time in the real world.
