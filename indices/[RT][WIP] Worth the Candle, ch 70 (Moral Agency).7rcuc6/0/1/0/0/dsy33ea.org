In the case of a gas station, everyone (well, every driver) has to buy gas. In the case of a party/candidate, if you move too far from the extreme then the more extreme voters might not vote at all. The evil candidate might be giving up 20 very-evil voters in order to gain just 5 slightly-good voters, a net loss.
