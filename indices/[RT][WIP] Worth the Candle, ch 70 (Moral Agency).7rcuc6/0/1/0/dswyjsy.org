Why does Hotelling's Law of spatial distribuition not cause both parties to move towards the center?

(That is the effect that observes how you can drive for miles and not see a gas station, then come across four at one intersection. That happens because if they were further apart, one could relocate closer to the center, therefore they all end up together).

By extension, if a Good candidate changed to be only mostly good, they would still capture all the good voters (who wouldn't dare vote for the Evil candidate) and might pick up a few evil voters that were nearly centrist. So the Evil candidate would change to be merely mischievous and recapture those votes and maybe a few slightly good votes as well. Eventually, they should both be Neutrals, right?
