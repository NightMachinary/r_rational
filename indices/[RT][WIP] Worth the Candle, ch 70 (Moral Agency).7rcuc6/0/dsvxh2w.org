Great chapter! I especially liked how the "Good" hero is able to arrive at compromises that involve superior outcomes. Someone forced by magic to be "zero tolerance good" wouldn't be able to ignore, say, an unlawful soul mage in his territory.

Now I'm hoping they encounter the "Evil" hero. Exactly why does he have enough supporters and thus gems to even stay relevant? Who's voting for him and why?
