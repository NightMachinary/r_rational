This just makes me more interested in seeing the Lawful Evil approach to problem solving and mass appeal. Not only does the other fellow have to be a sort of paragon of Evil, capital E, he also has to somehow win the hearts and minds of the town's population in doing so. He has to be both Evil and somehow working for the town's greater Good, too. Or does he?

Just really interested in seeing the other side of the mirror to the Abswifth, who was great. I've always liked to read about the Paladin figure who isn't constrained by their code. Or even who has a code that empowers them, morally, in pursuit of maximal Good, instead of being "Lawful Stupid." The threshold deontologist Paladin.
