I could sort-of see that, but it still means giving her own description to law enforcement in relation to a serious crime. There's crazy like a fox, and then there's just crazy.

Of course, I also find it stretches even my own suspension of disbelief to assume Fallatehr knew that Joon could get out of it, but in weakened form.

What if the brand new soul mage couldn't kill his own ability? Then Fallatehr maybe gets away free, but he also loses his ability to study Joon, because Joon gets carted away by the authorities, and probably also tells them all about how Fallatehr is out there. (Since he would be incriminated anyway, so why not go all in?)
