[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/one-foot-another-multiverse-si.11946/][One Foot- Another Multiverse SI]] is the story of Poe Acti. The protagonist knows about the characters and events, unfortunately settings are warped, fused together, or otherwise mingling in ways that present terrifying threats. His rationality waxes and wanes so I'll compare this to the anime Re:Zero so you know what to expect. I don't feel the slightest regret from following this story for years. Honestly one of my first fanfics.

Almost one year old is this slow-moving story called [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/][Sleight Advantage]]. In some ways this character ends up divorcing themselves from their previous self.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11132119/1/Reiteration][Reiteration]] is a possibly dead RWBY fanfic. This one doesn't have any knowledge of the setting.
