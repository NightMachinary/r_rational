Probably best to look on forums like SB and SV. Here's two:

*With This Ring* is probably the closest fit: it has a somewhat rational SI who transmigrates to the DC universe, but he loses his memories of the future for the particular universe he ends up in. He does keep memories of what happens in alternate DC universes and extrapolates from there, but it isn't technically "future knowledge". (Updates DAILY!)

*Cruel to be Kind* is another, but here the SI gains the power to transmigrate to and from different fictional worlds, and so isn't forced to stick around for the conflicts or play by their universe rules. For example, he can grab high tech spaceships from Star Wars and use them to fight Kromagg aliens from Sliders. He ultimately picks a normal universe with an unpopulated Earth and builds an empire there, only going to other story universes for trade and war. (Abandoned, I think. Still, 600+ chapters before that happens.)
