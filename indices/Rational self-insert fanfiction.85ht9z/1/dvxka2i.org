*Worth the Candle* on AO3 is the first one that comes to mind, where a teenager from Kansas is transported to an amalgamation of narrative fantasy worlds in a tabletop style. It's one I got into recently, and is very highly followed on this site. Updates fairly frequently.

*Marked for Death* is a Naruto quest on SV, where the participating posters create plans of action to guide a custom character and his team through the world. Less of a straight story, since it uses a variety of tabletop mechanics. Was paused for a little while due to a system transition, but I think it's back on now. Updates at least once a week.

*Sleeping with the Girls* is on FFnet, which follows an average Joe through several different anime universes, and almost getting killed several times in the process. Slowed down in recent years, but still gets some sporadic updates.
