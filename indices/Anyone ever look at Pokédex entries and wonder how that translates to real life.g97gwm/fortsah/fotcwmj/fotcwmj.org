Personal favourite is Entei, with "when it roars, a volcano erupts" combined with "one is born every time a new volcano appears" leading to exponential growth in Entei population, as well as totally contradicting the game's lore.

Also, Slurpuff's "Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human's" really does make it look like some kid is just slapping giant numbers on these without thinking.
