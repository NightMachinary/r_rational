As far as stories go:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046][Animorphs: The Reckoning]] has started updating again and continues to be great
- [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]] is one chapter (I think) away from completion
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18738010/chapters/48003352#workskin][Marriage and Monsters]] is a really good story all about narrative and genre savvyness that was originally posted last May, but hasn't been updated since September

Semi-related: One of the hosts from [[http://www.thebayesianconspiracy.com/][The Bayesian Conspiracy Podcast]] has started a chapter-by-chapter book-club/ analysis podcast for Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, [[http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?p=2336][We Want MOR]], modeled after the Worm analysis podcast, [[https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/][We've Got Worm]].
