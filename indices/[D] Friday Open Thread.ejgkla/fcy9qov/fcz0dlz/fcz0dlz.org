Open thread and open rationality(?) threads were combined due to low comment volume. In a most shocking reveal the author of Worth the Candle, the current No.2 most upvoted fic on here, turned out to be secretly no other than beloved Alexander Wales! That was one heck of a reveal, maybe someone has the thread where it happened. Magicweasle did her long announced world.
