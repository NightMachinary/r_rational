I tried to watch High School Prodigies in another world today. I couldn't continue watching after episode 8. There was potential for things to be explained somehow, or for things to be possible, but unlikely. But after that, I couldn't bear it anymore. There was a scene where a swordswoman was running along with and riding an anti air missile. It was that stupid.

And here I was hoping for a clash between high-tech autofabs and magic...
