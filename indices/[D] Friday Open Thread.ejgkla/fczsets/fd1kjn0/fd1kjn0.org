I don't really follow what you mean by the being prior to existence.

Like, I don't think it makes sense to remove the biological programming from an unborn human, because once you do so you stop having a human.

More generally, considering the decisions of a being prior to it, well, being seems kinda meaningless? How do you model the thoughts of a being in the pre-life, assuming that even exists? And if it doesn't, then I really don't understand how you can do it without simply modeling how the being will feel after it is dragged kicking and screaming onto this mortal coil. I.e, expected life quality.
