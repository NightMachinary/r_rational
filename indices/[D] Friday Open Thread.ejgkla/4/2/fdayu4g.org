  Basically, is there any reason to believe that it is immoral/doing an unjustified ethical harm to the not-yet-existing-being by deciding to bring them into existence?

  I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about this yet, and so my thoughts aren't very clear. It seems like the kind of dilemma that is obvious enough that someone has probably written cogently on it, so if anyone could point me to some good articles/books/whatever, that would be great.

I /have/ spent a lot of time thinking about it, and concluded that we do need to be very careful about what kind of beings we bring into existence.

In particular, expected quality of life matters.

I use the word "expected" but this is not statistical - if you are bringing a sentient being into a world, /you have the responsibility of care/, and so you need to /make sure/ that it has a good quality of life.

A great number of people are born often where this is not the case. I think this is morally wrong, but however. This being the case, I think increasing overall quality of life is currently more important than increase amount of life. In other words, I'm definitely not a pure consequentialist utilitarian although /in the end/ that's the simplest way to think about it; it's just that intermediate steps need to happen. Expected-value maximisation (which consequentialist utilitarianism optimises) is in fact the correct criterion for "obtaining the most value" (from life; or whatever) after all.

Hope this may have cleared up some confusion :)
