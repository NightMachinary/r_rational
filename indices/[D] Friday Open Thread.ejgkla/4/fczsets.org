Random thought I had a while ago that I thought maybe this community could help me work through/flesh out: How does one weigh the moral considerations of creating a new sentient being?

This usually applies to deciding to have a child, but in the future will also have some impact on creating AGI.

I'm less concerned with the ethical impacts of having a child on the world/earth (since those considerations seem much more straightforward and obvious) and more interested with the ethical implications to the child itself, as they, definitionally, do not get a say in whether or not begin existing.

My first thought on the matter was that "well, most humans will tell you that they prefer their existence to non existence", but then it occurred to me that we are evolutionarily designed to think this way. Humans that do not have a preference for existence to non-existence were not very likely to pass on genes. This seems like it would maybe make the post-existence opinion less valuable than a hypothetical (but impossible) pre-existence opinion that didn't have these constraints. Also, in the eventual case of AGI, we have the additional moral consideration of, do we create the AGI (assuming we have the ability to choose) with a programmed desire to exist, robbing it of the ability to make an unbiased choice?

Basically, is there any reason to believe that it is immoral/doing an unjustified ethical harm to the not-yet-existing-being by deciding to bring them into existence?

I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about this yet, and so my thoughts aren't very clear. It seems like the kind of dilemma that is obvious enough that someone has probably written cogently on it, so if anyone could point me to some good articles/books/whatever, that would be great.

Thanks.
