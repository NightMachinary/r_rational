thanks, that was a really good article. It's certainly relevant, but not exactly what I was looking for. They make the assumption (which they explicitly state near the end) that, because evolution has programmed a preference for existence, that any life lived without pain is better than non-existence.

That should /maybe/ be enough to answer my question. but the more fundamental though I had boils down to the following:

If a hypothetical being could exist as a consciousness before birth/genesis, without the cultural/evolutionary/biological/etc. binders on their thought process, would they choose to begin a life that would include those limiters/binders or would they choose non-existence? And how should we, as non-hypothetical beings, weigh these opinions?

The more I lay out my thinking, the more it seems like this is probably an un-answerable question since I'm not sure we really understand what intelligence even means absent those kind of contexts (this brings to mind a throw-away passage in the Culture series where they attempt to make Minds that lack all the cultural baggage/context they usually instill in intelligences and the resulting AIs are almost entirely non communicative and either suicide or "ascend" shortly after creation)

Basically, I'm starting to lean towards the idea (which may be, in retrospect, obvious or uninteresting), that it probably doesn't make sense to ask whether a being would want to exist before it exists, and instead it only makes sense after existence begins. If this is correct, then there isn't any moral weight or decision to be made before the creation occurs. There is just the somewhat normal moral responsibility of a parent/progenitor to make all reasonable attempts that the life experienced by one's offspring is as positive as possible.
