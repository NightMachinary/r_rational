I think it may make sense to consider if a being would want to exist before it exists, but /asking/ that being can't happen before the being exists. So you are basically left with using your own imagined empathy to try to answer that question, and you are limited by your ability to model other beings.

I once came across a post somewhere (I think [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]]) that argued that a moral thing we should try to do is implement every human being possible given humanity's gene pool. Because we should use our privileged status of existing to help others exist.

I and the majority of the comments didn't agree with that because if you try to make a human from every possible viable human gene sequence, you are going to end up with a lot of people with birth defects. Plus genes aren't the only thing that makes an individual an individual, so you wouldn't actually even get close to implementing every possible person. Plus there is a trade off between quantity and quality of life that the poster's “implement every human” argument didn't even try to address. And a dozen other counter arguments.

So there are people out there that are asking similar questions to “does a being want to exist?/ should we make a being exist?” I don't think it is a nonsense question, but I haven't seen any attempt at answering that was more rigorous than the meat-eating article.

Now I'm interested in finding a good article about this question too!
