I generally think it's worth it, though it depends on the book. Intellectual stimulation and introspection are probably the top two of your list, though I would stress that you /can/ find those in genre/web fic, it's just a lot rarer. What a lot of classical/literary stuff has going for it is polish and thematic cohesion, which, again, is in short supply in genre/web fic. Good literary fiction lends itself to thought, and to certain types of thoughts, in a way that you're not as likely to get anywhere else. Authors of literary fiction are trying to communicate something to you, unless they're total hacks, and I think those communications, if you can get them, are worthwhile, especially if they're not the sort of thing you generally get exposure to.

That said, a fair bit of the most popular literary fiction is just good-because-its-good, which is to say, put on lists because it's part of the canon rather than because it provides something extremely worthwhile. You kind of have to read to see which are which, or find someone you trust to provide recommendations.

(I haven't read all that much literary fiction since getting out of college, but I found the experience worthwhile for broadening my understanding of fiction and the human experience.)
