I think you are trying to talk around definitions here. Saying that you can box Jesus, as the human expression of God, is like laying string atop one's fingers and calling them captured. Not only have you failed to restrain Him in any meaningful way, but your restraints would stay upon him only if it suited His designs. Theologically speaking, there is no way to "munchkin" around an absolute.
