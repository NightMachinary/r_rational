So I'm watching the new Dracula mini-series and there are actually a few fun ideas in it regarding vampire lore. Spoilers ahead:

The first thing is that when Dracula feeds on someone he acquires some of their attributes and knowledge. Examples include being able to fluently speak a language he was a bit rusty with, a stutter, and he mentions that, had he only fed on the ship's crew members, he would have arrived in London with the social prowess of a sailor. I think one of the most interesting aspects of this is that it might offer up a logical reason for why a moral vampire doesn't just feed on animal blood since it could result in them having subhuman intelligence and if you only fed on rapists/murderers you'd end up becoming one yourself. Furthermore, this sort of behavioral inheritance aspect of feeding is used to explain his fear of the cross. He claims that he's been feeding on God-fearing Christians for so long he has acquired something like an extreme phobia of all Christian iconography (he also says he's excited to feed on some atheists, implying it might circumvent his weakness). Now, the Vanhellsing character claims this is a lie, but it's unclear if she actually thought he was lying or if she was just trying to bait him into a prolonged argument as a distraction, but we've got one more episode coming tonight and after the absurd ending of episode 2 (he walks out of the ocean after the shipwreck and is accosted by what appears to be Vanhellsing with modern-day government authorities, so there's been a big time jump and Vanhellsing may have found a way to exploit the vampire curse) I'm pretty curious where this will go.

edit: warning, episode 3 really shit the bed.
