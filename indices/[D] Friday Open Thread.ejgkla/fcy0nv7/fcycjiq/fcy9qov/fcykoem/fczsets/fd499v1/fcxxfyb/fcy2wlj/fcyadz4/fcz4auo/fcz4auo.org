I have a Chrome extension called StayFocused which will shut down various websites for certain time periods. I haven't used it in a while, and it was mostly useful for when I would be working on something on my computer and go to reddit just on reflex. Having a little pop-up and trivial inconvenience stopping me helped me to think about what I was doing and break that reflexive switching over to something else when my brain was stalled on writing.
