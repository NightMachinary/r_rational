Given the usual Christian definitions of God (omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient):

1. Even if God is in the Box, God is also /not/ confined to the Box, by the definition of omnipresence.
2. Assuming a properly-developed Box, the AI needs human intervention to escape. Even if you manage to finagle around the omnipresence so that God is entirely within the Box, omnipotence means God can escape at any time.
3. An AI would need to learn enough about you to simulate you and come up with a convincing argument to get you to let it out of the Box. Even if you manage to work around the first two points somehow, God would already know how to convince you, by virtue of omniscience.

Thus, I would say that any entity capable of being Boxed for even a short window of time is, by definition, not a capital-g "God" at the time this occurs.

That said, with a Box which is sufficiently poorly designed, or an AGI which is given sufficient information and capacity for self-refinement, the task may be equally futile.
