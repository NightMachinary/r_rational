In general, the classics are classics because they're well written, not tied to a particular cultural mindset (or not tied too hard, at least), and tend to carry some sort of insight.

You can find all of this in any genre, including amateur web novels; however, in most places you would need to filter out the other stories yourself. Lists of classics come pre-filtered.
