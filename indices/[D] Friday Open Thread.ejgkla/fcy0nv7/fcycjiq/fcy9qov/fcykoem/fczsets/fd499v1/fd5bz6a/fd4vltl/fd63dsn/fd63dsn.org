/lit/ recommendation charts are pretentious and unnecessary.

That being said, I'm a big fan of Cicero and the Aeneid. Book II of the latter was genuinely emotionally moving and Cicero had some good things to say about philosophy. I imagine that if I read more classical literature/cultural canon, I'd feel the same about other writers and feel the temptation to suggest them to others as well. I imagine that's what the /lit/ jpg authors think as well.

But getting recommendations/compulsion from others changes the experience, especially when it's highbrow stuff. I was dragged around, surly and unappreciative, to art museums, operas and other high-culture events. I found myself thinking that my parents didn't actually appreciate the art in question, that it was just a performative show that they were Well-Heeled people. How could it be when the paintings were all obviously the same? Once you've seen one tree you've seen them all.

But, looking back, it seems more likely that they did appreciate High Culture for itself, since they weren't compelled to pursue it.

TLDR; don't force yourself to read anything.
