There is quite a bit of overlap due to HPMOR and the founder effect. I feel like /I'm/ part of the rationalist community, but not everyone I direct here is. My dad, for example, comes here for story recommendations but doesn't read the comments or otherwise interact with any other part of the rationalist community. (He introduced me to HPMOR, but we share a love of fiction, not rationality.)

So that's two data points.
