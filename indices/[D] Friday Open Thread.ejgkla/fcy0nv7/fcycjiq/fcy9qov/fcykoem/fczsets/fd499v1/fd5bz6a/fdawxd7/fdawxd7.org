The main reason I don't is precisely this. Lists of "top classics" are basically themselves memes at this point, where people only put things there because other "literary people" have read them, rather than according to their actual value.

Without having read them, though, I would suspect Ulysses, Edgar Allen Poe's work (some of which I've read), Nabokov, Tolstoy, etc would be valuable. Not sure about American writers, we seem to have all picked up on American culture because it's so blimmin' loud everywhere. :)
