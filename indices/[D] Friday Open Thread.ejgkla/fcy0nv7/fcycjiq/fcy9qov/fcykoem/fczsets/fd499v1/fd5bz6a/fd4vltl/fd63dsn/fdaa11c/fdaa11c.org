Depends, I've tried reading a lot of the European classics (Goethe, Shakespear, Schiller), and they do /barely/ anything for me. It's sometimes worth it to get some cultural references and the origins of metaphors or popular sayings, but whatever deeper meanings and insights into the human condition they had, have been repackaged into more easily digested books since then.

Instead I've had some amount of fun and intellectual engagement reading non-fiction books on a variety of "high-brow" topics; history can be actually interesting, and many intelligent people have contributed to essay collections on basically any topic of interest to science and society.
