There was a recent article on Slate Star Codex, [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/12/11/acc-is-eating-meat-a-net-harm/][Is Eating Meat a Net Harm]], that attempts a calculation on if a standard food animal would be better off living a life in a factory farm or not existing. Their estimate is in units of animal-day-equivalents-to-human-days, or how many days would you want to live a standard cow life in exchange for a day as a standard human. They estimated an exchange rate of 10 cow-days in exchange for one human-day, and -2 human-days in exchange for a chicken-day. Basically, broiler chickens live a life worse than death to the point that you would shorten your life by two days to NOT spend a day as a chicken.

That may or may not be relevant to your question, but it is one attempt at trying to quantify if it is better to exist or not.
