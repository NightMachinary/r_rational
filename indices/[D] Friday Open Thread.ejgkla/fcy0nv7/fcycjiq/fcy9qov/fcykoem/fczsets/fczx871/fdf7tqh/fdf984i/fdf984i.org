Thank you. This is the response I needed. You are totally correct that it doesn't make sense to ask some hypothetical version without that code because that hypothetical version is /different being/, definitionally, and in the same way, a hypothetical human without the evolutionary hardwired preference for existence vs. non existence is /not the same being/ as the one with the hardwired preference.
