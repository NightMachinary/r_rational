If you've read Worm, you should check out its successor, [[https://www.parahumans.net/about/][Ward]]. It's not Worm 2; a different protagonist, a (necessarily) different world, and different protagonist also mean it tackles very different themes.

The protagonist is /very/ unlike Taylor; she rarely does that thing Taylor does where she comes across more like a battle AI than a human. She does a /lot/ of introspection, trying to regulate her thoughts, and making sure she doesn't use more force than necessary. Her power is less munchkin-able than Taylor's, too, but she's still very experienced and creative with it.

The side characters are more fleshed out, too; I don't think I liked any of the Undersiders as much as those kids.

It's a bit slower to start with; I think it takes until ~Arc 6 to really get started with the important plot stuff. But when I was reading along with the released chapters, I was happy enough with the pacing.
