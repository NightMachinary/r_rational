EDIT: STREAM NO LONGER LIVE, THANKS FOR JOINING! We had a lot of [[https://imgur.com/a/25G0DQI][fun]] and might do more r/r related streams in the future.

A few friends and I are watching [[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/437697099383963668/662730039984652288/dahlstream.png][Roald Dahl movies]] tomorrow so we can

1. Have fun together as a community and
2. Understand some references in Chili and the Chocolate Factory [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/]], the latest hit rational fic. (YES, EVEN NOW)

if you're interested, join us tomorrow at 3PM EST in [[https://cytu.be/r/homestuckmovienight]].

We'll watch all the movies people feel like watching, might split them across two streams if people get tired. If you're new to these streams please install the [[https://cytu.be/google_drive_userscript][movie synch script]] first.

Judging from past movie streams I'd expect around 15 people to join, so don't worry about awkward dead chats.
