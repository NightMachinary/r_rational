I'm being serious. I honestly believe climate change is a serious but not apocalyptic man made threat. But I can see why people disagree. If for some reason an educational YouTuber I really liked made videos about why climate change is fake, and used very in depth arguments for it, then I wouldn't be able to tell for myself who was telling the truth.
