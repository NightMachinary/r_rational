I always feel, for most political issues, what you believe comes down to who you trust. Few people have personally analyzed the science and economics of climate change by personally reading over primary sources to get an accurate idea what a good response to climate change is. Instead, at best, they watch some YouTube videos, have some school lessons, and read some articles about the topic, and trust the ones that sound the most authoritative and accurate.

If you trust educational YouTubers, you will think climate change is a real but not apocalyptic threat. If you trust Rose Twitter, climate change will kill us all with in 50 years if capitalism isn't abolished. If you trust Fox News, climate change is greatly exaggerated and not a significant concern.

And there are reasons to trust all of them. Educational YouTube has links to scientific studies. Rose Twitter is unbiased by corporate shills who manipulate things for billionaires. Fox News is a national news program that has professional, very well paid people to tell the news, and has the respect of the US president.
