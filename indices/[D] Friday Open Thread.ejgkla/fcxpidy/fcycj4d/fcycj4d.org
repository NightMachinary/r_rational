Minor disagreements are, if anything, /more/ suited to vitriol than major disagreements. A major completely-different-paradigm ideological difference generally isn't /personal/, but someone getting answers 99% the same as you but critically different is a blatant violation of the ideals you hold dear.

Even taking that into account, though, there's no reason to assume that everyone in rationalism circles has similar political views. [[/r/rational]] is a book club, essentially only tangentially correlated with the rationalism movement, and so naturally there will be plenty of people here who aren't rationalists and are just here because we have good stories.

But even as you move to the more directly rationalist communities, like Slate Star Codex or Less Wrong itself, people can discover rationalism from all sorts of lifestyles. Remember that the Sequences are hosted on the internet (and thus accessible from everywhere in the world no matter your country or creed) and one of its biggest advertisements is Harry Potter fanfiction, attracting from the fanfic-reader crowd which isn't super-correlated with much politically.

The Sequences are illuminating, but hardly brainwashing. If you start reading them as a diehard conservative you aren't necessarily going to have all your politics stripped away from you by the end and replaced with the same rationalist politics as the 'standard' rationalist. And that goes double if they only read some of the Sequences, or if they're in the less rationalist-y communities, and so on and so forth.

The biggest advantage rationalism might give against meanness in political threads is the warnings against biases that, if you keep your eyes on them, might remind you when your arguments are just incendiary or when your opponent might not be malicious after all, but that's hardly a surefire technique. All it takes is someone to not be on guard for that and they're just the same as everyone else in political threads, and things don't end up much different.
