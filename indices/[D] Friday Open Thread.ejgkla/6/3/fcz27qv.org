Beeminder is the only thing that works for me and [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/reading][reading]].

What is beeminder? Basically, you tell it what you want to do, by when, and you enter periodic progress and they make you a pretty graph. If you don't meet your progress goals, they charge you money. So, for example, if I have a goal to read 7 pages of my book each week, I have to read 1 page a day. Say I read 3 pages on Day 1, I don't have to read again until Day 4; but if I only read one page on Day 1, then I have to read again on Day 2. It's great for anything that can be broken up into sub-parts (like reading pages of books), but anything that can't be broken up like that can usually be timed which is an OK proxy (the app has a decent stopwatch feature that you can use to enter data).

I personally set a page goal, but you can easily set a time goal - I've done that for [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/pokemon-shield][pokemon shield]] (yes, I have become so type A that I have employed a commitment device to ensure my leisure time is used optimally).

It doesn't set a routine specifically, but it forces you to actually get the shit done. I find I end up reading at similar times each day (right after work, right before bed), and especially now I've ramped it up quite a bit (two goals: general reading and reading Harry Potter in French, which I'm aiming to bump up into 3 of English/gen French/HP French).

I became a lot more reliant on beeminder during my sabbatical, which was great because my sabbatical was unstructured by nature. I made a goal for [[https://www.beeminder.com/mad/orthographe][completing a French workbook]], my husband has made a goal for changing the sheets twice a month, my other partner has made a goal for getting pomos done on his PhD project (which is integrated with complice), I have several duolingo goals, I have goals for feeding my fish and giving my dog her monthly flea medicine.

The support staff are excellent, the founders bought me dinner once and were cool people, and I've purchased got a lifetime premium account.

It's basically an accountability partner (the app bugs you, a LOT, if you're going to derail that day), it requires quantifiable goals, and you have deadlines. It's awesome.
