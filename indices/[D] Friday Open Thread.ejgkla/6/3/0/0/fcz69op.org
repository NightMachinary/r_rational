FWIW I've never given them money for derailing because I'm super stingy, except for the cost of my premium account. So I find the fear of loss in general motivates me enough.

If you don't mind me asking, what goals did you pay out on? What do you "blame" on paying out (e.g. you set the goals too high; the website was too confusing; you were just lazy)? Cause like, the whole goal of the site is to find the amount that motivates you for fear of losing it (cause you know that if you are paying 100 USD if you don't read one page of a book tonight, you are going to move heaven and earth to read that page - or at least I would).

They've modified the interface about pledges a bit so you can set your cap - I think for example for my "play pokemon" goal, the maximum I can be charged for failure is 5 USD, while other goals of mine go up to like 180 USD in theory for repeated failures. (Basically, you start off paying a small amount - say $1 - for failure, then it goes up to $5, $20, $80, $200 and stops somewhere around there every subsequent time you fail. They're doing A/B testing on how to raise the pledges at the moment so yours might look different).
