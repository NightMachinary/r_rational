One of my New Year's resolutions is to develop more studious habits. You know how it is- there are all these cool things you want to learn, but you just never get around to them.

My ideas include separating myself from internet/phone with only a topical book for a set amount of time (say 1 hour a day), set aside the a particular time block at the same time each day to further develop the routine, get an accountability partner, and set quantifiable goals and deadlines.

Does anybody have other suggestions for giving myself motivation or helping develop a routine?
