I think those books have value that can be drawn from them, regardless of enjoyment or quality. It's important to see what the people that came before us considered important enough to make a record of it, be philosophical musings or ancient graffiti. The Epic of Gilgamesh is our first example of metacognition. It shows us that even so long ago, humans have very similar minds, and considering their perspectives can allow you to better understand your own.
