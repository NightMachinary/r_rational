People sometimes talk about how to get into highbrow books, despite them being (for most normal dudes) boring and difficult to read. But, beside the bragging rights and signalling sophistication, is it even /worth/ doing that in the first place? Is literary fiction, classical literature, and other stuff you sometimes get assigned as compulsory reading in school, significantly better in terms of enjoyment/entertainment/intellectual stimulation/introspection/learning/insert-another-thing-we-read-for than, say, genre fiction, good amateur web novels, and quality fanfiction?

I'm asking since I'm contemplating forcing myself to read some "must read" classics from /lit/ recommendation charts and am hesitant whether it's worth the initial mental pain and effort.
