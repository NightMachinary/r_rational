That was a neat twist at the end of chapter. I am very much in favor of people negotiating and working things out, as seen in both meetings T had.

I can see couple of ways you can make objects/people Ziz-proof, depending what you kept form canon. (Simurgh was a benevolent figure, Ziz was a malevolent, according to Wikipedia anyway, see no reason to call her by wrong name)

I should also point out there are other ways to communicate across continents with out cables and satellites, such as direct beams and various Tinker type tech.

Characters are okay in my opinion, but then again I am not the best judge of characters so the best I can say is they don't feel wrong to me. Like I said nice twist on chapter end, very sensible and expected with current situation.

Final note: Very glad you are still writing this, even if it is slow as molasses. Good work! Huzzah for You! Doot Doot! etc.
