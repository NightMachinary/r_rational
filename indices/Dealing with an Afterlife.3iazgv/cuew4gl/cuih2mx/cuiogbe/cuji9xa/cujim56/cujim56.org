For most cases, that would be fine. However, there would be a significant difference in the sorts of plans I would make depending on whether I was 90% confident in the afterlife, 99.9% confident, 99.9999% confident, or 99.9999999% confident... and that difference arises because I'm at least an aspiring Bayesian, and I try to calibrate my level of belief to the level of evidence available, and each of those scenarios implies a vast difference in the amount and quality of evidence available about the afterlife in question. (For comparison, I am, roughly, only 99.998 confident that I am going to survive the next 24 hours. If I am more confident in the existence of an afterlife than I am in that, then all sorts of wacky-but-logical consequences ensue.)

This sort of issue is one of the main reasons I prefer to measure probability - and subjective confidence levels - logarithmically rather than linearly, using what are called "decibans". 90% confidence corresponds to 10 decibans, 99% to 20, 99.9% to 30, and so on. 100% certainty would require an infinite amount of decibans. If every Planck volume of the universe since the Big Bang had contained a deciban's worth of evidence in the existence of the afterlife, I /still/ wouldn't have 100% certainty, or anywhere close to it.

Or, put another way, ever since considering some of the variations on hypothetical trolley problems, I am quite willing to say that it is possible to set up a hypothetical scenario /wrong/. "Trolley's coming. Will you do X or Y?" "I'd /try/ to-" "X or Y. /X or Y/? *X or Y*?" To which the only adequate response is: "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_%28negative%29#In_popular_culture][Mu]]."
