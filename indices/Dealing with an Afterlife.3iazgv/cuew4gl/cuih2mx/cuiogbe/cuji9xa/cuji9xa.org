Yes, that is definitely true in reality. However, in a hypothetical situation, it doesn't apply. A hypothetical scenario is a "what-if". The point is to take that initial, pre-supposed condition, and determine what courses of action would make the most sense, /with the supposition that the terms of the scenario are true/. So, within a hypothetical, you don't need to be persuaded of the veracity of the starting conditions.
