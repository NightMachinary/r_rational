/"The gods of the Disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the dead, and so people only go to hell if that's where they believe, in their deepest heart, that they deserve to go. Which they won't do if they don't know about it. This explains why it is so important to shoot missionaries on sight."/ -- (Terry Pratchett, Eric)

Yes I know I just used the same quote in an HPMoR thread. Still need to keep it in mind here.
