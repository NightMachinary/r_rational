When does life begin? At conception? Is heaven overrun by the souls of embryos who failed to implant in the uterine wall, and who outnumber normal humans five or ten to one?

Case 1: That doesn't tell me much. I don't think I have enough information to decide on a course of action. Well, except that I'd worry a lot less about other people dying. "Natural disaster kills 20,000 people? So what?"

Case 2: I'd do what many religions have already concluded is the sensible thing to do. Try to get as many people as possible into heaven by "converting" them.
