With a billion dollars, there might even be a way to save the murderer from hell.

The murderer could be frozen and put in a spaceship headed towards a black hole's event horizon so his soul can't reach the afterlife. Or their brain could be modified to find hell pleasurable. Such drastic personality change is no different from dying, but that's no worse than what happens in this universe anyway.
