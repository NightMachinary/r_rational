How the heck do I know there's an afterlife but nothing about it's contents? Did Omega tell me about it? Don't answer that.

Anyway, death is still a bad thing, obviously. This probably has some interesting effects on anthropic edge cases in probability; but since I have no idea how to deal with those, I don't know what those effects are.

... I suppose it might be worth killing some highly-trained people to act ass agents in the afterlife, bargain on behalf of humanity, etc etc; but the afterlife is almost certainly inhabited by superhuman forces, all else being equal. Probably not worth it. (You could train people with long-term terminal diagnoses, if you don't think the extra skill bonus from choosing your agents from a larger pool is worth killing people for.)

In the /second/ case, abolishing anything resembling a death penalty and trying /extremely hard/ to get anyone with a risk of dying to repent becomes /very important/. Personally, I'd suggest founding a new strain of Christianity, backed by all the rationality your billion dollars can buy.
