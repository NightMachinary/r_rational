The real problem with an afterlife of the second sort is that there's not really a line where people suddenly switch from "good person" to "bad person". In reality, everyone is at one place or another along a spectrum of morality. A line on one side of which you go to heaven and on the other side go to hell couldn't be anything but arbitrary.
