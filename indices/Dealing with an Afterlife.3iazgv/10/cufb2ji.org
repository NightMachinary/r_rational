Do the criteria for Heaven and Hell match any real-life beliefs in how to get to Heaven/Hell?

If yes, every actual religion which believes in a literal Heaven and Hell also describes ways of getting there that would offend any modern person's sense of morality. (The gays on Reaper, for instance, would be in big trouble.) Are we to assume that this idea of Heaven and Hell works like any real-life religion? If yes, then since (just by being in this subreddit) you are statistically likely to be an atheist, you're probably already screwed. Use your billion dollars to work on life extension, or perhaps, rescuing gays and atheists (and possibly Jews) from Hell.

If no, then the answer depends on exactly what the criteria are. It could be anything; maybe if you don't start making paperclips now, you go to Hell.
