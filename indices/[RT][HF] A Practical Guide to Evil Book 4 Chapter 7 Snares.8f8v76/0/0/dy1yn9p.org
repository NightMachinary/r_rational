Squire is technically a neutral transition name, so there's definitely room for her to play at becoming a hero. However, what we need to remember is that good is not necessarily Good. While Cat may be doing good things, the absoluteness of Good means she wouldn't be classified with them for even the slightest deviation, of which there are many. I think the Woe would work against her - Masego is undoubtedly a villain I suspect no hero has ever been part of a group with a villain. And having the soul of your enemy sown into your mantle isn't great either, nor is having a villainous mentor or being under the Dread Empress, and especially not having sung The Girl Who Climbed the Tower.

While she does care for peace I don't believe she cares about the lives of non-Callowans beyond not becoming a terrible villain that must be put down sooner rather than later. She didn't reject Headsman out of ethical but political reasons.

Now, while the Grey Pilgrim is Good I don't believe that is a fanatical devotion to the cause. He's sent legions of Heroes to their deaths, young children many of them, and I suspect that he may be looking for a way out. He has an incredible amount of weight behind his story, and I believe he may try and push it behind Cat in order to escape.

In Cat's personal story that'd be a nice symmetry, as then both the Grey Pilgrim and the Black Knight would be trying to escape the bounds of their stories.
