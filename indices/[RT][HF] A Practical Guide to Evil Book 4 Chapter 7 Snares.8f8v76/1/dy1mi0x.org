  “Talk with Kegan,” I finally said. “She was never eager, and it's not a given she'll still be willing. There's risks involved for her people. If she agrees, though, start laying the groundwork. But we're not going through with it until I give the word.”

They could intercept the army before it left Arcadia and ride the narrative until casualties would be high enough for Catherine to call a retreat.
