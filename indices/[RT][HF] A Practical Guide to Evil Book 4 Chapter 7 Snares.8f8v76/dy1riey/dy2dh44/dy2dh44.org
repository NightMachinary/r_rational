I have alwasy said that to do evil the rigth way, cat does not need to be evil, she have aways being about doing the lesser evil, but that have took her a downhill allay since her mentors are totally evil, what would happen if she did the same but coming from a Good background, Balance is was cat need, the ability to be on both sides and do what is needed be it good and bad without having her name and her story going against it.
