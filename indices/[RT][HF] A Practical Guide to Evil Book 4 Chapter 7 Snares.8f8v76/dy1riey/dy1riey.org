The possible redemption arc is strong in this one. Let's see, we have:

1. The status quo. Cat has some Good in her as she offers the infiltrating Heroes amnesty but in the end goes back to her Evil ways.
2. She talks with Cordelia, shows honest regret and remorse. Wants to resolve the upcoming conflict peacefully.
3. Her officers present mostly Evil, unsavory and easy solutions. She isn't tempted and rejects them all.
4. She meets an old Hero who's big on mentorship.

I doubt Cat will truly become a Hero but the story has a shape that's ripe for being abused. If during a pitched battle she was to proclaim being a Hero, would Grey Pilgrim be forced to step in and save her? This is especially important if you take her Fae nature into consideration.
