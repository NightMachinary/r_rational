You're confusing the general hero/villain/good/evil thing with capital Good and Evil of this story. Good is pretty much following the God's plans for you and is related to "order", while Evil is more related to "chaos" and to having high ambitions and carving out your own path. Even Good Names in this story can be "evil" morally, or the other way around like Cat tries to be (Evil but good).
