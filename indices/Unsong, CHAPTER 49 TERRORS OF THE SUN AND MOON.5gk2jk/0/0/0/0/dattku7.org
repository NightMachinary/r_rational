'K' has a value of 10. 10 commandments, 10 sephirot bringing divine light into the world, in contrast to 'ck' with a value of 13.

Di-k is therefore 20 - but there are two of them, for 40. 40 days and nights Jesus spent resisting temptation in the desert, 40 years of the Hebrews' wandering being rewarded by God by delivery to the promised land. 40 also corresponds to the gematria value for 'life' and 'I am', the divine statement of pure being.
