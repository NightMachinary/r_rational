"Dick" begins with 'di-', two, connects with Thamiel, 'duality of god', weilds a bident (phallic symbol built around the number two, i.e. a dick). 'Ck' has a gemmatria value of 13, representing unluck and bad circumstances. 26 (2 x 13 , 'di-' x ck) is the same value as the gemmatria for "bad egg".

Nothing is a coincidence.
