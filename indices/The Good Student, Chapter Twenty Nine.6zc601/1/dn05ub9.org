A thousand years is a long time. What does it say about the pace of cultural/linguistic change in Ranvar that Winnum Roke speaks the same language in the same dialect/accent as Simole?

Alternatively, since the Other Place makes everything sort of like you expect it to be, perhaps Simole is just expecting everyone to talk the same way she does and everything follows from there.
