I did enjoy How To Avoid Death On A Daily Basis, which is why I started The Good Student. My other comments explain more, but I had to put this story on pause. Is it unfair I compare [[/u/mooderino][u/mooderino]] to Robin Hobb and other notables? Not in my mind, Mooderino put his art on public display, and I have made comment. Either I am not his audience and he is better off without me, or I am, and he deserves the chance to know my mind, and re-entice me as a reader. Regardless, he has talent, and is better then i0% of published fantasy authors.
