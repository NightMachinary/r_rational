For the moment, but probably not for much longer. It seems to have lost its spark.

A few more words of clarification, in case the author watches these threads. The storyline about the demons and the other place bores me. It bores me because it doesn't directly threaten the protagonist or his goals. Also, his goals seem to have become nonexistent. As have his study habits. I was kind of looking forward to a good study-fantasy. I wish it could have stayed that way.
