  the fundamental conflict and goals of the story is still very unclear.

Is it fair to ask for clarity in these things in an [[/r/rational]] story? There are at least two aspects here.

One is that rational readers generally enjoy more subtle hints as to the true nature of the world - multiple readings are practically mandatory so that there are significant hypotheses to strike down as part of discovering the world.

Another is that by and large reality presents itself without such clarity, and a big part of rationality is recognizing how often we impose structures and definitions - sometimes helpfully, sometimes not.

I'm interested in people's thoughts since in my own writing I actively try to present scenes that have multiple readings.
