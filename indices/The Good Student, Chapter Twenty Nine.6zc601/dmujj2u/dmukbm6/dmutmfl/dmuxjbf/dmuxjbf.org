  In short, the fundamental conflict and goals of the story is still very unclear.

I may be in error but to me the demons are the big antagonists (there are also lesser things to overcome like the prejudice of the upper class etc.), the goal is to save Simone and the world and there is lots to be discovered about the world, the school, arcanum, society etc.

In the sense that it does not conform to the roles and steps of "the hero's journey" 100% I guess it is unclear, but I (disclaimer: personal taste) don't think that is a requirement for a good story.
