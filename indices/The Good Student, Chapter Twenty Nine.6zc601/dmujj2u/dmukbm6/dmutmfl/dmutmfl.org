We're fairly deep into the story and there has yet to be a clear antagonist. We don't really know what the protagonist is striving for; we don't know what challenges he needs to overcome. We don't really even know what events are good and what are bad for him. In short, the fundamental conflict and goals of the story is still very unclear.

Don't get me wrong, it's interesting that we're still guessing what's happening. This could be a useful approach that accurately reflects the sense of confusion and being lost in a big world that the main character must be feeling. But... I'm increasingly worried that the story will never start coalesce. It's gone on for quite a while now.
