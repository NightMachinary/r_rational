  Is it fair to ask for clarity in these things in an [[/r/rational]] story?

Well, I could reasonably argue that the rational genre doesn't obviate the rules of good story-telling, but the honest truth is that I won't judge this story till it's done. These confusing narratives and unclear antagonist may resolve in a really interesting way that brings together everything to a fitting whole. Or, they may not. We'll have to see.
