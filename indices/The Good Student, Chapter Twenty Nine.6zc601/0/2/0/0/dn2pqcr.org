Ah, then I thank you. Certainly How to Avoid Death on a Daily Basis is a favorite, which I binged. Your charecter building is excellebt, and it somewhat reminds me of the anime The Hosts Club, which is contrived, but pleasurable.\\
Feom my amateur mind I feel foe this story you made a more in depth plan then normal, which limited your voice. I feel your voice is novel, and superb, and anything which could interrupt should be eliminated. I truly apoligize for my earlier criticism because you have done something I could not...write a compelling, original work with complex charecters and a novel setting. Thank you.
