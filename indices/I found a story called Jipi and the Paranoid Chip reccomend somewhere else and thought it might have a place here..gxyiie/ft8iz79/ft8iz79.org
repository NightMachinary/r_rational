Nice story. It is curious how the older stories (Asimov, this one) like to think of robots as slightly dumber more alien versions of us.

I'm not sure why you would want to attach a bomb to a system which was designed to minimize false-positives at the expense of false-negatives though... It seems like a good way to blow yourself up.
