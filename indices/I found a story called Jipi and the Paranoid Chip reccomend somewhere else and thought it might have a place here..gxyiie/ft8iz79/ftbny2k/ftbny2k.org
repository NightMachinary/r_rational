I don't think it's that curious. That's still ahead of where AI is today, and given the rate of growth of technology it is not surprising that science fiction writers of 20-50 years ago went in that direction. The idea of "a superintelligent AI is inevitably going to kill all of us unless we are preemptively paranoid" is a relatively new phenomenon, and the, shall we say, over-abundance of that attitude is relatively limited.
