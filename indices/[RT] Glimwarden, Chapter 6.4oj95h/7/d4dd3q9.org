Aren't travel lanterns a thing? I assume that means a form or portable lantern. Why wouldn't it be standard practice to move one or two of those to the site of a breach? Or have a smaller, independent lantern in every lantern building. This would give the engineers inside the time to repair the main lantern while the glimwardens focused on evacuating everyone else.
