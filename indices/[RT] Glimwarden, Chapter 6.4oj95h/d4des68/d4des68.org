Really enjoying this story. I enjoyed Shadows of the Limelight well enough, but this has surpassed that in every way from my perspective. I'm super impressed and happy to see your original fiction deliver on the promise you showed with The Metropolitan Man. Of course, this is just my opinion; others may have liked Shadows of the Limelight more than I did.

Also, I was surprised to see you deviate from the Sander->Philip->Melanie pattern, but I think it was a good choice, and it's good that you did it early on.
