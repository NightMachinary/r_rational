For the last few months I've been editing a manuscript that strictly adheres to a rotation through three characters, and I've been having a hell of a time with it because each of the characters have different story beats and I can't quite seem to hit them in the right sequence while maintaining the Issah->Williiam->Ellebeth->Issah cycle.

So here, the original plan was to go through all four characters in a defined cycle, but as soon as I ran into a problem with it I dropped it.

I agree that Shadows was ... maybe not everything I had wanted it to be.
