Not at all - I'm a huge fan of your worldbuilding and approach to exposition and pacing, and I imagine it takes significant thought and revision to get right. I'd like to write more, myself, but I keep running into problems creating believable early-story conflicts that are relevant to the protagonist(s).

Not to sidetrack this thread, but are there any creative writing resources you'd recommend I look into?
