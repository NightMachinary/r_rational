[[http://www.writingexcuses.com/][Writing Excuses]] is a great podcast that covers a lot of important concepts.

I'm a big follower of Sanderson's [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][First]], [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/][Second]], and [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-third-law-of-magic/][Third]] laws of magic.

Stephen King's [[https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816][On Writing]] is one of the only books that I'd recommend on the subject. There are a ton of books about how to write well, but don't read too many of them, because at some point you're doing the equivalent of buying a bunch of running shoes and never actually putting them on to go jog around the block.

Dan Harmon's [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][Story Circle Method]] is my preferred method of structuring stories; it's a prescriptivist version of Joseph Campbell's descriptivist [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces][The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]. (/Glimwarden/'s plot is structured as story circles within story circles within story circles next to story circles.)

Also, [[/u/daystareld]] and I will be putting out a podcast in the next few weeks, "Rationally Writing", which is about writing rationally, so keep an eye on that.

My number one advice is to read a lot and write a lot, and do both of those with an analytical mindset. Break things down to see how they work and why they work, or in some cases why they fail. If you need help getting into an analytical mindset, try reading some in-depth criticism of something that you like or are at least familiar with. (Though they're not about writing, [[https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X][Understanding Comics]] by Scott McCloud and the Youtube channel [[https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting][Every Frame a Painting]] were both things that influenced how I think about telling stories.)

Edit: Oh, also [[http://tvtropes.org/][TV Tropes]], which is itself a form of multimedia criticism.
