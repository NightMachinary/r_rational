When Mr. Wales and I were in early talks about the translation of /The Glimwarden Chronicles/, he suggested standardization of all units to metric. I objected vehemently to this, and explained that the role of translation is to aid the reader in immersion. The primary audience for this translation is readers with English as a first language, who are primarily American (some three hundred million out of four hundred million). If the translation had used kilograms instead of pounds when describing a person's weight, the average reader would have to stop for a moment to grapple with what that meant, because there would be no instinctual understanding.

I have occasionally used metric where I believe the average reader would understand what was meant by it. Meters convert well enough to yards that they would hardly give anyone pause. Centimeters are also, I believe, widely known to the average reader as a smaller unit of measure, and they scan better than fractions of an inch. In this particular chapter, "miles" are used because they convert rather cleanly from the distance used by the original text; in this case, "1.6 kilometers" would read exceptionally poorly, while "one kilometer" would be too inaccurate. There are other places within the work where I have translated a distance to kilometers, but this is mostly done to achieve a particular feel or tone that the original text captured.
