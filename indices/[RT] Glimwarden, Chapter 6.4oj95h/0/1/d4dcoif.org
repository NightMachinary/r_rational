  Have you thought about including a link in each chapter to the corresponding reddit post? It would sort of compensate for their almost empty comment sections, and be useful for people discovering glimwarden through other channels than [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

I've been dragging my feet on installing the Wordpress plug-in that embeds reddit comments in place of having comments hosted on the site ([[https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redditjs/][this is the method]]). Mostly I think it's going to be some un-fun work getting it functional, and when I have the free time I'd rather be writing, which is both fun and productive. I will eventually get around to making it work though, ideally within a template that only applies to this story. (There are a few downsides, like turning away people who don't understand or like reddit, but consolidation of discussion is a big enough positive that the downsides aren't what's stopping me.)
