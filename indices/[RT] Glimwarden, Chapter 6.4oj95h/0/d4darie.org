  Philip sat down beside the limp body and started thinking about how he could use this situation to his advantage.

... Good thing you keep your priorities straight, I guess?

Random thoughts:

- This is probably going to mess with the tournament and the lantern construction big time, right? They're probably going to need a lot of replacements glimwardens, for starters.

- Sanders, grow a sense of self-preservation, please. This is kind of embarrassing right now.

- I love how Philip looks completely badass from Sanders' POV, unharmed, implacable, covered in darkling gore, in the middle of a sea of bodies, calmly contemplating his certain death... Then you switch to Philip's POV and realize he's unharmed because the darklings completely ignored him.

- I hope Sanders and Philip start bouncing thoughts at each other. They're both very "optimize literally everything" people, with similar-ish drives and completely opposed (complementary?) outlooks and skills. "So THAT's why they didn't want to accept my fishing quotas! What a satisfying, non-politically-motivated, completely rational reason!".

- I can't help but notice that the super darkling king murderboss made its villain getaway here. This cannot possibly not be a problem later.

- alexanderwales: Have you thought about including a link in each chapter to the corresponding reddit post? It would sort of compensate for their almost empty comment sections, and be useful for people discovering glimwarden through other channels than [[/r/rational][r/rational]].

- Why aren't there snipers defending the town? Whether gunmen, bowmen or crossbowmen, it would seem much easier to build a reserve army out of long-range fighters: you don't need to feed them hearts, there's less of a morale problem since they can stay on fortifications, and they can hunt darklings close to town in relative safety. Might be one of those coordination problems Philip should work on once he takes over the town.

- Am I the only one who got 'Attack on Titan' / 'Worm Endbringers' flashbacks reading this chapter?
