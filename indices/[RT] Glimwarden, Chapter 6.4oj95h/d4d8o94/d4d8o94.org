Awesomely done! I did expect sanders to at least have one lucky strike but you nicely subverted The Heros Luck.

Thoughts:

A) So obviously stone fortifications give some measure of protection from darklings (lantern buildings). Is the absence of walls part of the inefficiency of Lights Hollow or are big building projects just too ressource intensive within the restraints of the lanterns radius?

Quick calculation: 10000m circumference on one lantern, a wall 2m high and 50cm thick needs a cube of 21m stone. Seems doable, even if we double thickness.

B) One possible solution to the trouble of temporary failures would be to have a runecart with a traveling lantern ready. Not cheap, but cheap compared to loosing 3 glimwardens! Man, Lights Hollow is pissing me off even more than real world politics/inefficiencies.

C) One way for Phil to wrest advantage is to start eating the hundreds of hearts lying around. Presumably all glimwardens are DEAD - an existential problem for the town! The power that comes with having the strongest bind in town should be incomparable, cutting his route to route to dictatorship short.

D) At least something should be done about conserving the hearts, running to the lantern building and getting the conservation thingy. I mean its probably the last supply the town is going to easily get...
