I can't think of another one you've written, but this was a great all-out battle scene! You captured the excitement and rush of battle while also showing it to be a brutal, disorganized mess.

I really enjoyed the comparison and contrast between Sander's and Philip's perspectives. They're both intelligent but inexperienced, and they understand each other well, for two people who have fundamentally orthogonal views of the universe and the people in it.

This seems like the beginning of a long and productive friendship, which is doubly entertaining considering how little experience either of them have with friendship, and that Sander's mindset is essentially "I wanna be the hero," and Philip's is "I wanna be the big bad."
