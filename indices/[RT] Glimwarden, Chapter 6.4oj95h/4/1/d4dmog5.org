Surely you can do a bit better by moving the 8th lantern a bit farther away...

My reasoning is that adding a lantern "at infinity" adds pi square miles of safe area. Moving it towards the existing lanterns will increase the amount of new safe land until the circle of radius 1 around the lantern begins to intersect the area that is already safe. In any case, this is some pretty cool analysis. It's like a continuous analogue of circle-packing.
