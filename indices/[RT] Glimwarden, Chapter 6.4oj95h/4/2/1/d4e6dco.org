I get that if a lantern projects gliminance x/d^{3} to a point at distance d, and at one mile from one vertex of the hexagon along the line between it and the opposite vertex the gliminance is 1 arbitrary unit of glim, then:

x=1/(1+1/3^{3} +1/5^{3} +2/(7^{1.5} )+2/(19^{1.5} ))\\
=0.84949 arbitrary units of glim
