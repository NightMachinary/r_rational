Here's some more numbers, 'cause math is fun. Making the same normalization of "gliminance at 1 mile is 1":

| Event/Location                  | Distance estimate                  | Gliminance estimate |
|---------------------------------+------------------------------------+---------------------|
| Border of Light's Hollow        | 1 mile from lantern                | 1.177               |
| Sander's Grapnel fight          | .5 km past markers                 | 0.581               |
| Sander's Fracture flight        | 60 feet past markers               | 1.142               |
| Philip's radio chat             | 20 feet past markers               | 1.165               |
| Darkling watching Philip        | 320 feet past markers              | 1.007               |
| Merry's record                  | 2 miles past markers               | 0.080               |
| Healer's Lantern (unlit)        | 0                                  | 0.776               |
| Melting Schism (Healer's relit) | 200 / 500 / 1000 feet from lantern | 18,400 / 681 / 147  |

Given that the Fracture was "being torn apart at the seams" under 1.142 gliminance yet the Schism was not immediately obliterated by Healer's Lantern at 100+ times as much radiation, I wonder if only the surface of a darkling suffers a lantern's effect.
