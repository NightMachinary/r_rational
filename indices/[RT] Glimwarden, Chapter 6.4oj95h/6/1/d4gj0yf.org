  One way for Phil to wrest advantage is to start eating the hundreds of hearts lying around.
#+end_quote

/Is/ this an advantage? If he eats any Hearts, then he's either an Auxiliary or a Glimwarden for life. As an Auxiliary, he can expect to die the next time there's a lantern failure (the Darklings probably didn't attack him primarily /because/ he was the only one there who /hadn't/ eaten any Hearts). And we already know he doesn't want to be a Glimwarden (he merely wants to be seen as someone who wants to be a Glimwarden, preferably losing the contest without looking like he's losing it on purpose).

So, eating Hearts at this point works /against/ his real aims.
