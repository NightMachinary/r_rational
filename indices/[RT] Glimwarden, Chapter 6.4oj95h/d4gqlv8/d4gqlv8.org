Request: Consistency in units. Don't mix imperial and metric. The only places that to do that in our world (the anglosphere mostly) are for very specific reasons. Though I'm sure [[/u/mohammadashworth]] has an explanation.

My preference would be a wholesale switch to metric but it's pretty weird seeing Sanders evaluate a distance as 100m then talk about 300ft.

Edit: Now that I read the comments I see that he actually has replied to another comment on the same thing... lol
