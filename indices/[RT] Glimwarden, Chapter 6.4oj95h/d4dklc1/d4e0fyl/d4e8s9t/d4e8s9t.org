I'll assume that the edge farthest from the center lantern is 1 mile from the outer lantern (the edges aren't constant distance from outer lanterns). That means the target gliminance is 1.77, instead of 1.

With only one lantern, you get 0.95 mile radius, and an area of 2.82, down from 3.14.

With 7 lanterns: previously the farthest edge was 3.06 from the center; now it's 3. The safe area is now 24.38 (instead of 24.99). It looks like [[http://i.imgur.com/bcJ8vwg.png][this]] ([[http://i.imgur.com/2lKI98b.png][previous version]]). Overall, increasing the target gliminance has a similar effect to spacing the lanterns more and scaling everything down.

I think it would be reasonable for characters in the story to not have done these calculations, and be working primarily on the approximation that lanterns protect a circle around them with radius 1 mile. Then the city would be 7 tangent circles, plus the gaps in between them, possibly plus something on the outside where circles meet.
