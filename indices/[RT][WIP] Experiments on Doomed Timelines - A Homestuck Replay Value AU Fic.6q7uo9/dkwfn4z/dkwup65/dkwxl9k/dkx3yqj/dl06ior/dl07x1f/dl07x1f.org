I see I see, I got up to chapter 34 and saying that I'm engrossed by the story is an underestimation.

I really like that it reads like a cutting room floor article, It's my favorite kind of reading.

Also I wonder if dream bubbles are a thing or the whole replayerverse thing is just taking place on a part of paradox space that has no such thing "yet".

Since paradox space is totally weird I suppose that infinite stories could happen in any timeframe

Edit: guess dream bubbles so exist as a few chapters later, good to know
