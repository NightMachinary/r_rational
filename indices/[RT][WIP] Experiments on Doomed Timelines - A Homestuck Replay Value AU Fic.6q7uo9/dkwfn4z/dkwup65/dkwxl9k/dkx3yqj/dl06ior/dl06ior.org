That's a complicated question actually. One answer is that the original sburb glitch FAQ actually came out before gender restrictions were canonized in homestuck proper, and another is that there are only so many classes, and assigning male players to female classes and visa versa just makes it easier to create and explore characters. You could probably look at it best in terms of gender tendencies rather than gender restrictions - if classes are attached to people with specific traits and issues, maybe some of those issues are more likely to occur in people socialized female or male. Gender in the real world is already hard enough to define and deal with, I'd imagine that even if sburb had specific gender routines too they would be easily corruptible. How would the game deal with a transgender person, or someone who didn't identify with any gender at all, or someone who was intersex.

Hell, now that I think about it, I might actually make a chapter about this. But tl;dr gender restrictions aren't a thing because I don't want them to be.
