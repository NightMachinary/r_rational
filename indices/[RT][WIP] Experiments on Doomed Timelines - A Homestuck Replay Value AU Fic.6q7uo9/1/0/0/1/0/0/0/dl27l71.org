Dream bubbles are a thing, although they're not really as much of a central focus as they are in homestuck. I think in RVA they're mostly a lot more chaotic and deadselves have less personal awareness and motive and ability to escape their bubbles than in canon, like it's mostly closer to what dreaming in real life feels like for all eternity, you can never really garner enough self-awareness and lucidity to break the cycle, and even if you can, you'll forget soon anyway.

Althrough in the users guide to the apocalypse, the other main RVA work still being updated other than mine, they do make a few references to real objects falling into dream bubbles, giving the ghosts a sort of anchor to focus on and potentially effect the living world, like a real diary that falls into the hands of a ghost, letting them record their own thoughts and keep continuity of consciousness and a train of thought much longer, which I think could make a really interesting plot.
