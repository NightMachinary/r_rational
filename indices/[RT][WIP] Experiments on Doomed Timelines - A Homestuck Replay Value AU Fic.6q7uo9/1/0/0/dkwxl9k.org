Yeah. You don't really have to read any other works in the AU to get it (at least I hope so), but the background is all there. It's mostly just the core idea that after you beat the game you keep playing it in a new session forever, but there are a few other concepts that are considered part of the RVAU canon like new classes and aspects and corruption from angels and horrorterrors. But most of what I've been writing I've tried not to draw too deeply from obscure AU sources or write about anything that would require hours of reading to understand.
