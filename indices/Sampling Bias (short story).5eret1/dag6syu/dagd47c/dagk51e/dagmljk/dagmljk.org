It is contrived, no doubt about that. The reason I thought I could pull it off was because the MC gets information from the future in the form a Seer's vision which sort of clues him to the Important Piece of Wisdom. If it still seems contrived, then the failure is mine. Thanks for confirming some of my misgivings. I'll try to avoid this particular failure mode in the future.
