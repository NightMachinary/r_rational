I agree, unfortunately. I did not intend for it be so long winded, since I prefer to get the point across in 2000 words. But stories tend to run away from me when I write them, and when I went back to review it I couldn't figure out how to shorten it without seeming too direct and preachy, despite getting the same feeling as you did.
