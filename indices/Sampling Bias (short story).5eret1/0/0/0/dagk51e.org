I guess my main problem with it is, most of the story and dialogues sort of build a coherent world? But then the climax seems extremely contrived and unlikely.

As in, the protagonist meets a legendary dragon whose race is supposed to be almost extinct, far from the place these dragons are supposed to be, right after getting the sort-of-life-changing advice from the wizard AND right after talking about this specific kind of dragon?

That aside, I'm also not much of a fan of the "protagonist learns an Important Piece of Wisdom, then immediately gets an occasion to use it / see its value in real life" trope. In real life, transforming epistemology into visible results is hard and progress is usually indistinguishable from confirmation bias.
