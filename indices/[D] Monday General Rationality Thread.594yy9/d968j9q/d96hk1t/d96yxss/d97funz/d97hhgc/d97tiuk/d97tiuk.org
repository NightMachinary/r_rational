Why did he speak up at a board meeting though? What do you accomplish at board meetings? (traditionally: nothing, but that doesn't change the objective)

I'm not saying he shouldn't have done it, but if he just wanted to speak against it he would have spoken to the /offenders/! Unless I've read the post wrong, which is entirely possible.
