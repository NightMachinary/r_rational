You probably just got yourself marked as untrustworthy. Executives don't want to be put in the position of stepping in to deal with behavior on the road. You could probably make the case you are saving them an HR headache, but fault would end up on the person reading the jokes and/or those who participated in the chat room. If the chat room was not a company account, executives have even less culpability. They no longer have plausible deniability.
