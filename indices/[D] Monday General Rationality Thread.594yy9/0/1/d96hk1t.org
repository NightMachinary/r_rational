What's the context? If it's a public group, then you have no reason to speak against people with a poor sense of humor; if it's a private group (either corporate or recreational), then you have every right to campaign to get them restricted. And whatever you do, don't just assume that dark humor damages reputation - it might on a national scale, but on a small scale it's a form of in-group signaling. (As a general rule, think about what motivations a /reasonable/ person would have for making a joke outside the Overton Window. They certainly wouldn't do it if it /damaged/ their standing in regards to normal people.)

I don't think there's an ethical concern regarding dark humor, but it /is/ immature, and that is concerning. Just make sure you're not censoring speech needlessly.
