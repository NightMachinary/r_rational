  I don't really think that's a culture war thing?

I'm pretty sure it is, I know these people and I'm friends with the rest. To explain it fully, I'd have to go through everything that has happened during the last few months but I don't have the time right now. Let's just say that the trip was a complete failure from the viewpoint of our association and at least one previous leading person was fired and is not welcome in anything that has to do with this student association. And why it failed has a lot to do with that joke session and other things that happened on the way there + other kind of organizational dysfunction. I don't think anyone who made those jokes on the way there was even in the meeting yesterday.
