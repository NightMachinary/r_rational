  The people in the executive board meeting weren't there so many of them were quite shocked and I got a lot of compliments for saying it aloud

I don't really think that's a culture war thing? Almost everyone will act 'shocked' when in an official meeting after hearing about something like that; it's hard to tell whether they were shocked because of some internalized culture difference, or just because of the different context.
