One personal example of culture war:

So I study computer science and there was this event with multiple speakers from game and software companies in another city. This event was very drinking focused, people basically drank for three days in a row, but I thought it was a lot of fun and I got to meet a lot of fantastic people.

Anyway, we went to the event by a bus. We had an official WhatsApp group where people could chat. At one point early on we had a "Joke corner" in which people could suggest jokes in the WhatsApp chat and then a guy from our association would tell all the best jokes speaking to a microphone. Very quickly people started to compete who could tell the most offending joke possible, and nigger jokes, holocaust jokes, dead baby jokes and some pedophile jokes were the most common - and this guy would tell all the jokes speaking to a microphone.

I thought this could alienate some people who come to these events and make them less popular and taint the image of our association so I raised the topic in our association's executive board meeting today and said that they should do that a little less. Also, I personally think they're ethically problematic, but I was trying mainly to think about the good of our association here. The people in the executive board meeting weren't there so many of them were quite shocked and I got a lot of compliments for saying it aloud.
