What's the argument in favor of a Trump landslide at this point? Major polling error in the form of incorrectly calibrated likely voter screens? Some as-yet unlaunched October Surprise that changes the race in some dramatic way?

Edit: Alternative scenarios: polls are being rigged in Clinton's favor; election results will be rigged in Trump's favor; mass defection of Democrat electors to Trump; "shy" Trump supporters skewing polls.
