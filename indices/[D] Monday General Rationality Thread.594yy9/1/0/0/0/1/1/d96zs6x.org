I'm asking specifically about a Trump landslide, i.e. [[https://www.predictit.org/Contract/611/Will-the-Republican-presidential-nominee-win-at-least-370-electoral-votes-in-2016#data][this bet]], which is now up to 10%. It requires Trump to get at least 370 electoral votes, which would take [[http://www.270towin.com/maps/W3brw][something like this map]], consistent with a 13-point uniform movement toward Trump in all states. (Though there are obviously other landslide maps.)
