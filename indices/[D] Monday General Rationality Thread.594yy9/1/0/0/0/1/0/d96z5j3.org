  Remember that it doesn't need to be enough that Trump would win, just enough so that the betting odds are favorable even if a loss is more than fifty percent likely.

This isn't just a Trump win; it's a Trump /landslide/ market, winning 370 electoral votes.

  Also, the amounts allowed on InTrade are too small for this to really be true, but maybe an influence is that people are putting money down on Trump as a way of partially hedging against risk from his economic policy?

Intrade has been gone for a few years now....

On PredictIt, there's an $850 limit per contract.
