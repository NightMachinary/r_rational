See, the thing is, while I always wanted the Republican Party to crash and burn, I'm currently very uncertain that this is /how/ I've wanted it to crash and burn. Like, I thought George W. Bush was the kind of "last Republican president" I wanted: someone who didn't just say a few horrible things but actually started a bunch of wars and crashed the economy, proving for generations that his ideology was just plain wrong and needed to be rethought from the bottom up.

Whereas Trump is such a fucking buffoon that the entire camp of intellectual conservatives, corporate conservatives, and right-neoliberals have crossed over into Clinton's camp, thus forcing basically nobody to rethink because everybody can just say that they jumped ship when the word "pussy" came out.
