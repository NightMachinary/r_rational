Not to start some political bullshit here, but no, that's not what [[https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26551][the e-mail]] is saying (I'm assuming it's that one because there was a ZeroHedge article about it). First, they're talking about internal polls, not media organization polling. Second, there are legitimate reasons to oversample a demographic or area; first and foremost, a larger sample means that there's less of a margin of error. If you want a poll of Wisconsin but are especially interested in CD-8, you would want to oversample CD-8 in order to get a better picture of what's going on there rather than just naively sampling equally from all CDs. Afterward, you adjust your results by demographic weight ([[https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/3104][that's what they're talking about in this e-mail]]).

So when they're talking about oversampling of different races or in key districts, it's because they're especially concerned with those demographics or districts.

Edit: So, for example, if you're taking a sample of 400 people in a population that's 90% A and 10% B, your sample will probably only have about 40 B, which gives you a double-digit margin of error there. This is really bad if you're trying to decide whether to do a media buy that's meant to shore up support from the B population; you'd want to get better data about how the B population is feeling, and oversampling is one way to do that.
