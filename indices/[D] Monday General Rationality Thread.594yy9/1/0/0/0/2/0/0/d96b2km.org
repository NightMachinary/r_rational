Thanks for explaining that. At this point, I'm too disgusted by the whole process to bother looking for answers to these questions. I sort of assumed that most of the wild conspiracies coming off Podesta were, in fact, wild, just judging by the poor comprehension of other such "leaks" in the past (particularly when anti climate changers claimed that emails about proper statistical analysis of data were really about cooking the books) but I wasn't particularly interested in looking it up myself.
