  1. Our early forecasts of Trump's nomination chances weren't based on a statistical model, which may have been most of the problem.

  2. Trump's nomination is just one event, and that makes it hard to judge the accuracy of a probabilistic forecast.

  3. The historical evidence clearly suggested that Trump was an underdog, but the sample size probably wasn't large enough to assign him quite so low a probability of winning.

  4. Trump's nomination is potentially a point in favor of “polls-only” as opposed to “fundamentals” models.

  5. There's a danger in hindsight bias, and in overcorrecting after an unexpected event such as Trump's nomination.
