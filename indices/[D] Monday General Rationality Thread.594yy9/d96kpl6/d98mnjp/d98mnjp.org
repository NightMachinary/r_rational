This is more a case of /why/ than /is/. It depends on how much is on the line - if you're just doing it for no reason, then that's probably bad, and if you're just doing it because it's fun, I imagine that might be bad too. If you have to do it because a superintelligence is threatening to collapse society if you don't, and the simulations aren't sentient, and a whole bunch of factors turn out in your favor, then the net utility could be positive.
