Interpretation #1: "It's likelier than not" means "Pr(A)>Pr(~A)", because "it" refers to A and "not" refers to ~A.

Interpretation #2: "It's likelier than not" means "Pr(A)>0", because "it" refers to Pr(A) and "not" refers to the hypothetical concept of a Pr(A)=0.

It occurs to me that there's a third interpretation which explains the common usage:

Interpretation #3: "It's likelier than not" means "Pr(A)>T", where T is the threshold of probability past which things are worth considering. "It" refers to Pr(A) and "not" is short for "not likely", ie, T.
