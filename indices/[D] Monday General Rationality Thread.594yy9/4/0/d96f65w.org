#+begin_quote
  There are two sensible ways to interpret the phrase: "greater than 0% chance" and "greater than 50% chance", which are incredibly different things.

How? There are two propositions, A and ~A.

Pr(A) + Pr(~A) = 1, so if A is likelier than ~A, then Pr(A) > .5

How could it be interpreted as greater than 0?
