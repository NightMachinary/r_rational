Phrases that bug me: "more likely than not" (and the variant "likelier than not" and similar variants). There are two sensible ways to interpret the phrase: "greater than 0% chance" and "greater than 50% chance", which are /incredibly/ different things. Less Wrong's idea that there's no such thing as a 0% chance turns the "greater than 0% chance" into a truism, leaving the "greater than 50% chance" interpretation as the only meaningful one. But in common usage it means neither "greater than 0% chance" nor "greater than 50% chance", but "likely enough that I think it's worth thinking about".
