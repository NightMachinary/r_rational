Any poll worth it's weight (pun unintended) will adjust the sub-samples to match the demographics of likely voters.

For example, African Americans tend not to respond to polls, so they weight African Americans who /do/ respond more heavily.

Oversampling doesn't bias the result (unless there isn't any adjustment), but it does reduce the variance.
