Read the Atlas memo. Some highlights:

- Regional differences in jobs and coal in West Virginia should be explored by micro-targeting programs, oversamples in regions and focus groups. (See the Issues/Messaging section for more.)
- Consider focus groups or an oversampling of the following blocs of infrequent progressive voters: youth (18-29) vote (96,000 infrequent progressive voters), urban apartment dwellers (45,000), urban African Americans (24,000), Somali, Native American, and Urban Hmong (5,000).
- The campaign may wish to conduct larger sample polls, region-specific polls, or selected oversamples to gather data at a micro-level to make informed media decisions.
- Consider individual polls for specific media markets, or at least oversamples for important regions.

It should be clear from this context that "oversample" is a way of gathering extra data, not a way to "skew" the polls.
