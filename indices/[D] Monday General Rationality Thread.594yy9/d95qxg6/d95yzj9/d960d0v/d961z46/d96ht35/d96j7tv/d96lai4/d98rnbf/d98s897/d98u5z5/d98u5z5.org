2 years ago the MN Republicans almost had to declare bankruptcy due to poor handling of their finances. I've heard rumors of similar trouble in other states.

I also hear that this year's Presidential nominee is having an adverse effect on fundraising.

I'm sure that a lot of the rumors will prove to be false, or at least non-fatal to the state parties, but it doesn't look promising (especially with the business wing of the Democratic Party holding on to their power).
