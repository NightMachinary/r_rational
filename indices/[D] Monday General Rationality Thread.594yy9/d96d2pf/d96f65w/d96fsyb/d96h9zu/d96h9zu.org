  Interpretation #2: "It's likelier than not" means "Pr(A)>0", because "it" refers to Pr(A) and "not" refers to the hypothetical concept of a Pr(A)=0.

I'm not getting that. "It" doesn't refer to "P(A)", it refers to "A" itself. It has to because Pr(Pr(A)) doesn't make any sense.

The only way to get that interpretation is to interpret "not" as "some impossible thing", which seems like a stretch, because it means the whole phrase is "It's likelier than (not anything that is possible)" instead of the much more intuitive phrase, "It's likelier than (not it)."

  It occurs to me that there's a third interpretation which explains the common usage:

The common usage, in my opinion, is covered by the first interpretation. I've never had any trouble communicating with this phrase. But then again, maybe I'm receiving a different signal than they are sending?

  Interpretation #3: "It's likelier than not" means "Pr(A)>T", where T is the threshold of probability past which things are worth considering. "It" refers to Pr(A) and "not" is short for "not likely", ie, T.
#+end_quote

But "not" wouldn't be short for "not likely," it would be short for "an event with the lowest probability worth considering," or to use the word, "not any event with a probability worth considering." This also seems like a stretch to me...

If it was just short for "an event that is not likely," then it would reduce to... Pr(A) > Pr(B) and Pr(B) < .5, which would mean that, at least Pr(A) >= .5
