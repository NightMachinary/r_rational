This strikes me as kinda wildly missing the point of the prequels. Because he's putting everything on the Jedi as the source of bad in the story. While the prequels take pains to present the Jedi as just one part of a larger corrupt system that is incapable of resisting a descent into fascism.

Taking things from allegory to real world example, this is basically like blaming the failure of Covid management entirely on the Trump admin and totally ignoring all the deep rooted institutional problems that make the US incapable of handling a crisis.

To be clear, I'm not saying 'missing the point of the prequels' to say that the prequels are good or anything. They're not. But they're also really blatantly about something and to come out even a pithy, jokey take that's /less/ nuanced than the crappy movies is kinda embarrassing.

EDIT: Like, people like to say that the Jedi are bad because, look! They overthrew the rightful elected leader of the Republic. But the only reason they did that in the first place was their utter failure to scrutinize the Chancellor until it was /far/ too late to stop Palpy any other way.
