Nope. Good try! But nope. Both characters and the presumed civilization did not think this out. You sacrificed reasonableness to tell your story, which is bad for scifi in general and anathema to rationalist stories. You asked "how do I set up..." not "what if..."

While there are many indicating flaws, I'll stick with three:

- Why would you /ever/ design your colony ship to land completely? Aside from practicalities and design compromises for doing both interstellar travel and atmospheric landing, you'd making it that much harder to reach the bounty of space.

- In space, there is plenty of space. Not only would you know, to the millimeter if not the micron, how much room the receivers would require, why would you do it inside when there is infinite space outside?

- Everyone's dead. Take the dozen kilobytes to say why, first, and one repeat. Hell, take the space of a million of that billion to say why. What answer could possibly not be worth taking the transmission time to describe the problem? What answer could possibly give you the time to upload everyone, but not enough time to repeatedly describe the problem?

Thanks for trying, please do so again!
