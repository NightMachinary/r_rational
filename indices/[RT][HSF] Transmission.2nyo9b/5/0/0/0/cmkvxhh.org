The rational answer is to shut up and multiply, as it always is. The complication here is the method of assigning value to the survival of the species, since you have to take the vast potential future impact of the civilisation into account. Still, I think we can agree that the utility difference is not infinite between choices. If the risk was sufficiently small, I would slow down to pick the transmission up, but it'd have to be pretty damn small. Trying to invent some kind of ftl and catch the transmission later on is an option as well.
