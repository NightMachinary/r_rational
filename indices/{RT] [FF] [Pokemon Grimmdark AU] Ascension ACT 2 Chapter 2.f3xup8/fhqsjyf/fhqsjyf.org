Delia being a bad parent and knowing that she's a bad parent still makes a little uncomfortable, like I'm still not super sure that most bad parent's even have the self awareness to admit that they're not you know good at being a parent. But from what we see it makes a lot of sense of that she a young-ish woman, who is then a single mother who wants to do work that she's passionate and qualified for. It is a little selfish, but it's understandable that someone would do that. It probably doesn't excuse her failures but at least it acknowledges both that she had them and also that she's aware of them.
