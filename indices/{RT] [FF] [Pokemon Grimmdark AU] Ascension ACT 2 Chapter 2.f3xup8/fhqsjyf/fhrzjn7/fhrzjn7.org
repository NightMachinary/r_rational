" Delia being a bad parent and knowing that she's a bad parent still makes a little uncomfortable, like I'm still not super sure that most bad parent's even have the self awareness to admit that they're not you know good at being a parent. "

You must realize, most 'bad parents' don't have a Kirlia shoving the memory and emotions of said neglected child into there head forcing them to view the incidents from the child's POV. Also, she was not trying to be a bad parent. Unlike some kids who would go ask for attention, we must remember that with Mia keeping him almost constantly happy, Delia (who was quite unexperienced) always thought her son was okay. This isn't justifying her actions, but at least it gives us an idea of why she behaved the way she did.
