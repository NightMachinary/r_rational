Oh no I think how you portray it is completely reasonable, it's just the way that the portrayal shows her neglecting to care for her own son is what makes me uncomfortable. Like it's one thing to have a high fantasy problem, but the way that you're portraying it could easily be the way someone is currently experiencing it today. And that makes me uncomfortable, not at the way you're writing just in general.
