We thought it could be used as a verb. Basically something that indicated embarrassment or exasperation. Though we only use it a few times early on and don't really use it at all anymore. That being said when we go over it we can probably find better verbs to use. From what we read on it (sadly after we published, such is only used in anime/manga contexts). It has only been used in chapters 3,5 and 7 and we don't use it anymore.

/That being said, it is not wrong grammar even if such usage is frowned upon./

Other than its ridiculous connotation with anime/manga it can be taken as a metaphoric verb for embarrassment or exasperation.
