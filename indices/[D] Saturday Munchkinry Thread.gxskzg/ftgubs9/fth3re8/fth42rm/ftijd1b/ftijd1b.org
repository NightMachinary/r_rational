Got it. Then yeah, I'd say find a lab or factory that needs to get friction as low as possible for efficiency or a chemical reaction or whatever, and just maintain your bubble during working hours while the $$$ roll in. Not only are you better than any other method of getting vacuum besides literally going to space, but you eliminate the need for a lot of fancy equipment that wouldn't do the job as well. Also, depending on how much focus you need to exert to keep a bubble going & whether there's a maximum allowed distance between you and your bubbles, you could even hold down another job while doing this and retire in half the time (or donate one of your salaries if you're an effective altruist).

As far as actual cape work, the best you could do would be suffocating people (if the bubbles can have stuff intersecting them without breaking) or doing moderately-loud thunderclaps by collapsing bubbles. It's a pretty solidly C-tier power.
