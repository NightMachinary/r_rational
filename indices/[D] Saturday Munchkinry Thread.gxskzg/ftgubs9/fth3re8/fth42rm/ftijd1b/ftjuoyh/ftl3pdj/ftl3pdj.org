Yep, you could get some concussive force action, but only from the implosion--air rushing back in to fill the vacuum. Maybe enough to knock someone over or alter their trajectory mid-jump.

That brings up another question though: does creating a bubble have the inverse effect of pushing the air away, or is the air just devoured? It would be easier to use this in combat if you could shove people instead of pulling them.
