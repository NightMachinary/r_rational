Say you want to crack a 4-digit password. You try 0000 and send a message back to yourself saying that didn't work. So you don't try 0000, you try 0001 and send a message back to yourself saying that didn't work. Repeat repeat repeat, you try 1337 and send a message back to yourself saying it worked. You actually use this timeline, so it's the stable one, and the only one you actually receive a message from. It also doesn't take any particular feats of patience, since each iteration of you only needs to try one code, so the length of a password you can break is only limited by how long of one you can send back to yourself without error.

This also works on any ordered list. Say a list of arguments you want to try to convince someone of something.

If the messages you can send back to yourself are long enough, you can use it to brute force some mathematical proofs by counterexample. Even longer and you can brute force running all possible computer files of size N as executable until you find something a future version of you finds entertaining.
