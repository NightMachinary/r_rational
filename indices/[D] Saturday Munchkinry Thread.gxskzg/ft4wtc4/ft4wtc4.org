The vast domain of a dark god has three laws.

- The Law of Hunger: Plants do not grow here. Fungus and animals are fine - if they can find food.

- The Law of Gloom: The domain is in perpetual shadow. Total darkness is unknown, but even a blazing bonfire is reduced to a muted glow. There are no stars.

- The Law of Fertility: The god and its offspring can, and often to. interbreed with anything.

I'm looking for a few things in the above situation.

- What does it look like when a kingdom falls into this domain? What about a world?

- How would people adapt to living in this situation? How long could they reasonably last?

- How could people eat? I'm thinking some photosynthetic livestock created through extraordinary means, such as interbreeding god-blooded creatures with E. chlorotica (sea slugs with chloroplasts). What vitamin deficiencies would need to be addressed?

Thanks in advance and have fun with this. :)
