Thanks for the thoughtful reply!

I'll expand on the Law of Gloom a bit. While the most obvious effect is light, this also works on other energies and energy-like things such as magic, which does exist in this setting.

Magic is beholden to the Laws of Gloom and Hunger. It cannot be used to summon food without some form of sacrifice. The sacrifice could be something normally toxic - it simply needs to be alive.

Death of complex beings, especially those with innate magical ability, increases ambient magic. Over time, though, the magic disperses or is used up. There is no wellspring of magic. The same is true for volcanoes or other forms of geothermal energy. Fossil fuels, uranium and such mostly work as expected. The heat and radiation from these rapidly fade as they travel from their source due to Gloom.
