It seems there should be some way to turn the Gloom's dispersal of energy-like phenomena into free energy. At the very least, it can act as a heat sink to Carnot engines. What sorts of quasi-energy can magic create? Are chemical energy gradients dispersed by Gloom? Maybe you could magically raise or lower the pH of a body of water at one end, let the gloom disperse it across the body of water, and then get some type of chemovore living off the difference that makes more magic when it dies than was required to feed it?

Another though... what counts as death in the case of organisms like fungi? A hive organism could strategically kill parts of itself to generate magic that in turn feeds chemical reactions that can be used for energy. Like a slime mold that periodically kills half its own cells but generates energy in the process or an ant colony that sacrifices members for magical energy to feed a symbiotic fungi.
