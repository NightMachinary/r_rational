Gloom is intended to be very much akin to the third law of thermodynamics. The notion is that there is an underlying medium to the realm of the god that constantly disperses minute quantities of energy. A room, completely sealed off from its surroundings, should be pitch black, but Gloom will cause it to have dim lighting, albeit at the cost of light, magic, and other nearby energies.

Potential energy, especially chemical energy, doesn't tend to be affected by Gloom. When you burn something, the heat will get absorbed/dispersed somewhat more rapidly than normal. If you want to get the most efficient use of this energy, you need to do so from up close.

Death of complex creatures is what matters for mana. For the purpose of discussion, consider the benefit to line up closely with the increase in entropy caused by returning a creature to uniform distribution of heat and elemental composition.

I like the idea of the hive creatures that sacrifice components quite a bit! That aligns nicely with the god's personality and goals.
