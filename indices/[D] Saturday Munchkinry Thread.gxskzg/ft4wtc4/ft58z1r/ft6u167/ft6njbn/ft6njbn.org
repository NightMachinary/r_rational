A kingdom in a situation like that cannot produce excess calories and as such cannot sustain a large population and cannot support groups of people doing anything other than finding food.

I imagine migration would be one of the first things in people's minds but as they can't see it'd be difficult for those located in the central part of a kingdom to get to the borders.

The second thing in mind would be to gather all the priests and supercharge a god to fight this 'dark' god. Whether it be sacrifices or a debt to be repaid- a lot of things would be better than darkness, godspawn, and lack of plants.

A kingdom would first panic and lots of people would die due to sudden darkness. Bumping into animals, sharp objects, being trampled (being murdered).

Then the food that was available would be whatever was previously stored along with animals that could be butchered

I'd give it a week.

Adaptions would be better sense of smell, hearing and echolocation while eyesight would more than likely either become very sensitive or atrophy.

Perhaps people would find other people and begin to eat them. Or go into the wilderness (read death trap) and try to find and kill things that on top of being stronger and faster than them have better senses of smell and hearing or are too small to be worth anything.

Bodies of water would be repositories of life (read vending machines) so fishing with a blood slathered on a hook or having it shine might work?

I don't know enough about vitamins but people and animals would probably lack fiber.

Godspawn are the biggest issue and perhaps the salvation of whatever is in the darkness. Like godspawn not!plants that feed off of darkness, godspawn animals that are bigger and better, godspawn people who'd have adaptions suited for a dark hellscape lacking plants and host to abominations born out of uncontrollable lust.

A dark god world is very screwed. Godspawn would probably be one of the few things to roam the land. The ocean would be fine though as ocean life already has darkness as an everyday thing.

Ocean mammals that can echolocate would have an easier time as their prey can't see them anymore but not drowning could be an issue as 'where is up' in darkness might be harder to figure out.
