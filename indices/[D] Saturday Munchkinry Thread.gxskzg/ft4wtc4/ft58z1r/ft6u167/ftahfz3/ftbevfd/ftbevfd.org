Cows are ruminants: mammals with special adaptations to eat otherwise nutritionally-worthless grasses. They're a very inefficient source of animal protein, and if you've ever considered going vegetarian for ecological reasons but shied away from it, cutting cows (and sheep) from your diet is a good compromise. Personally I just don't eat mammals.

I actually picked them for the example animal because of this inefficiency - the bit where I multiplied cows by 8 comes from there. Pigs only get 3.5. But I didn't run through the numbers with all the animals, it could still come out that pigs are the better choice.
