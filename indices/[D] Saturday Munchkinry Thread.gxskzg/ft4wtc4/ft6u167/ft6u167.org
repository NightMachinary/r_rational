My first thought is that you're better off living at the edge of the domain so you can eat whatever animals wander in from places with actual plants.

I was suspicious about the ability for photosynthetic animals to actually feed themselves, so here's the numbers I managed to cobble together from Google:

- [[http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Calories_per_acre_for_various_foods/][1.1 million calories per acre of beef at 1000 calories per pound]] means 1100 pounds of beef per acre. Also note the feed conversion rate of 8.

- [[https://extension.sdstate.edu/how-much-meat-can-you-expect-fed-steer][A cow has about 500 pounds of beef in it]], so that's two cows.

- Your cows photosynthesize, so they don't need to eat, so you can skip the feed conversion ratio. So an acre is enough for 16 photosynthetic cows.

- This means a photosynthetic cow needs a surface area of 1/16 an acre to feed itself. About 250 square meters. Note that an animal this big would have higher calorie requirements than a cow.
