You could technically solve math problems in an instant. If you're a mathematician say, you could do work on a problem and send the result back to previous you, who will then work from that point on and send the improves results, and so on. This way, you could get years or decades of work done in an instant. This was actually a plot point in a Worm fanfic I read a while back called Technology Will Win the Day.
