Nice numerical breakdown!

I like the analyses. Checking in Google, it looks like pigs, surprisingly, are about triple the calories per acre compared to cows. Potatoes are about 16 times the calories - but animals would probably be far less effective than plants due to metabolic requirements.

The light input for photosynthesis would be lower due to Gloom. Even so, the idea of some desperate aquaculture creating calories by raising and butchering semi-divine slugs could work in both horror and humorous stories. I like this!
