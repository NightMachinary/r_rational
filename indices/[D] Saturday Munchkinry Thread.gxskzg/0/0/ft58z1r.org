First thing to consider is what a plant is at the most fundamental level, because in some ways it's subjective, based on arbitrary classifications come up with by humans. I can imagine a community devoted to spreading the idea that plants as a concept don't actually exist, and sessile organisms are all just different kinda of fungi or edible rocks. I don't expect that this would /work/, but the idea of it being tried is funny.

Assuming that plans along that line don't work, first thing to consider is that ecosystems need input energy - even on earth it isn't a closed system, due to sunlight, but sunlight isn't the only option. I don't know if the Law of Gloom functions by removing energy or just slowing down light-producing reactions, but in practice it means that a different input energy will be needed, since any biology that needs or produces light is going to be incredibly inefficient. Around the edges of the domain, I could see herbivores eating outside of it during a period of the day, and making their way back inside at night, but that might not be advantageous.

Underwater heat vents are the first thing to think about. Life on earth may have even originated around them. Depending on how 'hard' you want your world's physics to be, I could see this being expanded to fungi or algae colonies growing by volcanoes, feeding off of the heat. That would then be the start of a food web.

Your next option would be some sort of lithovore. We have bacteria on earth that feed in this way, though the process is incredibly inefficient. Sprinkle in a little magic, though, and you may have the potential for oasises of fantastical creatures around mineral deposits, with sapient settlements being built due to their dual purpose of mining and agriculture.

Next idea is a little bit more weird. It relies on the Law of Fertility. If the God and its offspring can breed with anything, that probably means that some meat-moving has to occur along the way, right? I'm imagining creatures that fertilise themselves, and make use of the free energy that comes from this having to succeed in order to feed. Like fungi that grow bundles of spores, seemingly out of thin air, only to consume them. Depending on how elaborate and generous this process is, it could result in grotesque megafauna who have tons of excess energy to devote to being as terrifying as possible.

Then, of course, if your world has magic, I presume these areas are soaked in it. If magic is stylised as energy, then that's energy that can be harvested. Depending on specifics, you could have mage molds that constantly cast Create Food and Water inside their own stomachs using the magic in the air, or some equivalent of that. This also depends on how promiscuous the God's offspring are.

People... Probably aren't gonna do well. All the suggestions I've made here would require a lot of time, presumably, before they became reliable food sources, not to mention questions about toxicity. People also very the majority of their vitamin D from sunlight, but that could theoretically be fixed with a diet disturbingly high in the stuff, or a quick fix to a defunct gene. But the problem, in the end, is that on our planet, photosynthesis is by far the most efficient means of gathering energy without consuming other organisms, so of course most creatures will fill that niche. By having an area that destroys that niche, you have an area where agriculture is destroyed, unless people predict that and create much worse farms in advance.

Still, I think all of that is a challenge to overcome rather than something unfortunate. I hope this helped a little either way!
