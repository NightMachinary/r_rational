Yeah, rehosting another author's work without permission, even like this, it a pretty rude thing to do.

You can simply go to the user preferences and choose the xenforo default theme if it's that much of a bother, or if you must convert it into another format, do so for personal use only and don't distribute it without consulting the author first.
