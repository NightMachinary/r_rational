Great point besides the obvious munchkinry, after every mission the protag reviews and updates his modes of operation.

On the other hand, if you want to hide your glowing body and posses telekinesis, use chunks of rock or metal or cloth to cover yourself up, especially if you have x-ray vision, enemy is a bit weak so far.

Overall great thing to read. Go read now.
