I could absolutely see that if it was a work he was making revenue on, but as it is posted on a forum that's clearly not the case. It's an unlicensed derivative work of copyrighted material, so he cannot claim his own copyright on it legally. There isn't even a review function or similar which would provide feedback.

I'm not seeing why this is rude, aside from as an instinctive possessive response. If you create a work under these circumstances, presumably you want people to see that work. Everyone who is anyone is aware that anything you post on the internet immediately and irrevocably spreads out of your own personal control, so there is no expectation of that.

"Don't rehost even though the original is difficult to read (to the point of being physically painful for some) and only do things in the author approved way." is almost the same argument used by media copyright companies to prevent piracy, remixing, rehosting, and the whole Youtube Content ID mess. Or arguments by the developers of PC games against modding their game or in some cases even displaying it at all on Youtube or Twitch.

It makes no rational sense to support one version of this argument and to not support the other.
