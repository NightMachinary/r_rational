So, this isn't bad. Finished what's been written so far, as it is a WIP. Strong writing, at its best when going off-canon. Just wish it would do so more often. It is currently following the TV show plot closely, so I'm looking forward to the S2 time jump to see what happens after Paul's deal is over.

That's the story I really want to read -- someone who knows details about the Big Picture dealing with intergalactic threats with a SmartRing approach. Hopefully this has all been planned as an introduction to the setting and characters, and it'll go in original directions soon.

Let's see, what else. I think the "Renegade" path stuff isn't as good, but there is some reason for it, I'm guessing. One that goes beyond feeding the forum dwellers. Especially given how much DC loves multiple universes and crossovers from them. There is /zero/ chance that RenegadePaul doesn't meet ParagonPaul at some point.
