You can put it all in a single page though :P

I like to use [[http://www.printwhatyoulike.com/pagezipper][Page Zipper]]. It's a bookmarklet, inserts a javascript into the page on clicking.

Also, not just for reading. It's great for archiving interesting forum threads in one fell swoop too. You have to scroll/PgDown all the way down so all the pages get to load (Not Ctrl End.. learned that the hard way)

Then save the page and convert to Pdf. I think I saw a few other thread saving methods around if this doesn't work for you.
