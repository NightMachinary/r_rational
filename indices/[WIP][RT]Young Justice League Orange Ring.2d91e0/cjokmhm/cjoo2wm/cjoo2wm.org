I wouldn't say that renegade is evil, more like dickish. Renegade!Paul still has the same goals as Normal!Paul, but doesn't care about people's opinions, and so chooses to take the non-socially acceptable options.

I see the stories as similar to two Mass Effect play throughs - the same overall story is happening, but Renegade!Paul has different advantages and disadvantages because of the way he acts. I think that the renegade story-line is one continuous storyline, but you have to fill in the blanks from the main storyline sometimes.
