Not only is this an excellent story, but the author updates every day, super regularly. Also, he's managed to keep two storylines running parallel, and I'm still not sure where they're going to meet.

On a related note, if the time at the top is in red, it usually means that that chapter is a renegade (from mass effect, if you know the reference,) showing what would happen if the main character made an evil/rash decision.
