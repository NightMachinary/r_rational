I like it so far.

Rationalism is an avarice, where avarice is /very loosely/ defined as 'I want it,' based ideology. Spacebattles is crashing on me at Pg 2, but so far we have a fairly standard lesswronger given superpowers, and only the starting of the munchkindom that is to be expected. Our hero is a bit of a twit, but that's standard.
