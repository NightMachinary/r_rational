Just read through this in the space of a day. Pretty fun. I can't speak for how rational it is, and perhaps my taste isn't the best, but I certainly intend to read more.

[Edit] So, any fics of similar quality around? 'cause I really wanna read more, and clockwork daily updates just aren't enough anymore apparently.
