That never happened when I was reading it. Maybe tellwyrn has finally done something in the last.... 3 books? Maybe 4? I read parts but I was skimming for a while before I stopped. How much did that actually effect the plot; was it cleanup after they'd already lost as per her usual, or?

Either way it's way too late to salvage her character.
