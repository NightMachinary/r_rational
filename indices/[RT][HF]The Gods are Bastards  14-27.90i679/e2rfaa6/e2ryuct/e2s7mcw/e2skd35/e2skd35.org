Of note, characters don't follow their natures.

You know trissany, miss headstrong elite combatant "I use fighting to solve my problems, and need character growth to start using my intelligence instead?" If you reread the books, that's all lies. Trissany hasn't killed any sentient in all the books so far, she's always shown onscreen trying to solve her problems via diplomacy, and she's overall shown to be quite caring and second guessing herself /in the same scenes that the narratoris calling her headstrong and thrill seeking/.

Tellwyrn is supposedly powerful - effectively unstoppable, in fact - with basically every arcane wizard power, from plane shifting to evocation to teleportation. She has never once done something plot relevant with that power*, and always lets villains just taunt her, leave, and get away with it.

Teal is a "bard." A bard that plays no music, tells no stories, and does no other bardic activities on screen except once during the dungeon crawl, which accomplishes little and is promptly forgotten by her. But, as the narration will constantly remind you, she's an excellent bard, she's in the music program, she's really into it honest.

Toby, unlike his narrative description, is an incredibly militant and judgmental douche who's everything narrative!trissany is accused of being, except he never acknowledges it or changes it and is praised for his compassion.

Essentially every character has this.

*in the part's I've read up to, it's possible it improves later but that doesn't make up for all the parts where they don't.
