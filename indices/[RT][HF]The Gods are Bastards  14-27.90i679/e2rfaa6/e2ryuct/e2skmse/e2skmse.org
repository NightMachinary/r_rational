I elaborate on the first part of this in my comments on turniper's post, but tl;dr bullshit and no they do not. Remind me the last time tellwyrn remembered her nigh omnipotent magic when it would inconvenience the plot, again?

They make a point of claimign that intelligent action is needed, but this is completely undercut by the fact that a) essentially every successful character is an idiot, and b, when characters like Trissany do try intelligent solutions it just fails. The only "cleverness" that gives results is the "cleverness" of the villains reading off the script.

Aside from all the retcons, you mean? And the fourth wall breaking (jenny everywhere?)? Yeah, everyone acts within their IC abilities, because their limitations are never defined except as the plot demands.
