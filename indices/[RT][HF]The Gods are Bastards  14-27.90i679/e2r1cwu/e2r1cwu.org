Gabriel is by far my favorite viewpoint character. Realistically flawed but aware of his own faults, has gone through quite a lot of personal growth over the course of the series, has an interesting and diverse fighting style, and is generally just funny/sassy. He was absolutely terrified last chapter, and managed to work up the courage here to confirm that his special scythe does not in fact kill gods.

Fross is second best, in large part because she complained about being stereotyped as an exposition fairy early on, claiming those aren't a real thing, before making it her full time job to be a fairy that spouts exposition.

I'm glad that the story has narrowed its focus onto a smaller cast of characters. I did find following Darling interesting, and the enforcer dude with the rest of Justinian's suicide squad was somewhat entertaining, but I don't think we needed to follow the new freshman group, and cutting down on side chapters makes the plot go much faster. The sophomore class should retain the spotlight, because they are the most interesting characters in the story, along with Tellwryn.
