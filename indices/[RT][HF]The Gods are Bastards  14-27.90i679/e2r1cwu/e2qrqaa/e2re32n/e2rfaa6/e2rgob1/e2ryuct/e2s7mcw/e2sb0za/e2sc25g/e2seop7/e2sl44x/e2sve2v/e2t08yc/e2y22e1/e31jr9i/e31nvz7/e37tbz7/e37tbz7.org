No I don't. I read 10 books straight up, then another 2 or so on and off. That's more than enough for me to tell you that no, this series isn't rational; not just with pattern recognition, but with almost complete certainty. That's like trying to tell me I can't say harry potter isn't rational without reading the deathly hollows, or that a fanfic isn't rational by the time I drop it a few chapters in for stupidity; whether or not a work is rational or not should be (and is) completely obvious by that point.

A perpetual sleep that lasts for months is not what I would call a permanent consequence, no. You said yourself that it was temporary, and if I recall the scene in question from my skimming (that was the one they had to get hellhound breath to cure, tight?) it lasted less than a book.

Death isn't the only permanent consequence, but the lack of it is a /huge/ issue since it happens to absolutely no one despite them being described as entering risky and life threatening situations all the time. Whenever one of the charachters talks bout how dangerous a situation is, I rolled my eyes and skipped over there speech because it's just hot air. The cast is in the dozens of characters. With one important person, it's acceptable that they manage to defy the odds because of the anthropic principle of stories. With this, however, its simply ludicrous. Even goddamn dragonball has larger, longer lasting consequences to major charachters, it it has a literal problem-fixing deus-ex-machina in its /name/.
