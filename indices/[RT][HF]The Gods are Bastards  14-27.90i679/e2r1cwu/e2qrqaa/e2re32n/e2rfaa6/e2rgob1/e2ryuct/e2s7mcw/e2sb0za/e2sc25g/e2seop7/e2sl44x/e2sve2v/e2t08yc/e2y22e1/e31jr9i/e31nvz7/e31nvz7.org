*you need to read something properly if you intend to criticize it properly.

You are simply ignoring plot points and events because you don't want to acknowledge them, Trissiny kills a lot of people as the series goes ( 2-18 [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/2-18/]] Trissiny killing centaurs on screen) she is shown to be an skilled fighter in many scenes and she is doing her best to progress from just a skilled combatant to an intelligent one.

Telwyrn has a habit of dealing with things her way, and sometimes that is letting them play out, she does things the forceful way otherwise, such as inviting the Kitsune to be clever so she doesn't have too, or by blowing up an air ship while falling from a dragon, or by ignoring a threat until shows it's face so she can /punch/ it ( 12-32 [[https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2017/03/04/12-32/]] Telwyrn using brute force to solve a relevant problem)

Toby acts like Toby in Puna Dara, he does his best to follow his friends, then when he sees things going in a different way than he would like he changes things, by casting incredibly powerful holy magic and healing everyone. He acts Holier than thou because he *is* holier than them, he is a fucking paladin, he is holy by definition, do you consider any of his specific actions to be /wrong/?

Is her lover falling into a perpetual, basically incurable slumber for months not a consequence? Or your only idea of lasting consequences death?

You accuse me of not reading the same books as you in one comment and then blatantly admit to skipping bits in the another, I have read the series up to the last chapter of volume 13, and unless you can give me a chapter number for your criticisms than you just aren't making an argument.
