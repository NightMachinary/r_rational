  just because teh plot demands it

If by that you mean the established characters do things that are in character? Most things they've been doing lately is either because of a bullshit quest (which has been hinted at for ages) or the power plays between established powers. I guess the robot snake could apply but that was really just an obstacle, not really important to what was happening.

  The characters do not solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources

Not really true either, there are a lot of actions by non-POV characters though so I suppose it's a valid criticism but nowhere near as bad as you're portraying it.

  the fictional world has does not have consistent rules

Uhm...what? The entire world follows very clearly defined rules to the point where there are classroom scenes explaining how the magic and various things work. Even the power structures are clearly defined and their resources are detailed. The only exception is literal divine intervention and even then there are a lot of consistent rules for them.

Could you provide some examples for what you're trying to say? I don't know if I've overlooked big things or if you're just making up stuff because you don't like the story.
