I think you are confusing 'brute force' with 'lethal force', using brute force to solve a problem doesn't equal killing it dead, it means using hard power to solve the problem, like walking into a temple and threatening to destroy one of their most sacred artifacts, or threatening to behead a priest and teleporting their holy place across the continent, or by sending someone inconvenient for you to an island that is so completely cut off from the rest of the world that they definitely won't bother you for awhile. Telwyrn solves /most/ of her problems like this, she rarely takes the path of explaining something or doing something circumspect when her awesome magical powers work just fine.

Trissiny is in a similar situation, she may not have killed anyone... except like 50+ centaurs sentient enough to use magic in volume 1, and a group of off duty guards trying to kidnap a child in loranaris, and a whole /bunch/ of the white riders in sarasio, and a certain priestess of /her own faith/ dumb enough to kill her friend in front of her... Oh wait, she has killed people, like a lot. She often downright ignores the circumspect root in favour of charging straight ahead, she goes to the guild to learn how to see the circumspect root at all, because she has divine compulsion in the back of her head roaring at her to chase and kill the evil she sees, and she succeeds, she learns that brute force and Lethal force aren't the same, and that understanding the correct application of brute force means less of a chance to require lethal force.

Toby, the only time we have seen Toby use Lethal force (not brute force) is when he has absolutely no other option, or when his god literally gives him no choice, and every time he does it he is broken up about it for /ages/ afterwords. Toby is one of the least developed characters in the series, but in almost all of his chapters he is full of self doubt and conflicted that he often has to resort to violence, he is shown to almost never consider his own well being above another's, he is compassionate to a fault, so much so that I'm surprised he hasn't gotten himself in more trouble yet.

The fact that Teal is a shit bard has been /directly called out/ by the god of bards himself, the story acknowledges and punishes her for this flaw (she was warned that if she didn't get her protagonist hat off then those closest to her would suffer...), and if she continues to act this way I imagine it will only get worse for her.

Most of your objections to the characters are either blatantly incorrect or are in ignorance of their character development/progression and it's effect on the story.
