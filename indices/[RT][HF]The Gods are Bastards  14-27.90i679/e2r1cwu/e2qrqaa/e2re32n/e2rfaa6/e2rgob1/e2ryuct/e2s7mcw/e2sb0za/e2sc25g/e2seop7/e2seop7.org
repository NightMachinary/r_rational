Fair enough. Tellwryn did solo an entire airship and take down a master diabolist without much trouble though. Additionally, Tiraas has had some trouble in the past when cults declared war on each other and that's definitely what would happen if the king/a couple of paladins decided to take down the arch pope without proof.

It's also important to note that, basically, the only practitioners of shadow magic learn it so that they don't get magic demon cancer. It might have been in the story but I imagine it isn't easy to master.
