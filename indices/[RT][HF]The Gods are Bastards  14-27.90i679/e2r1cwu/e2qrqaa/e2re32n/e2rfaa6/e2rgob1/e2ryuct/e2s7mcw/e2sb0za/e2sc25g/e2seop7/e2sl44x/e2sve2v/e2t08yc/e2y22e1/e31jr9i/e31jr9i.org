As I allude to above, the issue isn't that Tellwyrn never uses brute force. She manifestly does. It's that she never actually does anything plot relevant with it, ever*. I think book 12 is the biggest example there but tellwyrn just has a habit of... letting things happen, for no ic reason, despite her aforementioned brute force.

I don't remember it ever saying that trissany killed the centaurs. If so, it was definitely a case of telling, though; On screen, trissany just doesn't do any of that. Take a look at the trissany centric chapter in book 11; in there, her attempts to be clever and her attempts to straight fight both fail embarrassingly.

No way does that describe Toby. I challenge you to stop reading the narration, and start reading what the characters /actually do/. Look at toby in the pirate city idr what it's called, puja dara iirc? Kid spends basically the entire trip on his holier than thou, judgmental high horse.

The idea that there will be consequences is a joke. No one in TGaB ever has permanent consequences unless they're a minor character.

*In the first dozen or so books, I'll admit I skimmed or outright skipped a lot of the last few so it may have happened there I guess.
