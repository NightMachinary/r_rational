Shadow jumping is an obvious one. Basically nobody in TGAB uses combat teleportation, or takes advantage of the fact that shadow jumping obviates basically every common security measure the Tiraan empire uses and makes planting bombs trivial. Basically every plan Embras Mogul comes up with risks most of his organization and gains him nothing. We're constantly told that Tellwryn is a badass who can outgun basically everyone and we literally never see her do that. Also the fact that half the cast knows Justinian is supposedly some sort of big bad and nobody does anything about it. Plausible deniability doesn't work when every major power knows you're up to something, including half the Gods you supposedly represent.
