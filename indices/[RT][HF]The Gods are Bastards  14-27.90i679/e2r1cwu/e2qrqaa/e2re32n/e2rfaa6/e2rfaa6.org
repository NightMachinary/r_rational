I don't really think this qualifies as rational, uh, at all. Every book we get stuff happening just because teh plot demands it, The characters do not solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources, and the fictional world has does not have consistent rules. No matter how you slice it, this just really doesn't fit.
