Maybe! That would be suitably abhorrent.

I only think it might not be that because, supposedly (I don't recall which character noted this, so I might be wrong), they set out to just take down the Infinite Order, and they ascended accidentally, even unwillingly in a some cases.

From context, I think whatever happened was after they became gods and the Elder Wars ended.
