Leavign aside the retcons, like when they swapped the fundemental mechanics of magic from the whole "Mind interfacing with reality" (which I don't think was an bad move fromt he story perspective, since that was dumb, but is a very clear example of this)?

There's how much magical power constantly changes from scene to scene as the biggest offender imo. The story /cannot/ make up its mind on that; Tellwyrn is so strong the empire's strategy is to leave her alone! But she always backs down from conflicts with them because they're too strong from her! But we can't afford to piss her off! But let's do that!

Paladins are also a huge offender with this. Trissany is an incredibly powerful warrior, as long as it's not mid plot, at which point her skills vanish and she hasn't won a fight since, like book two or so. Toby is the reverse of this, in which he's a pacifist up until he's a martial artist that never loses in combat situations, and then reverses at a moments notice. Mostly this part is overshadowed by the narration lying, though, particularly since the two are usually entwined.
