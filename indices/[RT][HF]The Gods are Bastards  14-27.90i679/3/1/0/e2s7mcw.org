While established characters follow their natures pretty well, TGAB often makes liberal use of the idiot ball. A lot of people we're repeatedly told are very smart do very dumb things, pretty much any time plotting or statecraft is involved people take massive risks for poor reasons, and a ton of powers are introduced that nobody ever uses in a remotely creative fashion. Also people monologue too much. It's still a good story though.
