I'm pretty sure all of those have been addressed though.

- The circles of interaction make shadow jumping in industrialized or militarized areas an unattractive option: What happens when the infernal energies at your destination get eaten by some nearby arcane automation or even just disrupted by a fairy lamp? If you're careful there won't be any issues but when you're dealing with the heat of combat on top of the inherent focus necessary to channel the infernal without getting a terminal illness or permanent debuff, you're just asking for trouble. We do see strategic shadow jumping used in combat though. The Rogue Shade and Chase use combat teleportation to some limited degree, though both of them were granted level infinity +1 Warlock powers by godlike forces.

- Embras Mogul's plans - we can't really know anything about his actual plans and goals until the story is wholly over. Everything he says is suspect and should be considered to have at least 3 layers of lies built into it - He's the high priest of the goddess of deception for crying out loud. We can't assume that we've seen any of his actual plans either, at least until his long cons come to fruition.

- Tellwyrn - First, She's the strongest individual, but all the other forces in the world work in groups. Second, her goal is to teach - the rational choice for attaining that goal is to let her students deal with it and only step in if they can't handle it. We also see her using 'evaluation' type spells and toys all the time, so it's pretty likely she knows the abilities of everyone involved at any given time to make a good judgement call on whether the matchup is acceptable or not. Third, her badassery is strictly limited to brute force. Most of the challenges we see her facing that can be solved by that particular hammer get solved within the space of a paragraph, but they're all over the place.

- Justinian - None of the main or secondary cast knows that, except Justinian himself and a few close followers. Some tertiary characters have mentioned it, but never in enough detail for the main cast to necessarily understand the weight of the implications there. Those tertiary characters who do know are shown treating him as their primary priority. As for the gods themselves, several chapters have been dedicated to how mortals can exploit their natures and blind spots (Look for it especially in the Basra chapters). The Gods literally can't know because he's exploiting the same flaws that Basra has been, at minimum, though he's likely made a much more in-depth study on the subject. Multiple gods whose aspects imply self-reflection or understanding have implied that they noticed something was off about Justinian, and Izara has even directly interfered with his schemes, at least to the extent that the built-in limitations of godessness allow.

*TLDR:*

Shadow Jumping - The most common type of magic is a hard counter to tactical uses, and anyone dumb enough to not realize it dies of hellcancer.

Embras - He's lying dude. Even his lies are designed to trick you into false conclusions if you see through them. His job description is "#1 best deceiver in the world"

Tellwyrn - Her weakness is when opponents use teamwork. Her motivations make "let my students gain experience" the most rational choice.

Justinian - For the mortals, it's called [[http://typesofirony.com/dramatic-irony/][dramatic irony]]. They know less than you seem to think. For the gods, turns out it's easy to manipulate them. See the Basra chapters for more detail on one method to do so.
