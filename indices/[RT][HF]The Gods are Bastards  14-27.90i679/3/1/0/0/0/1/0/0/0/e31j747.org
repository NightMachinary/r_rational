No, she doesn't solve problems with brute force. She uses brute force. There is a difference, and one of them involves tellwyrn forgetting her powers whenever the plot demands. Take book 12, for instance; she even comments how she can't kill one of the villains because, oh no, she'd get in trouble with the empire. The Empire. The empire that's so scared of her that it's policy is to leave her alone. She never* once actually does anything meaningful to the plot with that power.

*In the first dozen or so books, I'll admit I skimmed or outright skipped a lot of the last few so it may have happened there I guess.
