You tell me I don't understand a rational discussion, then you refuse to engage with the actual points. Mmkay. You've been lost on a passive-aggressive signaling attempt from the very beginning. Maybe, if people love a topic, study it honestly and for a long time, then work hard to make content for people and want to share it with you, with the understanding that IF they succeed, you'll enjoy the video and find it interesting, you might respond like a human being to those people instead of ignoring the content and being so disingenuous and nasty?
