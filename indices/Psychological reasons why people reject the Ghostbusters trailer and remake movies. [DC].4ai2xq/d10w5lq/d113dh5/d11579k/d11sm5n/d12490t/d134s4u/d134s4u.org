There was a counter-claim made, NOT a simple questioning of the existing claim. I don't think you understand how a rational argument works.

This is what we have so far...

I think A. No, it's B. It's not B because B can't explain thing X.

That's literally what happened. Trying to retract your claim isn't helping.

Now, would you like a mini-lecture on how people actually take in visual and audio inputs, and what makes them seem too busy or not too busy, since you tried to bring that up? Spoiler Alert: Your understanding of it is very simplistic and will fall apart immediately.
