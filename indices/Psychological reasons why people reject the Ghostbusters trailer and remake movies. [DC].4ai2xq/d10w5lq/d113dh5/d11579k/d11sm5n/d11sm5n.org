"That's because I didn't make a hypothesis."

Yes you did. You said, and I quote, " In this case, people are rejecting the trailer - and by extension the film - because it was a bad trailer. The jokes fell flat, the plot was basically a rehash and didn't seem interesting, the actors didn't look to have the comedic timing necessary to make things funny, and the comedy itself was largely slapstick which I find boring."

This describes Pixels almost exactly also. There's a massively different dislike ratio for Pixels on a similar magnitude of views. Your claim simply fails to explain this.

Your claims and your advice are of poor quality.
