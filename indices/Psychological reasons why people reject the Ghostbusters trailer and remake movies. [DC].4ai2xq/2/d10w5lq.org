I don't think this was a very good analysis. Honestly, the green curtains don't always have to represent the main character's jealousy. Sometimes they're just green. In this case, people are rejecting the trailer - and by extension the film - because it was a bad trailer. The jokes fell flat, the plot was basically a rehash and didn't seem interesting, the actors didn't look to have the comedic timing necessary to make things funny, and the comedy itself was largely slapstick which I find boring.

Further, they didn't show us what kind of people the characters are, instead they just had a woman tell us what each of them is good at and from what I can tell they all seemed to be hackneyed stereotypes. She was basically talking to the camera, and from the looks of it that scene is going to be in the full movie which gives me serious doubts about the writing quality.

From my perspective, this video stated an obvious conclusion that no-one would argue with (that the trailer was bad and people were angry about it), then stuck in a bunch of random psychobabble in front of it. You could replace that explanation with almost any random thing and it would still be pretty much the same video, it didn't add anything or make things more clear. I don't feel like I understand the human condition any better as a result, which is a good sign that this was just fake wisdom.

People don't like it when they're got high hopes for a thing and it turns out to be bad. The greater the distance in quality between the new thing and the old thing, the more extreme their reaction. If this guy wants to make it more complicated than that, he should come up with a better theory.
