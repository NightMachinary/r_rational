You don't get how arguments work in rational debate, eh? First, one person makes a claim. Then, another person points out problems with this claim and the onus is then on the person originally making the claim to explain these holes.

Whataboutism doesn't really do the job. Nor does shit slinging. Nor does pointing out an observation then failing to draw any kind of link between that observation and your original argument.

Instead what we've had to far looks like this:

Claim (you) (also spam, and not relevant to the subreddit)\\
Counterclaim (me)\\
Observation that is true but unconnected to original claim. Attack at counterclaim.\\
Explanation that counterclaim's truthiness is irrelevant for the purposes of proving claim. Advice of disputed quality.\\
Reiterating observation, still unconnected to original claim.

I'm afraid this isn't the kind of subreddit where such tactics are effective.
