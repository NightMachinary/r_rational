I can't actually find them. Neither of us have really brought any up after the first few posts. I don't care enough about disputing a youtube video to create a full theory of how people react to bad remake trailers. You don't care to explain why your theory of why people react like that is any better than the many other plausible theories out there that would also fit the evidence of ghostbusters getting more dislikes than pixel.

I would normally have been nicer, but I don't like people who spam stuff in barely related subreddits.

We're done here, I think.
