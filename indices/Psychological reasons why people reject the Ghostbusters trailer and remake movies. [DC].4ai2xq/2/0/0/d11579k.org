  Your hypothesis fails to explain this.

That's because I didn't make a hypothesis. What I did is note that in certain situations, people act a certain way. I made no move to explain why they do so. If I had made an alternate hypothesis, it would be entirely independent of your explanation, and mine being false wouldn't make yours true, as well as vice versa. It is a false dichotomy to imply otherwise. Top points though for copy/pasting the same response you made to someone else in a completely different thread.

I'm assuming that this is either your video or the video of someone you know or work for, because the only thing your account has ever submitted are repeated links from this youtube channel. Most of them are downvoted or at 1 upvote, and half of them in subreddits with only a tenuous connection to the subject matter. So, I'm going to give you some advice.

First, when explaining something in a video you can't expect people to know about the things you've talked about in previous videos unless you have a legitimately popular channel. Relying on them as a core part of your argument is not a great idea.

Second, images and snippets of video from entirely different films have a place, and that place it not cluttering up the screen four at once (with four more as a constant background) so that the viewer has no chance to focus on any of them, let alone read them or figure out what their meaning is. At one point you had a map showing what I believe was the currents of the world's oceans show up on screen for a grand total of 1 second, and I'm not speaking figuratively. Consider using a smaller number of more carefully chosen images to give context to your points.

Third, the current voiceover comes across as mildly patronising. Presumably this was not your intention, but will still cause problems unless remedied.
