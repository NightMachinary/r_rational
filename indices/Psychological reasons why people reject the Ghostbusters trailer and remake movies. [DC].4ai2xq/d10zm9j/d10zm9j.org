Recognizable brand grabs people's attention, bad quality makes this attention negative. It has disadvantage of being comedy. Action movies can defend themselves with decent action scenes in trailers. But when jokes doesn't work in comedy, there's nothing left.

It's also really hard to joke about unfunny joke. Way above level of typical internet humor. Normally few jokes and memes would defuse tension. Simple jokes like "Terminator: Genisys - Revenge of Dyslexic". But without them things that are mostly upvoted are complains.

Complains generate more complains. Bashing bad movie is social activity. People are connected in how much they don't like it, they try to outdo each other how much they hate it. That way we end up with huge backslash.
