For me, the reason I'm not excited about this remake is because it's a palette swap. The writing process seemed to be:

1. Open script of original Ghostbusters
2. Search and replace all names and genders
3. To prove that it's not plagiarism, insert some hackneyed (attempts at) jokes about crazy black women and how women love hats.

If you're going to write fanfiction, the first rule is not anything about Frodo and lightsabers. The first rule is "it must be different in some significant way from the canon." If you retread the exact same steps with different names you have contributed nothing to the reader's experience.
