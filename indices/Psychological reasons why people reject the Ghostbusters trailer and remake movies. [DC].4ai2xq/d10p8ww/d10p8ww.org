Ah! Fascinating, thank you! I didn't have any problems with the trailer, and now I think that was in large part because I hated the first GhostBusters. The hero obviously should have been Egon. Instead the movie focused on this asshole Venkman who I couldn't stand, who is shown in his very first scene to be a terrible human and basically an anti-scientist. (in general I hate all of Bill Murray's characters, with very few exceptions) So I guess I was kinda glad that the remake was doing away with all that crap. Which is exactly what everyone who liked the first GhostBusters will hate. Insight acheived!
