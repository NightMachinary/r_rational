I've found that any idea, if it's logical and clearly-stated, will sound as if it's obviously right. You can only see how obvious and right it really is by noting how many other options also sound obvious but are actually wrong.

For example, several people have said "there's nothing special about the dislike, it's just bad filmmaking" Which sounds facile and obvious too, until you realize that the Ghostbusters trailer has literally 40x more dislikes on a similar number of views as the Pixels trailer (400,000+ vs 12,000). So sounding obvious doesn't mean that it's an easy conclusion to find or that it's right or wrong.
