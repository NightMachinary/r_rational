On a meta level, I sort of hate this video completely independent of the actual point it was trying to make. It reminded me of a lot of the RedLetterMedia criticisms of the filming style of the prequel trilogy of Star Wars. Namely, the creator is shoving so much shit on the screen that it actually becomes distracting and makes me lose track of what's going on. A busy, complicated frame can work, but simple scenes that show one thing well are much better than complicated bullshit showing five things badly. This was just excessively poorly composed. I don't know if the creator is trying to be ironic or something and making a bad video on purpose?

The actual points it was trying to make seemed facile to me, but I have no emotional investment in the original ghostbusters and this was the first I heard about the trailer for a new one (or, in fact, that there would be a new one).
