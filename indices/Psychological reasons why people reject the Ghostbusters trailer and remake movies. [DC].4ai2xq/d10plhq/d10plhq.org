I don't have any particular attachment to the original Ghostbusters film. I enjoyed it despite it predating my existence by several years. I vaguely recall finding it funny, but my memory is hazy since it's been over a decade since I saw it. I'm not really evaluating the remake in terms of the original because of that haziness.

The trailer for the remake made me laugh once, at around [[https://youtu.be/w3ugHP-yZXw?t=86][1:26]] with the "Let's go." joke. The trailer was clearly intended to be funny but all the other jokes fell flat or actually irritated me (notably, the part where the joke is "look at that violent irrational black woman").

I didn't care about any of the other complaints some people raised, like the CGI or the "four scientists" line or the cast. Remakes and translations from other media get that sort of thing wrong all the time, and is usually inconsequential compared to the script, acting, editing, etc.

The trailer has done it no favours from my perspective, as it doesn't inspire any confidence in the latter categories. That's not to say that I think it will be a bad movie. I'm reserving judgement until reviews come out and I'll probably see it if they aren't too negative.

Personally, I think the problem is the cuts used in the trailer. If a joke got a lot of laughs during the test screening, the people producing the trailer probably tried to include it but may have contextualised it poorly.

Looking at Paul Feig's other movies, they seem to do relatively well and have terrible trailers (I haven't seen Bridesmaids or The Heat, so I can't say how much I like them). I also looked at a few trailers from comedies I really liked and didn't laugh much at any of them. The few times I did laugh, I was remembering the scenes from actually seeing the movies.

Based on that anecdotal and brief test, I'd say that comedies are poorly represented by their trailers. In fact, you can see a recut of the Ghostbusters remake trailer that removed most of the jokes, which was substantially more popular with fans of the original.

*TL;DR:* I propose that trailers for comedies are usually much less funny than the movies themselves. The Ghostbusters remake could merely be another victim of this effect.
