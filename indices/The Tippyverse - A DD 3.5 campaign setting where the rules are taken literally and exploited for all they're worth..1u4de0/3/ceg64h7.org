The thing about the Tippyverse (TV) is that Teleportation Circle (TC) gets all the press but what actually drives the TV is the spell traps. Spell traps are simply engines that cast a particular spell every round; they are built using the "boon traps" rules from Dungeonscape. Tippy calls out traps of Create Food and Water as being how people are fed, and Fabricate as how things are built.

Problem: as far as I can tell, this doesn't work.

Boon traps very unambiguously target a /creature/, and only a creature bearing a specific Arcane Mark on its body (not on its clothes or gear). For an example of why this matters: Create Food and Water has no target, so it can't be put in a spell trap. Fabricate targets the raw materials that are to be fabricated. It explicitly cannot transmute creatures, meaning that it effectively cannot go in a spell trap.

Am I misunderstanding something? Are there relevant rules that I'm not aware of? Because otherwise the TV simply doesn't work, and it's too cool to let it die.
