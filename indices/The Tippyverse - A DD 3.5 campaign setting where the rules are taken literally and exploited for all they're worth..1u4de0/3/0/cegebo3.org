Create Food and Water traps are definitely the sort of thing that few DMs would allow (and even the character optimization guys raise an eyebrow towards), because they depend on a very Jedi "from a certain point of view" reading of the rules.

However, they're not actually the lynchpin of the system, since there are some other ways to eliminate the food problem. Clerics can cast /create food and water/ to feed fifteen people (when they first get it), and you can get a magic item like "Cauldron of Plenty" in order to feed more. It's far more expensive than the trap, but you can still virtually eliminate the farms, since you'll eventually pay off the magic item.

Alternately, you can use [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#Table-Estimating-Magic-Item-Gold-Piece-Values][the rules for creating a new magic item.]] Tippy (and the other char op guys) tend to assume that those rules don't exist, because they're too open for abuse, but there are already magic items made using /create food and water/ and assuming that you can't use those rules to make new magic items - at least when it comes to worldbuilding - it somewhat strange. By those rules, /create food and water/ is a third level spell, with a caster level of five and a duration of 24 hours, which means that if you give it a command word activation the price is 3 x 5 x 1,800gp x .5 = 13,500gp. This compares to 500gp × 3 × 5, 40xp × 3 × 5 = 7,500gp, 600xp = 10,500gp for the Create Food and Water Trap.

The core conceits of Tippyverse as I see them are large, highly-defended and interconnected cities of high level, with low level wilds outside them. I think you can more or less get that to work without the cheese (like traps that aren't traps and abusing infinite loops) so long as you make some assumptions about the level distribution of NPCs.
