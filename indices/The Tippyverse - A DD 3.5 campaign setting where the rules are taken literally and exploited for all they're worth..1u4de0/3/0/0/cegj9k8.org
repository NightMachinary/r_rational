No argument on the cities. If you have Teleportation Circle that's definitely what you get. But the universe doesn't fundamentally break unless you can cast spells effectively for free. (*)

Unless you assume that practically everyone is a mid-to-high level caster, the amount of magic that can get into your setting is sharply limited, and most things will remain cottage industries. You can't, for example, buff your entire army before 'Circling in to your enemy's capital.

But, as soon as a caster can set up a fast-resetting magic trap, the caster has effectively solved one problem and can move on to the next. You've now industrialized magic. That's where things fundamentally break.

(*) Oh, also, the food traps aren't really all that important -- multiple castings of Plant Growth will render your fields crazy productive. I was just calling those out as an example.
