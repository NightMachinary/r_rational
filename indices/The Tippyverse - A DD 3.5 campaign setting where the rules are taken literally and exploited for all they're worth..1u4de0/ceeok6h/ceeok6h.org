Oh, this reminds me: I've been meaning for a while to post in this subreddit a link to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor][The Two Year Emperor]], a quite awesome D&D fanfic, in which the antagonists of the story are basicly the Tippyverse. Seeing this reminded me, so [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u5fw4/the_two_year_emperor/][I posted the link]] on this subreddit. Thanks for the reminder!
