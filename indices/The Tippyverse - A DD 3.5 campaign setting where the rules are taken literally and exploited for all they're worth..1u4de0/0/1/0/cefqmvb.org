I think that it was good and comprehensive, the only problem I really have is with some of the discussion, which veers wildly off into rules geekery pissing matches and/or discussions on the nature of what makes a good setting, along with the very occasional shining gem of insight or setting gold (which is about par for the course in any discussion that gets much longer than two pages, no matter what it's about).

Most of the improvements that I'd want to make are in more coherently laying out the setting details, as well as laying bare the rules and assumptions that Tippyverse operates under, but that would require doing some rewriting, and collating the information found in the threads. The big problem is that Tippyverse isn't actually coherent - it's just an idea, not an actual setting, and pretty much every time it gets brought up it's in a different form. If you follow the pastebin, it's more of a progression of thought than anything else, and things that are stated early on don't really hold true by the end.

As it stands, I think that the pastebin is good, and a good introduction, but I guess what I'd really like is a redone Guide to the Tippyverse which arranges the lines of thought based on starting assumptions, rules, and outcomes - something like the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale][Kardashev scale]], but for high-magic D&D settings. The Tippyverse is really a collection of possible rational worlds that are clustered together based on similar characteristics, and I feel it would be better presented like that - but without rewriting much of what Tippy's laid out, I'm not sure that's easy to do.
