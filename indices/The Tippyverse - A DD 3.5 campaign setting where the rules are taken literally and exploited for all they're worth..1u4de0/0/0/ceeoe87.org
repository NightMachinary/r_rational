XP is cheap. It simply is, by the rules. First of all, there is the whole "experience is a river" concept. But beyond that, 4500 XP is a relatively small amount for, say, a 17th level character, who has hundreds of thousands of XP.

Besides that, Thought Bottles exist, so... XP costs aren't really a thing.

Also, the Dungeonscape source book is very clear that you can have "traps", using the trap rules, without them being hostile traps.

How much does a permanent Teleportation Circle cost? (Note by the way that you only need 17th level, not 18th as you wrongly described.) It costs: 17/10/9 gp base to hire someone to cast a 9th level spell (by the PHB), plus 1000 gp for the components, which is 2530 gp.

To pay for the permanency: 17/10/5 gp base, plus 5*4500 by the rate one must pay for spells with XP costs. This totals 23350 gp. If the caster uses a Thought Bottle to reduce the XP cost to 500 XP, it totals 3350 gp instead.

Thus, total price to hire someone to cast the spells for you: 25880 gp, or 5880 gp if a thought bottle is used.

This is a trivial expense for a high level character, even without the Thought Bottle, and definitely doable even for a mid-level character. Thus, I can simply say that you are strictly /wrong/ about it being "incredibly expensive".
