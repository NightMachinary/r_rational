As a big lover of D&D, I really enjoyed this ... however, I have a couple quibbles (which might be answered in the linked forum threads, I'll have to read those later).

I don't really understand why anyone would ever make a second city after the first one had been founded. Permanent teleportation circles are /incredibly expensive/ (they need an 18th level wizard, 1,000gp, and much more importantly, 4,500xp). You wouldn't make one unless you were linking together two points /and/ could make a profit doing so. However, the only way to make a profit is if there are goods to trade, and given the fact that agriculture is essentially eliminated (albeit with a fairly large initial capital investment) along with the creation of most mundane goods ... what goods are there to trade? Pretty much only those associated with material components for spells, or those that can't be created through magical means.

I sort of fail to see why you would ever have two linked megacities, especially since it requires the creation of not just one but /two/ permanent teleportation circles, /and/ a spell like dimensional lock can be used by either party at either end to block the route completely until force is applied (which costs more money than it seems like you'd be able to make, with again some return on investment problems). So with that said, it seems much more likely to me that there would just be a single megacity, rather than dozens or hundreds of linked cities. Perhaps there would be guarded teleportation circles acting as outposts/feeders for the megacity, but they'd be entirely linked, and they'd need a ridiculous ROI in order to be worth it.

Tippyverse also has a couple of things that I think are somewhat questionable but maybe defensible - it seems to assume that XP is rather cheap, what with lots of high level wizards walking around and blowing XP on all sorts of items and spells. It also makes heavy use of "traps that aren't traps", which requires a fairly *ahem* elaborate reading of the rules as written.

Then again, it's a fairly optimized and coherent setting based on an inherently incoherent ruleset whose economics were laid out by a group of people who seem to only have the vaguest understanding of how economics actually works.

Edit: [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?t=247468&page=1][This thread]] is my favorite so far, which contains some good debate:

#+begin_quote

  1. Tippyverse rules are not universally accepted
  2. Given the rules, Tippyverse assumptions are not universally accepted
  3. Given the rules and assumptions, Tippyverse outcomes are not universally accepted.
#+end_quote

Edit 2: Having read through most of the threads, I would suggest not reading most of the threads. It seems to descend into the typical char op arguing about RAW v. RAI v. what a reasonable GM would actually let you get away with for pages and pages. If you go by RAW, the first person to chain-gate Solars gets an infinite number of wishes and wins forever, which is certainly rational and optimal, but not actually very interesting. Hell, by RAW you can have infinite wealth at level 7. The Tippyverse, at its best, seems to me like it works by removing most of the completely broken stuff, and you can see that in the threads where there are things that work by RAW but completely break the Tippyverse; people don't like them, and will make shitty justifications for why it's not so. Tippyverse is better if it's just a formal list of magics available and the consequences of them, instead of just saying that it's the rules taken to their logical conclusions, because that results in derailing conversations about the somewhat incoherent rules of D&D when seen without a dungeon master there to mediate. It's an interesting setting as an exploration of how different reality-breaking spells interact with each other, given people thinking intelligently and a boatload of assumptions about how XP accumulation and D&D economy work.
