See, the thing is, the Tippyverse is what you get in a nonbroken way then you allow all those crazy things the rules allow. The basic premise is one of Thought Bottles and "infinite" wishes, and the whole setting comes as a consequence of that.

Basicly, you can say if you like that Thought Bottles are broken and that any sane DM would ban them, but of course that doesn't matter here, does it?

And about the cost: Even with the higher, non-Thought Bottle figure, it is, as you say, only a tenth of the wealth of the richest people in the world. (Well, actually not, because the wealthiest people would be PCs, but let's leave that aside.) I say "only" for good reason: Let's take the real world as an imperfect analogy. The richest group of people are billionaires. (We are not looking at the single richest person here, like we are not looking at the single top person in the Tippyverse, but rather the handful of top players.) Thus, let's say a real world cost of $100 million.

Imagine you could build a real-world Teleport circle for a mere $100 million. Think about the implications. The world would be crowded with them. Perhaps not because billionaires are building them, but because other (rich) entities (governments, corporations) are. $100 million is a drop in the bucket to the budget of the USG.

The point is, with big government you have wealth vastly more concentrated than that in the hands even of the richest. I see it easily being done.
