NPC wealth by level is 220Kgp at level 17, so making a single TC is more than a tenth of an NPC's wealth, which is not what I would consider cheap, especially since you need to cast it twice in order to actually make a path between cities. A fifth of the wealth of the richest people in the world is /not/ cheap. 4,500XP is also enough to drop you about a third of a level down to 16th - casting two of them drops you two thirds. Sure, you have hundreds of thousands of XP, but you can't spend it without gimping yourself. I also question how cheap XP is, given that the DMG explicitly says that an encounter so easy that it uses up none or almost none of the PCs' resources shouldn't result in any XP reward at all. But if you're a character optimizer like Tippy, you tend to go by the charts and numbers instead of anything that the DMG actually says.

If you assume the broken abuse like Thought Bottles for (basically) infinite XP, or infinite Wishes, then I think the setting just breaks, even given the assumptions underpinning it. There's really no reason for trade when you can conjure an unlimited number of magic items from the air. Tippyverse /says it has/ trade between distant cities, and with infinite material wealth I just don't see that happening - the only things that you'd be trading are information and service, and with the existence of perfect automatons and spells like mind rape I don't see that happening either. But again;
