Without increasing manufacturing you aren't going to achieve much.

An intelligent and informed person at best will be able to improve steel quality if he has the right knowledge.

Even if you have specialized knowledge you wouldn't be able to translate it that well through medieval means.

The best advantage is simple knowing what is achievable and having a modern mentality.

The scientific method,list of advantage and disadvantage, Assembly line batching.

The problems like paper, cloth, food preservation, information flow, energy,research and education represent and know that it is the major limits of that world stopping progress.

The most devastating you could be with modern knowledge would probably be thorough chemistry and biology for WW1 like weapons of mass destruction if your protagonist is a complete psychopath and irredeemably evil by all definitions.

With better steel and some oil you can motorize stuff as well as other machines.
