Wars are won by people, and they're fought for resources (even if that resource is something weird and ephemeral like "honor"). The best way to win a war is to never have to fight in the first place.

It wouldn't work for every lord, and it would take longer than a month, but advancing economics, law, and psychology would go a very long way to "winning" wars.

It's not like English is the dominant world language because the British (and then America) took over every where with might of arms.
