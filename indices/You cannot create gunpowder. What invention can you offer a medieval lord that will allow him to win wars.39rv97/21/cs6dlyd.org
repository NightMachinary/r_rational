I just had a really nasty thought. Chemical weapons. Having your infantry skirmishers carry glass bottles full of ammonia OR bleach.

Squads carrying ammonia are separated from squads carrying bleach. They work as paired squads. Ammonia-throwers and bleach throwers concentrate on standard bearers or other clearly identifiable targets.

Splash-mixing of ammonia and bleach in the middle of an enemy will break up an attacking formation rather quickly.

That's the crudest effective chemical weapon I can think of (other than fire, which our lord probably already knows about.)
