Thinking back on this, I admit I was wrong.

You probably could build a glider with the performance of the original 70's era ones. Or using a rigid wing design better than that. There's no way in hell though that you'd get close to modern performance with a similar construction out of materials available then. And re-optimising for the materials available is not a simple pen-and-paper exercise.
