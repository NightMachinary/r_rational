"really really complicated" is exaggerated. You need a flexible wing with a leading edge, and a sturdy frame. Yes, today they're made from aluminium and glass fiber, but the basic principles are very similar to a sailboat. A skilled boat craftsman could at least build a prototype from wood and cloth, and then start optimizing for weight.

The only trick you really need to know is the wing profile, otherwise the pilot can't steer.
