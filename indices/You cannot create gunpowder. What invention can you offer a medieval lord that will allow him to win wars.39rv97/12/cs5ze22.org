Trebuchets are the first thing that come to mind.

The second thing is smallpox blankets. After suitably inoculating the medieval lord's own people with cowpox, of course. This is fairly dependent on your definition of "direct combat applications". CONSTANT VIGILANCE and all that.

Third idea: Crossbows, depending on what year it is and whether this group has learned to make them yet.

Fourth idea would probably take more than a month, but: Steam engines, wooden tanks (like Da Vinci's doodles!), blitzkrieg warfare.

Fifth idea: Hang gliders and/or hot air balloons. Not sure if available materials will allow this. I'd probably start by showing him a paper lantern and then claim that with enough time I could build one that would let him fly over the battlefield to command and rain death from above.
