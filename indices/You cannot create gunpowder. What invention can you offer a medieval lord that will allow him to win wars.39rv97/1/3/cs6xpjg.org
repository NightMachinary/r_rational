Bicycles would be hard, I think. However tricycles would be far easier, and could carry more weight.

Just think of an army of soldiers on their Green Machines!

Seriously though, a tricycle would be easier. An extra wheel for better balance and more weight distribution, the center of mass can be lower. Easier to train soldiers to ride them. The pedals can be mounted directly to the front wheel instead of some complex pedal mechanism.

I specifically mention the Green Machine because it is steered with two columns attached to shafts, connected in turn to a solid axle, rather than a floating wheel
