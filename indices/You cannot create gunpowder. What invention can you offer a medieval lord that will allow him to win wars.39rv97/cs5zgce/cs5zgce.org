Signal flags, signal towers, and some type of variant of morse code. I don't know morse code, but I know how it works.

Also, food preservation methods. Boiling and wax-sealing clay containers would allow for better ability to store foods against siege, and better ability to keep men fed in the field with less death due to spoilage.

If the lord was progressive enough, I might try to teach the concept of the assembly line, and uniform components for making things like arrows, spears, and simpler armor pieces.

Also, potato cannons. Fueled by the purest alcohol I could manage. They can be made man-portable. Flint and steel igniter should be possible. A wire connected to a piece of steel, which is jerked, forcing the steel to impact the flint inside the tube, igniting the alcohol.

Actually, a long match in a small hole would work fine to ignite a potato cannon. (Burning splinters would work too, as noted below.)
