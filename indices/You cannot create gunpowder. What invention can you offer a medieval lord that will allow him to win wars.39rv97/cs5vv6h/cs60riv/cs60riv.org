Introductory biological warfare is actually pretty easy - and would go perfectly with refusing to improve hygiene. But I try to be a scientist who thinks about should as well as can, so... no way. I've also turned down some nice offers for Defense jobs due to pacifism, so really direct combat technologies are out.

Telecommunications. Start with Heliograph techniques, which were good enough for the British Empire in India, and try to move up to radio. Something which has clear military uses even on a tactical scale, but really shines for civilian applications.
