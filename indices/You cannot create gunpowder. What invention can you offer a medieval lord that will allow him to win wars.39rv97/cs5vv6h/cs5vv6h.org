Oh.

Well, in that case I have to cheat with Wikipedia (if I'm just using my native knowledge, I'm boned, since I couldn't do much more than teach math and logic). However, if I'm allowed to prepare some knowledge ahead of time:

- If it's early enough, the *stirrup* apparently allows a cavalry to hit a lot harder from horseback. *Horseshoes* allow travel over rocky terrain. The *horse collar* allows for the use of draught horses, which can travel faster than oxen, meaning better supply lines. These all fall under the general heading of "cavalry".

- I think I might be able to figure out how an *astrolabe* works, and maybe how to build one. This is general navigation, so maybe falls outside the bounds of "direct combat", but I have a hard time imagining that a medieval general wouldn't see the naval applications. Same with some ship-building techniques that I might be able to learn up on and present.

- In the sphere of *architecture* I might be able to offer some advice on better building techniques in order to improve castle defenses, or point out methods of siege assault. But that's not my area of expertise either.

But again, that's me cheating with Wikipedia, and I almost certainly wouldn't be able to even /instruct/ someone to craft any of those things without a week of study (ideally in the modern world). I'm hoping this answer is still better than just saying, "Nope, I'm fucked".
