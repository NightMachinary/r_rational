Not going to be particularly useful without a general staff. Remember, up until Berthier invented the general staff (literally right before Napoleon took over) armies were /at most/ as big as one guy could shout at, and it's going to be almost impossible to convince a medieval lord to give that up. There's a reason the general staff went out of vogue when the Romans went away and didn't come back until the French Revolution.
