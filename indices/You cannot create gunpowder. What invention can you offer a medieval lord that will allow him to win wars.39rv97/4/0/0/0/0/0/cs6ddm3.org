The Romans maintained a permanent, professional army. Roman legionaries enlisted for 25 years of service and were highly trained. Centurions were generally promoted from the ranks after several years of service and were required to be literate. Only the very highest ranks were political appointments; the rest were merit promotions up a hierarchy, commanding successively more important centuries and cohorts. Roman soldiers often spent decades fighting with the same comrades and officers. Furthermore, the permanent position meant that Roman soldiers could drill and practice and confer institutional knowledge, which meant they could actually do things like "produce and refine an infantry doctrine over the course of generations and practice it until every legionary knew it". [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_infantry_tactics][That infantry doctrine itself was /damn/ impressive]]. I can't really summarize it, but it depended heavily on the soldiers executing it trusting each other to cover weaknesses and to step in at the right time or switch out at the right time. Lots of well-ordered rotations, lots of shield-your-buddy-while-he-stabs, lots of "hold here and wait for the flank to pincer".
