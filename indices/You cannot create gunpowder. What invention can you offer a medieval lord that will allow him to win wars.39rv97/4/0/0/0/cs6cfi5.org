You know how armies have things like squads and battalions and lieutenants and captains and generals? That's the general staff. You have units, which are directly commanded by low-grade officers that are coordinated by higher-grade officers up to the Person In Charge. Every officer know what's going on at their level and the level above and - critically - has enough power and permission to make decisions that they can move their troops around to cover problem spots or take advantages when they see them. That's huge. That means that your Person In Charge doesn't have to worry about giving orders to 100-person blocks of soldiers and can concentrate on their strategy and ordering around tens of thousands of guys at a time. That means that decisions like "pincer now" can be made by a person closer to the action, which means those decisions will be more accurate and generally better. That means that individual soldiers have someone that they can trust to know what's going on and that can recover the situation when things start going badly, which is a huge morale boost.

Part of the reason the Romans were so dominant, militarily, is because they had this working. Centuries, Cohorts, Legions. They could delegate because they had a professional military and trained special-purpose officers and could trust each other.

Feudal lords couldn't delegate because there wasn't enough trust going around for it to work. Lords couldn't be trusted to handle maneuvers because they'd either screw them up or abandon the plan in a glorious charge or just plain backstab their king or the lord next door. Soldiers were conscripts or militia and couldn't be convinced to follow orders except from the single person on the field with the highest rank. As a result, the size of your army was basically limited by how loud your king could shout. Anything larger would dissolve into chaos because people weren't getting orders they could trust.
