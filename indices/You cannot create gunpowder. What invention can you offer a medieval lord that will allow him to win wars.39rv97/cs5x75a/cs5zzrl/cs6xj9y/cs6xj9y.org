Would you have better luck with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Man-lifting_kite][man-lifting kites]]? There's stories about a Japanese thief in the 1500's using one, but I don't know enough about the history of cloth to say whether it would be possible in the West. Actually, now I think about it, the Japanese probably used paper, I vaguely recall something about waterproof paper umbrellas being used in antiquity there.
