Horse drawn flamethrower chariot? I'd have to experiment with the fuel mixture to get it to burn without exploding and stick to the target, but there are plenty of flammable oils to use and I'd have time to fiddle with it. The actual mechanism could be pretty simple and crude.

It wouldn't be terribly effective against anything besides foot soldiers, but routing them is the bulk of the battle. Mainly a psychological weapon, but it should be impressive enough for the king to keep me around until I can put together something better. You could also use the fuel in clay jars encrusted with coals as trebuchet ammo.
