Gunpowder isn't the only thing you can use to power a crude projectile weapon. Alcohol will work quite nicely for Arquebus-style weapons or cannon analogs.

Sickness and starvation in the field need not only be addressed by 'hygiene' Better food preservation will address both of these issues, and allow larger stockpiles of food to resist siege.
