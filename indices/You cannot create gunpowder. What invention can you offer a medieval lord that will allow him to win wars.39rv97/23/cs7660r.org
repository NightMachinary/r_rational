I feel like there are a lot of military strategies that could be effectively employed in the middle ages, but unfortunately, I highly doubt a foreigner with no actual combat experience could convince them to put me in charge. Reserve troops, guerilla warfare, and information warfare as broad general concepts would all be game-changers. (Reserve troops would be particularly hard given the use of looting as an incentive.)

No hygiene? Well then, I suppose we could take a different direction, and employ biological warfare.
