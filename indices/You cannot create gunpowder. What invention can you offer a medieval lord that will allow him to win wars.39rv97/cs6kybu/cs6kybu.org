I'd gather all his blacksmiths and their spare metal (using plate metal too if I have to), and have them build personnel "tanks" out of metal. This would basically be a dome, about the size of an SUV, with slits through which archers could shoot with their longbows. It would also have a great many spears (entirely metal) welded to the tank's shell and pointed outward in all directions, like a hedgehog, to prevent enemy melee from getting too close, thereby allowing those within to choose their targets. The 'tank's shell will also protect its underbelly (one can only exit the tank when the door is unlocked by those within). Each 'tank' would fit 4-6 longbowmen (very cramped) and have a thousand arrows stockpiled (very very cramped). And yes, this would cost a /lot/ of metal.

Basically an invulnerable mobile tower at ground level, from which longbowmen could mow down enemy soldiers - even the most well-protected ones without putting themselves in any risk. Given how well protected they would be and the fact that longbowmen could fire shots extremely quickly, a line of such tanks along the front line could be both devastating and demoralizing. And they'd be able to clunk forward should the enemy, afraid of such a contraption, decide to break ranks.
