I think a spark-gap radio might be doable with medieval technology.

The receiver doesn't need to be more complicated than an old-fashioned coherer.

Batteries can be made with jars of vinegar or sulphuric acid with metal in them (lots and lots in parallel). Leyden jars are capacitors, and aren't that complicated.They knew what lodestones were since classical era, and I assume wire isn't a problem for a blacksmith.
