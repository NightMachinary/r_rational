You know, that's actually a fair point. We've all been taking "Medieval Lord" to mean "mid-ranking western European land-owning noble circa 1400 CE". Which is /technically/ correct, but the /spirit/ of the question could be lead to an interpretation of "Chinese General circa 700 CE". In which case things get really interesting and I'm probably about to lose two hours of my life checking up on Tang Dynasty military technology and doctrine.

That said, Tang Dynasty specifically had the bureaucracy and political unity to raise the professional army that could support the general staff that would make Radio useful.
