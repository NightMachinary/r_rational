I'd just rattle off a list of every medieval-level technology I could think of. Communication was horrid back then, and just because a Spanish lord was telling all his friends about this cool new siege engine doesn't mean that British sappers would know how to make them. As soon as I hit one that no one in the castle could identify even with drawings and descriptions, I'd consider the viability and start begging the house carpenters and blacksmiths for a crash course in medieval prototyping.
