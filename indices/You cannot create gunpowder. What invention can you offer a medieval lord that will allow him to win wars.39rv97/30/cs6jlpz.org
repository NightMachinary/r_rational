I wonder if you could make something like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_air_rifle][Windb√ºchse]] air rifle in a month. Even if you managed to make only a few it could make a huge impact on the battlefield. But I guess it would be very difficult unless you were already an expert at air guns already.
