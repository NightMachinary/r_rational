Short term: Telescopes and simple two-part ciphers. You work closely with a glassmaker to create a telescope. Then, you create a medieval PGP key encryption method. The major leaders all have a single page representing their key (given at some banquet), with an instructional manual telling their scribes how to use it. Then later on any message sent to those generals will be guaranteed to be accurate. Those two inventions together will give the lord a better scouting force, and the ability to reliably order his lords at a distance without worrying about enemies stealing their orders mid-transit.

Long term: Crop rotation techniques. Even simple 4 field crop rotation techniques increase the per-acre yield about 100% over early medieval farming techniques. Peasants who produce twice as much grain can afford to pay twice as many taxes. A lord with twice as much money per-acre is going to have a very easy time raising an army to fight his wars. Coffers win wars, when it comes down to it, though there are exceptions to any rule.
