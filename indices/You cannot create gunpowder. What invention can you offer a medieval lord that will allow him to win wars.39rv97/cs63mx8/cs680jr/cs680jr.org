They're already using boiled leather studded with metal. For any thickness you care to name, their existing armor is better.

Unless they're in India or China, they have to import silk at great expense. For any amount of money you care to name, you can equip many more soldiers with studded leather than with silk.

You're essentially just providing an improved gambeson, but it costs so much more that nobody would use it.
