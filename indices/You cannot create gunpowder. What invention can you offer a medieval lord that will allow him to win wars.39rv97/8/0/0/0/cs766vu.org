Because pre-1900 wars were very long-drawn, with all the movement on foot and transport convoys to supply the army.

Because of the slow physical movement of the army, even information on horseback was quicker than the progression of the war. That led to early warning systems that allowed opposing kingdoms to prepare their own armies and counter the attack. If the attacked kingdom had an information advantage, and the attacker didn't know that they were prepared, they could even ambush back.

That meant that a large part of the war was always an information war. You could pretend to be an allied army and "agree" on an attack timing and location. You could pretend to be an enemy spy and send false messages, leading the enemy's army to prepare an ambush on your fake location, leaving it vulnerable to your real ambush. Without proper encryption, every message could have been forged by the enemy. That's why encryption was used at least as early as ancient Rome. But encryption in those days was more obfuscation and could be broken or detected easily. Asymmetric encryption as of today can be carried in plain sight and can still not be cracked.
