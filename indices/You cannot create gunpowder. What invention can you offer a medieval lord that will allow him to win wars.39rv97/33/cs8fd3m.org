This thread has given me so many ideas for my current project. A projectile weapon modeled after a potato cannon could be made without metal. The Chinese wheelbarrow is ingenious, and I have no idea why I've never seen one in the US before.

Trying to figure out how to make potato cannon technology work in my story without breaking things was difficult, but I've managed it, I think.
