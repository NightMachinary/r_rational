I study biology. If I can't just share my knowledge and have to actually make a product... Direct combat applications, too, hmm. Penicillin is super helpful for fighting infection in war, which would let him keep more soldiers. If that's stretching it too far, bring me the sick and I will build biological weapons. There are some nasty bacteria that could go great on swords, arrowheads, spears... Poison the enemy's food supplies... Sicken their mounts... hell, if the objective is to fucking ruin them, I could spread blighted crops. If I could get ahold of some botulism, well, they'd be screwed. Anthrax would probably be fairly easy. My biggest concern would be not infecting myself or my people, but if I have access to all his resources, I imagine a decent lab could be built. And, if the lord would agree, offer antibiotics to those willing to join his cause. Call plagues on his enemies and miracle cures for his people.
