K.A. Applegate's Everworld series explores this concept. Some teenagers are trapped in a medieval fantasy world, but there's a copy of them living in the real world too and every so often their memories sync up.

One of them uses some knowledge from books in the present to have the craftsmen back then make a telegraph.\\
Definitely check it out if you're a fan of Animorphs. It's the same author, but sadly it's not a finished series.
