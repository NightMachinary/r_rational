Hey, I took an entire class on this! Technology and Military Organization from Dr. Salomone at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Awesome class. :D

Unfortunately,

  He gives you a month's access to his resources.

  sell a medieval lord on it's usefulness

  direct combat applications, no "improve hygeine"

  Any answer other than gunpowder

/There's nothing really revolutionary left/. Let me go down the list of technologies that have /actually/ revolutionized military doctrine (that is, /actually/ let people win wars):

- Gunpowder: out.
- Longbow: irreducible crafting time >10 years (seasoned wood, training).
- General staff: no way in hell am I going to be able to convince a lord to give up direct control over his unit.
- Hygiene: out.
- Railroad: no direct combat applications.
- Radio: useless without general staff.
- Internal combustion engine: can't craft that in a month.
- Precision machining techniques: no direct combat applications.

If you're willing to let me cheat, then I'm going to skate by on a technicality: gunpowder already exists, I just need to make it practical!

- Built-up and wire-wrapped barrel constructions
- Rifling bench
- Shells, sabots
- Mortars
- Leadscrews
- Ballistics mathematics
- Surveying equipment/techniques
- Field and split carriages
- Powder bags
- Interrupted-screw breech blocks
- Time fuzes
- Minie ball, wadding
- Brass cartridges
- Bolt action
- Mercury fulminate percussion caps
- Use of ceramics or lead in powder mills so you can use ball mills or edge mills instead of mortar and pestle which in turn means your powder is way more consistent and reliable
