I assume the lord can make clear that he wouldn't be satisfied by a kilometre meters of the stuff beforehand, so I can move on to other plans.

Your mention of geometry gives me another idea: cartography. The East India Company mapped India very quickly by using triangulation: find three points which you can see from one another. Measure the distance between two of them, and the angles of the triangle, and you can determine the distance between the others even if the terrain is awful. Measure the corners of a triangle which has one side in common with the previous triangle, and you know the two new sides as well. Continue and you can map an entire subcontinent quite rapidly and accurately (inaccuracy builds up as you move further from the original triangle, so measure some of the other distances manually again to compensate).

Better maps are important in determining strategy in advance; ambushes, travel times, etc.
