Navigation is very useful for warships, so: Spyglass. Sextant. Try to have people create a mechanical watch using my vague memories of a coiled spring and that weird two-hooked thingy.

Semaphores (both the humans and building). Halfway between signal fires (single bit) and telegraphy, allowing communications at 0.1 bit per second and a latency of 5 seconds per km. Get a message from the border 100 times faster than a courier or homing pigeon.

Roman roads, if they don't build their own yet. I doubt one will be finished by a month, but hopefully he gets the point that it's better than walking through mud.
