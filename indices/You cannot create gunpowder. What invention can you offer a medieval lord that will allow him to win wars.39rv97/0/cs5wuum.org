Stirrups, as previously mentioned, took a surprisingly long time to become commonplace. Trebuchets and catapults and other siege weaponry, if before their invention/introduction.

I know a bit about steelmaking, metallurgy, and materials; superior blades may be possible, but I doubt that I'd have time to get a significant enough improvement to a local blacksmith inside of a single month to impress significantly - lacking all scientific instruments and books about cooling curves and phase diagrams of steel and working solely from memory of martensite and pearlite and so forth, I doubt my skill would be sufficient to make something truly impressive with no modern tools or equipment and no books, in a single month. Modern metallurgy is significantly more advanced than medieval metallurgy, but getting it working in time seems unlikely.

If I happened to be lucky enough to have an alchemist or other guy who knew how to make to make aqua fortis (nitric acid), I could quite conceivably make nitrocellulose (guncotton) to work around the gunpowder restriction? This feels like cheating; also, not entirely sure how to make aqua fortis ab initio myself, so likely to be screwed by the starting conditions - and furthermore I'd like as not blow myself up.

If the medieval lord was allowing us to abandon whatever notions of chivalry, honor, etc. most concern him, a ghillie suit might be possible and a little useful for skirmishers and guerrilla warfare.

If in an era that prizes cavalry, perhaps invent the pike formation? If in one that prizes men at arms in pike formations, well, I don't think introducing and training in longbow use is practical in the time allotted, and probably wouldn't be a real new invention?

I could conceivably introduce improved armor - it took a long time to get to full plate armor in reality, and that stuff would be pretty useful. That said, as a non-blacksmith trying to teach blacksmiths how to make something I've never worn or had personal experience with this seems... unlikely to work out well.
