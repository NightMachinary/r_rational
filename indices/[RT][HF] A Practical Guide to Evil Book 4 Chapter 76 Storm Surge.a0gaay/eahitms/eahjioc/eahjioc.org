Imo, this is pretty much the worst case scenario which I didn't expect for Cat. Assuming Winter was unleashed before she lost it (which seems to be the case), I doubt her entire Drow sigil would have survived. Maybe the Mighty might have survived, but I don't expect anything below her Lords to survive Winter. So not only she loses her power equaliser against Heroes the level of SoS & GP, she loses her anti-army weapon that gave her an edge over Procer & Praes, loses control over the remaining Fae left, she doesn't get any military manpower that she originally went to the Drow for, and if Indrani is dead, Masego would be highly emotionally crippled while the Woe loses their Narrative advantage of a 5-man band. And this is all that I can list off the edge of my mind over lunch.
