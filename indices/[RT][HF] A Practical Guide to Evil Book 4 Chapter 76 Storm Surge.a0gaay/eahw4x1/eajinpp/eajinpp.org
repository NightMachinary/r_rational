The demon didn't steal her aspect - Masego cut it out to stave off demon corruption, along with a chunk of her soul. Interestingly it gave her something like a reverse case of phantom limb, and she walks funny because of it; in the current chapter there's a reference to her "bad leg". That's because of that.

She briefly lost the name of squire at first Liesse, and gained it back with three new and unrelated aspects. Break, Take and then she got Fall as a winter power. Only Fall stayed around, though Take morphed into that artifact thing.
