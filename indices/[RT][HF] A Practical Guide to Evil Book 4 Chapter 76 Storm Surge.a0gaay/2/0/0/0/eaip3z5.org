Now I have mixed feelings about this.

While I would greatly enjoy the conversation between Black, Pilgrim and the Saint, EE said he's going to halve book 4, so the other half becomes Book 5.

Judging by the character contest we have probably 10 or so chapters left (this is a highly idealistic estimate), which won't be enough time to resolve the Black situation. So it can only end in a cliffhanger.

Now, I feel the tension for Black has ebbed slightly but a new interlude featuring him would only reopen the proverbial wound bringing the tension anew and mayhaps intensify it. All excellent from an authorial perspective but cruel torture for the readers.

Tl;dr I wanna know about Black but don't wanna know too because I know it won't satiate me and only leave me craving for more.

... Fuck.
