I haven't been a fan of the Drow arc, but I really liked this chapter.

#+begin_quote
  some -- viper tongues one and all -- might call me a hypocrite for complaining
#+end_quote

Ok, I laughed. Cat, you're nothing if you're not a hypocrite.

#+begin_quote
  “You seem irritated,” Rumena noted. “Is your attempted enslavement of my entire race proving too troublesome for your tastes?”
#+end_quote

Oof. Rumena coming in with the big guns. But I'm glad that there's at least one Drow willing to call Cat out on the fairly monstrous things she's trying to do.

#+begin_quote
  . Just because I'd found seven of the Longstrides so far didn't meant that was all of them.
#+end_quote

Yeah, there's meant to be 200 of them. Where are the rest of them this chapter? You'd think more than 3.5% would show up to the fight that they came to Great Strycht for.

#+begin_quote
  The sudden attack had not been a pleasant surprise, but my plan was still working out at the moment
#+end_quote

Seriously, what /is/ the plan here? Cat knows that there are 200 super Drow out to get her, that Sve is about to make her move, and she's what? Driving all the Drow to the centre of the city and cause chaos? How is that even supposed to help with the issues at hand?

#+begin_quote
  I didn't have eyes in the back of my head -- although I could actually grow those, I'd found out, I still hadn't figured out how to make them function properly
#+end_quote

Ok, adding more tricks to Cat's proverbial bag. this is getting fairly ridiculous.

#+begin_quote
  “Make me,” Mighty Rumena said, voice utterly serene.
#+end_quote

Seems like a fairly dumb move for a guy who's survived for over three thousand years. But to give the guy credit, also hugely badass.

#+begin_quote
  Silencing their footsteps was too basic a use of Night for it to have been reasonable to hope otherwise, I conceded, but at least the mist would hinder their vision.
#+end_quote

Assuming that these ultra badass Drow, who are the hunters of the hunters, can't see through a bit of mist is something of a risky move. I'm actually a little surprised at how well it actually does work - you'd think that a group of elite huntes who live in a place called the Everdark would have ways of dealing with visibility problems.

#+begin_quote
  t felt like a ward, or at least something to the same effect.
#+end_quote

Oh cool, someone using one of Cat's weaknesses against her. That's always nice to see.

#+begin_quote
  The sheer variety of Secrets caught me off-guard....I'd fought heroic bands that were not nearly that skilled at working together. Shit, I wasn't sure the Calamities would be that good at it.
#+end_quote

Yeah. These Drow be crazy. If Cat ends up going home with an army of these, then I'm not really sure what fights she could get into that would be interesting to see. The Dead King? But that isn't a fight she needs to pick. The Elves? They're incredibly strong, but haven't really been up to much in the series this far.

#+begin_quote
  If this turned into a brawl I was dead. Winter or not, apotheosis or not.
#+end_quote

...were you expecting otherwise? You do remember how the fight with Urulan went, right Cat?

#+begin_quote
  “Let it be one and the same,” Sve Noc laughed. “All is Night.”
#+end_quote

And there we go. Finally, the parallels between the Priestess of the Night and the Sovereign of Moonless Nights come to a head.

#+begin_quote
  She's taken all of it.

  I was just Catherine Foundling, and might as well have been blind.

  I could feel my heart beat, my real heart. My blood flow from my veins. I had never in my life felt so vulnerable as I did then, stripped of every bit of power I'd clawed my way into owning.
#+end_quote

So Cat's human again. I wonder what Warlock would have said about this, had he been around to see it.

More importantly, Cat's lost all the godlike power she's picked up over the series, and especially over the past book or so. Honestly I hope she doesn't go back to the level where just keeping track of all her powers is a chore and the only challenging fights she can have are with individuals who could single-handedly flatten a country.

But it makes perfect sense for Cat to lose here. She's been charging towards Sve without any real plan for just about this entire arc. Hell, she's known that the Longstrides and Sve would make their plays at Strycht for a bunch of chapters and did nothing about it. She's been engaging in the sorts of moves she's always seen as morally and practically reprehensible, from slaving to handing out titles, without too much thought about it. Cat getting served here is the logical outcome of this fight.

#+begin_quote
  Choosing my words with great care, I grinned and met its gaze.

  “Take me to your leader,” I ordered.
#+end_quote

Ok. So I've got no idea how Rumena survived here, why he would listen to Cat, or what plan she could have here (did she plan for Sve to steal her mantle before she even knew that was Sve's goal?), but I'm excited to see what happens next.

Cat mentioned somewhere in the chapter that there were no more stakes, but I disagree - for once in this Drow arc ot feels like there /are/ stakes and that's wonderful.
