so yes like the other guy said but i'll make it more detailed.

her third aspect was supposed to be "seek", were she could basically get information she needed, but that one got corrupted by the demon so she lost it by having apprentice cutting it out permanently crippling the name of squire for her.

then she lost her name by having it stolen by the goblin before her resurrection, but by killing him she claimed it again but rather then getting the same name she had before, she got it granted anew with all 3 aspects so then she had potential for 3 aspects yet again.

then with winter making a deal with her with her heart being replaced and her nature shifted her third aspect became fall, that makes things enter the domain of winter.
