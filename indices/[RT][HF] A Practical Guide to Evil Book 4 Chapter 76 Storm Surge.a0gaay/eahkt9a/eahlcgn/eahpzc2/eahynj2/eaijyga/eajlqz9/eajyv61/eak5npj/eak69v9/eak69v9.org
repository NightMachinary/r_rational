In specific stories, in the right circumstances, but not universally. In Catherine's own words:

'There were dozens of stories about hard-headed young girls facing down gods for some cause or another, but all of them about heroes. I'd wiggled my way into that sort of role before, but only when standing for a greater cause than myself.'

- Chapter 31: High Noon.

She's used heroic stories several times by using her Role as ruler of Callow to gain an advantage over 'the hated invader', but that doesn't make her a hero.

A hero, by definition, is granted power by the Gods Above. They don't have to be devout priests or flawless Paladins, as the Lone Swordsman proved, but they do need to be aligned with the Heavens in their motives and actions. Catherine most definitely is not. She has specifically rejected the Heavens as a source of morality or authority.

'Woe on us all, but if the Gods demanded my home be ashes then the Gods would burn.'

-Chapter 37: Offing.
