That's what a hero is. Someone who fills a cultural Role and is granted the power of a Name by the Gods Above. There's no such thing as a hero who isn't on the side of the Heavens. You don't get to be Named without the approval of either Above or Below, and Above only chooses people whose beliefs align with their cause.
