Cat is something better than a Hero though. She's a protagonist. Both on a meta level for the book we're reading and on a in story level with Fate. She has too many weighty connections in every corner of Calernia to be replaced so easily. She's the Arch Nemesis of the East, the primary reason the Crusade is happening. The story would break is she died and was replaced by just another Goddess to stand with the Dead King.
