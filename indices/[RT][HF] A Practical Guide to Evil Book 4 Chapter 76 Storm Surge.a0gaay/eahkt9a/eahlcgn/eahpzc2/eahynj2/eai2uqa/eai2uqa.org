Sve Noc could pretend to be Cat though - that might well work, especially as Cat has taken oaths herself as the Sovereign of Moonless Night; "Cat" would at the very least be bound to make her best effort at forging the Liesse Convention as Cat envisioned it, and enforcing it afterwards. She might even be forced to work in Callow's best interest as she understands it.

It's possible that Sve Noc, Sovereign of Moonless Nights might be close enough for story purposes.
