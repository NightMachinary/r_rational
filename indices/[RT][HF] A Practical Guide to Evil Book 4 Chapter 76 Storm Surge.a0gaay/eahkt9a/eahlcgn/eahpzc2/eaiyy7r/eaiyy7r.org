Cat's stories have more than once strayed into heroic territory, and her foray into evil has always been a means to an end. Though a actual hero is probably out of the picture cause servitude to the heaves a few miles out of character.

Though not every hero has shown to be a servant of the heaven, though the once that do share a trait with Cat, they are the band leader.

That said, The folly is going to do something, though its a bit hard to rhyme with Cat's defeated behavior.
