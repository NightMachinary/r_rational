The whole drow arc lacks narrative weight for me. It's a side show. Even if Cat loses Winter to some z-list wannabe God, her long term goals and desires won't have been affected. Oh no, she lost something she didn't want.... And also, fights with the Drow are starting to look like the /Matrix 3/; the more powerful the fighters, the less interesting the fight. Because of all of this it's hard to feel invested in the fight or the characters.
