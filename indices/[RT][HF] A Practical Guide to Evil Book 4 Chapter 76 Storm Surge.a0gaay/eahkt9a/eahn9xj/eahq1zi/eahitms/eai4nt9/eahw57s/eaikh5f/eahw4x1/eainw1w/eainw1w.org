Sve Noc... two faced goddess... Cat's schtick often relies on usurping power from a superior entity via narrative... Akua has been building herself up as a "tool without personality" while Catherine has been digging into her out of curiosity about how much humanity she has left... cat's power almost always comes with a cost, but with winter, it seems like she doesn't really have anything left to lose...

But there is.

Cat's personality itself.

Half of her humanity.

What if...

Cat usurps the mantle/Name/Title of the two faced goddess...

... with her alter ego being Akua?

Then the oath with Vivienne would essentially have to be applied to herself... as Akua is a /part/ of her, a tool. Ending of the final book having Catherine/Akua face off against her former friends... the ultimate climactic fight!
