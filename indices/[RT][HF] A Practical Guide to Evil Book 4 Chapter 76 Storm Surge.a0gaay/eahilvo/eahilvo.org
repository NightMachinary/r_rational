Since we're in the last stretch of what is going to be Book IV, as a minor note the character contest is going to be sped up a bit (so it will end with the book instead of remain in limbo between books). That means there's two matchups to vote on tonight. First is the last of the initial brackets, Hakram vs Larat, while the second starts the second round: Cat vs the Dead King. Links to vote below.
