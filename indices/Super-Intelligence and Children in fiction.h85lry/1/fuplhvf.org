Ender's game gets held up as both a good and bad example. As a kid up till high school, I would have said it was a good example, now as an adult I have more mixed feelings. I think part of the problem is that as a gifted kid, even though your own internal world feels rich, complex, and complete, you aren't aware of the blind spots in your knowledge and the way your lack of life experience can bias your internal perception of yourself. Thus there is an inherent contradiction in writing super intelligent/gifted children. If it's a first person POV or a 3rd person limited POV it will either come across as unrealistic because it is true to the perspective of the gifted child and thus shares the biases of the child, or it will be “realistic” at the expense of not capturing the child's internal narration properly.

So Ender's Game feels true to the experiences as a gifted child, even if the overall premise and the extent Ender's ability is unrealistic.

Thinking of stuff I read as a kid, I really think Ender's Game is the best example. Ender's thought processes, social isolation, and (in hindsight) pressure from adults were all things that were true to my experience.

In Ender's Shadow Bean's life experiences felt too far removed from mine and his intelligence translated to hyper competence in a way I couldn't relate to and that undermined the main series.

I read 5 or 6 Artemis Fowl books. I didn't empathize with Artemis the same way I did with Ender. Artemis Fowl's genius tended to be in the form of inventions and research done off screen in a way that couldn't be replicated in my own thoughts.

Dune introduced me to a lot of interesting concepts, but the abilities of Mentats and intuition of the Bene Gesserit were super powers and not things I could relate to.

I'll confess I read Billy and Howard and Duumvirate (I know you know what these are because you started a let's read before giving up in disgust). The way Howard has a simplistic but edgy explanation for how the world works felt true to my teenage self even if I disagreed with the actual details of his explanations. In hindsight, these stories were a way of transgressing against my fundamentalist religious upbringing. It's kind of funny how the perspectives of an edgy nihilistic atheist who wants to be a world controlling Illuminati master overlaps with that of a fundamentalist Christian who believes Satan is controlling the world through the elites...

Anyway I think the answer of “good” changes if you are writing for gifted children or Young Adult audiences and are trying to be true to their perspective (in which case those outside this demographic might perceive it as inaccurate, going so far as to say that the author “has never met a child”) compared to if you are trying to be accurate about how the rest of the world perceives them (in which case it might seem like a “bad stereotype of a spectrum kid” as you put it)
