/Game of Thrones/ entirely exists to keep Howard sastiated, I swear.

I'm still amused by the daughter of those retrovial servants from /Duumvirate/. Whose considered a tragedy because she's... nice. Because of self administered electroshock. Because that's the only way a child of Northberg wouldn't be a little shit. Even if they're being raised to be a servant.

Maybe I'll give the Mark Fictus thing a try after /The New Humans/... and a bunch of other projects.
