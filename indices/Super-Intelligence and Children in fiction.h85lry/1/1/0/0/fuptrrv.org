I think I might be the last person on the English speaking internet to have not read /Animorphs/. Ought to sometime. Thanks for the rec.

And Mark Fictus is the one thing from those reviews I'm still a little proud of. Or maybe just affectionate towards. I did honestly consider writing him an actual story, but aside from finding better uses of my time than writing hate-fic for obscure web-serials, the amount of world building it'd take to make things vaguely make sense would be enourmous.

...Actually, maybe that's a reason I /should/ do it.

Just a note, I admire your honesty. It was years before I could even begin to acknowledge my dumbass creationist kid phase.

(My otherwise lovely student's aid gifted me a stack of Creation Magazine back issues, another things authors should remember about kids, they're eager as fuck to believe what nice seeming adults telll them)

Actually, you know what characters I was consistently engaged with even as I was hate reading Duumvirate? Sarah and Paul. I bet there's a timeline next door where the book was called /Sarah and Paul/ and was some great dystopian satire.

Wait, Billy and Howard ended with a supposedly universial plague being unleashed on the Earth...

Did Mark bribe the Operator to bump it down to Covid 19?
