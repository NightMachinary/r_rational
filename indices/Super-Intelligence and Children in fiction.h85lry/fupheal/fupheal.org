  Usually they tend to either read like the author has never met a child (gifted or otherwise)

I'd rather say that the point of those fics is to portrait a special super-gifted child which reader has never met. Potraying gifted children in those fics like the common real-life gifted children would defeat the purpose.

The whole point of fiction is to write about something that would most likely won't happen in real life.
