I always thought of Ender's Game as a better written twilight for teenage bookish boys

It's basically a wish fullfillment character. Despite being a child, he is one of the most intelligent and thoughtful people in the series. Other people are unconsciously intimated by his genius and are uncomfortable around him.

To be honest, I don't like super intelligent protagonists, even less when they are children. Since the author isn't super intelligent themselves it always comes across as silly or cringy to me.

In the fiction I read(rational or otherwise), I like smart characters but who are believed smart. Character thought processes should be grounded in reality.
