Oh, a fellow /Billy and Howard/ survivor! And my God, you actually read that let's read? Back when I was trying to do the "reviewer character" thing in text? I apologize in advance.

Also, /Billy and Howard/ reminds me of another good point: age groups are a thing. Billy and Howard don't act like ten year olds, or even preteens, they're more like sixteen year olds. A lot of authors treat childhood and adulthood as some kind of binary switch rather than a process. A nine year old will behave a bit differently from a twelve year old, that sort of thing.
