I've always thought that Ender's game is very good writing, but very bad in terms of the morals and lessons it teaches, and what you wrote here is a good start for putting into words as to why.

My previous explanation of why I thought so was sort of vaguely gesturing towards the degree of wish-fulfillment and glorification of killing your childhood bully (maybe it's just me, but I know that when I was a kid, I would /often/ fantasize about the day when my childhood bully would finally do something that would /justify/ bashing his head in without moral censure...that wasn't a /good/ part of me, that wanted that, but it is a part that loved Ender's Game) and the benevolent sexism treatment of valentine and petra, but that explanation is more just pointing out gotchas than really tackling the fundamental issues.
