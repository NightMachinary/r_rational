I guess the problem in my eyes was that I was just waiting for the right excuse to unleash the violence. What my bully would do is "accidentally" hurt me by slamming into me or kicking when my teacher was close enough to notice any retaliation. There was always just enough plausible deniability that I wouldn't really be /justified/ in gauging out his little eyeballs. I can see an alternate timeline where one or both of us was seriously hurt. Had that come to pass, I think we'd be worse off for it.

I actually did hurt someone, once. He had made a (to him, harmless) joke about my mother but there were cultural differences that I didn't fully understand at the time, which made me interpret it as a serious offence. It was definitely wrong of me to do that. Why did I hit him and not my bully? He was actually bigger and stronger than my bully. Because he crossed a (to me) clear line whereas by pretending it was an accident each time, the bully kept his actions just ambiguous enough to keep me confused as to what the right response was. And also because talking about my mother seemed like a worse offence than hitting me at the time. I had not really integrated into American culture at the time and I processed things in a way that made that insult very deep.

I don't think the /entire/ instinct is wrong (like if a /real/ scenario where I needed to defend myself or others were to occur) but I think there's something wrong with the mindset of "once there is sufficient cause, release maximum and lethal force" and that's Ender's game's lesson.
