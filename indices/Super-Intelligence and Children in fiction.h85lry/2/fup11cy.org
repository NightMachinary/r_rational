The students in David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest are pretty good. The main character is a hyper-literate tennis phenom that has a marijuana problem; however, his classmates aren't slouches either, and there's a lot of interesting interactions at their tennis academy that happens to have a comically stringent academic curriculum.

That being said, the reason all the children sound smart in Infinite Jest is because they're a reflection of DFW's authorial voice, who himself was a kind of young-gun literary genius. So I guess writing interesting super-intelligent children is easier if you're pretty super-intelligent yourself, heh.
