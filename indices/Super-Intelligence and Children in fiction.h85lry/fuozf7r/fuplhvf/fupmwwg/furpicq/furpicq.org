Are you sure it wasn't a good part of you? I worry that, even though it's ugly, you'd have been worse off not having it. Pride and ego and self-righteousness are important to have in moderation. Fantasizing about violence doesn't seem necessarily bad. You've got those instincts because they were adaptive for your ancestors, throwing them away, rather than wrangling them into check, would probably have unfortunate side-effects.
