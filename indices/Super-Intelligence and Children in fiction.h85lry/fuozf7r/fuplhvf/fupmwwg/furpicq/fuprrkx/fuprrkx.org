  My previous explanation of why I thought so was sort of vaguely gesturing towards the degree of wish-fulfillment and glorification of killing your childhood bully

That's definitely part of it too. For me it was more that I wished I had the aggressiveness to lash successfully out at all, not necessarily that I had the excuse to escalate to lethal violence but that's part of it, yeah. Another aspect is that key authority figures know about the bullying and intentionally allow it to happen for ambiguous purposes... that felt true to my experiences as well, even if the adults weren't literally watching on a monitor they would still say stuff like school is necessary for socialization or boys will be boys or other crap...
