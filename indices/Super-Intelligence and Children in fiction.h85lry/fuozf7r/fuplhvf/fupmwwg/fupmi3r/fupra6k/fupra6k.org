Sorry if this is getting off topic, but this is my first time running into someone talking about Billy and Howard... So some background on my reading of Duumvirate and Billy and Howard: I was in the 9th or 10th grade (can't remember for sure), I had just discovered TV Tropes, and I was a Fundamentalist Christian. Like a Young Earth Creationist, the Rapture is imminent, Satan is real and active in the world, America is fundamentally good but not Christian enough, Republicans are good but not Christian enough, Homosexuality is a choice and a sin, Fundamentalist Christian. I still read and enjoyed things completely outside my rigid worldview... I guess I believed that untrue things couldn't really hurt me. I would just kind of mentally sort it out and label what I thought wasn't acceptable to my worldview and and try to filter it out. So for a book like A Wrinkle In Time I would mentally label as new age heresy. (This book had the gall to suggest that Jesus was equivalent to Leonardo Da Vinci or Buddha, which I viewed a subtle trap to trick the reader into accepting a diminished view of Jesus).

So Billy and Howard was interesting because it was so direct in violating what I considered "right" and my worldview that I could read it without putting much effort into filtering it. It's also interesting because of how much it aligned and confirmed my worldview. Like obviously all non-Christians are just a hair's breadth away from being violent cannibalistic rapists, Slicer is just being honest about it unlike all the other non Christian authors. (I wouldn't have literally said this or consciously believed this, but subconsciously the sentiment was there). It also lines up with the cynical sort of a view a teenage can develop when they believe Satan is manipulating everything in the world and that all non-Christian media might be a trap or manipulation. Slicer's world-building puts forward a world in which that is true in the literal materialistic sense in the form of the Illuminati using Barney as a brainwashing tool for the masses.

For all that it served to fuel confirmation bias in my Fundamentalist mindset, in a way, I think Billy and Howard might have helped me... in it's directness it bypassed my filters. It kind of shows how a worldview like what I held is nihilistic and empty for all the purported joy I was taught to believe Christianity was full of.

So I found your let's read later in life when I revisited Billy and Howard and I was looking for a critical analysis. Despite its well put together TV Tropes page, I couldn't find any analysis or discussion of it. Your let's read, as short as it was, pointed out stuff I had missed because I was distracted by the shocking edginess of it. For instance, the low-key and not so low-key racism (in my high school years I was dumb enough to buy the right-wing idea that MLK had already succeeded and thus racism was mostly dead), the flaws in world building, the logical fallacies in Howard's exposition. My head canon for it now is that Howard was the puppet of the technocratic faction within the Illuminati and that the the Operator intentionally allowed for flaws such as Howard's over-sensitivity to stimuli and tendency to sunburn in order to make Howard biased in favor of his "wipe humanity out plan". The Wizard as a character was kind of stupid, but I actually enjoyed your Mark Fictus bits and your take on Sarah. Mark's adventures as he tries to unironically make the best TV shows possible and navigate an insane organization sound interesting.

Back to your main topic... The age groups divide is an interesting point. Like HPMOR Harry would be pretty reasonable as a 14-19 year old, Draco makes sense to me as a racist 12-15 year old who has been taught shoddy life hacks by his racist father and is being confronted with the problems in his world view for the first time. I think that is something a lot of authors miss in their child characters.

Another thing you got me thinking of now is that many authors fail to capture the changes in perspective with age that child characters go through. Like it's possible to swing from one perspective on life in elementary school to a more nuanced, but still flawed, opposite perspective in middle school and then back again in high school. I'm having a hard time thinking of children's books outside coming of age stories that do this well... I guess Katniss's perspective in Hunger Games shifts around a bit from just protecting herself and her family, to thinking of the district as a whole to thinking of all the districts. And her development of a more nuanced perspective. Thinking of Susan Collins, I guess Gregor the Overlander has a bit of development of perspective in how he learns about the different under land races and goes back and forth on how meaningful the prophecies actually are.

I thought of another book series for your consideration. The Animorphs characters aren't marketed or portrayed or meant to be super-intelligent, but given that they engage in guerilla warfare against an alien race and keep trying things and disrupting and plotting, I think they actually do partially qualify as super-intelligent at least in the narrow area of morph-based guerilla warfare... So I guess the lesson there is that if you write several dozen books you can gradually and smoothly develop your child character's abilities until they are hyper competent and it feels natural and earned.
