  Ought to sometime. Thanks for the rec.
#+end_quote

I'll qualify the rec... a lot of the books in the middle of the series were ghost written, to the point that some characters are completely out of characters or exaggerated. Some of the spin-off books with time travel are completely superfluous, while others of the spin-offs are among the best books in the series. There are probably good reading guides out there, but off the top of my head... I can personally recommend as good the first 20 or so books and the last 2-4 of the main series, the Hork-Bajir Chronicles and Visser. I never got around to reading them but apparently The Ellimist Chronicles and the Andalite Chronicles are good. The Megamorph's have some interesting worldbuilding for fanfic writers but I'm not sure how good they are.

  I did honestly consider writing him an actual story, but aside from finding better uses of my time than writing hate-fic for obscure web-serials, the amount of world building it'd take to make things vaguely make sense would be enourmous.

The setting is generic enough you could file off the serial numbers and do some world building and you'd have an original setting. It worked for 50 Shades author and it worked for the Mortal Instruments author, and those both started as fanfic writers for major series (Twilight and Harry Potter). The Illuminati is a staple of a lot of fiction, so you can keep that. You can put your own touches by playing up or down the hidden technology, figuring out what the Illuminati actually does and intends to achieve, maybe add in some occult magic... you'll have an original setting in no time.

  Wait, Billy and Howard ended with a supposedly universial plague being unleashed on the Earth...
#+end_quote

It was multiple simultaneously plagues, the Operator mentioned he had a hard time balancing fatality rate and spread... Maybe Paul actually did put together a plan to betray Billy's and Howard's plan together with Sarah and Mark. But... the operator wouldn't be bribed, he was the one to suggest the idea in the first place. But plenty of other Illumantis, as evil as they are, recognize they need normals in their supply chain, enjoy lording it over the normals, or actually have some faint trace of morality. So together they release a less lethal plagues. In response the global population goes into quarantine, preventing the Operator's ultra lethal super plagues from spreading. Paul and Sarah avoid blame by making sure the existence of their secret Chinese lab that produced COVID-19 is labeled as 'normal-directed misinformation', and thus Billy and Howard automatically disbelieve any of the evidence brought to them about Paul/Sarah/Mark's treachery. With COVID-19 disrupting the release of new video games and movies, Billy and Howard realize they need "the normals" after all, "Illuminated-only" media doesn't exist in sufficient quantity (or if we are being honest, quality) to satisfy Billy and Howard's needs. Billy and Howard put the plan on hold onto Illuminated entertainment catches up, the Operator and his faction stew in misanthropic hatred, and Mark races to further raise up the quality and quantity of "normal" media in order to stall Billy and Howard's doomsday plans almost indefinitely.
