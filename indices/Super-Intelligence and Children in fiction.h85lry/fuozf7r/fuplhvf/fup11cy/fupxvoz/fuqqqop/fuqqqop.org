Depends on how you define doing it well. My favorite super-intelligent children story is probably *The Promised Neverland*. It is absolutely not realistic, but it does do a couple things well.

First, we see the thought processes of the kids from time to time, and I consider this to be one of the most important parts of writing intelligent characters in general. Seeing the reasoning process of supposedly intelligent characters is important to lending the depiction a degree of authenticity, in my opinion.

Second, different kids have different /types/ of intelligence. This is something I tend to find sorely lacking in terms of depicting intelligent characters in fiction in general. In most books, intelligence is treated as binary, whereas in the real world there are often people who have different characteristics that could be defined as forms of intelligence (e.g. memory, spacial reasoning, arithmetic, verbal intelligence, etc.)

Third, the kids are still fallible. They're out-maneuvered both by other kids and adults on multiple occasions. Also, in terms of the kids, it's not like one kid is always the "winner" in their schemes - different kids come out on top in different situations.

That being said, there are still some tropes of Hollywood intelligence in there that I find grating, especially in terms of some of the ultra-young kids outside of the main cast being way too aware for their age (Phil is probably the worst example of this).
