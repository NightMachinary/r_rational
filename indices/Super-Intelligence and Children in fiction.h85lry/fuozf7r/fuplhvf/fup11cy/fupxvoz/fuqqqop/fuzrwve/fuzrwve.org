It is a very subdued example, but I think *Hatchet* qualifies. The protagonist is a young boy who survives in North American wilderness thanks only to his thinking skills as young rationalist/pragmatist. He is not a super-genius, but I would consider him "peak-kid rationalist", because the problems he defeats with clear methodical thinking would defeat most adults.
