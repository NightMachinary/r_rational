Admittedly I view those books through inch thick rose-tinted glasses (Even with Rowling's rapid descent into a nastier George Lucas) but I think she grasped the "inner voice" and behaviour of kids pretty well, and aged their perspective appropriately. Harry in particular I think is a lot more distinct than people give him credit for.
