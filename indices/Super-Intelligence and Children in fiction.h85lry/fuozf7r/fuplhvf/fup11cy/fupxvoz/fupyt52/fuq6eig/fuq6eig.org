Just read your username, are you the guy from spacebattles who did a lets read of HPMOR?

Anyway, I don't think there's anything neccesarily wrong with wish fullfillment. Every story has at least some level of it, at the end of the day we are reading stories to be entertained.

I just think that it has to be balanced by other elements as well. The reason I don't really like super intelligent protagonists is because the story often treats intelligence like magic. It makes conflicts often too boring for me.

Same thing goes for superintelligent children protagonists. Combine the difficulty of writing super intelligent characters with the difficulty of writing children characters and you don't often get a great result.

There are some examples though. Wildbow's fantastic Ward, Twig, and now Pale have really well written child characters, some superbly written child genius characters even.
