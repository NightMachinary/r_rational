  I always thought of Ender's Game as a better written twilight for teenage bookish boys

Side note, I feel people are a little harsh on wish fufilment. It serves a purpose, especially for kids. It can be problematic, sure, but done right, it can be both inclusive (in the sense that it bouys more than /one/ kind of reader, and not to the exclusion of others) and genuinely uplifting.

...Will say Ender's Game misses the mark a bit.
