Lots. Gobs. It was a going thing well before that.

I got on the ARPAnet in 1978 and by 1983 was providing free tech support for this guy who knew a guy at a local hospital to get a full Usenet feed piggybacked on their feed. There was also Fidonet and local bulletin boards in the ‘70s. The earliest SF I can think of with online flame wars was mid ‘70s.

Most techy SF writers were already on the Internet and fa.sf-lovers on Usenet by the early ‘80s, because people already online were happy to provide them free connections. I'm sure that included Asprin. It was so straight from actual online discussion. Except so enlightened because he turned Ender into a mary sue.
