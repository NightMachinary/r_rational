One thing to note about /The Promised Neverland/ that makes me really appreciate its intelligent children characters where I might otherwise roll my eyes is that it actually has an in-story reason for the kids being super smart, and even better, this reason is intrinsically tied to the plot rather than being bolted on after-the-fact. (anime spoilers) The kids are selectively bred for their intelligence (manga spoilers) and this has been going on for like 1000 years or something

Also, besides being really smart, they still behave like, you know, kids. They like to run around in the field and play tag, and so on.
