I think you're overoptimistic when you suggest a committee is no smarter than the median member.

Piet Hein wrote a grook about committees, I don't recall the whole thing but the last two lines are telling:

#+begin_quote
  /Intelligence makes a difference/

  /But stupidity makes a sum./
#+end_quote

One thing that might help would be to weight people's votes by whether choices taken where they voted with the majority had positive or negative outcomes, kind of like the classic matchbox tic-tac-toe engine.
