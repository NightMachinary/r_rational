  I'm not sure bandwagons are an inherent weakness of hiveminds.

Agreed. In fact,

  The choice of action at each point is decided by plurality vote.

is only sometimes true. Various other voting systems are used. You can't completely get around [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem][Arrow's impossibility theorem]], but you can still do a much better job than plurality vote.

E.g. [[/r/rational]] darling /The Erogamer/ uses a combination of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting][ranked voting]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting][approval voting]] - and sometimes combines multiple high-ranked options. Strategic voting is far less rewarded (and, at any rate, requires too much calculation for readers to bother with).

 

It's worth noting that in many quests, long-term strategising doesn't bring much benefit /to the readers/.

Sure, the character has a strong preference for a certain long-term goal (say, taking over the world). But a /reader/ might only have very mild long-term preferences, with much stronger preferences for some kinds of scenes (say, banter) over others.

Why pick the smart long-term world-conquering option when you could have a banter scene right now? The "I have successfully taken over the world" scene would be sweet, but not so sweet as to be worth the sacrifice. Plus the questmaster is clearly aiming for that scene, so it'll probably happen eventually anyway.

And since opportunities to banter come pretty much at random, there's no point in doing long-term planning to maximise /that/ either. You just vote "banter" whenever the option shows up.

(I once again present /The Erogamer/ as an example.)

 

Sorry for only addressing the specific case of quests rather than your higher-level question. Well, this /is/ [[/r/rational]].
