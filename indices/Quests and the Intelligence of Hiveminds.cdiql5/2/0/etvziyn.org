I'm aware that misaligned incentives is a problem with quests. I didn't address it because:

#+begin_quote
  (hiveminds largely populated by less competent individuals would have many other problems to deal with, but they're not as interesting as the problems that persist even in the best case scenario)
#+end_quote

It may be cheeky to file away a player base whose incentives aren't perfectly aligned with the goals of the quest as less than competent, but after covering bandwagoning, I realised that there were other problems with quests as practiced that didn't seem to be inherent problems and thus I didn't find them as interesting as the kind of problems that persisted when we had an ideal player base.

That said I would look at other forms of voting. I was wondering that stuff like ranked choice would make the voting process more complex (especially if write in plans are accepted, it may become cumbersome), but perhaps the higher threshold for voting would incentivise more intelligent behaviour. I'm now thinking of a three part voting period.

- A discussion period in which no votes are cast nor plans proposed that lasts several hours.
- A plan proposal period in which plans are proposed but not voted on (plans can also be discussed and refined further) that also lasts several hours. No plans can be voted on during this period.
- A voting period in which players rank the plans. Only voting takes place in this period (one could raise the threshold of investment by requiring players to rank all plans, but if a sufficiently large number of plans are proposed this would become cumbersome).
