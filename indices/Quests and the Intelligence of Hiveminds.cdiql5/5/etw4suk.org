I don't really even understand how this is applicable to quests.

Hive mind video games yes.

But the vast majority of quests don't have failure states. The authors are having fun and so are the audience. There are rarely "best" choices. Whatever choice you choose something will occur and when does that something mean game over no more content ever?

The long term is vastly discounted because the voters don't even know if they'll bother reading future updates. Even if there was only a single individual voting almost everything you say would still apply.

I can't trust that my future self is going to want to keep reading, I can't trust that the author will keep producing content, etc.

Why not look into the video game community? Which can and do commit to longterm plans, especially with small numbers of people. As the game progresses interest dies down and similarly minded people continue the process.

Look into twitch plays pokemon and all the thousands of clones of that.
