The OP's comments refer to a collective of humans, organized in a particular way. I'm curious how things would turn out for 1) a group of competent players, 2) who hold an election*, 3) some other system where votes are weighted, probably by past performance (which requires the group to keep track/spell out their goals, etc.).

*This is one way of fixing the commitment problem. The obvious objection in practice would probably be the impacts on fun-ness. Coming up with ways to make a "hivemind"/group more effective while still fun would probably be necessary for the method to actually be adopted. The actual issue might be entirely due to things being not taken seriously though.
