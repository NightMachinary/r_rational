It amuses/frustrates me that you think Quests would be "better" if the posters always made the absolute bestest, most smartest, most well-informed decisions. I completely disagree.

Stories are built on characters being idiots. On making mistakes. On failing to think ahead. On being flawed, and limited, and buffeted by desires they may only be dimly aware of. Frankly, I find characters' weaknesses vastly more interesting than their strengths, because that's where drama lies.

You are not treating Quests like an exercise in collaborative storytelling. You are treating them like an engineering problem. You are trying to optimise away the drama. As far as I'm concerned, having a Quest protagonist make stupid decisions, despite having the intelligence of a whole crowd of spectators driving them, is the system working as intended.

Because stories where the protagonist always makes the right choices, and comes out of every conflict on top, /are fucking boring./
