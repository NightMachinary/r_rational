A running list of goals and how they are valued seems like it would encourage people to also consider the long term.

  I'm not really sure how to counter it. Possibly some sort of a trust vote (ie I temporarily imbue X with my vote). Possibly a pre-planning exercise where people vote on long term plans to pursue.

I can imagine each update of a quest having a short period where people simply vote on which longer term goals and strategies are more important to them, after which there is a short moratorium on voting to come up with a plan with the goals in mind, and then a vote on which plan to follow.
