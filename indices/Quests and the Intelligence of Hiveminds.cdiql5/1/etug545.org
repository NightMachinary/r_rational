I've definitely noticed the 'Greedy Algorithm' tendency, particularly in acquisition of power. It does make sense to grab short term benefit, especially when you can't rely upon your future decisions to follow through on long term plans. It's a downside of democracy that's been apparent in real life. One administration can start a long term project, but quite often it gets cancelled by the next administration before it is finished.

I've also noticed it in a game I played a long time ago called CyberNations. The democratic alliances were considered unreliable by other alliances because the people in charge would change regularly. Of course that also helped sometimes -- the new leaders could easily brush off past animosities or conflicts with a "that was the old administration." Nearly all the rest were run by relatively few high effort members who also tended to bring a lot of history with each other (good and bad) to the table.

I'm not really sure how to counter it. Possibly some sort of a trust vote (ie I temporarily imbue X with my vote). Possibly a pre-planning exercise where people vote on long term plans to pursue.
