But it's also limited by the fact that votes are voluntarily brought up by people, an expert uncertain of the right thing to do in the situation, is trumped by anyone who puts together any vote at all. It also implies that more manpower is a virtue rather than an impediment, what you're describing sounds more appropriate when speaking of a committee whose members are chosen for their expertise rather than anyone who chooses to do so. There's kind of the larger problem not necessarily of bandwagon-ing but that some people can explain their vote in a more convincing way even if the vote isn't the best one available.
