Iterative Score Voting would fix most all issues and is fairly streamlined (certainly more so than any ranked system).

1) Each person proposes a plan (no discussion needed)\\
2) Show of fingers to score each plan 0-10\\
3) Each person proposes amended version of the highest scored plan\\
4) Show of fingers to score each plan plus the highest scored plan\\
5) Repeat 3)/4) until highest scored plan outscores all amended ones

No discussion needed so it harder for bandwagons to occur.

I believe the iterative nature helps with long-term planning, the voting process itself is longer-term, and iteration helps amend any strategic flaws and short-termism in the plan.

The only amendment to the procedure I might make is to try the procedure out a few times, then propose multiple amendments to the procedure and run them through the iterated score voting procedure until the iterated score voting procedure produces the optimal version of the iterated score voting procedure.

Hopefully, this doesn't result in a recursive self-improvement process that leads iterated score voting procedure to acquire runaway super-intelligence, but if one does emerge I think it's best it be made of people.

Iterative Score Voting also opens an avenue for something better than reputational weighting. Forecasting skill weighting!

Each plan's total score is an independent event, so forecasting each plan's total score is a prediction that can be made and immediately checked for accuracy.

Forecasting a plan's total score and forecasting a plan's value should correlate highly relative to anything else you could test.

If you then bias the vote toward good total-score-forecasters you should get higher forecasted-value plans winning.

Its also possible a training effect will occur. Getting rapid feedback on your forecasting skill should allow you to improve it, and thus improve your skill at forecasting other things like how valuable each plan would prove to be.

It's similar to how accurately assessing your confidence in your answer is closely tied to your ability to predict what percentage other answerers would give the same answer.
