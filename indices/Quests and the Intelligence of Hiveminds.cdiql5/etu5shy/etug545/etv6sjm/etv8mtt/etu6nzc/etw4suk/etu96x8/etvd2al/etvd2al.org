Quests are often intelligent in highly specific ways but are just as often extremely blind to potential problems and focused on short term gains, especially those which are 'rational' quests. Quest participants specifically do not form a true hivemind. They are a group of different people with different motivations and different desires. They may collectively choose a course of action, but that is not the same thing as being a hivemind.
