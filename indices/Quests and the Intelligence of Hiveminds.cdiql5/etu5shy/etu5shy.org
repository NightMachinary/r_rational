There's a YouTube video out there about [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pUA3LsEaw]["why corporations aren't AIs"]] that's relevant to the topic, but I can't find it right now.

The basic thesis is that a committee is sort of like an intellectual harness. If you have a bunch of people pulling on a cart, the cart can never go faster than the fastest person. Similarly, a committee can never be smarter than the smartest person in it.

And that's completely ignoring the fact that there's an efficiency loss in having to coordinate all those people.
