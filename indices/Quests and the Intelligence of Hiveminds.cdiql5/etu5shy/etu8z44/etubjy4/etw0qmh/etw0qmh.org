I think the cart metaphor might not work very well. Unless you're trying to demonstrate that many people can do work that no one person could alone, I suppose.

I think the biggest advantage of group decision making is that the ability of the group to spot potential blunders or optimizations is additive and far better than any individual, assuming all the individuals (or most of them) in the group are willing to listen to productive suggestions of that nature and alter course accordingly. That is a very big presumption, but if it's not the case then you do not have a good selection of people for making group decisions.
