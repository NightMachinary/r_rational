The cart metaphor doesnt work.

It's almost the 50th anniversary of the Apollo moon landings. The decision making and engineering thought behind those massive machines was done by a large group of people in under a decade. There were smart people, sure, but not one of them could have even come close to the cumulative centuries of thought, testing, and analysis that were performed by the thousands of people involved in the project. A solitary individual couldn't even get past the "gather background information" stage. They'd be hard-pressed to read just the executive summaries of the reams of reports that were produced, much less make good decisions on them.
