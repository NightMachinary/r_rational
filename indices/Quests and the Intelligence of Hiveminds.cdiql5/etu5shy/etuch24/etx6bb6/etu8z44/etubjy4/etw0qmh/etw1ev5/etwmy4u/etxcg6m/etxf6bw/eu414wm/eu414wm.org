For strategic competence? Garry Kasparov beat a team of 50,000 people at Chess (4 Chess stars were selected to provide the group with guidance) and they had computer assistance. I don't think collective intelligences (at least those who use plurality vote as the decision mechanism) are significantly superior in strategic competence to their most competent members.
