The Forge of Destiny / Threads of Destiny quests have a Math Cabal that meets on Discord, and a lot of times they have determined the best choice ahead of time, and usually their choice wins the vote.

That quest also has an automatic 2 hour wait before anyone can vote, which also helps foster discussion.
