we dont know the whole mechanic. Some people say that if you kill a human thats level5 its the same way as if you had killed a monster of level5. We know that stats from killing a lair are transferable like that. So its somewhat safe to assume that the same goes for level.

Another theory i have seen is that it only works if you killed the person just after they killed a blue.

Personally i would prefer if killing a human would count the same as killing a monster, would just kinda make sense if its transferable
