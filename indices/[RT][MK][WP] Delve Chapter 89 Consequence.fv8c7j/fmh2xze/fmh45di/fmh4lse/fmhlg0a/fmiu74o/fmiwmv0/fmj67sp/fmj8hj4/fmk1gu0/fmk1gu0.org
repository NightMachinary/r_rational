The best info we've got is that a blue's "essence should transfer, as long as it's been less than a day." Presumably if it's been more than a month, the essence won't transfer or it's a very small chance.

Then again their understanding of essence is incomplete, since they're very worried about making sure everybody gets a hit in, when Rain managed to get his essence from a 0% contribution fight. It's possible it still transfers (at a lower chance maybe?), but we don't have any indication that's the case.
