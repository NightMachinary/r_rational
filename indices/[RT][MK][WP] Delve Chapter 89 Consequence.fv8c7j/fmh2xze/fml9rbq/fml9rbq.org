I'm a patron so I've read ahead and I can answer this question.

You are 100% correct about the specific individuals. We aren't sure about the Guild yet. There's a couple of +Guards+ Watch left, the senior of whom is actually reasonable. Also, Lord Rill is dead. He was Velika's aristocrat 2IC and the only one with the skills, resources and desire to keep things running.
