Well, there goes my hope they were going to go Delve.

I liked Rain's talk with Velika. He's still so bad at talking to people with power. Every one of those conversations has him beaten him up, almost killed, or treated like a potential mass murderer. I imagine it's his otherworlder instincts, and that anyone who'd grown up in this world would much more viscerally understand that people can kill you in a flash of anger.
