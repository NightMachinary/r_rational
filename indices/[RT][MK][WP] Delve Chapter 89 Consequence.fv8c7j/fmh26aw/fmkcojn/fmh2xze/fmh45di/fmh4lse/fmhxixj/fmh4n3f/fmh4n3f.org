Exactly. IIRC, Westbridge was basically outvoted on putting her in charge. Not sure what the rest were thinking, but I think one of them might have been a family member (aunt or mom?). I think Westbridge just wants her dead and not get directly blamed for it. As far as the city goes, Westbridge probably thinks it's better for it to be destroyed than in the hands of the empire.
