Westbridge cares about exactly one thing: keeping the teleport platform in Fel Sadanis out of the hands of the Empire of Adamant.

The rest of it is just a sideshow to his main goal. He had to get /someone/ elected citizen in order to justify the way he intervened in the city, and it just so happened that Velika's aunt was pushing for her to be elevated.

He doesn't think Velika would make a good Citizen (because there was a good chance she'd literally do what she did in this chapter), but he was willing to ignore that in order to achieve the greater strategic goal of denying the teleport platform to his enemy without permanently destroying it.
