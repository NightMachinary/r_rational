My best guess is that he wanted someone else to be Citizen Fel Sadanis and set Velika up for failure so that she'd have to be replaced.

EDIT: Seems more complex than that. From chapter 74:

  “You still think it's a good idea? Trapping her in there all alone?”

  Westbridge looked at the gray-haired Citizen placidly, considering his response. Citizen Jarro was an archer, a real mage-killer as he recalled. The man had been in the Guild, though, so that meant he had mostly hunted monsters, not men. There was no sign of that past now. He wasn't even carrying a weapon, the burdens of leadership leaving his face lined and weary. As worn as the old archer looked, Westbridge had to admit that the man did know how to run a city. The common folk loved him, even if he was unpopular with the other Citizens.

  *“We cannot trust her yet,” Westbridge said finally. “If she survives the month, I will return and allow her access through the barrier.* Until then, Fel Sadanis will remain completely sealed to everyone.”

  Jarro grinned. “What if you die before that? Who'll lower the barrier? What are you, like a hundred?”

  Westbridge snorted. “You are one to talk,” he said mildly. Jarro had already been old when he'd joined the DKE, and that had been years ago. “The barrier will remain, even should I die. Theoretically, someone could access the barrier stone to lower it, but there is no one within that bubble with the necessary skill to operate the artifact. It takes a true mage. Either way, it is a pointless discussion. I am not going to die. *The objective has been accomplished. Whether Velika succeeds or fails in her duty, it matters not.* The city will remain sealed.”

So he doesn't care whether she lives or dies. I don't know how he thinks he's going to avoid repercussions if she lives, or why exactly he wants to force her to try to manage totally alone for a month. Maybe it's about isolating her from some other plot for that month?
