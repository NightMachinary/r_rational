Westbridge didn't put her in charge. The citizens as a collective did. He was just the one to take the city. It's pure politics in regard to who Citizen Sadanis is. Velika is first time a family has had two citizens and Westbridge would rather his own candidate be Citizen Sadanis. If he traps Velika and waits for her to make a mess of things he can get her replaced.
