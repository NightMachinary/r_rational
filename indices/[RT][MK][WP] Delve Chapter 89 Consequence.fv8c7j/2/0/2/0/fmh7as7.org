Velika's relative is her aunt, Citizen Kallias.

I concur that Westbridge doesn't really care what happens to her. I think he does care about the city though, if only to keep the barrier up. It sounds like those relics can't/won't be destroyed, so a lone teleporter platform is just as bad as a city fully captured by the empire.

He expects to be back a month after and for it to survive, and frankly people might have already started to die en-mass if it weren't for Rain.
