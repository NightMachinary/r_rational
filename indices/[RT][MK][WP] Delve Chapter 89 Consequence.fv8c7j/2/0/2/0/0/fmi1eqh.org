I think it was mentioned that attempts to relocate teleporter platforms in the past have destroyed them.

The DKE was probably afraid that Fel-Sadanis wouldn't destroy its teleporter platform, for economic reasons, and just roll over for the Empire.

The Watch and Guild are technically neutral, so, really, who could have been in place in the city and motivated to destroy the platform? I'd argue nobody. Maybe a silver ranker in the Watch, but it would be to the detriment of the people they were trying to protect so that would be a bit of a hard sell without more information.
