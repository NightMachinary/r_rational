Since the virtual humans outnumber the reality humans millions to one it's a bit like the US not having proper mental health treatment for schizophrenia. The extra deaths of 159 kinda weird people isn't a massive priority compared to the lives of 318 million. And these 159 people are taking up a quarter of the budget.

It's sad but you can understand the morality. The ability for an extra hundred million people to be able to live is more important than 159 schizos.

It'd be nicer if some compromise was reached but in terms of ratios if you don't think about people with mental health issues dying as a serious issue as weighty as genocide 1/2 million humans dying isn't a huge moral concern for most humans.

Edit. And so I feel that you can't rely on morality to dictate what should be done in these questions. You should instead ensure you have adequate weaponry and security instead. You can rely on others thinking "Killing people with no reason is bad." Not on them thinking "Killing a tiny minority for the good of the majority is bad."
