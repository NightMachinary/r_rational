I think the point wasn't to eat earth, but to eat the one-eight of the sun energy output that was allowing earth to exist.

"You can't take other people's stuff" is a nice guideline but it breaks down when stakes are high. I think it's intuitive that if, say, you have a starving child and you stole some food to feed them, that's excusable, if not right. Rules have exceptions; that's why they're not laws.
