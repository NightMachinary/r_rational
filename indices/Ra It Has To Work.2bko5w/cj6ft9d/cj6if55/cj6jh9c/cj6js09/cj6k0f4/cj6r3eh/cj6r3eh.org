  The obvious case if we ignore the person / possible person distinction is to take one rich person, hogging and wasting food, in a starving city. Surely taking the food away from him and distributing to the people dying of hunger is right.

The city isn't starving - all the other people are well-fed and happy. All indications are that the Virtuals are living the same kind of idyllic utopia lives that the Actuals were. So the only real argument is that there should be as many people as possible in the world, which I'm not sure that I agree with, since it would mean that maximizing population is de facto a good thing. And if the cost is genocide ... I'm just not seeing it as anything but an act of aggression. "You have stuff that we want" is not, to me, a morally valid reason to go to war.
