Consider the source, though. The only image of Virtuals we have is from the Reals, who themselves admit they don't understand Virtuals any more.

And the Reals are pretty much lotus eaters too, except much more wasteful. They lock down technology to avoid any kind of progress, and just sit in a static environment while watching the 'new humanity' re-do all the work, so that they can 'enjoy the /true/ human experience'. That's... Probably the same thing the least productive virtuals are doing? After all maximising happiness is not about flooding yourself with drugs; every uploaded person that's focusing on that is doing art, or re-discovering physics, or other similarly fulfilling tasks.

(and maybe most of them aren't doing real progress; though progress when the AI has 'solved' the world is difficult to define; but at worst they're the same as the reals, and the possibilities for actual productivity are greater - they could be planning to expand to other solar systems (or perhaps already have, and the reals just didn't notice), working on simulation efficiency, etc.)

Presumably at the point where the new humanity would actually become able of doing something new, the wheel would reset them in fear of them uploading again (since uploading lets one be much more productive).

As for being the ones to start the war, at /some/ point the wastefullness of Reals must become grating. It's like... Imagine you're in a food-constrained country, and must limit your population to a constant number, while the country next to you has thousands more arable land, but they insist on using it inefficiently. You could give them the new technology, and with no impact on their quality of life allow both you and them to increase population.

That's how I see the Reals' refusing to upload.
