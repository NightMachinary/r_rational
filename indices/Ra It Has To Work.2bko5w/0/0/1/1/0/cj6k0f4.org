Is it genocide if you can bring the people back later on and they'd be never-the-wiser? So it's basically just a couple months of torment.

And I dunno, even if it is genocide, if the scale of wasted resource is significant enough, surely it justifies the war? You're basically putting a billion existing people against orders of magnitude more of possible people, were they not so wasteful. Maybe possible people count less, but they aren't insignificant; if the ratio is big enough, the right thing to do is certainly to take the resources yourself.

The obvious case if we ignore the person / possible person distinction is to take one rich person, hogging and wasting food, in a starving city. Surely taking the food away from him and distributing to the people dying of hunger is right.
