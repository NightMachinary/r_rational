I don't have a lot of respect for the Virtuals, considering that they've been depicted as nothing more than lotus eaters. To me, that's not an acceptable end game for humanity. That's not even to mention the fact that they were the ones to fire the first shot in the war (assuming that's true). So basically, you're siding with a section of humanity that's decided genocide was the proper way of dealing with the fact that they want to have more fun.
