Is it bad that I'm cheering for the VR people (and thus Ra) most of the time?

I mean, sure, there's a couple billion people on the line here, but theres millions more 'frozen' in Ra's VR, and the resources these couple billion people are using could presumably host orders of magnitude more people if they were being used efficiently.
