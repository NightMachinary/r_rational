It depends heavily on what kind of society the Virtuals had in the beginning.

My interpretation was that the Virtuals were a bit similar to the Vile Offspring from Accelerando in that you can't really be sure what's happens in that world anymore because you can't comprehend any of it. So you can't be sure how worthwhile their lives are, if any. I think it's implied that in Accelerando capitalist competition eventually makes sentient beings obsolete inside the Dyson sphere.

Anyway, this is how Virtuals' society supposedly was:

  The new worlds would be tuned to whatever anybody could ask for, and to live in them would be as easy or as difficult as any human wanted. Rather than conquer the universe, they would write a fiction in which they had already conquered it. Infinite fun space.

If the rules of that VR society aren't perfectly thought out beforehand, then the fast pace of computation relative to normal life means that the rules are extrapolated to their logical conclusion and any selection effect in the original rules changes the nature of the beings very quickly. See [[http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html][this]] and [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/13/growing-children-for-bostroms-disneyland/][this]] about those kind of selection effects. This kind of selection effect could happen in "fun society" too, if the fun includes a lot of interaction and zero-sum games of significance (like status competition). For example it could turn out that the ultimate form of fun is to make others miserable by dominating them in games and these have to be real people because defeating pseudo-people is like loving pseudo-people who cannot love, e.g. pretty lame. So then people modify themselves to adapt to these game and so on. There could be lots of these kind of "unknowns" that hide in the system and would lead to nasty results if extrapolated to their logical conclusion. A "fun society" could optimize for many things we're not aware of and selection effect is not the only kind of development that could lead to unforeseen consequences.

So it depends on if their society was engireered this in mind (and in you can trust whoever engireered it, I'm not sure if I could trust Ra) or if it was allowed to grow organically. There's nothing bad about society growing organically but in this case you can't be sure what the end result is. I think the Virtuals probably were sentient, but in a vastly different way than humans and I can't be sure if their lives are really worthwhile so my best bet is to root for humans.
