Read it (and sequels) over the last few days. I enjoyed it there is some rational thinking used for healing and killing. The stories are somewhat small in scope and generally well written however don't go into them to be a piece of literature.

Overall its worth a read due to the simple writing and interesting plot that does not over reach.
