Okay.

I included the story, because while I wouldn't say it's rational fiction (although no one's really holding the Idiot Ball, just dealing with Outside-Context Problems), it does a really good job of coming up with novel ways to take advantage of telekinesis so weak that it's like a gentle nudge. How the main character Tarc munchkin his telekinesis and sensing heat into winning against multiple armed enemies makes for a very good cerebral thriller.

Also, the first book in the series is free. So I'm much more willing to endorse it in a separate post instead of just putting it in the Off-Topic Friday Thread, since the only 'price' is taking the time to read it and you can stop reading if it ever gets boring/unappealing.
