I should make a slight amendment, I think you'd get a better 'rationalised BTTF' using a normal!Marty doing his best. I didn't mean to say that writing a very different Marty would definitely make the whole thing worse, just less instantly recognisable. BTTF can still be a great setting for a rational exploration even with a different Marty. You do you your thing :-D
