Only in the last paragraph of writing this WIP did I realize that Marty was bootstrapping himself to rationality. It hasn't happened yet (in 1955) to Doc yet, because rational!Marty hasn't been able to teach him yet. I do think that the next segment to write will be a prologue corollary where rational!Doc reveals the DeLorean to 1985-Marty.

I don't think original Doc Brown has any neurological disorder. I do imply that he has bipolar disorder in my version when I reference bouts of mania when he works on some bizarre science project.

I do think that Doc Brown has schizotypal personality disorder. He's quirky, weird, and reclusive enough in a funny but non-threatening way. [[http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder]]
