I agree with everything you just said, but this fear/worry of mine is not a product of logic. It's a visceral fear of my most important ability to reason being corrupted and destroyed. So even though you made some things clearer about mental disorders, I still shy away from my fears.

However, since rationality is about learning to improve my decision making and mental behaviors, I'm taking classes in neuropsychology to learn more about how we can notice signs and deal with mental disorders. Wish me luck!

*For a final test, I should directly talk to sufferers of schizod-type disorders and Alzheimer's.
