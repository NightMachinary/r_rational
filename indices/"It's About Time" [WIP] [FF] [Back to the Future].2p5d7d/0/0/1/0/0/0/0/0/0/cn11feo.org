Might be a better idea to talk to people with more mild disorders first before talking to those who experience anything as severe as full-blown hallucinations or delusions. I strongly suspect that people with more mild mental disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and ADHD will seem more "normal" on first impression and that will make it easier to relate to them and learn how they cope without getting overwhelmed by pity/horror/fear of "if it had been me"/etc. Not to mention, full blown hallucinations and delusions are probably much harder to work around, although I'm sure psychiatric meds help with that. Although I have yet to see a known example of a rationalist with schizophrenia, it seems like something that should be possible in principle, although I think it would be a lot more difficult. Also, as far as I know, it is possible to live with and work around Alzheimer's, though only in the beginning stages. Since it's the gradual destruction of one's entire brain, it's probably one of the mental disorders if not THE mental disorder that fits your fear level perfectly.

So if you have an irrationally inflated fear of mental disorder in general and you're trying to fix that by making the fear become proportional to how harmful a disorder is, then starting with Alzeheimer's is a /bad idea/.

Also, something I should probably point out is that just as some severe mental disorders can become mere nuisances with the right treatment, some mere nuisances can become severe with a lack of or the wrong treatment.

I would suggest starting off by talking to people who, aside from their disorder(s) and the direct effects thereof, seem normal in every other way. You've already talked to one, so you can check off "mild autism" and "ADHD". :P

Also, my mother's a psychiatrist, so if you have any questions that I don't already know the answer to and if Googling the answer isn't sufficient, then I can ask her for you.
