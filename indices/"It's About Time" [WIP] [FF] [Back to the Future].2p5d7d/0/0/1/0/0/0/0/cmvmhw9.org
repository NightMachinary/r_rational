Mental disorders are not all equally harmful. Some are significantly less severe than others. There are mental disorders that are catastrophic, and then there are mental disorders that are mere nuisances. The former is a lot scarier, the latter you can learn to live with and work around. And "disconnected from reality" in the sense that you seem to be talking about, or psychosis, is not a symptom of all cases of mental disorder. One example of a mental disorder I can think of that does not include psychosis as a symptom is Obsessive Compulsive disorder. I can see why the more impactful and less treatable disorders are so frightening, but there's no reason to be /that/ afraid of the ones which are mere nuisances. Furthermore, some of the really bad disorders can become mere nuisances with the right treatment.
