Interesting interpretation. But.. is the narrator Marty? The tone is very different from Marty of the films. I think you'd get better results by writing normal!Marty struggling but trying his best to be rational than by writing rational!Marty dispassionately recounting events.

The tone almost reminds me of Frankenstein, actually.
