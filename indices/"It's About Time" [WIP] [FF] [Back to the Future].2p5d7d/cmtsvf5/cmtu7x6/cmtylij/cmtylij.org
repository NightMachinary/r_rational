You still can have both. Marty's bootstrapping himself into rationality right? But what about Doc? He's definitely learning some rationality skills so he can teach it to Marty. I'm interested in how someone who constantly acts irrationally can learn to be more rational.

Also does anyone have any idea if the Doc from the original show has some sort of neurological disorder? All I can guess is some form of ADHD or maybe being bipolar.
