Thank you! My only regret was not inserting the characteristic exchange of "Great Scott!" "Whoa Doc, that's heavy!"

You're right that this isn't canon!Marty. The mere fact that he decides not to interact with the world vastly changes the tone. I envisioned an overly cautious time-traveler bootstrapping himself towards rationality. His only goal is to prevent himself from destroying the universe since he's not sure which "time-travel trope" his world operates in.

I referenced as many time-travel theories as I could muster and I'm sure there are more. My original plan was to draw out the "survey questionnaire" as a series of Q&A about time travel to help Marty figure out what would happen if he threatened paradox... but I wasn't even sure how he'd be able to find out without experimenting. So I left it as a puzzle he'd have to figure out over the next thirty years.
