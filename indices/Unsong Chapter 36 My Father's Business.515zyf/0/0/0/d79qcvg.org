This is a really good and elegant hypothesis, but I don't see why names would be powered by Uriel's stash of light - it seems like they should be using the stream of light that's constantly flowing into our world instead. Before the Skycrash names didn't work because Uriel had cut off that flow, even though his own reserves were full. It also seems like names were working even before Uriel's reserves existed in the first place.
