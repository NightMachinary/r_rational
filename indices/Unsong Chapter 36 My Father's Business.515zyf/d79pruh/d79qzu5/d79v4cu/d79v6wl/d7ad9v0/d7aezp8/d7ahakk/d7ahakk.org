So repurpose a Colorado town whose name already has Kabbalistic similarity.

From a very cursory glance down Wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Colorado][List of cities and towns in Colorado]], one that jumps out at me immediately is *Dolores*, already being named after suffering.

I'm sure you could find a better choice going down the list - Agony derives from the Greek word "Agon", meaning Contest. So kabbalistically, "A contest ending in pain". *Alma* was the first battle of the Crimean War, part of the /Great Game/ between Russia and Great Britain that ended in the Russians' humiliating and painful defeat. Any towns on the *Purgatoire* river. You could look up towns whose syllables match any of the [[https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#safe=off&q=agony+in+hebrew][Hebrew words for agony]]. Etc.

A bit of time and creativity could easily find better ties than I could in ten minutes. The Comet King had plenty of both, and a solid motivation to weasel his way around the prophecy.
