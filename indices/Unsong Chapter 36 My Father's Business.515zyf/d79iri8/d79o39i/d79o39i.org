I wonder if names used by humans draw on Uriel's light reserves or on the unfiltered light entering through the crack.

If the former, then I guess that would explain UNSONG. And if we /are/ in the final years, then the 58-letter Vital Name could drain a significant amount of power - maybe enough to not even work more than once.
