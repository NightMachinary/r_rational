If by that you mean fiction, the story that I /noticed/ teaching me things was van Vogt's Null-A. I expect that stories like Asimov's Foundation taught me quiet ideas like "You can analyze things by thinking", and that Piper's Fuzzy stories taught me to take for granted that sapience mattered, etcetera.
