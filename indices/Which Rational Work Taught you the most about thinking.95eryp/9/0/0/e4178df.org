I try different things, but I'm probably teaching a very different group of kids. I didn't join the discussion because I believe the article is years old. I'll look for the article. Long story short, teaching rationality is hard and mostly unsuccessful, so I try different things each year. Frequently I fall afoul of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law][Goodhart's law]]. Different things I try include:

1. Graph this population data and give me reasonable guesses of what you think is happening. This is moderately successful, but takes an inordinate amount of time with my population. 30 minutes to manually make a line graph with 10 data points. The reason I have them do it manually is I that I want them to screw up and see how data distorts if you mess up your scale. Teaching map/graph scale / ratios is challenging problem / one of our mandated responsibilities.
2. Let's look at two pictures. First tell me what you notice. Then tell me what you notice here. How are these two things different? What are some guesses you have as to why? How can you prove your guess? This works ok. It's better for creating visual associations to content than it is for teaching visual reasoning. Example: Picture of the Korean peninsula at night from space, what is the difference between the two areas? Why are they different? Let's read an article to find out. The opening steps work wonderfully, but kids have trouble justifying their guesses even when right.
3. I do one debate, and only after we've read 5 pages of primary sources and they've written a paper where I hammer their logic in the comments. We're talking a page and a half of comments for half a page of writing; for a hundred students. This is by far the most effective exercise I do, but it takes 2 weeks of class time, 3 weeks of grading, and another 2 weeks of recovery. Upper level students like the feed back and argumentation; lower level students dislike the independence. This shows positive results for the top 30% of students. An unknown but sizeable portion get their parents to do it for them, and then their parents get mad when I call out their faulty logic.
4. Here's a bunch of different explanations for why something happened. Read it, answer associated questions, tell me why or why not it's a convincing argument, move around the room asking other groups, and tell me what the most convincing argument was. This has worked surprisingly poorly for me. Most students have trouble comprehending different arguments simultaneously.
5. Find all the examples of this historical author mentioning this phrase in the text. Why does he use this phrase? No, it's not because he's stupid. He has a purpose. What do you think it is based on the way he's using it? This is effective only for about the top 5% of students.\\
6. Cause and effect mapping an event. This is extremely ineffective at teaching content or comprehension. I'm not sure why, but I think the medium is creating anxiety.
7. Teaching that the world is a network of systems. I do this through showing maps, surprising facts. I'm not sure if it's effective.

If you're still reading at this point. You'll notice the major flaw in all these techniques. They're techniques that are not goal-oriented. Rationality is a hard concept to define (even though there's the whole point about most definitions being probabilistic clusters.) I would say that beyond the whole History thing, I want to help my students develop the following mental processes:

1. The ability to examine their beliefs, and change their beliefs as new evidence comes in.
2. The desire to always prove arguments and base their arguments on evidence.
3. The ability to notice when they're confused and figure out why they're confused.

I don't know how the fuck you teach this or how the fuck you measure whether your different strategies are successful, especially #3. I would appreciate help, but I think making a post would be a little gauche since I've not been an member of this community very long.
