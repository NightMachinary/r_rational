I think definitely Luminosity. I apply the whole "don't lie to yourself about your true reasons for doing things just to maintain the belief that you're a good person" thing practically daily. Also, saying things out loud to remember them rather than just saying them in my head. That comes up less but is also pretty handy (ie. counting out scoops of coffee)
