Also, it's been a really long time since I've read it but if I remember correctly /Eldest/ was damn near rationalist. I didn't realize it when I read it, but the elves are basically a transhumanist utopia, beings who used magic to become immortal and end scarcity and they spend all their time working on self-improvement or understanding the world better. Most of Eragon's lessons seem not far removed from modern rationality.
