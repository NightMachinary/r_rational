I agree, it is pretty good. Anyone who reads it knows how old the author was, and the writing just keeps getting better as you further along in the series, which is pretty amazing and the characters grow in a lot of ways as a result.

The mechanic used in the end just seemed like an arbitrary rule in the source material, and was rather climatic (though Fridge-horror) in Inheritance. The blue fire (thing) was cool, and was a nice continuation of some of the things Eragon was thinking about beforehand - 'I could take this blade of grass, and use magic to make it into a powerful weapon, but when the energy ran out it would be useless', which was developed into 'you can use magic to make useful thing more useful this way' and 'things that have never been done before can be surprising'.

In fact, the magic system as a whole seemed like a refinement - 'you can do anything you can imagine if you have the power/motivation' -> you can only do what your body has energy for' let the story include so many beautiful spells. The extreme effects of the spell Eragon cast wrong that messed up someone's life felt like it fit in with the story, really well, made for a fascinating character, great character development, and were a great intro to 'spells cast on people'.
