Ender's Game book 2, The Speaker for the Dead. It made me really think about how something perfectly normal for one group can be completely horrifying for another. The whole book is about putting aside your own worldview and trying to see events from another person's perspective, because in a way, each person lives inside their own version of reality. And we can't really know another person until we accept that their truth is *a real* truth.
