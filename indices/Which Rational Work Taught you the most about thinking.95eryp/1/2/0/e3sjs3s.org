I.. Suspect you're doing this exact thing we're talking about. I could be wrong but, AFAIK, OSC has always said that homosexuality is a sin - which, within his cultural framework, is just a fact - but that individual people are not to be mistreated for it. One of my favorite works by him has a gay male lead, and it's never portrayed as something villainous.

Here's a quote from him:

#+begin_quote
  Oddly enough, even as I am attacked by some as a homophobe, I am attacked by others as being too supportive of homosexuality, simply because I cannot see individual homosexuals, in or out of my books, as anything other than human beings with as complex a combination of good and evil in them as I find within myself. In my own view, I am walking a middle way, which condemns the sin but loves the sinner.
