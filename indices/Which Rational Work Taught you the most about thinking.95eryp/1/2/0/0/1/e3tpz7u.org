yeah this is good nuance. Context matters. 20 years ago I was outright homophobic. 15 years ago I accepted it was natural. 10 years ago I thought LGBT was totally fine but gay marriage was kinda weird. 5 years ago I was all for gay marriage. Today I actively argue with members of my family that I don't see as supportive enough of LGBT rights and dignity.

I don't think Card's views should make his books invalid unless those views creep into the books themselves.
