I think it's worth mentioning that Card's views on gay marriage seem pretty similar to, say, Brandon Sanderson, which is basically, "I'm a liberal, but I'm a member of the LDS church and accept their stance on marriage, which is that God intended for marriage to be between a man and a woman." I imagine that if the church's position changed tomorrow, they'd probably smile and breathe a weary sigh of relief. (Given the large number of fantasy/SF authors that come out of SLC/Utah, I would expect this to be a pretty common viewpoint among a large number of people in that community, only difference being that most of them seem to remain strategically silent on the topic.)

Back in the mid 00's, I never would have expected to see Card attacked so consistently from the left, I recall him being pretty far left on a number of topics, like his position on immigration being that anyone who crosses the US/Mexico border should automatically be given US citizenship so that they can fully participate in society since they're going to be here and have jobs anyway. He was also against intervention in the middle east (back when most democrats were in favor of the US having a presence in Afghanistan) and critical of a lot of US military action in general, saying on numerous occasions, "We are not the good guys," extending this back as far as World War II where he argues that Pearl Harbor was actually an attacked provoked by the US, and while I'm not sure this is exactly a "liberal" position it probably places him pretty far away from the standard slate of Red Tribe beliefs.

I think if you took Card's views and compared them to any mainstream democrat in 2005, you'd find him to be uniformly further left on pretty much any topic; the only difference seems to be that Card has been pretty consistent in his beliefs over the years, so the movement of the Overton window makes him look like a bigot when it comes specifically to the topic of gay marriage. (Lest we forget, it was less than ten years ago that California passed Prop 8 to block the advance of same-sex marriage, and California is firmly blue.) Also, While I certainly don't agree with Card's beliefs, the fact that a 65-year-old Mormon man doesn't support gay marriage strikes me as completely unsurprising and unremarkable, so I've always found it odd that it seems to be THE most common thing people remark on (as opposed to, say, his views on immigration, which are also pretty far outside the norm but in the opposite direction, or literally anything else about him). Even today, I think his positions on topics like immigration and US foreign policy are still way further left than most mainstream democrats.
