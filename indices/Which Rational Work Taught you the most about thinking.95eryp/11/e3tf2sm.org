HPMOR taught me rationality wasn't all it appeared to be. I read everything on lesswrong, and was really starting to fall for it.

Then just after i read something about rationality being the thing that wins, I finished the book. The ending disappointed me, all the plot hooks that were promised failed to come to a conclusion, and the thought that was supposed to be put in the story appeared to be empty promises.

That showed me, thinking rational isn't going to make you a good writer. Or a good talker. Or good at understanding other poeple. Most of the important stuff in society is cultural, and lives in the minds of poeple. And poeple are not rational.
