There's also the Empire duet, which combines a shitload of Alex Jones style paranoia. Or Alvin Maker, which is fun, if not grounded in decent History, but over the course of the series it seemed to drift closer and closer to Mormon apologetics.

I went to school where OC lives and he had a weekly column in the local conservative paper (Rhinocerous times, which went out of business years ago). By the mid aughts it was a combination of irrelevant and silly. I vaguely recollect that in one column he decided that common plays weren't appropriate for high school girls, so he decided to write a play about a teen girl's sleepover as a middle aged man. He repeatedly kept "reporting" on the liberal conspiracy to keep his friends from tenure. Keep in mind this was well over a decade ago and memories are constructed, but still....

He was a hugely influential in the development of my friends and I, but a continual disappointment when we read his columns and many of his later books.
