As others have listed, HPMOR, Ender's Game, were influential for me too. Ender's game helped me develop empathy as a young adult. HPMOR had a lot of metacognition theory which was useful. Reddit's badHistory is a great place to see biases on display, and the value of academic debate; I was lucky enough to start reading it in college which helped me focus on learning as a process and outcome of debate. Dune was also influential, because along with Foundation, it helped me worked out the ideas of History and Politics as a system with something close to universal laws. It was an Enlightenment for me.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I'm a teacher and none of the classwork I did really focused on metacognition. Most of the stuff I could find online was written way above the reading level of my students or was just a way to try to sell the same old tired strategies. The Less Wrong post on education was profoundly unhelpful too, because it presented problems without solutions and the comments were the usual mixture of hatred for public schools as social engineering (that's supposed to be a bad thing to transhumanists?) and resurfacing of old trauma visited on students by their teachers.
