Hmm. Interesting question. It wasn't a rational story, but I did read one manwha that helped me learn a coping strategy for a really hard period I was going through. The story was called Nineteen, Twenty-one. It was about a girl who went into a coma, came out after a year, and had to retake her last year of high school. She was essentially nineteen (twenty-one in Korean age) and taking cram school with juvenile delinquents.

She was depressed and felt like she was always behind, like she'd never catch up with the rest of the world. I also started college two years late, and felt awful about it for similar reasons.

At the end of the story, the girl says, "I don't want to go through life thinking I'm always two steps behind. If things hadn't worked out that way, I wouldn't be the person I am now. There are things more important in life than the difference in age between nineteen and twenty-one."

Sometimes we can focus on the wrong things in life like they're a big deal. I often thought about that story after reading it, and I think it really encouraged me to see setbacks in a more realistic and positive perspective. Not just in that situation, but in others as well.

I'm not sure if this counts as learning to think more rationally, but it helped me to act more rational and level headed in stressful situations. I read it years ago, but it still resonates with me. :)
