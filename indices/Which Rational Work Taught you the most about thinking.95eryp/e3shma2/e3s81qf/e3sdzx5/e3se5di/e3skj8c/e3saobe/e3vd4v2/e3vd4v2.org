Fun fact, I used an idea from that in a very religious school in the South. The asked if I believed in evolution. I took a brief digression how the phrase do you believe gets virtue signaling as a response and how "is ____ real" is a better way of testing your beliefs. A kid goes "is God real?" and then clapped his hands over his mouth; it was one of the more heartbreaking and hilarious moments in teaching.
