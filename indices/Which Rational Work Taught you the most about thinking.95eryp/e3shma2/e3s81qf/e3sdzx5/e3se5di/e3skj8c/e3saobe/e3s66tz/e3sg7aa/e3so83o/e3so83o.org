Yup, someone who knows three words could easily trounce someone with an entire dictionary at their disposal, either through creativity or scientific knowledge. One particularly rational example from the story is just applying a small amount of force directly in the brain. The story explored consequences of the magic in cool ways, such as having mages sprinkled throughout the army and having a secondary fight going on underneath the obvious one.

Other parts were annoyingly irrational, such as the dragon dance, and the ending (not going to say why because spoilers); but on the whole it was extremely well done.
