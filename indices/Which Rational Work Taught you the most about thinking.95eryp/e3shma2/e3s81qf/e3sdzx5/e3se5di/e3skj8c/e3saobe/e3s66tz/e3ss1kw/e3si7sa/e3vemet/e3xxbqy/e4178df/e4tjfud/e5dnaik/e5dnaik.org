Honestly? One of the best sets of classes I ever had was the poetry unit in my 11th grade AP English class (this is about halfway between your #5 and #3, I guess)

It was a combination of 11th and 12th graders (though mostly 12th), and we had to read a poem for each day of class, and write a paragraph analysing the poem. The start of each class was a Socratic Seminar based on the analysis of the poem. The teacher would walk between the two tables (it was a large enough class that having only one would inhibit discussion), and listen to the arguments presented, and occasionally discretely direct the conversation by dropping a question before walking away.

In this way, everyone got to see not only how the others interpreted the poem, but /why/ - which phrases stuck out to them the most, etc. We began to realize how the year the poem was written in might affect the worldview of the author, and thus the word choices. One poem in particular I remember the discussion from was "My Papa's Waltz". We were pretty evenly split between believing it was a relatively happy poem involving a dance, and believing it was a dark metaphor for a child being beaten.

Understanding the reasoning behind the other interpretations, and sometimes switching your own viewpoint, helped form logical analysis skills and showed that, as they say, "your truth is not my truth, but that doesn't make it not /a/ truth".

To be honest, the fact that it was a daily occurrence, without a great deal of overt supervision, was what allowed the discussion to really flourish. The readings (daily poem) were short enough that /everyone/ read them and were able to participate, unlike when it's a 30+ page reading with a however long writing assignment at the end. The constant exposure (this went on for at least a quarter of the year, even though it was only the first 15 minutes or so of each class) meant that by the end, everyone was comfortable voicing their opinion, it wasn't awkward, and those who didn't really get it at the beginning were coached by example by the ones that did, taught to see the other perspectives through the words of their peers.

Just like how some people aren't good test-takers, some people aren't good at formatting and laying out their logical arguments into a paper, and therefore dread the research papers. If the goal is the show how different opinions and worldviews are spawned, and help young minds identify them, then create a situation where the class is split in opinion and let them explore it.

 

I know that an example from an upper level class might not be as effective with lower levels, but I can honestly say that that class shaped the way that I read and interpret text.
