If we're just talking about fiction, probably HPMOR. If we're talking about rational literature in general, probably Rationality: From AI to Zombies/the Sequences on Lesswrong.

Or wait are we talking about learning how to think or learning how thinking works?

(I bet there are a ton of people on here with that exact same answer to your question who aren't posting on this thread because they don't have anything new, unique or surprising to add to this discussion that isn't already said. Most people here got started from HPMOR after all.
