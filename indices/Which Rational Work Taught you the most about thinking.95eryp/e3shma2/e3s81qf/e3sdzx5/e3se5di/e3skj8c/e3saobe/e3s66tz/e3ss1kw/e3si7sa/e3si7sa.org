It's hard for me to think of a book that taught me about thinking before I found rational fiction. I read a lot of Heinlein growing up, which exposed me to new ideas that were healthy for me to think about it. A lot of it is pulpy though, arguably smut (maybe that's why I read him so much). Here is a recommendation you might not have seen before: Moonwalking with Einstein. I think it was a great primer on using mnemonics. It isn't fictional, but it's at least shaped into a narrative.
