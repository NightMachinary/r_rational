For me the top 3 that shaped the way I think are ring world series by Larry Niven, ender saga by Card Orson Scott and basically everything from Asimov. But I would argue that everything you read changes a bit the way you think or atleast the way you look at the world. The more points of view you are exposed to the more you learn not to take things at face value and you grow as a person. I can say that sometimes I learned more from 1 paragraph I read on a random comment on Reddit then some entire books I read.
