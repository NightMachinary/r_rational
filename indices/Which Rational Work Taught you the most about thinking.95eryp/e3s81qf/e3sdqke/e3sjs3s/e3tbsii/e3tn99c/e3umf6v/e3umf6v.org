I won't argue that the fact that the gay genetic scientist deciding to succumb to some kind of primal urge to start having biological children is a bit weird. Like, there's specifically a line where he talks about how the gay sex that he pursued in his youth was all meaningless because it didn't lead to making babies, and at last he discovers that the /real/ purpose of sex is to ensure that your genetics continue to be part of the future of human race. (Maybe a bit less "out of nowhere" considering that it's coming from a genetic scientist.) You could definitely make the case that it's homophobic to say that gay sex is "meaningless" or somehow less valid, but to me this kind of feels like it's in the same category with Catholics who oppose the use of birth control (because sex is for making babies, not for hedonistic pleasure).

Is the way Anton is written weird tone-deaf and insensitive? Yeah, it's pretty hard to read it today and not feel weird or uncomfortable. Is it ignorant? Yeah, probably about as much as you would expect from a Mormon guy born in 1951 writing a book released in 2002, back when maybe a third of Americans supported gay marriage. Is it hateful? I don't personally think so, but you're welcome to draw your own conclusions.
