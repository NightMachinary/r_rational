I think what the finale really needed to work right was a "Reconstruction Effort" Montage between the final fight and the wedding. Not much - just some shots of Asami in a hard hat or construction mech and Korra Rubble-Bending. Because logically, both of them would be up to their eyeballs in that effort, and it would make the romantic vacation ending feel more logical and less rushed.
