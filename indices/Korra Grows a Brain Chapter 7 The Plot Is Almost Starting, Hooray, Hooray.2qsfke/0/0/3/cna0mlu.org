I thought it was pretty good. Not as good as ATLA, of course, but seasons 3 and 4 redeemed the show for me. Less focus on romance, no deus ex machina, and interesting character development for Korra and some of the side characters like Lin. The villains were good too, though I do agree that they [[#s][Korra book 4]] Like [[/u/alexanderwales]] said, the romance had so little screentime that, though it did come out of left field, I don't think it took away from an otherwise strong ending.
