I am going to be doing [[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2qrex5/fanfic_tuesday_fanfics_week_0/][this]], which means this fic will be updating every Tuesday, and it will probably be updating there, not here. As such, I consider this the last week for pandering requests. If you want Korra to get a pet bunny that shoots lasers out of its tail, now's the time to say!

Try to solve the definitely rational plot ahead of time, guys. Who blew up the hospital? When will Korra figure out who her party is? When is Zolt going to totally kill Mako like he is gonna? And when will we be seeing some Korrasami lezphysics action dammit.

OH AND THE SHOW'S OVER CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS [[#s][Spoilers]]
