You want a random request to pander to? You've got it!

I looked up online for a random word generator. The twelve words given are: premium, tire, mind, plain, neat, venomous, towering, grateful, ring, teaching, books, and crowd.

My random idea is therefore.../drum-roll/...Korra gets a premium tire to be used as a ring for a (grateful?) bride in a marriage ceremony inside a library to teach about snakes.

/blinks slowly/

Ok that was a weird idea, but it's up to you to follow the idea exactly as much as you want.
