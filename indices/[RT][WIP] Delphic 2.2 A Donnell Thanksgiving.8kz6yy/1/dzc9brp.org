I love this story. It is so lifelike, spending time on the things real people spend time on. Cooking, food, and family support are so often ignored in fiction, let alone cape-fics.

It allows us to get to know, understand, and value all the people he has a relationship with, while giving the greater world and society more color with each slice of life and meal cooked.
