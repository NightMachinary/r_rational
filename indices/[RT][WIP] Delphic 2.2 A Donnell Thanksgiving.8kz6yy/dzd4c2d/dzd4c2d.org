One thing I really appreciate about this story is that it shows an underrepresented perspective of the superhero genre, without that being either the main defining characteristic, while also acknowledging that there is, in fact, a difference in experience there.

It isn't my lived experience, so I'm not certain about the accuracy, so I'm slightly curious to know if it's the author's, but it at least reads as plausible to me from the people I do know, so good work with that.

Thanks for writing it, and I can't wait to read more!
