I don't recall if this was alluded in previous chapters or not, but after reading this one, it begins to make some kind of sense to me why Luna is at Chogborts in her first year at the same time as Horry and his classmates.

In canon, Harry enters Hogwarts in 1991, but Luna, being one year younger, only enters in 1992. So far I've been assuming by default that the current year in this world was 1991 (I don't recall if we had a mention of the current year or not in the previous chapters).

But in this chapter, Horry's book shows his birth date as August 1st 1982, which is 366 days later than Harry's birth date in canon (July 31st 1981). Since I've got no reason to believe otherwise, I am assuming that in this world students still need to be at least 11 years old before entering Chogborts, as per the rules in canon.

This means that the current year is in fact 1992, and the history of this world, aside from all the differences we've seen so far, is also "shifted" 1 year to the future.

With the further confirmation in this chapter that people can be dropped in alternative worlds, it now makes some kind of sense why Luna is here at this time if we presume that the selection of the year at which she is dropped in this world is anchored to the date of her original world (which is supposedly closer to canon given her name).
