Actually, we've already established how the library works: each book is encoded in base 4, and then the number is turned into a qr code, except spirally and with greys. Yes, Alvin is playing fast and loose for why things are the way they are, but the library really does contain every finite text, and because of that has countably infinite books inside of it. Since it has every text, anything describable can be found inside of the library, and someone's life story is certainly capable of being described.
