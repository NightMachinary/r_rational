Alvin argues that every possible outcome of every possible choice Horry every makes is represented by a book in the library because it is uncountable. My comment is meant to point out that this is not necessarily implied by having an uncountably infinite library, and possible reasons for this logical flaw. I am not certain of anything about how this applies to the story, but I was trying to come up with plausible reasons for the flaw.

For example, it is possible that the world in the book doesn't respect the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory (ZFC), or that Alvin is lying, or that the author made a mistake. I am not sure which is more reasonable. I think the most likely explanation is that the author made a mistake or deliberately inserted a logical flaw in Alvin's argument.
