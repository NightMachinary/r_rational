While the library is definitely a reference, the library of babel is a much more limited case than the true library, and is actually finite in both the implementation and original description. Books in the library of babel of are a fixed length (shorter books are padded with spaces), limited character set, and have no images. The true library is not only unbounded by character set and image inclusion, but also likely has control of format, ink composition, page condition, and any other variable you'd need to describe any possible book, from the voynich manuscript to that dog eared copy of the hardy boys from grade school.
