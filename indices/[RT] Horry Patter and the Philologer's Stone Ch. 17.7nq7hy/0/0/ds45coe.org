True enough, although I think in this case it's not so much a lack of understanding as the author already working under the principle that the library is an uncountably infinite set of all possible written works (without exception). I suspect it's more likely that Alvin was trying to explain this and simply worded it badly.

I'm pretty sure the whole thing is a direct reference to the [[https://libraryofbabel.info][Library of Babel]], which is absolutely meant to be an infinite set of all possible written works.
