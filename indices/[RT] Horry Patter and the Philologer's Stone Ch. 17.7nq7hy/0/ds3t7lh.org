One thing I feel a strong need to mention, is that just because a set is uncountably infinite, doesn't mean that it contains every element in its domain. For example, the set of all irrational numbers between 0 and 1 which do not have a 1 in their decimal representation is uncountable, yet still none of these numbers contain a 1, and most notably, isn't the set of all irrational numbers between 0 and 1. So it is just by odd quirk that there is Horry's life story, but there is no guarantee that any variations of it exist, even in a library where the cardinality of the set of books is an uncountable infinity.

How this applies to the story, it is unclear. Either the author doesn't understand infinities, the author is ignoring definitions because it fits the narrative nicely, or Alvin doesn't understand infinity. Which it is remains unknown.

Edit: Or Alvin is lying to Horry. another plausible alternative.
