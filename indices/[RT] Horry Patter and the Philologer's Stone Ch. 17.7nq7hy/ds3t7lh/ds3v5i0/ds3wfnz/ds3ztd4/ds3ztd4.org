As I'm sure you're aware, the library could also contain no books containing the letter 'a', and still be uncountably infinite. Its uncountable-ness is not a sufficient condition for it containing every story (nor is it strictly necessary, modulo assumptions about how fine grained the data specifying the state of the universe is).
