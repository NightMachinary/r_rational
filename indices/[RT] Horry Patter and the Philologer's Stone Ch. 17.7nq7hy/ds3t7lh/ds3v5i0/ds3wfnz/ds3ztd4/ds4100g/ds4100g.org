  "Horry, very few people really understand the extent of our Library---what it truly means for it to be infinite beyond count. For every choice you have ever been confronted with, there is a tome, somewhere in our halls, detailing your life after you made that choice---with a new branch for every choice thereafter.

I see that these are separate statements, but by saying first that people don't understand what it means to have an uncountable library, and then saying, /this is true/, it heavily suggests the first statement implies the second, as it if to say, this is what people do not understand about our library, because they cannot understand infinity. It is not wrong, merely misleading.

Thanks for the response :)
