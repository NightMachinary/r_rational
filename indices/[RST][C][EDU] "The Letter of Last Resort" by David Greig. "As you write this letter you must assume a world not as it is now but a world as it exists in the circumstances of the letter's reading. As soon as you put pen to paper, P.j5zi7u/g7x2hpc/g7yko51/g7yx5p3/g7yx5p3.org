I'm simplifying the game theory into symbolism for the sake of not having to write an entire introduction to timeless decision theory. I'm trying to translate the logic into gut level emotions.

The point is to make the branch of the decision graph that John inhabits one that, for predictable reasons, contains no benefit to anyone. This causes it to always have been impossible. Time of course doesn't /actually/ work like that, but the multiverse stuff is more an intuition pump. The point is to make John think of the past as real and mutable.

Frankly, if I could, I'd admit to it and argue TDT and the legitimate military purpose of mass murder of non-military targets on the stand of the ICC. This is of course a terrible idea. Practically I'd just hint at my ruthless commitment to fairness in diplomatic conversation.

(The problem with the irrationality thing is it's strawman irrationality. Second-striking Beijing is an entirely rational thing for John to do, and for me to order.)
