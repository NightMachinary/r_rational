You can't causally effect an agent outside your light cone, but given a good enough model of the universe you could predict what sort of agents exist in the unreachable (to us) universe.

Imagine you were some powerful agent, and had reason to believe the universe beyond the visible was very large; you might be able to make trustworthy (to yourself) predictions about the sorts of powerful agents that might arise throughout the wider universe, based on the likelihoods of them appearing from the statistical distribution of starter states. If you have high confidence that a very powerful agent or class of agents exists, and are yourself powerful enough to understand this class of agents very well (i.e. run its source code) and they you, or in other words, you can be superrational wrt. each other, then you could acausally trade with them.

Alternatively, you could do it with an agent in the past or future, but that seems less likely as you'd expect any agent powerful enough to engage in acausal trade to rule its future light cone.
