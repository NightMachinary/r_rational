I don't think that this is consistent with the mainstream understanding of multiverses, or with rationality in general.

If John nuked Beijing, or shot himself, that branch of the multiverse will not be 'snuffed out'. A universe that's devoid of people still exists, it will merely have less potential life, less potential humanity, less potential joy in it. Sure, John's existence and much of the post-nuclear Earth may be pretty awful, but in the long term? Whether modern life recovers or civilization collapses, that branch will be worse off if John blows a tiny part of it up or not.
