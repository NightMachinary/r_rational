I think this is what I'd write. I don't know if this would work, but it's what I'd say anyhow.

  Dear John,

  Do you believe in a multiverse? I do. I think, on some level, I always have. I think you have to account for the possibility that things could have gone differently to appreciate what choice means at all.

  They nuked us, John. It's over. We're dead, your family is dead, BBC Radio is dead. (I'm assuming you have checked that one.) Someone made a decision, history went a certain way, and now England is gone. Wiped right out.

  If you had a time machine, you could go back and fix it, stop the person - president, party functionary, general - stop whoever did it in their tracks.

  You don't have a time machine. You have a nuclear warhead. And your only goal now is to take this universe - this entire branch of time - and snuff it out, to the greatest degree you can manage.

  This should never have happened. Now we need you to make this future not exist. You need to take this entire malign branch of the multiverse, this failure of history itself that you have unfortunately found yourself to inhabit, and squeeze it shut behind yourself.

  You need to understand that we have /lost/, John. The game has already ended. We played, and they cheated, and they won and we lost. What you need to decide now is if you're gonna just accept them taking everything from you or if you're gonna throw over the table and shank a fucker.

  Someone in the past looked into the future - into this moment, and they saw a /victory/, a glorious and shining future for their people. To varying quality, people want to believe what is true. This observation cannot be allowed to be true. The point of your existence now is to make it untrue.

  The United Kingdom can no longer give you orders. But my honest recommendation is that you nuke Beijing, and then shoot yourself in the head.

  --Mr. Prime
