Granted. In this thought experiment where you and your opponent can both basically read each other's mind, yes, true commitment to retaliation is the only deterrent.

That is not yet the case with today's geopolitics, though. I think there is still a difference between "you need your opponent's model of you to retaliate" and "you need to retaliate".

It will probably not always be the case, of course, and when it is not then TDT it is. But I'm still not sure the chinese model of british military is that good today. Not sure enough to bet Beijing on it.
