TDT and multiverse are a bet, though. If reality doesn't work like that, retaliation is net loss in terms of human lives.

So assuming your aim is to minimize death, it should go something like this (I think?)

E(lives lost | retaliation) = (1 - P(TDT)) * (n(Beijing) + n(London)) - P(TDT) * n(London)

You'd need to be quite sure that there's such a thing as a multiverse for this bet to be rational, right? And since it's an unfalsifiable hypothesis, I fail to see how you'd have a high prior for it.
