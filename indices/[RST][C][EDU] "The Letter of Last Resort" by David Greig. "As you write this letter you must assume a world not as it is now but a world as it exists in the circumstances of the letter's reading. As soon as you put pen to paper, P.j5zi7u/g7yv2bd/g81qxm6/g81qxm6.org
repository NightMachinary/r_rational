Dear John:

I won't beat around the bush with introductions or niceties. Now is not the time for nice, is it?

Do not simply make them die. Whoever did this, they do not care if their largest city dies. They factored that into their decision, and it was not sufficient to deter them. Death is not enough.

Make them /suffer./ Now, in this moment, you have the ability to remind humanity of what we are capable of, to write an epitaph for our civilization in the agony of those responsible. Create for yourself a legend, become The Thing Who Goes Bump In The Night. Make sure we cannot be forgotten, and ensure the lesson we teach is carved forevermore in the collective psyche of man.

This will require creativity. If it was China, do not simply destroy their two largest cities, for that is not enough. Destroy the Three Gorges Dam instead. They killed us, so we will bring enduring calamity upon them. If it was religious extremists, do not target their nation, but their holy sites. If it was someone else, do your research to determine how best to maximize their misery, for the longest time you can, for the most of their people as possible. Whatever their goals in destroying us, become the antithesis of all they value.

I do not command this in vengeance, for vengeance is pointless. I do not command this out of spite, for such concerns are meaningless before the consuming void we find ourselves cast into. I command this so no-one can again question what humanity will do, to what depths we will sink, when faced with annihilation. We cannot allow the consequences of nuclear holocaust to be a nebulous unknown ever again. Our last lesson must be that we can be made monsters, that no god or nation or other thing of human design can save us from the consequences we mete out upon ourselves. You must destroy the present, so the future knows what is truly at stake at the next turn of the wheel.

Good luck. May whatever gods there be grant you all their wrath. Perhaps, one day, we will no longer need to remember it.
