Surprisingly good decision/game theory for a normie play. The part below is when I knew I had to post it here:

#+begin_quote
  *PRIME MINISTER:* Look, John -- the thing is -- this is all very well but it's -- I don't -- I mean it's all so hypothetical --

  *JOHN:* I don't catch your meaning, Prime Minister?

  *PRIME MINISTER:* There isn't going to be a devastating nuclear attack on Britain. London isn't going to be wiped out by bombs from Russia or whoever... I don't know.

  *JOHN:* Iran

  *PRIME MINISTER:* All right, Iran but the fact is the political conditions are just -- it's impossible in the modern world. Maybe during the cold war but nowadays it's...who would do it? Who would actually launch the missiles? Which leader of which country thinks an attack like that on a country like this would have any kind of... would have any meaning?

  *JOHN:* Still.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* I could write a nursery rhyme on this piece of paper, John, it's never going to be read. The events that require it to be opened are quite simply impossible. They're never going to happen.

  *JOHN:* Except of course that they have happened.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* What?

  *PRIME MINISTER:* The events have happened.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* No they haven't.

  *JOHN:* They have.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* London has not been attacked, John.

  *JOHN:* With respect Prime Minister London has been destroyed.

  *PRIME MINISTER:* Look -- London -- trees -- sky -- bird -- cat -- night.

  *JOHN:* The only circumstances in which this letter will be read are those in which there are no longer trees, or birds or cats... or London or you. As you write this letter you must assume a world not as it is now but a world as it exists in the circumstances of the letter's reading. As soon as you put pen to paper, Prime Minister, London ceases to exist.
