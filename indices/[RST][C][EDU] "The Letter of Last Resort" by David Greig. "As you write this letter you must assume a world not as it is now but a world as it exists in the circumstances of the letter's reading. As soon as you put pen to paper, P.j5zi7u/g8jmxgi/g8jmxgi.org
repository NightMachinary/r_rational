Yes, the Prime Minister needs to write "retaliate" in the Letter of Last Resort.

But that's not necessarily what the Commander needs to read.

The entire point of writing the letter is to allow the Prime Minister to behave to other nuclear countries as if they'll be annihilated if they attack, even if the UK is obliterated.

However, John from Arrangements knows that these aren't the orders that the PM would give under those circumstances. She has written a letter with /those/ orders, which are "Don't retaliate."

If Arrangements can surreptitiously retrieve that letter and use /it/ as the Letter of Last Resort, then the PM can behave as if the post-annihilation retaliation directive is in place (because she'll believe it is in place), while acceding to her desires about what should actually be done in the case of annihilation.
