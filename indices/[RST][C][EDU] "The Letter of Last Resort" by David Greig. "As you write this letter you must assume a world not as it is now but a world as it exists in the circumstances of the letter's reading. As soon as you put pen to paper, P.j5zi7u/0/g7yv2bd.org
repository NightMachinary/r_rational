  Dear Commander /HMS Vanguard/,

  Some will claim retaliation is irrational and immoral. This is not so. With your actions, think not of what you owe the dead, but what you owe the living, and the generations unborn. They deserve a world where it is known that murder on the scale the enemy has committed will be avenged, however inadequately and imperfectly, in order to deter any repeat of such behavior. Punish the enemy because it is entirely moral and rational to make future efforts at deterrence more credible, especially now that deterrence in pure prospect has failed. It will not bring back London, but it may save the next one.
