This subreddit has fewer than 4,000 net members.

Of those, even fewer fully agree with the definition put forth for /rational/ and /rationalist fiction/, as can be seen every time this argument comes up. The people who agree with your views make up not even a /significant-sized minority/ of rationalists around the world.

I'm not sure where you got the idea that this relatively puny subreddit has the end-all be-all say on what rational fiction is, especially when so many other people, such as [[/u/thesteamboat]], clearly have differing views on it.
