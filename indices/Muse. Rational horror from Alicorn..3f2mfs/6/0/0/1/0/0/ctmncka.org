i may not have explained myself properly, what i meant was that all of these things could have been solved relatively easily without significantly effecting anything important in the story.

nothing would have changed if the author added "if not for those stupid politicians" or "if only we had time to charge the robots to send them instead", other than the fact that we could be assured that the author thought about those things. so yes, we would know the author was aware of those points and decided to make a story where they wouldnt be relevant.

but nothing in the story would change significantly.

On the other hand my problem with the many small irrationalities is that without them the story would just not be the same, i.e. it would not be possible to get the same horror.
