Even in /Luminosity/, that is a relatively minor point where the world didn't act right, not that the main characters didn't enact plans that made sense given their assumptions. The author was trying to execute ideas that their plotting skills failed to really match, and the world-building buckled under it--which is forgivable in my book. But they tried. That makes it rational in the genre, but flawed.

That's really all I ask for in speculative rational fiction: try hard to make the characters and world act right, given the genre. I didn't get that in /Muse/, despite the sorta-kinda sciencey-based story. The story world didn't make sense, even in sci-fi terms, and the characters also didn't act right for what they were supposed to be doing.

There isn't really...a thing described and deeply rooted in the world, just a situation that happens to people. And people don't /really/ act like they should, if they were professionals on a professional mission or people living with...a thing. Too much explanation that is needed doesn't happen, because it isn't a story about these people, technology, other worlds, or the...thing that happens. Just its effects.

It is a story about a thing that happens. And that's fine. It's a good story.

--------------

Questions I would have answered (quickly) to make this short story more rational:

- *Why isn't this a quasi-military mission, with all that implies?* People just sort of flop around, literally like tourists. It not being highly structured suggests even more alien things than other worlds, when it comes to human organizations.
- *Why didn't they have medical personal?* Just...why? How can anything...that happens have happened? And if they had deep, functional society (which seems to be the case) where was /their/ artistic and meticulous medical science? We currently treat minor mental issues with a boggling variety of drugs. This story suggests...they don't, even when it would massively improve quality of life? Ehhh...
- *Why didn't anyone on either side ask any questions about anything?* In addition to not sending a doctor, they didn't send an anthropologist? Are these proactive and curious explorers or bored college professors with generic expertise grinding through their tenure? Is this a society based on...what it was without anyone interested in this...thing, did no one find the visitors interesting? Whatever the case, how did the crew miss it? The crew figured it out very, very fast later on, but also jumped to a lot of conclusions that /could have been dead wrong/. So why didn't the locals talk to them about /anything/? With the developmental implications, this seems...stupid. Either they could work at a level where their...situation wasn't noticeable and yet they never worked on the obvious problem, which isn't logical, or the explorers were criminally negligent in their mission, which isn't /rational/ or otherwise supported by the plot.
- *Why didn't they treat the alien planet as an alien planet*, or even ask questions about it? Which leads to-
- -the big one for all sci-fi: */Why isn't this ALL being done by robots/*. No AI, fine. No robotic explorers sent on automated missions, or at least being controlled from orbit? No. Just, no. You aren't writing sci-fi anymore without answering the robot probe question.

Failing that last one ultimately makes this fun space opera fantasy, and less "hard" sci-fi than /Stargate: SG1/. Being written as if fleshy people had tasks to do in space exploration, which simply isn't true /now/, it fails at almost the first rational sci-fi hurtle. Which is fine, as space opera is seldom very rational.

--------------

Let's go down the list in order:

1. Things happen /because/, we never hear the reasons. Conflict is purely artificially constructed. See: my iPod rant, below.
2. The conflict is with the world, and it isn't even explored if this...thing is a good thing or not, which is actually an argument in the real-world analog of this situation when it happens to real people...though less dramatically. That discussion is never even mentioned, because that would detract from the horror. Even though...it is kind of insensitive to people with real...thing issues in real life.
3. Nope. In fact, no one solves any real problems at all, let alone intelligently. We don't really learn what resources there are, what people know, or why they do what they do. They just do things and we watch.
4. And no. We learn almost nothing, especially about FTL, alien worlds, alien cultures, sci-fi cultures, or really anything at all. In fact, they don't have smarthphone level tech like handheld video and music /while on an FTL ship/, which is a /huge/ fail of imagination. You bet your /ass/ the first FTL explorers will have the ability to /personally play music on electronic handheld devices/, just like people did in 1990. Sigh.

Again, still a very, very good story. I think what the author wrote works, and was most importantly what they wanted to write, it just isn't at all good /rational fiction/.

-edit

*tl;dr*

This isn't rational. World building matters. Rational fiction horror looks more like /Andromeda Strain/, and less like an episode of /Star Trek: TNG/. Still a good story. I liked ST:TNG, mostly.
