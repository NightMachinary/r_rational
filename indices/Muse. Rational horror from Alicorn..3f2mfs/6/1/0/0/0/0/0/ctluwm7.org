For someone who dismisses memetic viruses as a plausible explanation you're remarkably quick to assume it to be the actual explanation. Other than the symptoms being weird for a biochemical virus there's no evidence that I picked up for the virus being memetic.

Regardless, they failed biochemical safety procedures. If it had been a normal flu, they would have died just as surely as they did now.

Note: I'm assuming you mean "virus transmitted by information exchange between minds" when you say "memetic virus". If you merely mean a biological virus which affects the mind, I don't get your point at all.
