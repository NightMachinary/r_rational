To my mind, the entire exploring post-"scatter" society in /Muse/ is holding the idiot ball. It is not just that the reader has to assume things, which is fine, but that they have to make /excuses/ for stupid things the characters do. In an otherwise good story, that's mediocre storytelling.

I was able to suspend disbelief while reading the story, which is why I say I found it a good one /despite/ this issue. But the moment I finished the story, literally that /second/, my brain started poking holes in it. That's bad for a rational story.

Also, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3f2mfs/muse_rational_horror_from_alicorn/ctng031?context=10][the author says it isn't meant as a rational story]], so...

I'm also going to shoot down your "words don't mean things" statement.

I use the sidebar definitions in this sub for the terms /rational/ and /rationalist/, as those *are* in fact meaningful. Words do, in fact, mean things. Maybe don't use words you disagree with, if commonly held definitions are a problem for you.

I don't hate that you suggested this story. I liked it. But it isn't a rational story. Please don't try to weasel out of this with semantic games. And perhaps consider using words that mean things to other people they way they usually understand them, and just disclaim ahead of time if you think an entry might be sort of weak on the sidebar-defined rational elements. I'm sure people will still enjoy well-written submissions.
