    It could be explained simply

  Then why wasn't it? We're not talking about the story you're telling yourself about this story, but what was actually written.

I'm not sure I agree with this point. Let me stretch to a mathematical analogy, namely the distinction between consistent and complete. Most of what you're arguing is that the world building isn't complete. You point to a bunch of things and say "I think that needs further justification." The world building hasn't answered everything.

On the other hand, the story is certainly consistent with everyone acting as normal, intelligent people (at least, prior to muse exposure). That is, for each of your objections you can come up with simple, plausible extensions to the text that would answer them.

  Muse doesn't fit together at all, even when a few words would have fixed the problem.

To me this seems bizarre. I care not a whit for completeness, only for consistency. Again, this is the difference between a character who is an idiot and a character holding the idiot ball -- holding the idiot ball means that the world (in particular, the offending character) is inconsistent. In contrast, a character who is dumb isn't bad writing, it's just a character who's stupid.

Full disclaimer: I think that, as descriptors, rational and rationalist are not particularly meaningful. I chose the title as I did to parallel last week's contest.
