  It could be explained simply

Then why wasn't it? We're not talking about the story you're telling yourself about this story, but what was actually written.

#+begin_quote
  they might not be able to use it as it would offend their hosts
#+end_quote

That would take maybe five words to mention, but it isn't. That's a failing of the story's rational basis.

#+begin_quote
  but I think going into the specifics is not the solution in this case, because any of the specifics (why wasnt this a military mission could have easily been "solved" by having one of the people mention how "this mission really should have been a military mission...

  ...

  But as a whole there are too many small points which when combined prevent this from being "rational" in my eyes
#+end_quote

This doesn't logically follow. Lots of small points could have been covered by a single sentence:

*/The entire scatter recovery plan hinged on this single, admittedly poorly-funded mission, run by their group of dedicated volunteers./*

Now every stupid mistake is explained. Done. But it doesn't do that, because even that would distract from the elements that the author wants to focus on.

I actually /listed/ what I felt was most wrong, because even if it was a series of small things, they weren't unsolvable issues. Altogether, there was a lot not covered. Even in a short story, where space is limited, these sorts of things need to be dealt with in rational world-building, and they weren't.

It isn't about being "hard" sci-fi, which mostly means the math and science has been done and is explicitly shown, but about having a well put-together world. Instead of sci-fi, we get space opera, because none of the science questions are even lampshaded. Even though it is otherwise a good story, /Muse/ doesn't fit together at all, even when a few words would have fixed the problem. And that's a shame.
