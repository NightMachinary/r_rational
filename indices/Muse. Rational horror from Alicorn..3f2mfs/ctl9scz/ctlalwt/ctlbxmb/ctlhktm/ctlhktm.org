I don't think rational scifi has to be "hard" scifi, which is implied by your robots question.

The fact that they don't use robots doesnt -really- detract from the rationality. It could be explained simply by them not having the tech, and yeah its possible for a world to exist where they have FTL but not robots. Not to mention that it is a diplomatic mission in practice so they might not be able to use it as it would offend their hosts.

And I think similar things could be said about most of your other points. meaning, I don't think they are the causes for this to not be rational.

Having said all of this i do agree that the story is not really rational, even though it is generally nice. The reason for me is simply that the characters themselves did not act rationally. which is more abstract, but I think going into the specifics is not the solution in this case, because any of the specifics (why wasnt this a military mission could have easily been "solved" by having one of the people mention how "this mission really should have been a military mission, if not for colony politics we should have gotten much better protection" or something similar)

But as a whole there are too many small points which when combined prevent this from being "rational" in my eyes..
