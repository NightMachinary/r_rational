I think some people expect literally everything I write to be rationalist fiction. Most of it isn't. Muse isn't. I don't mind it being posted here because the audiences empirically overlap quite a bit, but I'm not doing that every time I write anything. Thank you for appreciating the story for the not-rationalist-fiction that it is :)
