You're right, but I want to note that they also failed memetic containment by returning and communicating with their home planet in completely unbuffered ways. Surely they had to have guessed that might be an issue, even if it wasn't a thing they considered initially.

So it doesn't really matter what the problem was, they failed big-time, from one end to the other. It is a story of almost literally the worst prepared and acting space explorers that I've ever read. The Nostromo was the goddamn CDC headquarters in comparison.
