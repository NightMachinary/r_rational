I meant a virus which somehow alters the mind in a way that isn't distinguishable from the victims just having a different culture and which the victims eventually aren't aware about. There's just no precedence for a sickness like that.

I assume they just did the normal "Have you been sick any time in the past 2 weeks" procedure for things like a normal flu. I mean some amount of trust is required right, the colony could easily have just shot them out of the sky and they could easily just have bombed the colony from orbit. It's a trade off between safety and getting the most diplomatic stuff done in their mission.
