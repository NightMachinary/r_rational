What? No. That's not...either interactive alien biology exists and should be accounted for, or it doesn't and finding truly strange things sets off literally all the alarm bells. Not that anyone even fucking /checked/.

And if you really can't do a rational approach, you don't throw quarantine protocol out the window. The whole thing is, scientifically speaking, dumb, and the author doesn't even try to lampshade this. Because it is space opera, with less basis than /Alien/ in how space exploration works.

You fail space exploration forever. Please turn in your Heinlein Space Patrol badge and gun, and put on this red shirt. Might as well use a transporter while you're at it.
