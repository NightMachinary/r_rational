I had the good fortune to talk to him at a Denver lit con and asked him about that. He said that he has no intention of writing a novel. He feels the novelette/novella is exactly the right length for exploring the subjects he wants to explore, and stretching them into a novel would be a disservice to his readers and isn't in any way appealing to him.

Obviously nothing in life is certain, but it may be a long time /if/ we ever do get a novel.
