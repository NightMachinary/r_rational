I finally found a romance anime I unequivocally enjoyed, even moreso than such titans as /ToraDora/, /Spice & Wolf/ or /School Days/. Since the romance section here is relatively empty, I think it's worth a look.

The manga ran for years but the show only runs for thirteen episodes, so if you want the rest of the story you'll have to read it. That said, the ending is satisfactory, and shouldn't leave anyone overly angry.

This is the story of Akira Tsubaki and Mikoto Urabe, two young highschool students who become a couple by the end of the first episode and grow closer as the show continues. That's it. There's no evil villain or save-the-world plot lurking around the corner -- their first real relationship is quite challenging enough. This is a story about learning what's okay and not okay and how to convey and reciprocate feelings to your romantic partner. Both characters take a very thoughtful approach to their relationship and don't make terrible decisions purely for the sake of drama.

I should mention the drool. It's kinda important. If it's too gross, then I can't help you. The show rolls with it, and won't make any effort to include people who are repulsed by it. I expect that to have a lot less of an impact on the readers of this subreddit. People have complained about it fetishizing the drool, and I guess it does, but it could have been much, much worse. There's not much fanservice, although one scene goes a bit dumb later on. Whatever. It's better than it has any right to be, and that is quite enough for me.
