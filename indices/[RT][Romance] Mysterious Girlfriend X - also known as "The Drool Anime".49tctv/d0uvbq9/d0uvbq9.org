I watched this recently.

As far as I can tell it's about a saliva wizard who's power has obvious combat potential. She has the ability to mirror her physical state, such as injury or intoxication, onto her opponent by making them taste her spit. She can also perform surface-level mind-reading on anyone who's saliva she tastes. She is abnormally skilled in melee combat with a bladed weapon.

However, as this is set in high school, she instead uses her power as a substitute for proper communication.
