Now imagine that you're a minimally educated manual laborer who spends his life mostly underground at a work site located a few miles from North Korea. You get all your news from rumors, or from overhearing casual chatter by your bosses, which usually ends with them noticing you hanging about and ordering you on your way. Your life is dominated by scary stories and superstitions. You believe you've discovered a Korean infiltrator who plans to blow up your mine--you don't know when exactly--and all of your friends agree. You have the infiltrator outnumbered and surrounded, but he steadfastly insists you've made a mistake.

(leaving aside the part where Dul Misishi in many ways resembles a North Korean labor camp itself)
