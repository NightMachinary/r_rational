You offered a detailed break down. You ignored the relevant details though. The comic made the point that your redefining the problem to keep the hypothesis alive. Let's look at the conversation and see if I'm right.

  One problem with that is that Aaron has been unfailingly lame since the book started. His everyman position would be ruined if he had a secret ancestry.

At this point you haven't yet explained how and why Ben Davidship would ruin his everyman position.

  #+begin_quote
    secret ancestry
  #+end_quote

  Why? Lots of people are ben david no?
#+end_quote

I point out that the scarcity of the quality is non-existent.

  That's a decent argument against, yes, and Scott might decide to go that route, but I hope he doesn't. Technically, it might be trivial within-universe if Aaron happens to have important ancestors. But in a Doylist sense, it would have tension with the everyman theme, however it were rationalized.

You say that it might not be scarce in the book it is still scarce in real life you were after all speaking in "a Doylist sense".

In other words you were only talking about scarcity in the story world and not in real life. The scarcity in real life is the salient point.

I point out that I'm also talking about the scarcity in real life, and there isn't any.

You then decide that it's not about scarcity, then it's not about scarcity in the story world, then it's not about scarcity in the real world. In other words you are redefining the hypothesis.
