I never claimed that scarcity was what would potentially ruin Aaron's everyman position. I think that a secret ancestry ruins his everyman position regardless of whether or not lots of other people share that specific secret ancestry. The trope of "secret ancestry" calls to mind ideas from other stories using that trope, and those ideas being brought to mind would hurt the everyman position, even if those ideas don't apply as well within this specific story. "Doylist" should be read to mean "thematically, in the sense of what ideas it brings to the mind of the reader", not "is this true in the real world". My comment wasn't intended as an argument, just as a description of my point of view that others might or might not share. Nobody else had a problem with my statement. But feel free to disagree with my opinion if you wish, I guess.
