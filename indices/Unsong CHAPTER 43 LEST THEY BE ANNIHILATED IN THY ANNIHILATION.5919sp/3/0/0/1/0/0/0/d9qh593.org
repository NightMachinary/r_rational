The fiction/reality distinction isn't important here.

I think that it smacks of destiny and fate and similar things if your character has an important ancestor and gains plot relevant powers from that, even if there are logical reasons which could explain this ancestry without reference to destiny and fate. I think that this kind of connection to destiny and fate and such would undermine Aaron's everyman position, even if it's true that a lot of people are descended from David.
