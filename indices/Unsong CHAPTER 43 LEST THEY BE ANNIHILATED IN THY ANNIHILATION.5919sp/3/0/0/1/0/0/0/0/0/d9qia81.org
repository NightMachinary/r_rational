Someone said that Aaron might be the Messiah ben David. I said that would be bad because Aaron is more of an everyman and it would ruin that to give him a secret ancestry. You pointed out that lots of people are ben Davids. I responded by saying that, while true, making Aaron the descendant of David would still feel like a plot device despite that. I'm not sure why you're confused.
