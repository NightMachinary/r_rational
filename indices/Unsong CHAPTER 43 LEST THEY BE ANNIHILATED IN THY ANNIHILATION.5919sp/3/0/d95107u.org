Have we met anyone named David? Over at [[/r/unsong][r/unsong]], [[/u/Fluffy_ribbit]] says:

"David means beloved. David is also a child who takes on Giants. David is also a king. The child that David has dishonorably dies in the womb, but he repents and afterward, his son unites Isreal and Judea."

So, Someone who is beloved, someone who takes on powerful forces, and a king. Hmm...

Someone who takes on Giants as in the corporate giants ie. our main characters?

Ana, who is beloved by Aaron, or Aaron, who is beloved by Sarah?

Aaron relates to Aaron and Moses, who was the high priest, and thus ruler, and thus King?

I predict Aaron is the Messiah ben David.
