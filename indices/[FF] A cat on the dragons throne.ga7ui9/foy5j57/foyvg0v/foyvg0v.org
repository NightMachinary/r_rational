I'm enjoying this one. I have to imagine this Joffrey as the older version from the show rather than the book version that acted like a spoiled little kid. Joffery being a spoiled idiot ended up kicking off a lot of the plot and him having a good sense of self-preservation and being willing to sacrifice a lot for it definitely changes things.

I wonder what Tyrion's been up to during all this?
