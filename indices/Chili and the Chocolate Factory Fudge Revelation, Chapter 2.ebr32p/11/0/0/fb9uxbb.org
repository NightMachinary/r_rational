The fact that the person eats one more cookie instead of eating vegetables says that the weight of the 'eat one more cookie' choice is more than the 'eat more vegetables' choice.

The person believes that he should believe that eating vegetables is better than eating cookies, but actually values eating cookies more than eating vegetables. Choosing the more valuable option is what I mean with 'the best option'.
