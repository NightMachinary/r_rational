Well, two out of two for the "A children wins when they actually input what they like best" theory. The actual implementation of that scheme would require a full database about the likes of every children in the world, which would create a 'Likes Best' entry for that children. Those whose input matches that entry wins a ticket. And actually liking something best is harder than it seems.

And now I guess that the next episode will feature the chatters trying to use this strategy, and failing.
