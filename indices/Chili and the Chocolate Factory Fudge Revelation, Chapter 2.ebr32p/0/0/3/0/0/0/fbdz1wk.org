Yeah I'm with you, I think "being able to be liked best by" is different from "more likely to be liked best by" though. I think the answer, for this premise, is that the child who likes cigars best among children would not be granted a golden ticket if there are any adults who like cigars more.

That point about narcissists is a good counterexample, makes me think "what you like more than anyone else on the planet" can't be the answer. Lots of options for likes that are too personal for it to be applicable to any competitors
