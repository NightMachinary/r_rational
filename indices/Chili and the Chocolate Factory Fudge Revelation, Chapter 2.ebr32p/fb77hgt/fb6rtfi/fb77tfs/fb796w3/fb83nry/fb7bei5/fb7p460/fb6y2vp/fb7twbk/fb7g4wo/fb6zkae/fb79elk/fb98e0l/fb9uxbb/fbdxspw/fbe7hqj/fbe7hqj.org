I'm not saying that their choices are the best objective options. I'm just saying that their choices are the best option their brains are calculating, even if those options are objectively harmful. Someone whose life is ruined by alcohol had a brain that was calculating that drinking was the best option before its life was ruined, that calculated that he shouldn't drink at the month he was trying to stay sober, and that calculated that he had to drink again after that month.

Even if the calculator works wrong, it is true that it calculates. That is what I meant when I talked about the meaning of choosing something.
