Of course, I'd completely forgotten about those! Horrifying as they are that's almost a relief, since it could equally have been going in a more simulationist direction (where only the world is modelled in detail, and people aren't supposed to know).

That's not a bad plot in itself, of course, but there's a definite appeal to a setting having complex and strange rules that can't be explained in a sentence, such as 'this whole time the Dahl books were a simulation'. It's also suited more to plots about life outside the simulation or a individual character's journey, and there's too much of an ensemble cast for that to feel like the case here.
