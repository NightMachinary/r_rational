I suppose the part I was trying to answer was whether the events were included just to be 'le random'. While the actual plot of The Witches isn't something that tells us what's going to happen, it explains some basic motivations (witches are cruel, may have specifically planned to get these children, and may scheme towards grand strategies such as electing a figurehead for some purpose) and gives a precedent to some abilities (i.e. the feel of the magic in The Witches matches what was possible here).

It's a definite dream sequence of events, but it seems likely to follow an internal logic through the story as we learn more about them, in the same way that the selection of winners will make sense in the context of the setting.
