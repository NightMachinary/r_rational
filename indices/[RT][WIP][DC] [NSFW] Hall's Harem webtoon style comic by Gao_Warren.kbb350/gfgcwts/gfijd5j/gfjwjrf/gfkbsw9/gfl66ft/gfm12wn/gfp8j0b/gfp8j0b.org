  the same woman could potentially get sent to 2 or more time periods
#+end_quote

Would it be advantageous to her though? I think it would suffice to send the most recent and knowledgeable version of yourself (or the one with the least quota, after sharing all knowledge which might be useful) to the earliest time period to get all the advantage you can, and just forget about quotas of all the other versions. Actually, radically minimizing your quota in this way would be the real advantage here.
