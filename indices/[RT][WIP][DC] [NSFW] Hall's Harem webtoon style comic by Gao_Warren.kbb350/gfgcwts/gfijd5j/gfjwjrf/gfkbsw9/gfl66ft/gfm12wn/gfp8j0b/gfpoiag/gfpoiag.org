Hmmm. The thing that would really determine the utility of multiple revisits is whether the histories of the women still in the afterlife would get "updated" once someone goes back. If so, then multiple revisits would give a person multiple chances to "get things right", if something went wrong or changing the timeline had unforeseen negative consequences. However, that's assuming that they're being sent back to the "main" timeline, and not just some 1:1 scale simulation. They're all "copies" after all.

Unfortunately, as far as we know, multiple versions of the same person haven't shown up, so this is all probably moot.

On further thought though, while it's possible that they won't be sent back to the main timeline, there's no reason that all the women won't get sent back to the *same* timeline. If this is the case, that would up the stakes and make the lower quotas even more important, since you could end up in active competition with another time traveler, especially if they share a goal that requires a monopolistic approach to accomplish.
