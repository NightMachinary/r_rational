Ah sorry my fault for not reading closer. As you say they haven't really addressed that (yet?). My best guesses would be a toss up between most "used" image and first ever "used" image for each woman. Otherwise it'd be unfair to the other women, since the same woman could potentially get sent to 2 or more time periods.

But that makes me wonder, do any of them come from the exact same source, and if so how would that work? Would they have to both be involved or it doesn't count? Would they share a quota? Would they split "uses" between them or both have the full amount? I guess we'll know more when they figure out what the exact criteria is
