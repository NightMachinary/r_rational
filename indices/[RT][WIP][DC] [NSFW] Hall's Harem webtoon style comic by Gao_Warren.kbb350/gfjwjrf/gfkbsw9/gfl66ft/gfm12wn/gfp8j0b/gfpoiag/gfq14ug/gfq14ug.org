  The thing that would really determine the utility of multiple revisits is whether the histories of the women still in the afterlife would get "updated" once someone goes back. If so, then multiple revisits would give a person multiple chances to "get things right", if something went wrong or changing the timeline had unforeseen negative consequences.

Hm, that's a good thought, I didn't think about the iterative approach :)

#+begin_quote
  there's no reason that all the women won't get sent back to the same timeline. If this is the case, that would up the stakes and make the lower quotas even more important, since you could end up in active competition with another time traveler, especially if they share a goal that requires a monopolistic approach to accomplish.

Yup, that's how I was imagining it (as a single timeline in the living world + a place outside space and time where the story is set), unless there will be some contradictions suggesting a more complex model. I'd say the quotas wouldn't be as important in that case as returning to an earlier point in time: as long as you fulfill your quota, it doesn't matter how long did it take.

Another possible variant: facing possible competition, a good winning strategy could involve cooperation between a woman with a low quota and a woman with a quota so high that her hopes to fulfill it are low (or she doesn't want to do it at all). The first one gets out ASAP and cooperates with the other one in the living world, sharing profits, and the other one keeps competitors from fulfilling their quotas using whatever means she can :)
