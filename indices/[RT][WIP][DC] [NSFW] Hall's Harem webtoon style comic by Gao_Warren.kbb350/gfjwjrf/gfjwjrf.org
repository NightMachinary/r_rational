One question I have that didn't seem immediately answered was how did it choose which time to take when he masturbated multiple times to the same individual? Like if he watched three videos of someone and came to each one surely that would not mean three versions?

Would it be the last one he masturbated to (so perhaps they don't remember), or the most recent picture of them? If it's the girl in the water I'd be surprised if he never masturbated to a more recent version of her if he was really into her for that many years after this photo.

Similarly applies to when during the shooting they were brought through, seems like most of them were still dressed which surprises me if it's moment of orgasm

I'm going to keep reading to see if gets brought up or if I missed something in the intro video that explains it

I guess it will address the question of what counts as having sex for the purpose of reducing the counter

Also it's a good thing he only started masturbating to people who are over 18 but there should be a line about that like "I had a genetic disorder so I couldn't jerk off until I was 18", ezpz
