Well, let's think about it physically. If ONLY blood can't pass through it, then any body part that does would have the blood forced out of it.

If this happens slowly, things are probably OK for a minute or two, but without oxygenated blood tissues will start dying off fairly quickly.

If it happens fast, then you've got a problem. Because the circulatory system is one-way, you're going to have some backflow problems. Because you're pushing all the blood out along a plane, the blood can't move from the arterial side to the venous side. You'd be drastically increasing pressure back along the arterial system, which would affect the heart and lungs. The venous side would be a little less affected, being lower pressure anyway. However, if you were moving the body part backwards through the ward, you could blow out your venous system, since there are one-way valves that block blood from backflowing.

And this would only get worse the faster/harder you passed the plane of the ward. If someone slammed you into it, imagine all the blood in your body just bursting out of you on whichever side of your body passed the ward last.
