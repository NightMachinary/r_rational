Almost same as regular barrier/solid wall, your finger stops. Blood is fairly evenly distributed in your body and instead of you skin being stopped by wall and then it in turn stopping flesh which stops bones which etc etc etc, this time its just blood which still has EM presence (unless blood ward interferes with tangibility of blood) that stops flesh that stops bones and so on and so forth.
