It depends on whether it's a field or a wall.

If it's a wall, then nothing much happens. Your blood hits the side of your capillaries and effectively transmits the force to the nearest part of your body.

If it's a field that applies a 10g horizontal acceleration inside of its volume, then you can push your hand (or entire body) into the field. (I'm assuming 5 l of blood in a 50 kg person (10.567 pints in 110 lb)). While in the field, the total force on your body would be like climbing a 45 degree slope at 1.41g, which is totally possible. The difference in pressure between your furthest-forward and furthest-back points is 1.3mmHg/mm, or enough to drop your blood pressure to zero (or double it) in four inches. This would almost certainly cause you to pass out, or cause death if you went in head/feet first.
