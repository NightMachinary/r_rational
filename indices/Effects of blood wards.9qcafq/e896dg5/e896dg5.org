Something to consider though is that a blood ward that can act upon the blood inside of a person's body implies that the body has no (effective) inherent/passive magic resistance. If that's the case, this universe makes it /extremely easy/ to kill people with magic---to the point that without constantly-maintained active magic defenses, anyone can just go around popping blood vessels in brains and killing people.

That's why in MoL for example, there's passive magic defenses on each person. So I'd assume in a case like a blood ward, the ward would either not be able to sense the presence of blood below the skin and would be ineffective or the body's passive magic defenses would distribute the repulsive force across the body to make it no different from a wall or force field.

Don't forget about the implications of your magic on the practicality of the setting when designing it.
