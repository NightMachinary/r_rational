The only really interesting part I feel would be the injuries.

if you walked up and tried gently pushing through, pretty much nothing would happen, except maybe a few bruises.

If you tried consistently going through it, or laying on it, it would slowly deprive small parts of your body of blood. It doesn't seem like it would be dramatic, but it would cause some weird illnesses/injuries.

Slammed into it? Vessels pop all over the place. Quick death. Maybe even painless.
