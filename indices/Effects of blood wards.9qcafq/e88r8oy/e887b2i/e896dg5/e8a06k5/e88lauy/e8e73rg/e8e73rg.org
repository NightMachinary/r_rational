Munchkin time: such a ward can be used to stop bleeding as if it were a band-aid. It could even stop otherwise deadly injuries if you can contour its shape around where the skin would normally be.

Military application - a blood-ward body suit makes for an unusually resillient soldier because most minor injuries are simply cosmetic. A career soldier might end up being more concerned about the mana reaerves than the injuries (1 ward left unspent, so still as good as uninjured)

You can clean surgical tools quickly, though maybe germs get left behind.

Actually, you could clean up all sorts of blood illnesses by using a blood ward to direct blood one way and everything else another. Imagine an implant that slows the spread of certain cancers by diverting blood out of your body and back in through such a ward while it captures everything else.

On another track, preparing meat for consumption gets easier (cheaper) since you can use the ward to drain the blood instead of having to wait for it

Actually what counts as blood? Plasma? Platelets? A specific mix with just the right set of ratios normally seen in human blood?
