how much force can such a ward produce/withstand?

Does a ward keeps the blood out of an area or functions like a selective wall?

Is it repelling blopd going in and out?

What do you count as blood? Blood plasma, Red/white blood cells? Haemoglobin?

I would guess it is a selective wall.

I assume the strength of the ward depends on some factors

  What would happen if someone put their finger through it?

Then the ward is really weak or there is no "blood" in the finger. (I doubt you could empty a finger of blood with a blood ward, since it would trap at least some blood. And then it is a question what can withstand more force? The cells the blood is pushing on or the ward)

but i guess if you could have a bloodless finger you would have the same damage as you would with a tourniquet.

  Tried to force their way in?

What is stronger? The ward or the body of someone trying to force themselves in?

I would guess the same thing if you try to foce your way into a similar strong wall

#+begin_quote
  Was slammed into it?

Like they were slammed into a similar strong wall.

Unless they were really fast and it was a strong ward. Then you would have blood mist outside and bloodless meat inside.
