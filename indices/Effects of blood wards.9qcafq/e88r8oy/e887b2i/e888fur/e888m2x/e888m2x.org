If it repels blood, then blood is pushed like on a wall, but blood is liquid so it pushes against itself in your body, it can leave small empty space in your veins if they bypass barrier and blood is left behind. But I don't think blood is compressible so all you would be doing is raising your blood pressure much like squeezing your finger with strong rubber band makes it pop.
