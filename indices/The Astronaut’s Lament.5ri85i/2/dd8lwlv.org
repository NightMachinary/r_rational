I like it, but I feel like there's something missing. Maybe it's just because I've seen this kind of reveal done before in other rational fiction that it feels like a cliche at this point. The story has some interesting ideas and I do like how it explores the relationship between scientists/engineers and the people who use their creations, but the direction it goes just seems rote and uninspired. I shouldn't be too hard on this thing since it does exactly what it's supposed to and does it perfectly well, I just found the reveal and ending a bit underwhelming.
