The story doesn't go into it, and isn't part of any continuity, but some of the base was [[http://alexanderwales.com/world-building-minorities/][this post]], originally an entry into the weekly challenge for [[/r/worldbuilding]] (prompt "Minorities"). Also the basis for a half-completed book sitting in my drafts folder.
