It's a bet that has a very low chance of going wrong, but if/when it does, it wipes out all the gains you make plus a bit more (so the expected utility of it is negative, even if the odds of the bad part happening are super low).

It's like if you used the statement 'all swans are white' as an example of a certainty, and then someone discovered an entire new continent you had no way of knowing even existed and it had black swans on it (i.e. Australia). It's a pretty convincing deathblow to the notion of certainty.
