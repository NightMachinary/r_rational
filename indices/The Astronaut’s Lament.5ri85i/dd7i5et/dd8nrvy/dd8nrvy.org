That doesn't really affect the ending, though. You'll still need non-mages to perform interstellar transport. Even if you turn non-mages into mages on the receiving end, they're going to have a history of identifying as non-mages, and will hopefully be sympathetic to the non-mage goals.

The real problem would be when a method of turning mages into non-mages is made, which would allow mages to check up on the distant colonies.
