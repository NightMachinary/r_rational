(I'd like to remark that the title of this post is not very good. The word "rational" has no business there; a more concrete adjective should be used ("precise" and "useful" come to mind). There is an article by Eliezer somewhere that says something like "every time the word 'rational' is used it loses some of its power". I agree.)
