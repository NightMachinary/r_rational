  Is there any ambiguity allowed in the definition? Can I say my phone is an object, while still saying that the battery is an object, or does it have to be both or neither?

Less ambiguity is always better, but I'm certainly going to insist on perfection.

Liquids really do need to be covered somehow. They're just too common.

I would envision a screw as part of the board it's screwed into, but that opens up questions like "how deep?" as you point out.
