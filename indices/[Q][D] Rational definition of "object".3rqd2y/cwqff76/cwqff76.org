Consideration from actual physics -

I remember this demo from physics class, where we took two crystals or glass or something, and you shined a laser through them at an angle, while moving them closer together. At the start, the laser responded as if traveling through both medium changes (air -> glass -> air -> glass -> air), but when you got close enough, the effect the middle air gap disappeared.

Similarly, everything's got surface tension. Gas, and solids made up of other solids (dirt) are where it gets interesting.

Alternative, based entirely on magic - Magic uses the user's understanding of "object". Change your understanding, change the effect (although this is difficult). Also does interesting things when the user can't actually properly conceive of the entire thing, like "mountain" or "the earth".
