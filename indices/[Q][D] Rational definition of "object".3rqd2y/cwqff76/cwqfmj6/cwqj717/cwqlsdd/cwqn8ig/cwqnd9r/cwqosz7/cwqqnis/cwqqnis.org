When she timeshifts (goes into her borrowed time), the world around her is frozen in time. She can bring objects into her time with her if they fit completely within a certain volume. This is really important when she needs to get through a door; if the door is an object unto itself then she can bring it into timeshift with her and open it. If it's part of the wall, then it's an invulnerable barrier.

This was a major plot point, because the team needed to deal with a group of terrorists on a bus and she couldn't get the door of the bus open.

(Note that there are some edge cases on her power. Gases (e.g. air) are sufficiently diffuse that whatever part of it is inside her zone can be treated as an object. The four fundamental forces continue to work normally, so she can see and she could point a laser at something. Once something has been brought into timeshift it remains there even if it goes outside her zone. Certain objects, such as living things, can't be brought into timeshift at all. Freestanding objects, again including living beings, can be picked up and carried around, although they are invulnerable.)
