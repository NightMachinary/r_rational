  Were the "is" and "isn't" in the rust example supposed to be switched?

A hinged door is not part of the frame because the two or three parts of the hinge are separate objects.

If the door is rusted shut it's not an object, the rust is a bond between the hinge and the frame making the frame (and probably the wall, if it's painted) part of the same object.

  A one-object-target spell couldn't affect "handcuffs", it would have to affect one piece of a handcuff.

There's no reason that a spell can't effect multiple objects at a time, you'll just have to understand what the parts are and include them all. Like, those little pins and springs inside a lock.

  I think it would make for some counterintuitive results until the reader got dialed in.
#+end_quote

That's a bonus. Getting people to figure something like that out helps suck them in to the story.
