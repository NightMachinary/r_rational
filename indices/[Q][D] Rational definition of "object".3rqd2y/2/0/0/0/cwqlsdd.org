  Then you say "no, THAT door wasn't an object, because it was just nailed together, THIS one is because it's glued" or "of course a conventionally hinged door is an object, but that one isn't because it's rusted shut, whack it a few times THEN teleport it out, dummy".

Were the "is" and "isn't" in the rust example supposed to be switched?

This is interesting. So, that would mean that each board in a door that was nailed together would be a separate object, and a pair of handcuffs would be three or four separate objects. (The jaws of each cuff are held together with pins.) A one-object-target spell couldn't affect "handcuffs", it would have to affect one piece of a handcuff.

It would be a consistent definition, although I think it would make for some counterintuitive results until the reader got dialed in. It would also be a power-up for a lot of abilities and a nerf for others.

I think I've already locked myself out of this definition in Induction; I wish I'd asked sooner.
