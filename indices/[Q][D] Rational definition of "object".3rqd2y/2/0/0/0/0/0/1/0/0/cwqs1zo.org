  This was a major plot point, because the team needed to deal with a group of terrorists on a bus and she couldn't get the door of the bus open.

Not a problem. The bus door may have all kinds of electrical connections, mechanical connections, gaskets, sealing compounds, etc. So, like, she could open the door, except for this wire that's part of the wiring harness of the whole frigging bus that would have to bend...

Similarly, she can't open the windows because the gasket around the edge of the glass would have to bend, and it's part of the bus object.

Also, she probably tears her shoes up horribly walking on grass.
