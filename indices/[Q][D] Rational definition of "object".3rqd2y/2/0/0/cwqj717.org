  How would this work in practice when it comes to something like "is this door an object?"
#+end_quote

You could say "an object is anything you can separate without breaking atomic bonds". With scale factors to exclude things like van-der-waals forces.

Then you say "no, THAT door wasn't an object, because it was just nailed together, THIS one is because it's glued" or "of course a conventionally hinged door is an object, but that one isn't because it's rusted shut, whack it a few times THEN teleport it out, dummy".

That would actually make an interesting magic system that would be well suited to things like mysteries. "Then I realized that the thief couldn't have come through the window because it was painted shut, so it HAD to be the butler...".
