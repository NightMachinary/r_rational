Object-oriented magic needs a definition of object, but not all magic systems are object-oriented. If you're looking for a magic system that stands up to heavy scrutiny, I'd suggest staying away from anything object-oriented.

With that out of the way, here are a few of the solutions I've used for the "object problem".

- Objects are defined by what people think constitutes an object. This implies that someone sufficiently psychotic would be capable of affecting different things.
- Objects are defined by group consensus. If you have the ability to affect "cats", the definition of a cat depends on what everyone in the world would call a cat. Not subject to the lone psychotic problem.
- Objects are defined by the magic system itself. I've used this for systems where the world itself is an object-oriented simulation; if you break a chair apart into pieces, each piece becomes its own object, but if you go too small they become particle effects instead.
- Objects are defined by some external agent. Every time you want to check objectness, the external agent takes a look at what you're trying to do and says "yea" or "nay". Indistinguishable from authorial fiat, so isn't great under scrutiny.
