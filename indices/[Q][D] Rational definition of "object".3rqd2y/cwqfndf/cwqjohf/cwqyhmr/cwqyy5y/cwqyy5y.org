Maybe the language of the gods is one of those that rely on a few simple words and lots of composite words (polysynthetic language).

In any case, even when new things are invented that have names that can't be addressed by magic, the definition of "object" itself will still make sense, so you can affect them with any spell that targets a generic object.
