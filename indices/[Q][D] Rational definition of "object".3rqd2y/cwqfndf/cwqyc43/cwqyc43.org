You don't need a psychotic. You just need someone who is willing to think of arbitrary targets as objects. Once he manages to think that, it becomes self-fulfilling because the fact that the spell works reinforces the idea in his mind, making such spells continue to work.

Mind you, I'm not convinced that even for ordinary people, there is a consistent "what people think constitutes an object". If you ask people whether a specific number of sand grains is a heap, there will be a small size that is not a heap, a large size that is, and an intermediate size where people say it is or is not a heap depending on their mood. There will be intermediate "objects" as well.
