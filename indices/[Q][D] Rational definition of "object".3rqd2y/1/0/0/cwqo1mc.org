  What happens when Elly uses her thread powers on smaller fibers within a thread?
#+end_quote

/waves hands, talks fast/

I don't have a good answer to this. I'll figure something out, though.

#+begin_quote
  Can she "work out" to affect larger coils of rope (as well as whatever large braids of rope are called -- what they use for anchoring big ships)
#+end_quote

She can simultaneously straighten all the threads that constitute the cable (assuming it's a cotton / hemp / etc cable instead of steel), but unfortunately her power doesn't work literally simultaneously. Individual threads would straighten slightly sooner than others, and would rip through the others, casing the whole cable to fall apart.

(EDIT: She could also just straighten 1..N of the threads in the cable, which would still shred it.)

What she could do, though, is knit a tube out of one single thread and straighten that. And, in theory, if you got an enormously long thread and doubled it back and forth enough times you could make an anchorline that would both hold a ship and be straightenable. Assuming you did, what happened when she straightened it would depend on how you made the loops; most knots (e.g. a [[http://www.animatedknots.com/bowline/][bowline]]) will tighten down and bell out into indestructible loops. On the other hand, if you made your loops by doubling the cable back on itself and securing it with steel wire, it would straighten and rip the wire apart.

  What if Bag Man (sorry I'm forgetting the names of your characters on my iPad at the moment) -- what if he loaded up his backpack while in atypical environmental situations to stir times with special properties? For example, a sub-zero freezer or in a forge to store frozen water or red-hot pokers?
#+end_quote

Quinn. Yep, he could do that. He'd need to be careful about pulling the red-hot pokers out, though.

  After her most recent experience, Rachel will really be interested in being able to escape more easily -- so I could see her carrying around her own utility belt with things like grease, lockpick-gun, canisters of liquid nitrogen or acetylene torch. and perhaps have the bag guy store larger items like a bolt cutters, car-jack, arc-welder, jackhammer/other pneumatic/construction equipment, quadcopters/drones, and other things to toss out when she needs extra help during her time-stop phase to turn things into an object she can manipulate. Basically anything she can manipulate while Time-Stopped that can in turn, manipulate things in ways she cannot.
#+end_quote

Very true, although it wouldn't have helped her in that particular case. All of those things would be great for getting the handcuffs off before she outtimed, but she couldn't use her power right then because she was waiting to pay off the last use. Even if she had been able to, the handcuffs+chain+I-beam was too large for her to bring it into her Time Stop effect so it would have been completely invulnerable and unopenable. If there's an object that she can't timeshift with her she can pick it up and move it around, (e.g., pick up a person and carry them), but she can't change anything about them by, e.g., hitting them with a hammer or unbuttoning their shirt.

  Can Monique practice a series of standard movements like a martial artist and eventually automatically "program and execute macros", allowing her to manipulate a lot more objects in a more systematic way? Can she work on smaller and smaller prisms, and if given a near-infinite supply of millimeter sized prisms covered in superglue, rapidly create a crude utility fog of massive objects?
#+end_quote

Quite possibly, yes. She's still new to her powers.

#+begin_quote
  Edit: (Or even better, they are wrapped with string and a capsule of super glue so Elly choose to glue the prisms together and she/Monique can make it move around by eithe manipulating the strings or the prisms as a crystalline-threaded battle bot)
#+end_quote

This raises issues of shape -- once you glue things together they get counted as one object, so 'triangle + a thread sticking out forward' is not a triangle and therefore she can't control it. The bladesheets are more or less what you're talking about, though -- they are a triangular sheet of fabric with Elly's threads sewed into pockets, sticking out just a millimeter or so in order to not cross her threshold of 'not smooth'.
