Best and most consistent explanation I can think of is this. Wizard dude tries to target something with a spell. Magical energy, using physics not known to this universe, starts to accumulate in the object, just like electric charge. Magical energy has the property that it conducts to all atoms sharing electron clouds from the target point.

So a single, monolithic block of metal in vacuum is the easiest thing to target. It requires the least amount of energy to cast the spell.

A block of metal in air is harder, because the gas molecules carry away "charge", but doable.

And so on. There's a coupling effect as well, where molecules of the type that is similar to the target point are easier to charge than ones that are not similar.

At least this makes sense and it's not affected by anyone opinion of what should happen. It also means that if you target, say, a specific human, with the spell impacting their chest, if they are holding hands with another human the spell will spread pretty smoothly to them. And so on. A rusted door will be harder to target than a door that isn't rusted to the frame, but a door that is welded to the frame will basically require that your spell act on the frame as well.
