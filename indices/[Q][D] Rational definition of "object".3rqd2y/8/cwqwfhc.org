I argue that the definition of an object depends on what object it is. Consider dirt stuck to a car. Is the dirt a part of it? As a car, the dirt is not part of it. As a generic object, the dirt is a part of it. If you want to lift the car you have to lift the dirt too. If you want to fix the car you don't care about the dirt and can safely get rid of it if it's in the way.
