Is there any ambiguity allowed in the definition? Can I say my phone is an object, while still saying that the battery is an object, or does it have to be both or neither?

I'm thinking something about how strongly bonded something is. If two things are sitting on top of each other, they're not an object, but if they're glued by a strong enough adhesive, they are. If you hold onto something hard enough, then the friction is strong enough that it counts as part of you. Although if you go that route then anything sufficiently heavy just becomes part of Earth.

Water doesn't seem like it's held together very well though, so if you counted it as an object, you'd pretty much have to count everything as one giant object. Are you allowed to not count it? This could be a problem because it means your blood doesn't count. You could get around this by saying anything enclosed in an object counts as part of the object so long as the holes are smaller than some really small size.

Does 'wearing' have to be treated differently than 'holding'?

Edit: If I have a screw that I screw into something, does it become part of that object? Does it matter how tightly I screw it? I could see it counting as an object if I'm making a hole in wood by screwing it in, but not if I screw it into a nut where there's room for it and it doesn't press against it.
