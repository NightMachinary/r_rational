You're getting too theoretical with the definition of "object". Think about the intuitive, physical sense of the word, and it is about MANIPULATION. We primarily manipulate objects with our HANDS, so naturally, what we consider objects can be easily manipulated with one or both hands. Thus, a car is an object (we could potentially roll it by pushing really hard when it is in neutral) but a building is not an object (unless you're superman.)

If we alter our method of manipulation from hands to say... multi-tools, or large robot claws, or octopus body-parts, etc. we get at the core issue, in my opinion.

Screws in a door are objects if you have a screwdriver. A brick in a wall is an object if you have a solvent that dissolves the mortar or a vibratory robot claw. Water underwater is an object if you suck it into your ink pouch and squirt it at your enemy.

Object-oriented Magic should initially starts off at the "gross motor" level of development in fiction, like a baby able to rake something towards themselves, and then toss it across the room. Then, it can progress to fine motor, like opening up a can of food and shaking it around to make a mess. Then, it can go even further to precision motor skills, like lock-picking or surgery. Or go bigger with progressively heavier object manipulation like weights, cars, buildings, planets, etc.

Ultimately, individual wave-form/particles can be manipulated if you possess the tenacious mind of HPJEV and his high-fidelity imagination/visualization. (Although in my opinion, he shouldn't be able to do that unless he's scrutinizing it under an electron microscope to even begin getting a handle on it.)
