In regards to Change Storms:

What happens when Elly uses her thread powers on smaller fibers within a thread? Can she "work out" to affect larger coils of rope (as well as whatever large braids of rope are called -- what they use for anchoring big ships)

What if Bag Man (sorry I'm forgetting the names of your characters on my iPad at the moment) -- what if he loaded up his backpack while in atypical environmental situations to stir times with special properties? For example, a sub-zero freezer or in a forge to store frozen water or red-hot pokers?

After her most recent experience, Rachel will really be interested in being able to escape more easily -- so I could see her carrying around her own utility belt with things like grease, lockpick-gun, canisters of liquid nitrogen or acetylene torch. and perhaps have the bag guy store larger items like a bolt cutters, car-jack, arc-welder, jackhammer/other pneumatic/construction equipment, quadcopters/drones, and other things to toss out when she needs extra help during her time-stop phase to turn things into an object she can manipulate. Basically anything she can manipulate while Time-Stopped that can in turn, manipulate things in ways she cannot.

Can Monique practice a series of standard movements like a martial artist and eventually automatically "program and execute macros", allowing her to manipulate a lot more objects in a more systematic way? Can she work on smaller and smaller prisms, and if given a near-infinite supply of millimeter sized prisms covered in superglue, rapidly create a crude utility fog of massive objects?

Edit: (Or even better, they are wrapped with string and a capsule of super glue so Elly choose to glue the prisms together and she/Monique can make it move around by eithe manipulating the strings or the prisms as a crystalline-threaded battle bot)
