You don't have to encode a complete taxonomy into "consensus-based" magic OOP semantics. Just grab all the human brains around at the time, and extract a template neurotypical human from it; and then, when you want to do an OOP identification, simulate a human-instance that was born in that time period and had average learning experiences, and ask that simulated human to create an Interactive Fiction-like object model of the current "scene."

One of the fun things about this mechanic is that if everyone in some time period believes in the "atomicity" of something like "blood", then you can't ask magic to select out parts of it; but once the compound nature of a thing becomes common knowledge, then magic suddenly gets more scientifically-minded as well.

An interesting question is how to "pick between" the several multi-level models that co-exist within the human mind: thinking of blood as a liquid, as cells, as proteins, as molecules, as atoms, etc. My suggestion: don't. Instead, presuming the magic system has a "cost" for a spell, present the most "intuitive" model-level of a given phenomenon as the least-costly one to use, and have cost rise exponentially the less intuitive the model-level becomes.

Also, note that this breaks if transhumans try to use human-derived magic, because they no longer follow the human-template the magic system is using. That's an interesting plot-point. :)
