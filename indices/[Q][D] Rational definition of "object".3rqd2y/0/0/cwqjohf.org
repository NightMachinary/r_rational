  Objects are defined by group consensus. If you have the ability to affect "cats", the definition of a cat depends on what everyone in the world would call a cat. Not subject to the lone psychotic problem.

Even better is to make it so that the definition depends on what everyone in the world called a cat at some well-defined point in the past. For example, when a demi-god a thousand years ago first "tamed" magic and made it suitable for human use or something like that.

This way, magic works as expected even in the event of massive psychosis or near-extinction of sentient beings.
