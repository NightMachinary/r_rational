Objects are solids that your protagonist touches that could be moved sideways via a vibration (the "magic vibration") and wouldn't encounter other solids. Maybe limited to a certain mass or volume.

Dresses and shoes fit. Cellphones fit. books, swords, sandwiches fit. Doors and windows don't. Cars, possibly. People, possibly. Holograms, no. Shadows, no. Liquids, possibly (maybe liquids and gas count always but only inside the mass/volume limitations).You should define touch anyway.

This also has interesting outcomes, for example you can't carry things when you're buried underground. You can't carry pants while you sit on a small chair. You would leave shoes back when performing magic in a field of grass. Etc.
