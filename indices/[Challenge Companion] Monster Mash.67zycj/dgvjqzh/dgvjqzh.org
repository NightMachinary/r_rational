I'd like to thank everybody (especially [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]]) for participating in the writing challenge. I've had arresting anxiety over sharing fiction with others for years and years, and I got some upvotes without any strange personal nightmares coming true. I think it's the coolest thing we could use [[/r/rational][r/rational]] for. :)
