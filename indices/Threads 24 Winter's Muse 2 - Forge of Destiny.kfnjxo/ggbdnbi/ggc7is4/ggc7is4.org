I mean it's not as mathematical as delve. But the MC is doing their best everything considered. Last few chapters showed a lot of insight into her self and goals. So far i say the MC is lucky but not in any plot armor or overbearing way. Opposition to the MC is well thought out and not just a caricature. The novel also manages well to insert cultivation titans into the story and their interaction with low level cultivators. All the characters are well fleshed out and have their own goals and motivations to follow.
