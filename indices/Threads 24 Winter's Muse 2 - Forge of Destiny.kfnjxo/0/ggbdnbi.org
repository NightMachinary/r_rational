While I don't want to comment on my opinions about this story as a whole, I do wanna ask; is this actually rational fiction? The protagonist does the typical fantasy student thing of just aimlessly bouncing from one power up to the next, and no broader goals are ever really stated. It's not badly written at all, but I think it's very much a product of its genre's tropes.
