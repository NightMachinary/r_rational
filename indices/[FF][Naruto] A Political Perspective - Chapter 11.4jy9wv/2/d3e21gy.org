Very interesting so far. It's playing off the concept of a 'Council' which I believe is non-canon, but the blending of it as a story element for forcing early-group teamwork between the members of Team Seven is quite ingenious. The fact T7 is all bonding better is lovely, especially in how their various quirks are being altered.

Although I don't think Sakura was having issues regarding what she ate in canon, or anything but her canonical 'good at theory, bad at practical' issue in melee fighting. The 'orange is unstealthy' aspect of a number of fanfic is always kinda baffling considering the outfits basically everyone seems to wear in naruto canon generally not fitting stealth all that well.
