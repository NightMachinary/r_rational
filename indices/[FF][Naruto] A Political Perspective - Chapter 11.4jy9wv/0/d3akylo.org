I think I came across this in a comment on this sub.

The Leaf is a real military dictatorship, and our dear supreme leader and one of his top officers are put in a precarious situation when Team 7 honestly passes Kalashi's test after the council "ordered" him to pass them regardless of their aptitude.

Great writing and character development for the whole team, and Kakashi's proud teacher moments have really moved me. All in all, I think this is great fun.
