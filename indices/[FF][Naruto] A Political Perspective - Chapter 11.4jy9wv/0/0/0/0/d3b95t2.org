Hm? No, it doesn't really affect my enjoyment negatively; I just like to have a dialogue between myself and content creators. It's why I like watching streams, and interacting in Marked For Death, for instance. I seldom give unsolicited criticisms or anything, I just like giving direct encouragement; and when an author doesn't have pre- or post-scripts for their fiction, it's hard to tell if they look at reviews and such.
