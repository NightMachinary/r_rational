From the sounds of it the Great Northern Wilderness has nothing in terms of danger to the deeper levels of the dungeon. There's just not enough ambient mana to support creatures that are that dangerous, and he's already made some cash hunting down monsters in the Wilderness and selling their parts for raw materials before (like just before meeting Silverlake for the first time).

More likely for the danger to come in form of accidentally trespassing on someone else's territory, like the shifters', instead of chance of actual personal harm coming to him.
