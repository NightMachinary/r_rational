Yup. I have this thought from many chapters ago that Zorian would be a toymaker after his graduation. His main product being a 'doll' for small girls. His clientele including Eldemar military, noble and merchant house with too much money lying around, and well-to-do groups of dungeon delver badly in need for disposable vanguard.

For more immediate money problem, I agree Zorian can craft a persona using his simulacrum. Just like Mr Kesir. But instead telling people about conspiracy, he would supply materials from the Great Northern Wilderness. Or Green Hell, for that matter.
