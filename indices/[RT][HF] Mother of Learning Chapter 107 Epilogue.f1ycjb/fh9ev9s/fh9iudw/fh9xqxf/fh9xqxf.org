Safe houses, of course. With the war looming, he would want a comfortable pocket dimension with Xvim-certified "adequate" security installed. That means army of golem posed as little girls' doll or ordinary furniture. Not to mention non-perishable supplies and supplier contact to get the perishable ones to entertain his guests once the danger comes.

And maybe securing instruction from other archmages. Remember 2 dimensional mages Quatach-Ichl recommend? It would be a waste for Zorian to not contacting them before trying Quatach-Ichl again for further instruction (LOL). After all, the Bone's skill expanding Cyorian's Time Dillation facility in only three weeks is nothing but /absurdly/ awe-inspiring.
