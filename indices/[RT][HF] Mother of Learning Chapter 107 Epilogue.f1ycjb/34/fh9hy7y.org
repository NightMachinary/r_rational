This is excellent. I can say it now: MoL is my favourite novel of all times - and I read a /lot/ of novels.

A single epilogue chapter is, of course, not enough to touch all plot threads in detail, nor is it meant to. As the author said, that would be sequel material. This, instead, was used to provide a general outline of the closure, and it's certainly up to the task.

I shall eagrly await for [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] 's next work!
