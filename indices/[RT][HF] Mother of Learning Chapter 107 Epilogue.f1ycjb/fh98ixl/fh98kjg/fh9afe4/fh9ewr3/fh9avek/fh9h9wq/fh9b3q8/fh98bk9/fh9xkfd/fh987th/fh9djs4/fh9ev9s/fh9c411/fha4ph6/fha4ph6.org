I'll have you know, you little noble daughter, that not even Vatimah Tinc, the chief of local Mage Guild double as the leader of Cult of Dragon Below, can boast about having more expertise than me. Not his mind magic, his soul magic, his blood magic, or even any of his less sinister branch of magic. None!

... Uh, maybe excepting his expertise in raising a conspiracy. Or keep all of it hush-hush. Yeah, maybe I should keep silent.
