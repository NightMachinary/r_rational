It's been stated that magical creature needs certain level of ambient mana to continue living. The more powerful a creature, the thicker ambient mana they need just to survive. It would be no doubt there would be all manner of deadly creature in the depth of the Hole.

Also, this haven't been talked about in the last few chapters, but there's a reason why Zorian never mention about reacquiring magical ability through blood magic. He would be confined to dense cities or risk weakening.
