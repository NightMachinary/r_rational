This happened in an earlier chapter but I never fully understood and I wondering if anyone would explain it to me. Why did Zorian kill the original Zorian. I understand taking his body to save the world and all that. But why did he destroy his originals soul afterwards instead of just storing it and giving original Zorian his body back later. Loop Zorian could wait and get a new body for himself and then return original Zorian to his body. Sure there would be complications and it would suck for the original Zorian but surely its better then being dead?
