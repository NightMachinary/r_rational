  No way. Grey Hunters are terrifying mage killers that even professional combat mages fear fighting. Zorian originally planned to use it to scare off Oganj, a Dragon Mage. Getting the eggs just made the already impossible task for student mage Zorian even more insane. There's a reason that even with combat god Zach's help it still took them many tries to get the eggs successfully.
