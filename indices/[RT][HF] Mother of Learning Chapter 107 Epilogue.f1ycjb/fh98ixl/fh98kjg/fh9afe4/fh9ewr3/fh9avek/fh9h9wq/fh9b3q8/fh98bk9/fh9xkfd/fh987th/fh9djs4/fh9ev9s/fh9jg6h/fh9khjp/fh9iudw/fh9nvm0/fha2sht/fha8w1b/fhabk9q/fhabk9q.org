I don't think so? The eye-beast used a [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/disciplines-of-magic/#comment-7723][soul magic]] attack on Zorian, and soul magic attacks need to overcome the target's magic resistance to work. So I imagine the grey hunter, possessing powerful magic resistance, would probably be immune.
