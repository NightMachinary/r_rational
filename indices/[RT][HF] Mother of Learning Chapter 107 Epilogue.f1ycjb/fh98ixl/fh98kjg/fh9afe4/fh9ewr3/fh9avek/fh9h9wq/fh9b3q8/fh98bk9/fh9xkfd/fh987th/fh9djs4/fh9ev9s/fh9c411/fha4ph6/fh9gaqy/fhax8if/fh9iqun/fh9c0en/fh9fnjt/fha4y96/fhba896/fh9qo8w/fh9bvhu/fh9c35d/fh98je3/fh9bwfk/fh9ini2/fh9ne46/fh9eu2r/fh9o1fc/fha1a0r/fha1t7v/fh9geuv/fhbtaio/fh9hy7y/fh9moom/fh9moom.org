Well, it's the end of an era. It's been a fantastic story, and feels like it's been following me through a huge part of my life. I'm sad to see it go, but happy with the way it ended. I hope that we end up with that extended epilogue that was mentioned, but if nobody feels like moving on, I think that's fine. I really look forward to his next work.
