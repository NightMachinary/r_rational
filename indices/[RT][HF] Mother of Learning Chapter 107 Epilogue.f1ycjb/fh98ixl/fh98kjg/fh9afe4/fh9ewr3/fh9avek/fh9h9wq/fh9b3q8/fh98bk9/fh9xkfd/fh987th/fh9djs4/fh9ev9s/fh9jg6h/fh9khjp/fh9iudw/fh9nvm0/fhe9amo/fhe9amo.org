  The Greg Hunter is an odd species of giant spider. Mostly docile, the Greg Hunter will happily go about its life without attacking nearby humans, so long as it's left alone. There is one caveat to this docility however: given the opportunity, the Greg Hunter will, as its name might suggest, doggedly hunt down anyone with the name Greg. We still don't know how the creature identifies Gregs, but it's more than just auditory observation (as demonstrated by the slaughter of four of the Silent Monks of the cloistered order of Somnus in 1426). Perhaps it has some degree of soul perception?
