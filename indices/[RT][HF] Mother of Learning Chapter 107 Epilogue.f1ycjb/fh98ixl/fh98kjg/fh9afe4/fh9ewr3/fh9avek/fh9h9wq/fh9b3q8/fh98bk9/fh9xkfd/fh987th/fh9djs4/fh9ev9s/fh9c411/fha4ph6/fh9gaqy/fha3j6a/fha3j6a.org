SAME. (well, i got into this at chapter 38, so just a few months before you). 2015 to now. What a journey indeed.

Sign me up for that signed copy, 100%. Honestly MoL has been a huge part of my life over the last 5 years. I've definitely read it more than 5-6 times especially while waiting for new chapters. I've shared it as a bedtime story for my nieces and nephews. I've been an enthusiastic sharer of MoL content in real life. It's been real, MoL. It's been real.

And yes, the lack of Zach interaction I think definitely hurts the epilogue a bit.
