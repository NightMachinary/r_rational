  Because Silverlake betrayed them and almost ruined everything
#+end_quote

Why should he hold the real Silverlake responsible for the actions of her looped duplicate, who she acted to stop?

#+begin_quote
  he doesn't trust old Silverlake any more than timeloop Silverlake
#+end_quote

Agreed, she's not trustworthy, if you put something she wants enough in her reach. She's still an excellent teacher, and, with the potion of youth available and on offer, and no death from marker expiry looming over her, there shouldn't be any particular incentive for her to betray them. Especially given that they're archmages.

#+begin_quote
  All the things you listed above happened before the betrayal.
#+end_quote

Indeed, and were done by a Silverlake who /didn't/ betray them. Sure, any promises they made to the Silverlake who exited the loop are null and void, but they made promises to a different Silverlake in exchange for making them a potion of soul sight and teaching them dimensionalism, and both the Silverlake they made those promises to, and the one they would be repaying, have done nothing but help them.

#+begin_quote
  I personally doubt he is interested in reconnecting that relationship.
#+end_quote

I get why you don't think he would want her teaching Kiri. I disagree that it's as big a deal as you think, but I get it, and I'd totally understand if Zorian himself came to the same decision.

I don't get the idea that because one Silverlake betrayed him, that negates the commitment he made to a different Silverlake, to be repayed to a third Silverlake, neither of whom were involved in any such betrayal.
