  He is a powerful mage, but it would be very dangerous for him to hunt for material in the Great Northern Wildness. The mana deposit / invader cache was such a large money source for him is because it is a large sum of wealth that get regenerated each loop in the same location. There is no reason to believe he knows of any similar resource in other areas as there was simply no need to search for them when they had a ready resource in the mana deposit/cache
