Well then, if House Zoltan is getting involved of their own volition as you claim, then where are they? Why have we never heard about them since? Not a single mention of any vampire, anywhere? Not a single mention of whether they gain their abilities through infections/blood/saliva like traditional vampires, or through rituals like liches?

And also, you're underestimating her strength. She could survive losing an arm, like it was nothing. She fought against Kyron, and did not suffer any major injury that could hurt her in the middle term. She obtained a form of immortality and perpetual youth that allowed to keep her flesh and her tactile senses, which is more than what lichdom offers. If vampirism is an alternative to alchemy, why didn't Silverlake mention it at all?

Also, I'd like to point out that without a shield and taken sufficiently by surprise, Zorian is as brittle as any other human being. A single dagger thrust, incinerating beam or hidden mine, could take him out in an instant. When Zorian killed her, it was when she was dizzy and couldn't properly avoid it, while taken by surprise with one of the few spells that could actually have a real effect on her, while she mistakenly assumed that the students were no threats to her and her immortal body. It was definitely inexperience and overconfidence, but she had no reason to expect that someone like Zorian was there in the room, either.

But all of this aside, it doesn't change the fact that her mere existence, and the existence of her house, creates a plot hole, if they are never referenced again. In a world where vampires exist, and willfully choose to participate in the invasion on the sides of Quatach Ichl, this is not what you would expect to see. It is inconsistent.
