in the beginnings like the very early chapters Zorian explain that you need a license for spells, and teaching people without one is illegal so first kirelle must get a Licence somehow and then he can teach her actual spells.

there are some level 0 spells that i think were legal anyway, but most are bumped up to level one because it's more prestigious to be the creator of a high level spell.

sure he'll probably teach her a attack spell anyway despite the illegality of it, but then she'll not be allowed to show that one in school since the teachers will probably see she's more familiar with it then she should be.
