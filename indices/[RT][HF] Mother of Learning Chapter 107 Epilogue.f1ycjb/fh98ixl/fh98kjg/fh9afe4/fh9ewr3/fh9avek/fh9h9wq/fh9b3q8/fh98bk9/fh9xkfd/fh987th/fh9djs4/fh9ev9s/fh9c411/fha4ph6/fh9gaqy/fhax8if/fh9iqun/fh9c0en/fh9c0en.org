Well the Grey Hunter may pose some Problems for Zorian and Zach in the future , but other than that it seems to have worked out perfectly.

I would have like some ZZ screen time but I guess noboby had to put a lot of things in the epilogue and you cant have everything.

So the last question to ask: When does the sequel come out? ;P
