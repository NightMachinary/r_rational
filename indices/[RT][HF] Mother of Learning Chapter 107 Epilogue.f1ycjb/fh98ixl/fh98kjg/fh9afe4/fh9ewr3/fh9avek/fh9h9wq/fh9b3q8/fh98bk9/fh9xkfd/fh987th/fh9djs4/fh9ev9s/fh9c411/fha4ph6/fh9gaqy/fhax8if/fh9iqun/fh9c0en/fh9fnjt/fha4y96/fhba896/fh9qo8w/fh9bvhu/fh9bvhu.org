Well, what amazing journey - it's honestly stunning that a story like this is just freely available to read on the internet...

Anyway, What am I going to do with my life now then? I've been following and looking forward to the bi-weekly/monthly chapters of this for years, it's honestly helped keep me going... now I just feel empty.

I guess I'll need to track down some more of these "build 'em up" (well, "[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution][One man industrial revolution]]" is the closest genre to MoL, just replace 'industrial' with 'magic') stories, but I don't know if I'll ever find one that "scratches the itch" as much as MoL did.

So, in one way I'm very happy to see this has come to a satisfying (and well deserved on Zorians part!) ending, on the other I'm sad that it's over.

Great job to [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]], thank you for gifting us with such a great story - I really hope you follow through on your plans to figure out publishing like you mention in the afterword, I would definitely buy it üòÅ
