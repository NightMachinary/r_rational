Definitely give it another go through. It's not one-man band, but it is fantastic. That part is really only the start of something great. Cato and Landar do some really cool stuff, and they bounce back from that bit pretty quickly.

Now that I'm thinking about it, I really should do a reread, because it is a pretty great story. (Though it could use some editing.)
