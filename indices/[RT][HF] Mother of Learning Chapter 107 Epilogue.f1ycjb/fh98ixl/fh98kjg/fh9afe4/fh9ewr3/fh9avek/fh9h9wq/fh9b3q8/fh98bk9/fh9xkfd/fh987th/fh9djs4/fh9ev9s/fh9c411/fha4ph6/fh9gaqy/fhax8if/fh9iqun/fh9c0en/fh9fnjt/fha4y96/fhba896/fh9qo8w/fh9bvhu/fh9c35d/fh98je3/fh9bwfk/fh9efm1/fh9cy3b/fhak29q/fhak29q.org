The intro with Kirielle is a good summation of Zach's relationship with Zorian imo. Pranks. Taking out Tesen's men indicates they have that fight well in hand.

Xvim appears to have gone back to teaching. So Zorian remains the teacher's pet to a mentor that Ilsa claims produces the occasional thriving student, a readymade explanation for Zorian's future growth.

I think Alanic is the most active behind the scenes, as he is surely behind the church's activities helping Eldemar track down miscellaneous bad guys.
