the rest of the house doesn't /have/ to be around. lichdom and necromancy is still (probably) reserved for the noble houses. the masses are still going to be normal humans. there is not going to be vampires randomly everywhere en masse. how they become a vampire is ultimately unimportant to the plot if the plot never moves into Ulqaan Ibasa proper (and even then. especially if undead status is reserved for the nobles)

when I say she was weak, it was a bit of an exaggeration. she's weak in the sense that she's 100% combatable by seasoned battle mages or retired ones. and if she was truly strong, she wouldn't have been blindsided /that/ easily. she's definitely no QI and she's probably weaker than the Cult leaders, etc.

why would Silverlake care? she doesn't have access to unlimited bodies to really focus study necromancy anyways. plus, alchemy is her thing... why even bother? and lastly, she wanted her youth back. vampirism isn't going to help her at this point.

would it hurt to remove her? probably not. is it that large a plot hole or that "inconsistent"? imo no
