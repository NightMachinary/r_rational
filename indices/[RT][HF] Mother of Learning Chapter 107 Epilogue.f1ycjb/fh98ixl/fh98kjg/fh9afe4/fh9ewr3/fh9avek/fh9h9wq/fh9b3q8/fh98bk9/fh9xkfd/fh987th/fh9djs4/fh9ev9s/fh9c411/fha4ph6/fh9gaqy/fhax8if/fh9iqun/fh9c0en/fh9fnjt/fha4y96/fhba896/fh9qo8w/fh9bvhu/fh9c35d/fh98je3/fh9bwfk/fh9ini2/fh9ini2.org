For a sequel, give me cut throat politics and a potential internal royal coup. Culminated in Zorian becoming a noble and needing to get married, whilst an underground invasion or primordial spiders happen . I want to see the foreign tensions played out. I want to see more superman\batman dynamic from Z\Z. The sequel could be less epic and more world buildy leading into a 3rd book that is epic again. The setting fascinates me more than potter ever could.
