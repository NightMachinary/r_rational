I would argue that based on what we've seen in the last chapters, Zorian is /most certainly/ the most powerful human /mage/ in the entire continent, by far.

1. His magical creations are so advanced beyond his time it's like a soldier from the middle ages with a modern machine gun. Sure, Zach or the lich could overwhelm him in a duel, But could they defeat him protected by the cube while supported by a 10-20 Mrva golems? Not to mention all the other tools he can prepare in advance.
2. His hivemind connection with 10-15 clones of himself and the mind enhancements he developed seems to give him something close to superintelligence. Like finishing advanced math calculations in seconds instead of hours, and reverse engineer a trap /after springing it/ while in combat.
3. He can basically one-shot anyone now that he managed to bypass the mind-blank spell.
4. Non-combat related, he has the most potential to exponentially grow.

I think the biggest plot-hole in the entire story is that he still goes to school, which should be a complete waste of his time. (He could probably digest an entire lecture in two seconds, with his hivemind of clones and enhancements)
