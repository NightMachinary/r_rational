Quatach is highly respected, and his voice has weight. But Ulqaan Ibasa doesn't have a monarch, or a single ruler. It's more of a republic in this way, with a council making the decisions, and with various factions being part of it. Not every faction respects Quatach Ichl's opinion enough to listen to it.

For example, most people on the council seemed to consider that it was best to remain at peace with Eldemar and the rest of the mainland, to not stir the pot and to negotiate trade agreements. Quatach disagreed, claimed that the most profit would be obtained from waging war, and that they should not be so satisfied with a single isolated and unhospitable island. However, his voice not being enough to sway enough people his way to convince the Ibasan government to start a war, he decides that it's in his best interest to attack a major Eldemarian city along with the local cult and thus force the issue.

The current situation, with Eldemar gearing up to wipe the people living on that speck of an island despite the risk of being stabbed in the back by Sulamnon or Falkrinea while their attention is elsewhere, isn't so far off from the situation Quatach Ichl wanted to create. Although, he would have preferred to have not lost the initiative, to have caused much more damage to Eldemar from a rampant Primordial and an unleashed angelic counter-attack, and to not have lost his crown in the process.
