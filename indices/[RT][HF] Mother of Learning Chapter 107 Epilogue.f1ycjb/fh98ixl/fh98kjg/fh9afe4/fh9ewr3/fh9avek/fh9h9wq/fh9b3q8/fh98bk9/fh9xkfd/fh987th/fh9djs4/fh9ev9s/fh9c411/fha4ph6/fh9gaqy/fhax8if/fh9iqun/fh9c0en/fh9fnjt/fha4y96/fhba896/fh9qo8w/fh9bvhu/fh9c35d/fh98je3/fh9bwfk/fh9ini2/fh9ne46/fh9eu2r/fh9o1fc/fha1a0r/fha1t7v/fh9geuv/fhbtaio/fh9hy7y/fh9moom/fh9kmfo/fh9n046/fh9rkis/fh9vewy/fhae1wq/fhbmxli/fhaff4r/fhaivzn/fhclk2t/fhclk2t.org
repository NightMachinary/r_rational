The story as it reads doesn't quite seem to imply there were any significant fatalities among the group Jornak talked into convincing Zach. I'd think the chapter'd at least mention off-hand something like that if it happened, like, "Despite a reduction in their numbers, the group as a whole survived and Jornak's next six months were the best time of his life." Not, "Jornak's next six months were the best time of his life. But when the second limit approached, tempers started to run high among the group." (Paraphrasing.)
