  you're probably overestimating how much Zorian can still grow. probably still plenty of room, but not exponentially

His insane mental enhancements came towards the end of the loop

Sure he can't brute force knowledge with billions of money as easily now, by he can still make enough and again, learn far faster

He can do shit with his simulacrums, including making and selling stuff so he has no money issues
