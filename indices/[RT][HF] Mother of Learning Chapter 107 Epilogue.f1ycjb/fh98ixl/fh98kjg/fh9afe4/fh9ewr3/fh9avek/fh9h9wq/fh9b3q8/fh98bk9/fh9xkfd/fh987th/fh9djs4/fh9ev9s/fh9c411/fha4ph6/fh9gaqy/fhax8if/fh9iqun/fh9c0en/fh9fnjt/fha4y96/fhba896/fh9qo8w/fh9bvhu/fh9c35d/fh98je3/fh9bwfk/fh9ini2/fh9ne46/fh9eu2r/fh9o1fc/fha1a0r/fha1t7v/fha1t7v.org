Conspiracy theory: Zach couldn't show up in the epilogue because he's dead. The angel contract killed him.

Zorian couldn't handle the grief, so he used mind magic to give himself false memories of saving Zach. "I Win (III)" is no more real than the other "I Win" chapters. Everyone else also thinks Zach is alive because, before modifying his memories, Zorian built an advanced golem to pretend to be Zach (this is what he's been spending all his money on). The golem is good enough to fool others, but not Zorian, which is why Zach-golem is programmed to never, ever interact with Zorian in person. It all fits.
