Honestly, I've enjoyed the epilogue more than a lot of chapters, recently. Small slice-of-life conversations always were the strongest aspect of MoL. If [[/u/nobody103][u/nobody103]] decides to write another story, I only hope it focuses more on people stuff, mystery, and worldbuilding and less on epic battles. Anyways, this was a rather sweet closure.
