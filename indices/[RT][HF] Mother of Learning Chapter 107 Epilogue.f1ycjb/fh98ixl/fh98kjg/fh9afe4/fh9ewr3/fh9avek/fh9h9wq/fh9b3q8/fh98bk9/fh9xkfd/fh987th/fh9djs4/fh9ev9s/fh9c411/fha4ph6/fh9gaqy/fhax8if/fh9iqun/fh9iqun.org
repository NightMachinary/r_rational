No further romantic development between Zorian and Raynie? Aw, that (not too) sucks.

Actually Zorian placed himself in "only slightly out of reach" by letting Raynie know his most recent role and influence. Given that Raynie herself is an achiever, there's no doubt she would pursue Zorian or at least the position/prestige he is in. Although it's a coin toss whether it would develop into romantic feeling.

Anyway, Akoja regretting the tone her letter let a chortle out of me.
