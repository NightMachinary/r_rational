I'm jumping in here to say that I am convinced Ontosomatics is right, and that the author did say that somewhere...I just can't seem to find where.

Scoured his reddit comments, the two most recent MoL universe wordpress articles and their comments, his fictionpress.net account bio...nothing. I guess it's either somewhere on his Patreon feed or RoyalRoad replies, or maybe the comment just got deleted from one of the three sources I searched through.
