(Grey Hunter) I'd imagine some of them may involve soul magic. maybe.

simulacrums wouldn't matter. he explained every reasonable avenue of revenue and explained why they're not valid. he got most of it from crystalized mana deposits, and stealing from the invaders. first one is depleted for the most part and second is also depleted. he explained that he can sell stuff but that attracted too much attention and thus shut down as well. so he doesn't really have anything
