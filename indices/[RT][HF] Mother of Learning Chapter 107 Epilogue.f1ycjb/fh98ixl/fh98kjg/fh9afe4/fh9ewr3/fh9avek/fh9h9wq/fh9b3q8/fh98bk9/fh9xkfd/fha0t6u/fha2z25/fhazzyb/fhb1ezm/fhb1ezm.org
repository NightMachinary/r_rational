  Zorian would never let Silverlake teach his sister
#+end_quote

Why? He let her teach him, and she seems eager enough to teach women from witch bloodlines (e.g. Kana).

#+begin_quote
  I seriously doubt he plans on giving her any sort of repayment.
#+end_quote

Why not? He's on a big repayment tour of everyone who helped him out or taught him in the loop. Silverlake certainly qualifies. Why would he make an exception for her?

#+begin_quote
  Zorian is well aware that Silverlake only stepped in for selfish reasons.
#+end_quote

So did the people in Xvim's book, who only helped because they were promised once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, like projects done by a team of archmages. They only helped when helping was shown to fit their own selfish purposes. And the Silent Doorway Adepts, who only helped when given huge bribes, and then when given Bakora Gate keys.

Zorian is planning on paying them back for their tutelage; why not Silverlake?
