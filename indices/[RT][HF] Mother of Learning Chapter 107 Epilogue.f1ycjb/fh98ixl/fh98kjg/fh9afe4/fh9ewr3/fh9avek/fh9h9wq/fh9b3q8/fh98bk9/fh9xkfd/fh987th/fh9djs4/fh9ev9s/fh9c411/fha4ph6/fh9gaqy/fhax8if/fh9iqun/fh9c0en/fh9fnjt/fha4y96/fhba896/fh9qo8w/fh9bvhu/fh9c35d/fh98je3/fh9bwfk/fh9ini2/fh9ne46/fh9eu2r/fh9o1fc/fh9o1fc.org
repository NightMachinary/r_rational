Next 400 years later will be serious for people who aware of time loop ability of Sovereign Gate beside Z&Z, they know well not to skip something like this and surely would have their representative to be present when planar alignment happen.\\
Beside primordial enhanced Grey Hunters I more afraid of Silver One the winter wolf shifter, there's no mention if it's dead in battle. If it's alive then Altazia would have another monster sapients because Silver One decendants will inherited it's shifter power, they can reason and intelligence thinking like other sapient beings. They can even transform into human and have potential be become mage (difficult but plausible) by learning human spell casting system instead ivented new one.\\
Z&Z should build proper company and research facility in future to obtain money instead selling magical devices in black market.

Thank you Nobody103 aka Domagoj for creating this amazing story, I love it and surely want to buy printed version if it's published.
