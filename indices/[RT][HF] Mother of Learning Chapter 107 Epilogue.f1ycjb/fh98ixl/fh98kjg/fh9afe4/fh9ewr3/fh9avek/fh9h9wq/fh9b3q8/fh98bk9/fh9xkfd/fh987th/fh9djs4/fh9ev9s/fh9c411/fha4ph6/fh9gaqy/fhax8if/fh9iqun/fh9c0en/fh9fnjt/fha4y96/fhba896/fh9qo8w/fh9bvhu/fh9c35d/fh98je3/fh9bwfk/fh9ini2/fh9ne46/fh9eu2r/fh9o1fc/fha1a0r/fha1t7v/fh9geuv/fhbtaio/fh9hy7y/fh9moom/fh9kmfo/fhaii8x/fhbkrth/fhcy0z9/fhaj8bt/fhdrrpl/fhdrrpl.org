I want to know more about the Grey Hunter's children. Are they just going to turn into Advanced Grey Hunters, slightly larger/more intelligent/more magical, like ordinary D&D monsters that are advanced? Are they going to turn into Hunter-Shifters, given that she consumed Panaxeth's essence? Are they going to have durability-enhancing mutations, like Looper Silverlake? Maybe become general shapeshifters who happen to have Grey Hunter as their base form? If it's the latter, is it possible that they might eventually intermingle with the aranea, or is their brood too deep into the Dungeon for their territory to intersect?

I want to know more.
