Interesting thought, but assuming Zorian made a habit of maintaining his spiderweb presence-detection trick, if QI came in mind-blanked Zorian would immediately know a powerful mage is in his presence, and if QI tried to come in with a fake mind it's not very likely to be convincing enough to fool Zorian. He'd probably need to directly teleport right next to Zorian to ambush him, in which case I estimate there's a moderate chance Zorian is able to defend himself, a very high probability that Zorian ends up needing to out his real skill level to defend himself, but also a mild chance that QI would need to abandon his new body when he tries to escape in the aftermath, and will take a while before returning to Ulquaan Ibasa if he doesn't, at which point you question whether it'd really be worth it to him to ambush Zorian.

Well, assuming Zorian maintains his spiderweb presence-detection trick. There's a mild chance it'd out him as an archmage if another archmage happen to come across him able to actually detect his spiderweb. In which case I wonder what other methods he has to avoid ambush. Constant stealthy divinations?
