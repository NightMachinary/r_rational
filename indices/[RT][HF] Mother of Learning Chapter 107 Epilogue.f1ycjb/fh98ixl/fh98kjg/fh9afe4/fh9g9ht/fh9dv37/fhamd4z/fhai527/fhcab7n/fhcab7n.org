Primordial essence infused spiders will likely give them hyper regen or shapeshifting capabilities. We also dont know what's gonna happen to Oganj now that he has those divine artifacts. Makes me feel like I want an ending similar to Neverwinter Nights where they summarize the drastic effects of your actions in the game.
