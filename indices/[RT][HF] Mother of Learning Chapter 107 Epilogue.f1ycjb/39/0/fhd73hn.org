Zorian himself explains to Zach why he did so. I'm going to quote from chapter 92 for your convenience.

  “Oh yeah... what did you do with the--” Zach started to ask, before being cut off by Zorian.

  “I killed him,” Zorian said curtly. “Sent his soul to the afterlife.”

  “I... umm... shit,” Zach fumbled. “That's kind of... brutal?”

  “What was I supposed to do?” Zorian asked, uncomfortable with this line of questioning. “I don't know how to make a new body for him. Maybe I never will. I'd have to either keep him in stasis for years and years before finally releasing him into an alien world where a stranger has usurped his life... or having him accompany me as a powerless ghost looking over my shoulder, constantly getting his face rubbed in at the fact I'm so much better than him at everything. Isn't that a cruel and horrifying fate to inflict on someone?”

  “I... don't know,” Zach admitted after a while.

  “I know I'm not the same person as him by this point,” Zorian said quietly, “but I would hate that with every fiber of my being. I... don't think I'd ever get over it. Maybe I'm just a selfish monster trying to justify my crimes, but I think I'm doing him a favor. Alanic says the afterlife is still a thing, even after the gods stopped talking to people. For all his faults, I don't think the old Zorian had done anything truly heinous in his life... there should be a good outcome waiting for him there. Something he'd never get back here with us.”
