Zorian can't store 1 let alone 10~20 Mrva (yet). and both those and his cube can be sieged and drained. while very, very diverse, the cube could potentially have a weakness (like the demon saliva). now that QI has fought Mvra and knows of the flower, he can also build counter measures. after that, Zorian is pressed for an answer.

Zorian didn't quite have an answer to Silverlake's creatures. the rose demon stopped Mvra handily. it's doubtful Zorian would actually beat Oganj in a direct fight. well, maybe with the flower. not that those are common by any means. and also probably vastly underestimating how much it costs to build even 1

one-shot requires contact. gl against QI or Oganj. QI can potentially fight it off via his superior soul defense (as confident RR was in his own, it probably isn't as superb) plus other defenses as well

you're probably overestimating how much Zorian can still grow. probably still plenty of room, but not exponentially

it's not a plot hole. how is he going to stay under the radar if he suddenly left on his own? you think he'd go back to Cyrin with his parents? there wasn't even anyone to go back to yet since his parents were in transit still. going off on his own will attract attention. "going to school" is pushing it, considering he personally grabbed teachers for "simply" a study group. he is also doing this more so to pay back his fellow classmates first and foremost anyways
