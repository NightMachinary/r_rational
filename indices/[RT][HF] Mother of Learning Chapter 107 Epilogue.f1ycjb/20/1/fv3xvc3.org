  I would argue that based on what we've seen in the last chapters, Zorian is /most certainly/ the most powerful human /mage/ in the entire continent, by far.

  1. His magical creations are so advanced beyond his time it's like a soldier from the middle ages with a modern machine gun. Sure, Zach or the lich could overwhelm him in a duel, But could they defeat him protected by the cube while supported by a 10-20 Mrva golems? Not to mention all the other tools he can prepare in advance.
  2. His hivemind connection with 10-15 clones of himself and the mind enhancements he developed seems to give him something close to superintelligence. Like finishing advanced math calculations in seconds instead of hours, and reverse engineer a trap /after springing it/ while in combat.
  3. He can basically one-shot anyone now that he managed to bypass the mind-blank spell.
  4. Non-combat related, he has the most potential to exponentially grow.

The hive Mind thing was strongly implied to be a last resort terrible idea

But life and death for real battles are pretty last resort I guess

But yeah his mental enhancements came reasonably late in the loop, he has a LOT of rapid growth potential and he's willingly stunting himself otherwise lol

  I think the biggest plot-hole in the entire story is that he still goes to school, which should be a complete waste of his time. (He could probably digest an entire lecture in two seconds, with his hivemind of clones and enhancements)

And that with his ability to create anonymous simulacrums, he has trouble with attention for his creations.. definitely the biggest plot hole in the story.

He has better artificing skills than his teacher/likely any other mage in the planet, and that's what he wants to do as a career sooo
