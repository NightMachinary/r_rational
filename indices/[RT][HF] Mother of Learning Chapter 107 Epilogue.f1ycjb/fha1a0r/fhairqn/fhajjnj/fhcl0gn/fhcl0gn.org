A foreign hostile country was able to organize a whole invasion underneath a city in the country that the royal capital is actually on slightly bad terms with (among the citizens of the royal capital, at least. In contrast, the principal of Cyoria's academy was noted to be a fervent nationalist, though I can't speak for the municipal government). The story'd be a little different if the Ibasans tried to attack the capital, which has a higher concentration of competent mages loyal to the death to the Crown. Zorian even notes on his first visit there that the capital city has soldiers patrolling regularly as a matter of course, unlike Cyoria, so crime is somewhat harder to organize.

Besides which, if Zorian was to seriously attempt subverting the entire royal bureaucracy, he'd have to get them all at once, which is physically impossible unless he uses something similar to his array network (which would just call attention onto him), or use something like a long-term compulsion that spreads like a virus which other than being somewhat too shady for Zorian and even most aranea's tastes, would probably take enough time that someone skilled enough is almost guaranteed to catch on eventually. Either of those would just escalate a takeover into outright conflict between the government and the mind mages, which is really not where Zorian wants to take this, I'd bet.

And even all that is leaving aside whatever divine artifact the Royals might be able to dust off and use. Zorian still hasn't figured out how to invade the sulrothums' sand worm's mind, because of its divine protection, remember.
