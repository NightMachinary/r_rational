That would make the most sense to me, as well. I mentioned in the past that I expected that the author would just remove her entirely from the story once he edited the story into one coherent whole.

Probably, he will turn her into a fairly generic Ulqaan Ibasan, but one who happens to be connected to a major family. It would have the same general effect. There was also Kael's coin trick beating Quatach, that might be altered a bit as power creep forced the author to have to increase the lich's strength accordingly so he could remain a threat. According to what we now know of him, it would have been very surprising to be defeated by that, and for him to risk losing his crown, even temporarily.
