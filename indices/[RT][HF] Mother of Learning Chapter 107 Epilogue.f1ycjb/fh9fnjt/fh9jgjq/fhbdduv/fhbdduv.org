She was the one person that RR and Quatach saw fit to bring with them when they confronted an archmage surrounded by academy professors. She was from a major house of Ulqaan Ibasa, one with a unique tradition of undeads seen nowhere else, that could potentially become more widespread than lichdom. Simply meeting with her or any member of her family would have required a lot of effort, time investment and resources, if they were not initially related to the invasion or intended to participate themselves. /Particularly so/ because she was the heiress of this politically powerful house, one which was powerful enough to be able to apply pressure on Quatach Ichl himself. Who was the one who recruited her? Was it Red Robe, or Quatach Ichl? Was that why Quatach went back to Ulqaan Ibasa every month? Or if it was Red Robe, then why did he choose her? What made him go to Ulqaan Ibasa in the first place, or motivated him to seek them out?

The mere fact that she, and her house, exists, creates a lot of implications for what is possible with magic in this world, and for the power structure of the Ibasan government. You're right that overall, she wasn't particularly relevant to the story. But that's only because the author chose not to include her, because he seems to have decided to drop that plot thread. But if you want to have consistent worldbuilding, then you need to include at least a few passages about her and her family in the epilogue, at the very least.

But since the author chose not to do that, I expect him to remove her and her family entirely from the story once he edits all the chapters into one coherent whole, which will solve the inconsistencies.
