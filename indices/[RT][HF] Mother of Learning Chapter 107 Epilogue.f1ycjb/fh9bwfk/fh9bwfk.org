I gotta admit I'm a bit disappointed with this. We got hardly anything describing things that matter and a lot describing characters that Zorian himself barely remembers. What's the situation with Zach, Xvim, or Alanic? Zorian goes through his master plan, Zach hits him, and....thats it?? Where's the fallout?

I think the real issue I'm having is that this entire book is about never seeing ripples go out further than a month, and the epilogue here is....one month after the invasion. Give us some long-term ramifications! Set it on the one- or two-year anniversary of the invasion (or something), so ZZ have had time to seed their paybacks and watched as the benefactors get to actually study the books for more than 30 days at a time. How does the world change when they can /actually/ change it? Zach's goal was always to stop the invasion, but Zorian's felt a bit more farsighted, and I feel a bit robbed that I don't get to see the fruits of that foresight.
