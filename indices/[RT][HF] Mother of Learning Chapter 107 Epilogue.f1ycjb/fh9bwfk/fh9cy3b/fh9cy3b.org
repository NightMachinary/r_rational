The most jarring is the lack of any interaction between Zorian and Zach, not even a simple dialogue. It looks as if it was supposed to be an introduction to the epilogue, not an epilogue itself, as if ending was cut short. But it seems Nobody103 is finished with the story, so there's that. He probably tried many ways of ending and was disappointed with them, so he's published the least he could stomach, however lackluster it is.
