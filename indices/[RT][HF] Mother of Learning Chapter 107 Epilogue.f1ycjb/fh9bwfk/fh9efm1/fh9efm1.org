Oh, and another thing I've realized is missing: a gut punch.

Like, all of Zorian's relationships, both hostile and friendly, have been colored by his ability to retry over and over until he's spent literal years getting to know people (with the sole exception of Zach). The playing field is now leveled, and with time flowing normally he doesn't have the time to build up those relationships with all those people the same way.

I'd really like to see the pang of regret as people grow apart from the version he knows, or outright reject him out of suspicion when he accidentally blows his first impression out of habit. Showing the downsides of the loop would have gone a long way to feeling more complete.
