I'm satisfied with the epilogue, but I'm more satisfied with the afterword. It's rare that an online story of this scope is finished, rarer that the ending is satisfying, and even rarer that the author truly admits their shortcomings in such a frank way.

Overall, this was a great wild ride even considering the addressed issues. I'll be able to recommend this story to everyone in years to come. Thanks, nobody103.
