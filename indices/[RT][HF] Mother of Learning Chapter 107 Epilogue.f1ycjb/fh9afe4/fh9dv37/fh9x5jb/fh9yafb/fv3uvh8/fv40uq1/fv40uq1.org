The Dragon Below is the mythical entity at the centre of their planet. It is supposedly the still beating and possibly sentient heart of one of the seven Primordial Dragons. The gods killed the other six, but use the last to form the material plane, leaving only its heart intact to provide mana for the world.

The primordial are it's children/fragments? I'm not to clear on that. They are the most powerful remnants of it. The lore is that the Dragon's continued rage and hatred towards humanity is why using ambient mana for casting drives humans insane.
