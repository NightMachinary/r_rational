After a recent re-read, my first read through from beginning to end, I think /all/ of the primordial essence from Silverlake is in the eggs now, and that it only granted spider mum sapience and the compulsion to go lower, though that may be an innate compulsion to seek the proper mana density for her offspring to mature in. I still like the sequel idea, and if nobody103 never returns to the MoL world, I might give a shot at a Fan-fiction.
