I think Zorian's at the point where he can invent spells that are different enough from other to be registered as their own spells but are functionally similar to other first-circle spells. Since he doesn't care about prestige he could probably register them as zero-circle spells and teach them to Kirielle perfectly legally.

IF he wants to go that far, which he probably doesn't, if nothing else because it'd probably attract attention to him. He'd probably just teach Kirielle mana sensing, then shaping exercises, then just straight-up unstructured spellcasting if he gets that far before Kirielle becomes a certified mage, and I'm pretty sure illegal spell teaching doesn't covered unstructured spellcasting. He could probably craft a "shaping exercise" that mimics magic missile. Though Kirielle's more likely to be interested in the illusion stuff.
