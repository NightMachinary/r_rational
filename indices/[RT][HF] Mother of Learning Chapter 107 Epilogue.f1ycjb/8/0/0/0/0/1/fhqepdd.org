because there are much easier and safer and competent alternatives. especially since Kiriel has no need to learn from the very best under very questionable circumstances

the warning in of itself is arguably enough as it is but maybe he did/will prepare some stuff for her

Zorian also knows she's very willing to abuse anything she gets and seek more. you can't just say "why blame her for Looper!Silverlake" when they've only really diverged half a year. anything Looper!Silverlake is willing to and has done, Silverlake is very much capable of doing to Zorian
