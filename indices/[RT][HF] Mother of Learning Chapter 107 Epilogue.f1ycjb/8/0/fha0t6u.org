All Zorian can really do with Kirelle is give her a good foundation, since his expertise is not in areas where her interests lie, it's also illegal for him to teach her any spells so if she's gonna go to the academy he really can't teach her stuff except shaping exercises that help her get a grip on things once she is spell legal.
