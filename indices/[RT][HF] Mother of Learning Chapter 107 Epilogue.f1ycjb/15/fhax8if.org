All right, now that I had the time to digest things, here are some of the things I'd like to see in the follow-up story:

- Zorian rubbing it into his mother's face that it's all thanks to her witch ancestry that giant telepathic spiders scouted him out (and the reason Daimen was so successful)
- Quatach-Ichl being incredibly petty and revealing Zorian and/or Zach the first chance he gets. I'm thinking soon after the war against Ulquaan Ibasa begins, he'd blow up a portion of the Eldemaran army, face their HQ and amplify his voice, and just bellow "ZORIAN KAZINSKI AND ZACH NOVEDA, I DEMAND A REMATCH!" and see how that blows up from there.
- Akoja's father vetting Zorian's suitability for Akoja. ...Possibly at the same time as Raynie's father vetting Zorian's suitability for Raynie. Like, one party walking in on the other two's conversation or something.
- Zorian hunting down Violet-Eyes for that injection of cash he needs. Her imperial staff might even be helpful when fighting against Oganj later, too.

Thanks for writing this story!
