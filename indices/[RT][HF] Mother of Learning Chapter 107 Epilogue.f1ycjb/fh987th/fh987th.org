Oh man I was not expecting this so soon.

Edit: Wow! A fantastic ending, so many loose ends tied up. Of course I wish we could have another 20 chapters just to see how people's lives progress but it makes sense to end it here.

The ending about the Grey Hunter sounds interesting and I hope we get to see a sequel of some sort! It probably wouldn't involve time loops again but it'd be cool to see a new protag take on the challenge and the different branches of magic involved, maybe get to see cameos from Zorian et al.
