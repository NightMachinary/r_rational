Man, I've been reading this since it was around 15~ chapters in. Always been a highlight of my day when it came out, and every chapter has left me wanting more. The epilogue is no different, which makes me a bit sad that such a wonderful story has come to an end. There isn't anything else on the internet I have found that has scratched an itch so satisfyingly as Mother of Learning has.

I particularly loved Zorian's growth, not just power wise (which was so damn good), but as a human being - the interactions he had with all the various characters. The moment Zorian decided to take Kirielle to Cyoria for the first time was amazing. As was his return to Cyoria, teaming up with Zach, and then Xvim, Alanic and Daimen.

Thanks [[/u/nobody103]] for all the entertainment you've given me over the years. Looking forward to whatever you write.
