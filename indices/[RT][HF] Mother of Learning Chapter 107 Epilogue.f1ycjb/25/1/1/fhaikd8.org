I am guessing the main interaction between ZZ would be the moment that Zach wakes up. After that, there probably isn't any significant interaction between ZZ that Nobody103 want to tell. Considering that it would be jarring to jump from a few minutes after the end of the invasion at the start of the epilogue, then a month later in the next scene, Nobody103 probably thought it would be better to cut that scene
