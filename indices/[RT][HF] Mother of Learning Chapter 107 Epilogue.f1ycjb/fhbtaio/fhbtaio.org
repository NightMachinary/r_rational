A big vote for the slice-of-life mini-sequel as mentioned in the afterword, if you are keeping count. With the cast-of-dozens the epilogue could only cover a few of the relevant characters, and in minor ways, so I would definitely be interested in having more of that detailed. And there is still sortof this final "plot" element of Zorian and Zac building a life where they can be honest about their abilities and find a role for themselves, which I imagine that would cover. So if you need votes for that, this is one!
