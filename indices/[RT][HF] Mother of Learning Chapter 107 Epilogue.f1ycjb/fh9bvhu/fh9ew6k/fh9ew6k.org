[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1][A Hero's War]] is what you're looking for. It actually goes into awesome detail about ramifications of creating an industrial revolution, and as far as I can tell, is very realistic with that. It's also an Isekai, but handles that better than any other Isekai I've ever read.

It gets posted here occasionally.
