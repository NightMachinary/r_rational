You don't just leave those kind of plot hooks hanging if you're not going to do more than a epilogue spin-off. Of all things to mention in a epilogue, why the golems? And why twice? Well...

MoL 2's story begins a full month after the start of the war between Eldemar and Ulquaan Ibasa. When Cyoria comes under attack for a second time, a young novice mage who went on a expedition to the depths of its dungeon finds himself trapped, his only exit gone in a matter of moments, this is how he discovers a hidden facility deep underground and the giant golem slumbering inside. Now protecting his city and stopping the Ibasan forces is up to him and the +gundam+ golem he found. Will the towering machine, along with the ever increasingly complex golems of the Eldemarian Kingdom, be enough to change the tide of battle in their favor and end the war once and for all? Or will the forces of evil triumph once more? Altazia's fate is once more in the hands of an unlikely hero and his mighty companion.
