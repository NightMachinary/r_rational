Yeah, but that doesn't mean they are at maximum capacity, something is driving mama spider to go deeper. The Dragon Below has been a background element for a while now, would be interesting if something like the creation of a new primordial, based on the Grey hunter, became a thing. It would as elements to the story and world that MoL glossed over due to Zorian's lack of interest, like more about the church, the way monsters work, and a bunch of other things.
