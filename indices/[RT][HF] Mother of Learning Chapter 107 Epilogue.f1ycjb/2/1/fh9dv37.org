Girl*

I think it's a possibility, depends how deep she can get, and what powers the primordial Essence has granted her.

Honestly I think a great continuation of the story would be from the perspective of one of her offspring.

She makes it down to the core of the world and absorbs more power, directly from the Dragon below, but somehow one of her eggs gets detached and ends up on the surface, blown out through the hole to hatch somewhere in Cyoria, it learns of Humans and in a primal wish to emulate them it uses it's primordial Essence (which originated from panexeth) to turn into one.

Commence story about awesome spider girl/boy with antimagic powers and the ability to shapeshift and a overarching plot about the birth of a new primordial (her mother) and the fact that she may be the only one who can defeat her, ad in some prophesies from people like Zorian, interaction with the Areana, and it could be an epic almost as cool as MoL
