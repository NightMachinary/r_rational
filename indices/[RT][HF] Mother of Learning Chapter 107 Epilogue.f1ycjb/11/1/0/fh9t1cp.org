  Also, this haven't been talked about in the last few chapters, but there's a reason why Zorian never mention about reacquiring magical ability through blood magic. He would be confined to dense cities or risk weakening.

Well no, you anchor the ability in your mana reserves, which constantly supplies it. You have less total power from then on, since it's powering the enhancements, but you don't need ambient mana. That's /way/ to big a drawback to be worth it and they've had blood magic abilities plenty of times in the later loops yet weren't always around mana-rich places.
