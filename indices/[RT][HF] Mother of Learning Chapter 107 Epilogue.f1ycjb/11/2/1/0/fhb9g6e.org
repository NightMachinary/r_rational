assume I implied "sell services" to be included when I say "sell stuff". also, while there's almost definitely a use for dimensional mages, that's probably not something most people would know of or seek out since it's that freakin' rare. so he'd have to seek/advertise and that's going to attract attention along with dimensional magic turning heads in general as well.

spell formulae is the default when I said sell stuff
