I did start reading it at some point, I got as far as when he started setting up an iron forge or something?

Then something went wrong and he had to abandon those plans... I kinda lost interest a few chapters later because the story was going off on a diversion... I'll give it another go though, it sounds like you certainly recommend it - maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance.
