I think it's mostly because the author's been updating very slowly, so they haven't had the perspective on how to pace it very well. 3 weeks can be rough to pace, for MoL. But aHW is much more irregular, and goes a lot longer sans update.

It's a good story, except the recent chapters (and really the whole thing) needs some editing and revision. And maybe for new chapters to be written faster so that the author can keep the idea of how it should be paced in their head, instead of slowly dripping out updates.

A similar problem happens with Dungeon Keeper Ami, where ever since the Trapped double chapter, the author's updated it so slowly that the pacing feels a bit odd. Though, I think Pusakuronu is doing a bit better of a job in keeping pacing in mind over the long stretches without any updates.
