I'm very happy with this epilogue. This story /is/ the one at my top of all time list, ever since I first started reading it, which was when chapter 42 was first posted. So since September 27, 2015, or slightly after that. What a journey.

I never buy physical copies of books, but come on. If this got published, I would need to get a signed copy, somehow. This story just hits all the points that I want in a story.

I think people are mostly missing an extended epilogue, which may happen eventually. Maybe Nobody103 will pull a Wildbow and start a giant work in a few years, as a sequel. This epilogue was pretty satisfying, though.

The only thing I miss is Zach interaction. In particular, I would have loved to see his wakeup scene, though the way this one started mirrors what he probably felt really well. I'm sure we'll start to see some fanfiction now. :)

Man... This story has been so so good.
