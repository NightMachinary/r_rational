more lore regarding vampires would've probably made things a little more complete. but as I already said, what does this specific lore add to the plot at all? Zorian can add a throwaway comment about vampires living there (adding little value) or we see her again... turning people? I already mentioned why this isn't a realistic option and there are plenty of stories where vampires are very selective in who to turn (it's intentional and not as simple as just biting). when mind reading, Zorian is probing with intention (that's the only way to do it) and none of the things he'd care for would involve her. she isn't going to be someone he'd be able or want to investigate during the month and is mostly a normal soldier in the invasion (rather than commander integral in its planning). thus mentioning her again within the invasion also doesn't add much value to the plot

forcibly bringing her back into the story without intending to actually make use of it is distracting at best. I just think it's excessive to say it's inconsistent to mention her once and never again. for that matter, why don't we see /any/ other undead nobles participating? there has to be at least one other house that participated and they're probably an undead. but they were never even mentioned ever. she could normally with them and thus never encounter Zorian again on most/all restarts. if you're going to say it's inconsistent she isn't mentioned, then questioning why we don't see any other undead nobles is also an inconsistency. if she must be mentioned, they must be mentioned

why even mention vampires at all? because it was an easy way to introduce some world building without being too distracting. other forms of necromancy are possible, adds even more "evil" to the invaders (using our world lore as a crutch, sure). it was an easy insert and (mostly) fit in smoothly. the best way I'd see her or vampires in general being mentioned again would be if Z&Z decided to raid the fort for w/e reason. maybe that was indeed cut. still, I don't think most would consider thus large enough of an issue to say the story is inconsistent
