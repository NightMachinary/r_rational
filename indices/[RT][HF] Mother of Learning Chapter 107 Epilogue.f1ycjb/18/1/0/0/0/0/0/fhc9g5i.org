And I disagree. Having no mention whatsoever of them by anyone at all at any other point in the story, not even any invaders, not even in their thoughts that Zorian read, and not in Red Robe's inner thoughts either, is an inconsistency, if they were actually present in the invasion force. There is no way whatsoever that it could be otherwise. It's clear that it's just a plot point dropped by the author. In a world where there was a vampire clan participating in the invasion, there would have been /at the very least/ one other mention. There were none. This isn't consistent with a world where vampires exist.

I don't think I can make my point any clearer than this. So if you're still not even willing to consider that this is an inconsistency in worldbuilding, then there's no point pursuing the discussion, since it's clear neither of us will change their opinion.
