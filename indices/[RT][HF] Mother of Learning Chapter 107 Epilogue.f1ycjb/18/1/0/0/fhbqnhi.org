she was forced on QI, he did not deign to bring her of his own volition and didn't care for her personally (outright hated, actually). she was forced upon him to gain campaign experience and fame/honor for her house and nothing more. she was weak and lost to freakin newbie Zorian (even if by surprise). so again, QI was not going to bring her because he wanted to and RR absolutely had no reason

QI himself also looked down on the new class of undead (nevermind the fact that she died easily, too). thinks they're too arrogant and overestimating themselves.

QI is a military leader but implied not all-powerful ruler of Ulqqan Ibasa. imo you're overvaluing QI's influence and House Zoltan and misunderstanding how their political structure works. remember, QI welcomes an attack against Ulqaan Ibasa because he thinks it'll teach some of the others in power a lesson, implying he doesn't have anywhere near absolute political authority. thus any particular house or necromantic art is very inconsequential to the main story.

RR outright knows QI beats Zach solo handily. archmage or not (and I don't think RR ever thought Zach to be at that level). plus they brought more than simply 3 people to confront everyone in the hall. plus the teachers have to care about defending students and other importants.
