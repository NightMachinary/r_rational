That's a pretty generic description, do you remember any names or keywords? My best guess would have to be A Hero's War. It focuses on one of the protagonists raising demi-humans up to help them combat zombies and humans. It starts off by breaking the world down around him and gaining a better understanding of magic, but eventually shifts to the social and economic ramifications of what he's doing.
