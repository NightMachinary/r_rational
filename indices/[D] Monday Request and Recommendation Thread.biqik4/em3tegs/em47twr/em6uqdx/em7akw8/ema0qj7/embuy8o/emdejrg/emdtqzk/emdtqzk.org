I'm not sure I know enough of a variety of games to help, but here are some thoughts that might help you narrow down your preferences:

- Are you looking for surprises/novelty in exploration? Wide variety? Tricky procedurally-generated scenarios?
- I personally haven't tried it, but my understanding of EVE is that there's a lot of conceptually 4X-themed things in it but it plays very differently because you control a single entity rather than order a bunch of mass-produced units. Maybe that could be interesting to you?
- As my first bullet point might suggest, I'm wondering if other game types could interest you outside of RTS and 4X. Roguelikes can often offer (replayable!) exploration, for instance. RPGs may offer a large amount of novel content to find. Open-world building games like Minecraft or Terraria also offer a large amount of space to explore and recipes to learn or gear to upgrade.
