I'm looking for a work of fiction that explores what happens when half the population disappears in some supernatural way (e.g. a Rapture type scenario). Ideally the focus would be on the logistical, political, or economic aspects, rather than being a meditation on loss or about personal stories.

Similarly, and I doubt this exists on the scale that I would want, I'd like a story about those people coming back years later, all at once.

("Global phenomena happens" is one of my favorite scifi genres, but it's very often just about the individuals with little pagespace given over to the larger questions of how governments, media, etc. deal with these kinds of things, other than some vague allusions.)
