I would say all of them has competent MCs, except for /The Loop/ and /Eleven Days in the Life of Gene Hunt (and one in Sam Tyler's)/ which are more about the drama.

All of the Harry Potter ones have somewhat tragic endings, although /Getting the Hang of Thursdays/ has a second happy ending written.

Every other story that I didn't mention by name should meet your criteria.

EDIT: /Step Right In and Start Again/ is tragic, but /Starting Over Again/ won't make sense unless you read the first story.
