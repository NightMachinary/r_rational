  Are you looking for surprises/novelty in exploration? Wide variety? Tricky procedurally-generated scenarios?

More the first two. The third is more contingent on the gameplay.

  I personally haven't tried it, but my understanding of EVE is that there's a lot of conceptually 4X-themed things in it but it plays very differently because you control a single entity rather than order a bunch of mass-produced units. Maybe that could be interesting to you?

I /really/ don't like the way EVE does permanent asset loss. I've played that sort of game before, and having months of time and effort evaporate because you had the bad luck to be in a convenient spot for some asshole to fuck you over is infuriating.

  As my first bullet point might suggest, I'm wondering if other game types could interest you outside of RTS and 4X. Roguelikes can often offer (replayable!) exploration, for instance. RPGs may offer a large amount of novel content to find. Open-world building games like Minecraft or Terraria also offer a large amount of space to explore and recipes to learn or gear to upgrade.

I don't usually like roguelikes for reasons similar to above, though at least here it's usually only a few hours and my own mistakes.

I have in fact sunk dozens of hours into Minecraft, and I've pretty much burned out on it by now. Really all that sort of "make your own fun" sandbox games like that really, nowadays.
