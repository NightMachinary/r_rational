So like finding the intricacies of the game? I mean stellaris still does that even if the random events are totally just flavor text for different flavors of resource. To be blunt the exploration is functionally for the finding of more resources. if anything the 4x genre is really good with reducing literally everything down into numbers and different numbers uhh.

​

Can you explain what you're looking for in more detail, like what would you describe is a good example of what you're trying to find? cause like i can't honestly think of anything that isn't just resources under a flavor text heading within the larger constraints of the finding certain resources to make certain things to eventually win with. Like within the constraints of most 4x games there is a limited amount of map to discover, and generally little besides the random or predetermined resource plots, to the point that the exploration is kinda within a bounded range if you know what i mean? like there isn't a lot of predetermined story telling or really anything besides the different land masses and resources?

​

sorry if that sounds confrontational but i wanna do my best to help you find what you're looking for but i just don't get what you're looking for.
