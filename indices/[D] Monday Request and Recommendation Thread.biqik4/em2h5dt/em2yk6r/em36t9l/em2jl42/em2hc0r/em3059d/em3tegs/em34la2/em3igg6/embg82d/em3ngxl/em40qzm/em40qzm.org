[[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/45950.I_m_a_cyborg][This]] list has several. Some of which are actually decent. Incidentally, I mentioned /Safehold/ up-thread which features an 'uploaded' protagonist.

There's quite a few of these on royalroad, too, though usually in Virtual Reality only. As you might expect, most of them leave much to be desired.
