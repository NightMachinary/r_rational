Great thanks for that list.

I guess the wish fulfillment is about leaving the limits and immutability of our physical bodies and minds behind (at least for me). So the VR ones that simulate these limits aren't as interesting. although you probably know that since you used it as a qualifier. I'm sure there are a few in there though :).
