I'm looking for a web serial I read some time ago to see if it has been updated since. Plot points that I remember:

- A person from the "ordinary world" ends up in a magical world,
- The magical world has late middle ages / 18th century technology,
- There are multiple provinces or countries or something fighting each other,
- He starts introducing technology based on more modern ideas, and combining magic with it, kind of like a substitute for steam,
- Magic can be encoded in circuits, he builds tools and weapons that allow ordinary people to use it without training,
- Builds a mana power grid for the city.
- Much of the plot focuses on the technical and social effects of introducing new technology.

I've looked through the top lists of of popular stories, but none of them seem to be it.
