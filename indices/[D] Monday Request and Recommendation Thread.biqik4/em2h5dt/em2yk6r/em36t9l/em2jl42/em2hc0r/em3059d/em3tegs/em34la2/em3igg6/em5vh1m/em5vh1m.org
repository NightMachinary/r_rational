Looking for any and all zombie stories.

Preferred: Action focused, written in the first person, or a clear showcasing and breakdown of critical thinking.

Hard Avoid: Flowery language, romance-centric, and short stories.

The Walking Dead, The Enemy, Day by Day Armageddon, and The Forest of Hands and Teeth are some of my favorites. I'm not asking for the best of the best, instead, I'm wanting to find hidden gems you might know about so I don't have to spend hours scrolling through romance fanfiction. If any are rational, even deconstructions, I'm doubly excited to read it.
