Shared plenty of your favorites, so I figured our taste wouldn't be so different so here's my favorites that aren't on your list:

- The Iron Teeth: the main character is a simple goblin and it is really fun to watch his antics, with the backdrop being bands of outlaws surviving in the wilderness north.

- Grand Design: humanity's been wiped out by a superintelligent race of alien who wishes to destroy the world, and the protagonists are the only surviving member of it. they searches for the Grand Design, the grandest weapon humanity had developed to fight against the superintelligent alien before they are wiped out.

- Release That Witch: isekai wish-fulfillment story where protagonist brought about technological advancement to medieval era.
