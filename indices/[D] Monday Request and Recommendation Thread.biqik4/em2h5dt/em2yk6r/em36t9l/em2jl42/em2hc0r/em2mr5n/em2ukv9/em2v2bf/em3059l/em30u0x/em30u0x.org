I've never really thought of it as a rational story, so I've never posted it around here. The main character isn't stupid, but he definitely isn't a genius either. The world is only slowly becoming internally consistent as I write more. I make up limitations on myself as I go.

The MC gains 'perks' based on how they've lived their past lives. I've never really had the MC munchkin the perk system.

I do avoid Deus Ex Machina when it comes to saving my MC's life. Reincarnating is part of the story, so if he gets into an unwinnable situation he tends to either die or successfully run away.
