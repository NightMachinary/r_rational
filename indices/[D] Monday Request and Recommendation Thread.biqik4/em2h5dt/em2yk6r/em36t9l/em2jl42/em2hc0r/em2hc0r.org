I'm going to repeat my request from the friday open thread in the hopes that it gets a few more responses:

So I'm about to start publishing the story I'm working on. It's a rationalist web serial with my own deconstructive take on a few of the more common tropes (isekai, litrpg etc) and I'm very excited to get it out here, of course, but I'm wondering where else I should advertise it besides this sub? This isn't a career move, just a passion, but I'd still like to reach a wide audience.
