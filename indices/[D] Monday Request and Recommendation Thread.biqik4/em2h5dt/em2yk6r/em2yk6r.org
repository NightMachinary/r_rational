I really enjoy time-loop / groundhog day style stories. I don't mind if they are traditionally published books (replay, first fifteen lives of harry august, one word kill), webnovels (mother of learning, time braid), or live action (russian doll, edge of tomorrow). Any good recommendations?

EDIT: Also should mention if fanfiction, prefer it to not require knowledge of source material. :)
