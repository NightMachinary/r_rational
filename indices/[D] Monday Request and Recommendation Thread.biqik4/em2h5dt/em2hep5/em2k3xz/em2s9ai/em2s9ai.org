I'm told Michael Grant's /Gone/ is about very similar themes? It's about a small city that gets surrounded in a forcefield, and everyone in it who's above a certain age disappears.

On the other hand, it's meant for kids, so I don't know deep the writing will be. On the gripping hand, it's by the same couple who managed to sell a war story about shape-shifting teens fighting mind-control aliens to 10-12 years olds, so who knows.
