[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347397.The_Disappearance][The Disappearance]] by Philip Wylie. Maybe not exactly what you are looking for, but half the population disappears (twice!).

From [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Wylie][wikipedia]]:

  He applied engineering principles and the scientific method quite broadly in his work. His novel The Disappearance (1951) is about what happens when everyone suddenly finds that all members of the opposite sex are missing (all the men have to get along without women, and vice versa). The book delves into the double standards between men and women that existed prior the woman's movement of the 1970s, exploring the nature of the relationship between men and women and the issues of women's rights and homosexuality.

  (...) Some people have accused Generation of Vipers of being misogynistic. The Disappearance shows his thinking on the subject is very complex.
