[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y:_The_Last_Man][Y: The Last Man]] is about every male mammal on Earth suddenly dying (except the main character).

It's been a while since I read it so I may be remembering incorrectly, but I don't think it has that much of a focus on the specific parts of that scenario you're interested in. It doesn't completely ignore them, but it does focus more on the personal instead of the logistics.
