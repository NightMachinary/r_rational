Funny you should mention that...

Can you wait like, one more week?

E: A more serious answer- this is actually partially what I'm exploring in the story I'm working on right now. Though the time scale is such that the logistics and politics probably won't enter into the picture until like, the second year's worth of stuff. In the short term, a lot of people disappearing is probably the most survivable type of apocalypse (depending on /why/ of course). Infrastructure is still in place, but your population is vastly reduced, so you aren't in /immediate/ danger unless you depend on services (gas, in-home care, etc) that might not be available to you. I imagine that the mid to long term effects would largely resemble the aftermath of a severe war or great plague- a gradual contraction and period of social reshuffling followed by an enormous uptick in births. If anything, the overall effects re/inertia in societal change and impacts on global climate would probably be extremely healthy for humanity as a species. Pretty unfortunate about the half that has to go, though.
