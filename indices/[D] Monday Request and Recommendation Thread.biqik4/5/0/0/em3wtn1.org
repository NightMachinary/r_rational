Thanks for the recs! I follow TNE and SL somewhat religiously right now, but will definitely read The Dao of Magic/Cradle/Metaworld Chronicles/Savage Divinity.\\
Have watched Psycho Pass 1+2 and SNK, but will definitely try Shin Sekai Yori and Seto No Hanayome.

Edit: Although Solo Leveling has fantastic art in the manhua, the story itself seems to be pretty meh. It seems like your stereotypical edgy OP MC who saves the world and gets praised a lot for it. Fun and enjoyable to read/watch like junk food, but not really in the same vein as APGTE/WTC/MOL imo.
