I'm trying to think of books where feature an uploaded protagonist. I quite like them, probably because of wish fulfillment :). I've made this [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/135331.Ems_Uploaded_minds][goodreads list for uploaded minds]] which includes Egan, Bobiverse, Stross, and a few more.

I'm also trying to think of all the books with [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/135415.Ship_minds][ship minds]], and [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/129688.Cryonics_to_a_strange_and_distant_future][cryonics]].

If that interests you, please let me know books that I'm missing, either here or by voting on goodreads.

And if you have similar tastes to me, feel free to [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5936824-wassname-mike-c][add me]] on goodreads. It's always motivating to see what others are reading or see ratings from people with similar tastes.
