Just discovered the manga [[https://myanimelist.net/manga/87922/Hyakuman-jou_Labyrinth][Hyakuman-jou Labyrinth]] Evidently it's completed, but the sketchy manga reading website I use is only up to chapter 9. So far it's been a pretty engrossing read, as the characters try to discover the rules of the world around them. Except they're videogame QA, so they do so by trying to /break/ the world, which is pretty funny.
