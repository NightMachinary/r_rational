[[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PurpleDays][Purple Days]] [A Game of Thrones] - Unlike a lot of other time loop stories where the protagonist is constantly dying in a loop to some disaster that they have to live past to escape (Time Braid, Mother of Learning), Joffrey is simply repeating the loop every time he dies. There is no obvious threat or reason that he can come up with for why this is happening to him. It's very reminiscent of /Groundhog Day/ where the protagonist is taking the time to grow and develop as a person.
