My story on royalroad has almost 4000 followers. I got them by doing basically nothing other than writing the story and adding cover art. There are lots of hungry readers out there looking for stories. "Build it and they will come" is pretty fitting advice.

Look at Mother of Learning as an example. Before it was added to royalroad the story had basically zero find-ability unless you already knew what you were looking for. Yet it had a huge fanbase.

As both a reader and a (sort of) author I'd recommend that you just focus on writing the story. If you can output consistently and often that will be enough of an advertisement. I'll at least try out most stories on royalroad that are over a hunded pages, sound vaguely interesting, and seem to update at least once a week.
