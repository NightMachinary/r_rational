[[/r/wormfanfic]] has a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/wiki/index][wiki]] and a [[https://old.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/bhywo4/weekly_rwormfanfic_discussion_what_have_you_been/][weekly discussion thread]].

If you liked the "gamer" part of A Bad Name, there are /very few/ good ones.\\
[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/][Siren Song]] is /okay/, though the main character doesn't grab me the same as A Bad Name's.\\
[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/][The Paragamer]] is an even harder sell, but has a nice "Life in a post-Endbringer city" arc in the beginning.

If you're very attached to Brockton bay and the original cast, you probably won't like either of them a lot, since they take place outside of BB.
