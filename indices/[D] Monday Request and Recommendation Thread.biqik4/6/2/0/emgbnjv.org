Regarding exploration? Well, Fallout 3 is probably my favorite in that regard, though having interesting places to go is kind of a requirement for most good open world games.

The 4x games that hit the closest are Civ5 and X3. In both cases I think it comes from seeing how the various NPC factions have set up. So... maybe what I'm looking for is less, like, pretty scenery and more coming upon and observation of interesting interaction of systems. Which, come to think of it, kinda applies to Fallout 3's AI too.
