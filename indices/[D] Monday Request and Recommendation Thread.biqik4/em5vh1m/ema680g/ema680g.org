Based on the realism and drama heavy ones in your favorites you might enjoy "Feed" by Mira Grant, it's one of my favorite books of all time. I didn't read it with a rational focus, but it's definitely the most realistic zombie setting I've ever seen and it has great character depth. It's part of a trilogy, but I haven't read the others.
