That was a sample chapter in an anthology book called The New Dead I read years ago, but I think it was called family business or something then. I didn't realize it was more than a short story and am picking it up now!

Funny enough, that book and The Living Dead were the reason I specifically asked for anything but short stories. When they came out, most of the short stories were professionally written but it was easy to tell that the authors were forced to adhere to the editors standards. That usually led to abrupt or unsatisfying endings, with the concepts just interesting enough to look into more of their work.

Fun bit of information, George R.R Martin had a short story about zombie prostitutes in one of them as some of his early work.
