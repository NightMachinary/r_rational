I really liked the We're Alive podcast. It has really nice sound production and voice actors which is pretty key for the form of media they're doing. Despite being purely sound it doesn't detract much from action scenes or tense moments. It's pretty long too which is nice. It's available on youtube or their website or spotify so you could listen to it on pretty much anything. The characters feel mostly real but there is some trope-y stuff sometimes but I thought it was fun and done in a good way.
