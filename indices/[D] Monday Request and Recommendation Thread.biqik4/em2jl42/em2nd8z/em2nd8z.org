I recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442][Cenotaph]], where a small change at the beginning of the story dramatically changes Taylor's strategy towards stealth and information gathering. It has a sequel, "Wake".

You can find a bunch by searching the subreddit for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=worm&restrict_sr=1]["Worm"]] with the search bar at the top.

There is also a subreddit called [[/r/WormFanfic][r/WormFanfic]] that may have good suggestions and a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFicRecs/Worm][TVtropes page]].
