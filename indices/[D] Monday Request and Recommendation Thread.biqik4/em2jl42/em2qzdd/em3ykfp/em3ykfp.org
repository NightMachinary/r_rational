El-Ahrairah goes for the optimal rationalization experience at the expense of character. I don't think I've ever seen a Taylor written to be as unlikeable as the one in that fic. The amount of condescending dialogue where she lectures adults twice her age... Man, it just took me out of the story and made me recognize that cool powers and rational protagonists are good and all, but investment in the characters requires a sympathetic protagonist.

This is what I mean by the dialogue:

  "It's true, Shadow Stalker," I said. "Incidentally, your actions against me earlier this month were a violation of your probation. Doubly so, in light of the fact that those actions induced a Trigger Event. The Protectorate was quite eager to score points with me by sacrificing you." I met her eyes; my power told me where they were, despite the mask. "But I plead your case, on the condition that you be watched more closely. You're scum, but your power is useful, and if I'm being honest I'm rather grateful that a cape was involved--the academic literature suggests that that's what made me a partial Trump. Still, make no mistake, Sophia Hess: you remain free only so long as I want you free. Now sit down and shut up."
