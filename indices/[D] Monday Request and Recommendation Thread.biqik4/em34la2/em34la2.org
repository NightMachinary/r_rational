You know, I don't think I've ever seen Larry Dahners or his [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/96454-ell-donsaii][Ell Donsaii]] books mentioned on this sub. They are pure popcorn literature - Mary Sue OP protagonist, wish fulfillment, action heavy, highly repetitive, and honestly not terribly rational.

But, they scratch a very nice itch for mutchkining a random piece science without going too deep into things (which almost always bogs down a story for me). It's what I imagine you would get if you tried to hollywoodize a hard scifi book. Each book is an exploration into what you could do if X technology were real (mini wormholes, harnessing quantum entanglement, gene manipulation, etc.).
