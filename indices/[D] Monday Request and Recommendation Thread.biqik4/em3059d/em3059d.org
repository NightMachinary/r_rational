I was wondering whether anyone would have any recommendations for me? I have read and liked (in probable order of my favorites):\\
1. A Practical Guide to Evil\\
2. Worth the Candle\\
3. Mother of Learning\\
4. Worm\\
5. KR web novels (generally monster invasion with self-insert, wish-fulfillment edgy MC)\\
6. CN web novels (ultra generic xianxia stories that hit all the tropes)

I really like the greater meta-ness and characterization of APGTE and WTC over MOL, although MOL is still great. Worm was my first web novel, so it was mindblowing to me at the time, and I enjoyed the different tropes in KR web novels over those of CN web novels.

Would you guys have any recommendations for me?
