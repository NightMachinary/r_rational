The KR web novels I'm really into right now are The Novel's Extra (cool premise and I like the MC), and Solo Leveling (also called Only I Level Up, it's both a web novel and comic with AWESOME art). If you want a somewhat meta and funny xianxia-esque story try The Dao of Magic. If you want good xianxia without the shitty CN tropes, try the Cradle series by Will Wight. Other enjoyable webnovels include Metaworld Chronicles (awesome worldbuilding and cool magic system) and Savage Divinity (really funny at times, depressing at others, and good character development).

If you want to go to a different medium, some good anime's are Mob Psycho 100 (there are 2 seasons, it has great art, and is really unexpectedly wholesome), Now and Then, Here and There (fucking brutally sad but really good), One Punch Man (good art and action and funny), Psycho Pass (good psychological thriller), From the New World (aka Shin Sekai Yori, really good, pretty sad, explores post apocalyptic world after a certain percentage of people get psychic powers), Seto no hanayome (my pick for funniest anime of all time), Attack on Titan (everyone has heard of this, great action and art).

None of these are rational per se, but enjoyable reads.
