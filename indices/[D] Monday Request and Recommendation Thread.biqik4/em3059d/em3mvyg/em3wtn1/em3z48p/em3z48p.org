For sure. I have even worse guilty pleasures to be honest, I read Reincarnation of the Strongest Sword God, which is yet another CN reincarnation VR story, but it scratches an itch.

Another few I forgot to recommend are With This Ring (a DC Comics, specifically Young Justice fanfic about a guy from normal earth suddenly appearing there with an orange power ring. It's pretty good and there is a LOT of it.) Also Dungeon Keeper Ami, a really good Sailor Moon fanfic (I know, but trust me, it's good). It updates very slowly now. A good rational story is A Hero's War, but it updates very slowly now as well.

If you like the stuff I recommended feel free to PM me whenever for more.
