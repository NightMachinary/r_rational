Semi-related but it sounds like you'd enjoy works such as [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99702.Island_in_the_Sea_of_Time][The Island in the Sea of Time]] or Weber's [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safehold][Safehold]] series?

If you haven't, I'd trawl through Novelupdates' books tagged with [[https://www.novelupdates.com/stag/apocalypse/][Apocalypse]], [[https://www.novelupdates.com/stag/kingdom-building/][Kingdom Building]], and [[https://www.novelupdates.com/stag/returning-from-another-world/][Returning From Another World]]. But webnovels are sadly almost all universally shallow when it comes to the things you're after in such a story.

I wish the tagging system on royalroadl had reader voting, but you can do something similar to novelupdates with the [[https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsAdd=post_apocalyptic&minPages=300&maxPages=20000&minRating=3.5][apocalypse tag]]
