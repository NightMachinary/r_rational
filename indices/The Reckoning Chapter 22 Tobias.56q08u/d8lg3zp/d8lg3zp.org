Getting earth tech better makes it a much more valuable piece for everyone, but the only ones who can take advantage of that currently is either earth itself, or V3.

Since V3 is the one that has goals outside of earth, he's doing a good job at cementing his advantages.

I wonder what the end game of this story will be. HPMOR had a pretty clear sort of end game it was working towards, but just what is it that the Animorphs want out of life? V3 has massively expanded the gamespace for humanity past 'keep earth free' into an invitation the wider universe. Canon Animorphs may have been dragged into wider fights for a book or two, but only really fought for earth.
