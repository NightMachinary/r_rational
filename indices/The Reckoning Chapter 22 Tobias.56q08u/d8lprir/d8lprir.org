This is far more elegant solution for the Visser than the brute force solutions I was thinking up. In one stroke, the Visser puts pressure on the animorphs to reveal themselves, gains some goodwill, can now play the nations of Earth against one another, industrializes and technologically advances his future industrial base, and, most importantly of all, fractures the resistance. Also, the cube.

While it's an elegant plan, there will be issues, as other people have pointed out. Cassie is dead, for one. For another, there are still bits of Aftran left, there's another bit of Aftran in US custody (Tyaagi's got a Yeerk in stasis) along with the earplug tech, and an actual Andalite around.

The only issue is giving humanity blueprints for super-advanced technology and expecting them to be able to up-tech to interplanetary travel in just 5 months. Although given that the Yeerks were able to rapidly industrialize, I suspect that while the first principles needed to work out how to build anti-gravity drives and energy weapons are difficult, once you have them it's easy to put together what one needs using basic early 21st century technology.

This story just went from awesome to f**king-unbelievably-good.
