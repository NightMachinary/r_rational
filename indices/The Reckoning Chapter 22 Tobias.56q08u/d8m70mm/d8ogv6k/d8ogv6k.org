RE international relations:

- I expect the middle east conflicts to keep on going as normal for the immediate term. Either dismissing it as American/zionist propoganda, or treating it as irrelevant.

- The main powers will probably go on immediate high alert (if they bweren't already after the asteroid impact, many of them would have assumed it was a nuclear strike/accident, or at least taken the possibility seriously). And mass mobilise everything, whether its aliens or America doing something sneaky they need to be on high alert.

- The next step will be trying to confirm what has actually happened. Either via diplomatic channels, spies in US services, satellite imagery, or all of the above. Noone in an intelligence agency on earth is sleeping any time soon.

- China and a bunch of other countries are going to shut down the internet until they figure out what the hell is going on, with associated repercussions for economy and public mood.

- Once they have convinced themselves it is real every country is going to demand to be able to have their own people talk to the alien, or have them passed on to the UN, or whatever. They'll see this as a potential seed of a renewed US hegemony if they are the only ones with access to the new tech and info. Expect a struggle within the US government between teh military type "keep it all to oursleves" and the internationalist elements. The only countries who have the ability to serioiusly enforce that demand would be China, since they could cut off trade supplies to the US, and maybe a coalition of the other developed countries if they can coordinate properly.
