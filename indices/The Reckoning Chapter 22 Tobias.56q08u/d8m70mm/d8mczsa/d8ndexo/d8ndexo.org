  I wonder if this is a "evil can't understand good" situation? As in, Visser Three might have flaws in his plan to manipulate both the Earth leaders and the Animorphs, because he's too selfish and sociopathic to pass for a benevolent person or whatever.

after reading the brainstorming thread, I think Visser Three is vastly overestimating human ability to figure out the right response. Like Visser Three can play international politics if he is given any exposure to other countries, but if the US government just throws him in a dark hole somewhere this angle is gone. Visser Three wouldn't expect this because of course doing this would send international tensions to a dangerous boiling point, but the US government might not react 'correctly'. Even worse for him, Fundamentalist Christians in congress might think he is a demon and demand his immediate execution. This might have seemed too stupid, but there are congressmen on the science committee that deny evolution and global warming. Visser Three is counting on us being stupid in a manipulable way, not on us being random stupid.

TLDR; It's not evil can't comprehend good, but hyper competence can't comprehend the level and complexity of human stupidity.
