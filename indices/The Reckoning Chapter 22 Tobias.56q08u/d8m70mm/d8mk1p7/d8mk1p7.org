  - I do notice that the space-bridge kept Esplin distracted long enough to let the situation devolve into something he couldn't control.

I wonder if that could have been the entire reason for C/E to make and show him the bridge? Chaos God was on the Animorph side in the pool to keep the fight going, Order God pushes V3 towards an unveiling to try and neuter the Animorphs?

*<Edit>* Looking at the Esplin chapter again, this seems more and more likely. He was distracted by the bridge for ages, then was right in the middle of negotiating a truce with Telor when word of the crash came in.

That may well have been what made him take the gamble of revealing himself to humanity: It makes him briefly indispensable to Telor, and I don't think Telor has the chutzpah to tell the actual truth and have him executed as a scapegoat, they need him to manage this diplomatic tangle he's created.*</Edit>*

  most militaries will think about the possibility, and try to reverse-engineer the tech before replicating it

What, you're just going to carefully /study/ this while China/ Russia/ North Korea/ America is possibly building an invincible space fighter task force? This is a prisoner's dilemma with a bunch of players, at least /someone/ is going to build it straight off the plans ASAP, so you'd better do the same to keep up.

*<EDIT>* Depending how "LW Rationalist" [[/u/tk17studios]] wants to be, this is the /perfect/ analogy for the AI safety research problem. You gotta go fast or someone else will do it first and own you, but if you go fast without worrying about understanding the risks of what you're doing you might end up being a slave to some alien intelligence. *</EDIT>*
