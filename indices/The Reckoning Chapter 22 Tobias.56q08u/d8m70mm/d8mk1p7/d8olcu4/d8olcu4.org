  What, you're just going to carefully study this while China/ Russia/ North Korea/ America is possibly building an invincible space fighter task force? This is a prisoner's dilemma with a bunch of players, at least someone is going to build it straight off the plans ASAP, so you'd better do the same to keep up.
