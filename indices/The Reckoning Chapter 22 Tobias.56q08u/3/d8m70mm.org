Okay, there's a lot to be said here, this chapter changes so much. Braindumping:

- Meta-wise, this is a super bold move. Canon Animorphs kept the invasion secret until the yeerks had been defeated; even when they started their open invasion, they still ran magic cover-up operations that kept everyone in the dark, and we only saw the one governor and a few military leaders interact with the story. The reason is, of course, to keep things simple, easy to determine and easy to explain to the reader. You've basically let 7 billion players enter the game here; I'm impatient to see how you deal with that.

- On the whole, I think this was Visser 3 making the best out of a very bad situation, and still kind of a bad decisions because of information he didn't have, for multiple reasons. And I know this is believer-thinking, but I do notice that the space-bridge kept Esplin distracted long enough to let the situation devolve into something he couldn't control.

- The world is going to move like crazy for the next few weeks. Every single political and military force in the world is going to be on high alert for a while; which might have interesting effects on ongoing conflicts (how would El Assad react after learning about an alien invasion). I expect many instances of curfews, and many riots wherever there's political instability, as people wonder if their leaders might be compromised, or just easy to take out.

- Speaking of which, I wonder how the international community will react to this. Most stories about alien invasions are focused on what happens in the Pentagon, and mostly paint world leaders as acting unanimously, or bickering themselves to a standstill. But in practice, even if we only consider people on the Security council, I'd expect Vladimir Putin and Fran√ßois Hollande to have wildly different reactions to this situation.

- I wonder how justified Tobias' fears about Esplin handing out backdoored tech are. One the one hand, most militaries will think about the possibility, and try to reverse-engineer the tech before replicating it. On the other hand, this might be equivalent to teaching indigenous people how to make computers, killer drones and laser-guided missiles, then attacking them after an EMP strike. You've basically tricked them into making you a free industry, and there's not much they could have done to anticipate your move. Not much to be done against this either (except planting bombs in every factory, which... has its own problems), since /not/ upgrading is not an option, especially when other countries might not be so recalcitrant.

- On a more personal level, Paul Evans (aka fake!President) is kind of screwed now. There's no way their entourage is going to leave them unattended long enough to morph-demorph without being seen. Even if the real president gets back extremely fast and they switch places again, they'll have to do so in front of /some/ witnesses. Awkward explanations incoming.

- The technology boost will be a political shitstorm, depending on what exactly Esplin is ready to share. Right now we're afraid of the political consequences of people getting access to /nukes/. Esplin demonstrated he had the technology to wipe the Earth, and might be ready to share it.

- I don't think Esplin is going to come on top once the Animorphs start their post-preemptive counter-counter-insurgency. First, their access to morphing technology means they can prove their good faith to arbitrary people, at the cost of giving them immense powers. They know for a fact that some of Esplin's affirmations are a lie (him being about to starve, the meteor being a dead-man-switch), but most importantly they know that Esplin has access to a Leeran, with all that implies. Of course, they might pretend to believe him as some sort of I-know-you-know-I-know game, but they'll probably stick to first principles and just stonewall as much as they can.

- I think Tobias is a bit optimistic/pessimistic about the speed at which Yeerk society will integrate on Earth. We already have a hard time integrating differently-coloured refugees who did /not/ "accidentally" flatten a major population center as an act of spite. I'd expect it to take years before yeerks were allowed to infest humans anywhere, let alone in a military. By the time controllers were allowed any strategic post, memetic contamination would have started again, and the state of the war would probably have changed drastically.

- Speaking of which, I think the most scary tactic Esplin could employ is use the human race as a living shield. If he can persuade even a few countries to host yeerk coalescions, as long as those countries are powerful/influential enough not to be strong-armed by the rest of the world, he can maintain a yeerk presence long enough to compromise the planet in the eyes of the Andalites. Of course it's a bit harder than that, since both the Andalites and the human world leaders will probably consider this scenario, but it might be the best way to get Earth into conflict with the Andalites.

- Holy shit, this is a lot of text I'm writing. TK17Studios is probably having multiple writergasms by now.

- I think that, among the multiple failure modes Esplin has just opened himself to, the biggest one is that he made himself potentially superfluous to Telor and the Yeerk guerilla empire (new headcanon name!). If Telor can open negotiations with human leaders, they might realize that they can broker some treaty where Earth accepts to build an armada powerful enough to defend the planet from Andalite cleansing, host an arbitrary number of yeerk coalescions (as long as they don't infest anyone), and serve as a hub for the yeerks to explore the galaxy while they keep getting engineered bodies from the Arn. Granted, such a solution would be hard to get to, but it would be mutually beneficial and give the yeerks everything they want without any other coalescion dying. Plus, Esplin is basically the perfect scapegoat right now.

- I see several comments mentioning the possibility of delivering Aftran's last shards to Telor. I'm not sure they're going to do that. First, the shards might refuse out of self-preservation: even if they're delivered directly to Telor without interference from Esplin, Telor will probably dissolve them, and might even do so in a way that doesn't conserve their memories, to avoid memetic contamination. Second, even if Telor spits the shards back intact, the Animorphs won't be able to trust them, since they have no way to check the "identity" of a piece of yeerk matter. And even if the Animorphs are okay with letting the shards go, Temrash might want to stay with Marco's dad anyway. (that's a lot of "even"s :p)

- I'm wondering if Esplin's plan might be on a shorter time period than it appears. First, his attempts at contacting the Animorphs are probably a play for the hypercube. I mean, uh, the blue cube. But beyond that, he might just be trying to get some key component of the game into whatever shape he needs, without consideration for how his actions affect the rest of the world, because he intends to go into the offensive before they can actually prepare their defences. I'm not sure that's the case, because it sounds like a plan the Joker would make in the Dark Knight that can't possibly work in real life because something unexpected happens along the way. Still, worth a thought.

- Not sure how relevant the Animorphs are by now. Like Tobias said "gods, alien warlords, and USA presidents". The only way they can still influence the game might be communicating relevant intel to people willing to listen, and giving the morphing power to a lot of people.

- More on this later, but I think Tobias speaking out was a minor tactical blunder. Esplin's speech was broadcast to the entire world, while Tobias' interruption only touched a few thousands people at most, and will be reported as "In the middle of the speech you just heard, a telepathic voice who's probably a secret guerilla teenager said some rude things".

- By the way, I'm guessing that Esplin had most of his caches and sleeper agents evacuated before/while making his speech? If he did, people might notice the sudden disappearances (unless the sleeper agents were all low-profile people with few connections). If he didn't, the Animorphs could get militaries to quarantine the concerned cities (might be too hard to do, though), get the Chee to spot any incoming Bug fighters, and capture the sleeper agents.

I think I'm done. No, wait, that was only the strategic implications.
