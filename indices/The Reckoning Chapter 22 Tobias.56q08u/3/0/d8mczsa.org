My thoughts on the writing and stuff:

- "Don't give up the gunfight without at least making him waste some bullets." I love that line :D Han Solo said something similar in /The Thrawn Trilogy/, to a concilman who refused to take any initiative because it might be playing into Thrawn's hands (though his concerns where a bit more legitimate there). I think Tobias is worrying a bit too much about not letting Esplin predict him, and should worry more about doing things that work even if your enemy anticipates them.

- Tobias is getting seriously injured. At some point, he'll have to self-morph to backup!Tobias, but he has way too much critical intel to do that right now (plus it's kind of like suicide). Although he could let one of the Aftran shards infest him, collect all the relevant intel, then /git-checkout/ himself. Then again, trust issues.

- I like how everyone is completely shocked and excited and terrified by the alien invasion and completely on the ball and almost unsurprised by it. Everyone posts pictures on Twitter fast enough to make a cover-up impossible, the police cordons the area off immediately, the air force reacts to the spaceship as soon as they see it, etc. I'm not sure what gives me this impression; I think in most "aliens arrive" scenes, people usually just gawk at the spaceship until the alien inside says something or starts killing people.

- I'm really glad the story name-dropped "Twitter, Reddit and Facebook". On one hand, this will probably make the fic very dated at some point, the same way /Star Trek/ references make canon Animorphs super dated now. On the other hand, this grounds the story so much, makes it seem so realistic and close to reality, like a lot of other details in the story, that I don't think it could have been omitted, or replaced with a generic mention about "social networks". I mean, of course if a spaceship crashed in a population center, there would be pictures of it on Twitter within the next thirty seconds. Actually...

- I'm really interested in what the media coverage for this event would look like. A very interesting part of Worm was how the public reacted to the protagonists' adventures. Some of it was poorly done (the PRT being about nothing but PR was a bit clumsy), but some of it made the story /awesome/. The first time Taylor took out a supervillain, there was an article about it on Superheroes!Wikipedia. When she took over the town, the police started hanging flyers warning against her, and people debated her choices in forums. I hope this story gets its own PHO interlude.

- Speaking of which, I mentioned in the previous chapter that it might be interesting to get the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] hive-mind to pool suggestions for Telor's litteral hive-mind. But another, more direct idea could be to get reddit posters to play fictional reddit posters. The possibilities are limitless!

- I wonder how the Chee think when they're talking to humans. Their interlude made it clear they had a very alien psyche, and yet they're completely relatable when talking to other characters, probably using social algorithms acquired through centuries of living among humans. Even taking that into account, the difference is still jarring: the Chee in the interlude seemed completely unaware of things like names, or human dignity.

- The "I notice I am confused" comment was probably the most jarring part of the chapter to me. I feel this is something Marco /might/ think, but I wouldn't expect Tobias to think that, much less interiorize it (as opposed to quoting it from someone else). I think that The Reckoning is a great rational fic because it avoids using obvious "flags" for LessWrong ideas. When Esplin said something about Alloran being confused, he said it in character, and in his own words. It felt like an idea that he had constructed himself, not something he was quoting from LW.

- I really like the first contact scene. I can imagine people, being there. You see a spaceship hovering in the sky, people are taking pictures, there are helicopters around, the cops are trying to evacuate the area... then a voice in your head says "Hey, just saying, the guy you're about to see might be like Hitler". Badass. Oh, and then Esplin starts talking about how he wanted to invade the entire planet and killed millions of people, and you think "Um, okay. Should I run away really fast?".

- That dig at the canon appearance of Andalites is awesome. Aaaand kind of petty :p

- Yes! Shoot him! Succumb to the Renegade Side, Tobias! Screw consequences! Screw long-term planning! Make the bullies' life hard! Spread anarchy for the Chaos Legion! (looking at the situation logically, I think it would have been beneficial to Tobias to shoot Esplin, if he'd actually been close enough to do so).

- The scene where Esplin freezes the government official to continue his (unauthorized) speech is actually pretty funny. "And in our arrog... Hey! Stay back, pathetic human! I'm not done speaking. Where was I? Yes, we regret trying to enslave your species, in our unjustified arrogance, but now we've learned the errors of our way."

- I wonder if this is a "evil can't understand good" situation? As in, Visser Three might have flaws in his plan to manipulate both the Earth leaders and the Animorphs, because he's too selfish and sociopathic to pass for a benevolent person or whatever.

And... if think I'm done. For real, this time. Holy crap, this chapter was inspiring.
