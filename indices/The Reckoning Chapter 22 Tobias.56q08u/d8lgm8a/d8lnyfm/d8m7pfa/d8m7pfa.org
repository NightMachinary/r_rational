In Aftran's chapter this is true, but in just the previous chapter, with Visser 3 discussing with the other pool minds:

#+begin_quote
  ‹Aftran was compromised in more ways than one,› he said. ‹There is a reason I kept you quarantined from her once she began taking human hosts. She lost more in Silat than she expected, and with what was left---she was beginning to allow the humans to---influence her.›
#+end_quote

So even though an individual Yeerk's study of human emotions was a failure that was ignored, the collective pool of Aftran was starting to be influenced. Of course, Visser 3 could be lying partially, but we also heard this from the Yeerk Temrash in a previous chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “Because we were learning!” Temrash broke in. “Things that would change the war---that would change everything. Because we'd figured out that we didn't need him anymore!”
#+end_quote

In explanation for why Visser 3 wiped out so many of them.
