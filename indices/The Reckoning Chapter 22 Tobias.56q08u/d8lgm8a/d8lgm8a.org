Okay... we have just enough information that Tobias doesn't have to call out BS on a few parts...

The Visser claims:

#+begin_quote
  But if we are to slip the noose that fate has prepared for us---to step outside of the roles our manipulators intend for us to play---then we must start somewhere.
#+end_quote

However in the previous chapter:

#+begin_quote
  No, it was not at all clear that Esplin should attempt to do what the watchers wanted, assuming it was even possible to guess. Nor was it safe to try striking out in the opposite direction, to act in open defiance of an unknown force with unknown strength and values---in the end, the best he could do was attempt to reason from clear knowns and first principles.
#+end_quote

Thus we know that the goal he stated to Tobias is at least partially BS.

Next statement:

#+begin_quote
  I see no fundamental reason for us to be enemies---my people think they want control, but that is only because true symbiosis has never occurred to them as an option.
#+end_quote

However, we know that the Visser killed the pool mind without saving any of it in order to guarantee that the idea of true symbiosis would be eliminated.

So we at least know two major claims are deceptions, but I can't figure out what the Visser's endgame in this is.
