Predictions:

- V3 will make excellent use of his (ironically) captive audience. It's likely that interrogating him will become an international effort, meaning representatives from major nations (those on the UN Security Council at the least) will be involved. Naturally, that lets him play global politics without ever leaving his cell.
- The Animorphs will send somebody to talk to V3. Probably Jake, despite Marco's protests. Alternatively, they may send one of the Chee and relay the dialogue with thought-speak.
- There will be public pressure, ostensibly (and perhaps actually) not from V3, for the Animorphs to reveal themselves.
- There will be a heated argument with the Chee over the truce. Marco will be dead against it. Jake will feel guilty for wanting to give in.
- The surviving portion of Aftran will be livid at V3's propaganda. Since V3 does not know about them, this offers the potential for clever strategies (e.g. sending them to Telor to spread the memes that led V3 to attempt to kill Aftran, or using them as counter-propaganda).

Also, I liked the description of V3's appearance as a canon Andalite. Pretty much designed to appear graceful and wise to humans is right.
