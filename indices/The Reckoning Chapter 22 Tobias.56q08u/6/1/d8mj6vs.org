  I can't figure out what the Visser's endgame in this is.
#+end_quote

Remember he's not evil for the sake of it. He wants to amass as much personal power as possible so he can achieve his wider goal of optimising the universe.

He's obviously lying through his teeth in order to make the offer as palatable as possible, but it gives him a good chance of conquering earth the way Tobias speculated. Choose the most compliant surviving human hosts and release them, let them tell nice stories, then in a couple of weeks time have an "Andalite" attack wreak some havoc on earth and the Yeerks ride to the rescue.

The Visser explains that the Andalites are afraid of the humans challenging them, or the Yeerks using the humans as a resource, and offer more help with technology and an alliance, and some voluntary infestation. Once they're integrated enough a coordinated takeover or Arn sleeping-sickness plague or whatever allows a complete takeover, or maybe he's even able to keep manipulating humans to serve his goals without that.
