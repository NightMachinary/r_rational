I assume he got the Arn to build the construct body +just like the one Rachel killed.+ It has the advantage of being a hell of a lot more likeable and trustworthy looking compared to an actual R!Andalite, if Ax shows up for real he'll look like a Gremlin compared to V3's Mogwai.

+Note that also means this body could be full of tricky weapons and so on, but I'd guess he's left it pretty bare so it looks harmless when it's dissected after it dies.+

Edit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/56q08u/the_reckoning_chapter_22_tobias/d8mkm9k?context=3][Word of god]] says it is a construct body, but his previous human avatars were actual humans infested by artificial Yeerks.

My second para is still true I guess, but I'd written it when I thought his avatars had under-skin weapon storage, when it was actually just regular pockets...
