Adding to the list of things Visser Three does not know about: let's not forget that his contact with Rachel's mind was /prior/ to Rachel finding out about the retrieval of Ax. He may or may not have registered that there was an Andalite distress signal (remember, there was a ton of information in a very compressed burst), but he definitely doesn't KNOW that there's a legit living Andalite on the surface.
