I think that it's already the case that this is a conflict of Good v. Good, inasmuch as Visser Three is explicitly fighting Moloch (under its guise as "The Vanarx"). Depending on his intentions for the post-endgame, it might not be my favorite choice or even be in my top five, but it's better than nothing IMO.
