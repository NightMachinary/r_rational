This story never fails to impress me.

I'm not sure what I want more - for the Animorphs to continue fighting Visser Three, or for them to team up with Visser Three against some new enemy such as the Andalites (who did, after all, want to destroy the Earth...)

Also, the Visser's speech was so good that I can't decide how sincere he is about what he said. I think it would be very interesting if he is, in fact, sincere, because it would show that he is willing to rapidly change his mind and adapt to new circumstances. That would give him a great depth of character, and make him more sympathetic (the most interesting conflicts are Good vs. Good). On the other hand, if this is all some clever trick, I wouldn't be surprised, and couldn't complain.
