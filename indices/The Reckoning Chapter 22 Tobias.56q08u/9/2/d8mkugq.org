I'm modelling him as an amoral alien AI who places zero value on the fulfilling preferences of others, (of course helping others can still be useful instrumentally, as with the Arn) and whose own preferences/goals might or might not align with human preferences in some ways.

His speech is full of lies, everything about his little show was carefully crafted to create the desired effect, with truth being only instrumentally useful, not a goal in its own right.

Rachel will agree with me, probably Marco will too, with Cassie dead... (shit, I think it was Chaos God in the pool. and he /wanted/ war to continue, and he /wanted/ Cassie dead to help achieve that...) who'd going to be arguing for a truce? Ax won't trust him, who can be more pro-peace than Jake? (David!)

The Yeerks will definitely get some human allies out of this, and they'll benefit short-term, but V3 is not a safe genie, there are way too many outcomes where cooperating with him ends terribly for you, and more likely ones too I think.
