You consistently surprise me. This is the one thing it would never have occured to me for V3 to do. But it makes perfect sense from his POV. It works so well as a surprise because it violated an implicit assumption I never realised I had about the story, that the canon style masquerade had to be maintained, and that the sides in the war were set.

The biggest threats are not the humans but crayak and ellimist. Even if one of them is on your side notionally, they are still using you as peices in a game. To quote Masego in the Practical Guide to evil, we've been focusing on fighting the other prisoners, when we should have been breaking out of the cage.
