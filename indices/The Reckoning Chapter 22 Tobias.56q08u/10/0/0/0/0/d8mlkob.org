.../oh/, that was meant to be /clothes/, I thought it was a cyborgy kind of body... I read it as clothes later on then other kids were pulling his "artificial skin", but as a construct here. Hmm, I wonder how many other people made my mistake, I thought the artificial Yeerk was too big to infest a regular body, for some reason. This means he can infest and fully interrogate anyone without leaving Alloran then, and without the two-way communication of a Leeran.
