Whoah, good question. And if it is individual shards, what happens to the morphing ability when they're reabsorbed?

The whole pool would have a time in morph of like 30 seconds so that doesn't work.

How about using the Visser's Tech to give the pool a few dozen construct or volunteer bodies it can control remotely?
