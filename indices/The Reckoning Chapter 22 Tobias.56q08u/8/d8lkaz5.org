This was an excellent chapter with yet another great twist in the plot development.

My guess is that this plan is designed to be adaptable into many possible outcomes good for Visser Three, such as Tobias' thoughts of the factories to churn out bug fighters. But I think the primary goal, above all else, is Visser Three hoping that he can manage to befriend/trick the Animorphs into revealing the cube. The cube is possibly a prize on a similar scale to the entire planet for the Yeerks. If they can reverse engineer the tech, they could potentially have whatever bodies they need at all times.
