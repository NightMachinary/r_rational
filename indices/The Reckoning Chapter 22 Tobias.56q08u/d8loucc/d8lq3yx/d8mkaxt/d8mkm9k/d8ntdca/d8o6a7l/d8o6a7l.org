Shouldn't we be? I'm pretty sure we all still knew that /she/ believed she had killed a kid, and before I just felt extra-sad for her going through the experience of that when it wasn't true. Maybe she could have found out someday and been marginally less traumatized, who knows? Unfortunately, there is a real psychological difference between killing someone with your own hands (er, tail), alone in an unexpected fight for your life vs setting war plans into motion with a team. I don't think she made the wrong choice or anything, so this is actually better (for the story, not her lol).
