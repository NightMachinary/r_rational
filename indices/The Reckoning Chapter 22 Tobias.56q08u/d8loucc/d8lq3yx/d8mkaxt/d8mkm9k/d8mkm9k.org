It is an Arn construct, but as for the human ones, I have some bad news for you ... he's just been taking real people and running them as doombots. Rachel killed an actual kid.

What the Arn and/or the Naharans did was sort out how to make a "blank Yeerk" that V3 could then control via thought using a Z-space transmitter (a mimic of one small piece of what the morphing tech is doing). Stick that in any ol' host body, and voila.
