This is a sequel to [[https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football]["17776: What football will look like in the future"]], which was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6loy70/th_wip_what_football_will_look_like_in_the_future/][shared here]] a few years ago. It's best to start there if you haven't read it yet. The current installment has just reached its “midseason finale” of sorts and will be picking up in 2021 (I didn't tag it WIP because the next part is going to be a separate installment with its own title).

Spoilers for 17776: Briefly, this is a webfiction about the distant future of an Earth where humans stopped aging, dying, or being born in 2026. After achieving post-scarcity and failing to find anything of interest out in space, people now occupy themselves with increasingly elaborate forms of play. The story is told from the perspective of self-aware space probes who observe moments in different people's lives, comment on football games, and draw parallels to interesting bits of American history trivia.

Of interest to the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community, particularly in this installment: a generally positive take on immortality (though it's not a technological singularity type of setting that pushes the boundaries of what it means to be human; these are “regular” immortal humans, most of them just aren't miserable about it); a novel game with a simple premise from which complex strategy emerges; characters succeeding against (varyingly) intelligent opponents via lateral thinking and manipulating information asymmetry.
