I can't remember how much of a thing that is in 17776 specifically because it's been a while since I read it, but there's a ton of it in 20020.

ETA: I checked and there's definitely at least some of it in 17776. This quote kind of sums up the way it's approached:

"I wonder if there's a single place in the whole world that's never had a story. I bet not. I just about guarantee you there's no places like that in America. Every little square of it, every place you stomp your foot, that's where something happened. Something wild, maybe something nobody knows about, but something. You can fall out of the sky and right into some forgotten storybook."
