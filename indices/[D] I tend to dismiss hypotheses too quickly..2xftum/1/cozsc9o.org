I have this problem now and then. My usual practice is to withhold judgement and kind of let the hypotheses pop like popcorn and then settle down. It's not like I would really have immediate off-the-cuff evidence that's strong enough to immediately eliminate most hypotheses... usually it takes a bit to even unpack new ideas and get them past my first few levels of cached reactions and responses. I still miss notes of confusion... but it's an ongoing thing.
