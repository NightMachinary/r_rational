It's good that you're noticing the pattern at all. The next step is to try to notice it immediately, or soon after it actually occurs. So you want to prime yourself to be on the lookout next time you find yourself in a situation where you may be discarding a hypothesis prematurely.

Something that might work (its unnecessary for me but seems to work for others) is reinforcing the behavior of noticing by giving yourself a quick and easy reward. Use of a click counter may work, or treating yourself to a bite of chocolate. YMMV. Personally I immensely enjoy finding opportunities for self improvement, so the act of noticing things is itself a reward.

(Edit: An important step I left out is to actively seek out concrete opportunities to trigger the unwanted behavior. This will speed up the process. You will know best how to do this.)

Whatever you do, the goal is to get to a point where you routinely notice the behavior as soon as it occurs, and then as it is occurring. At that point you can transition from rewarding yourself for noticing, to rewarding yourself for implementing an alternate behavior instead of what you normally do.

In your case something that might work is writing down the hypothesis and any perceived disconfirming evidence, along with estimates of your beliefs, and the strength of the evidence. Try to think of ways the hypothesis can still be true, given the perceived disconfirming evidence.

Then over the course of the next few days (or however long it takes to get more evidence), you can revisit that hypothesis and adjust accordingly. This should help you to identify the sorts of situations where you too readily dismiss hypotheses, and become more mindful of that fact.

Of course, nothing is solved until it is automated! Eventually the alternate behavior should become the new default behavior. With time and practice, you should internalize the process, and be less likely to dismiss hypotheticals out of hand.

Hope this is useful! At this point I'd like to suggest further reading [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/p/microrationality.html?m=1][here]], and [[http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-to-train-noticing.html?m=][here]] (which is where I got these ideas).
