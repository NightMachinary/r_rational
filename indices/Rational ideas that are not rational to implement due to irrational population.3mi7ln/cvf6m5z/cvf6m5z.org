Your example doesn't seem to fit the class. It's not that it's irrational to implement, it's that we just can't. If you could flick a switch and have it implemented that would be a rational thing to do (or not, depending on how you feel about a divided humanity entrenching its division by taking to the stars before it even attempts to reconcile, and turning its back on that prospect forever).
