  And, as I have noted, I am referring to the flu, in healthy adults, and made exceptions for consideration of more dangerous strains.

The flu, which is also a respiratory track disease, didn't decline around when auto immune issues started appearing. There's no actual evidence that flu infections improve your immune system functioning. The article also noted that they managed to stimulate long living immune cells by vaccinating them with mycobacterial cell wall fragments, not that they infected them with flu or a live disease.

So yes, you cite scientific articles, but not ones that actually support your point.

Vaccines use the immune system too, and certain ones can make it work better is what your scientific article proved.

  Written by oh, so knowledgeable individuals with one goal in mind. Universal vaccination, because anything else would require too much thinking.

Yes, all this science that disagrees with you is a vast conspiracy! Reading it will pollute your mind.

In reality, as mature, proper scientists they want to improve public health using science.

  In layman's terms, the immune system is being used, therefore, it stays strong. Does this mean that I think everyone should put anthrax powder on their cornflakes? No.

Layman's terms aren't good. In actuality, when mice are given cell wall fragments of mycobacteria they have a healthy immune system.

It's like if a study found out "Eating things seems to keep cats fur healthy." and you concluded from that. "Eating forks will improve my muscle growth." You should stop using your common sense. Scientific studies don't prove random things you think are rational that they didn't study.

  Allowing lesser diseases to infect the population every now and then is like exercise for the immune system.

  Get it through your head. I am referring to forgoing vaccination for the flu, in healthy adults, with exceptions for the most virulent strains.

  It ALSO stated that individuals that regularly encountered immune system threats experienced fewer mass die-offs of immune system cells and fewer malignancies.

As you noted, lesser diseases, immune threats. I wouldn't count flu as a lesser disease anyway, but this isn't a strawman, this is what you said.

Regardless of whether it's just flu or anything else minor that you value, you haven't shown that the flu specifically boosts your immune system. You certainly haven't shown that when the immune system is used it stays strong.
