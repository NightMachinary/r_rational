So, issues with your rationality-

You're claiming that once you get infected you have some sort of superior immunity. This puts others in danger, as natural immunity is often inferior. Flu vaccines for example cover you against multiple strains, and as such are superior, and many vaccines are superior. Also, many diseases have a high risk of death, and pox parties and similar things where people seek natural immunity are incredibly dangerous.

You're disregarding science in favor of aligning yourself with the anti science anti vaccers who make absurd claims about vaccines. This weakens the credibility of other people who claim rationality.

You're claiming that healthy people with appropriate immunities don't get sick from those diseases. This gives people a false sense of invincibility and increases danger. In reality, immunity is just one element of a complex, multilayered set of systems to resist disease, and one which can fail or be evaded. Minimizing exposure is always important to minimize chances of an infection defeating your immune system. If you have too numerous an infection they may evolve past your immune system, and there are parts of your body where your immune system has a much weaker presence, like your brain.

So yes, your attitudes are very dangerous and risky for the future of humanity.
