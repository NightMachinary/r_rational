  What I have said repeatedly was that healthy adults subjected to live viruses without vaccinations will have a stronger reaction to the disease, with nearly no risk of permanent harm.

And as I noted, respiratory track diseases haven't actually declined and they are harmful and can cause death.

I suggest reading actual scientific articles on the matter,

Or reading the various well written public health guides.

  Challenging the immune system with threats it can successfully counter is shown to be a plausible way to improve immune system health.

  Human autoimmune diseases are often associated with viral infections that disrupt T cell survival mechanisms, resulting in lymphopenia.
#+end_quote

Remember the article you cited? It noted that viral infections could cause mass deaths of immune cells, causing them to need rapid repopulation which leads to malignant immune cells. And as I noted, a number of illnesses have been proven to not have any effect on autoimmune diseases. It's a super complex picture. Some illnesses help, some hurt. Some do both.

  You don't get to define what science is. Scientists do, and you better believe that the Wikipedia hard sciences folks would be all over those articles if there wasn't science to back them up. That is one thing that Wiki does do pretty well, provide accurate information on hard sciences.

Is this based on talking to actual professional scientists?

I have, and while many note the usefulness of wikipedia for student research and getting a basic overview, they've also noted that it often lacks a lot of research, and their efforts to edit in accurate research were often stopped by non scientist bureaucracies which overruled them.

If you want actual really good science look for a review, not wikipedia.

Not that I'm actually contradicting much info in wikipedia. You've just taken wikipedia and gone far further than it suggests to push your personal theory of immunology, contradicting your own sources in your efforts to prove your points.

  Where in the hell are you even coming up with this absurdity? Where have I even hinted that this was a good idea? Have I gotten lost and found myself in 4Chan?

And you noted influenza, a dangerous disease that's killed millions, as an example of that.

Since many diseases worsen the immune system as your cited article noted, and many have no effect as mine noted, this mass infection would be a bad idea. You may want them to acquire the viruses naturally, but I'd see preventing people from using good sanitation techniques is similar to mass infecting them.

  It was an error. I will go fix it now, since you are so bothered by it that it has apparently destroyed your ability to argue against points I actually made.

Good.
