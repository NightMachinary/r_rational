  I have repeatedly indicated that this position is a position I hold for flu immunizations. Please do not engage in strawman arguments to draw other diseases into the conversation.
#+end_quote

I didn't actually draw other diseases into the conversation.

Plus, your general argument, we should let people be infected with minor diseases to train the immune system includes other illnesses. Still, the Flu isn't a minor disease, and can easily cause deaths.

  No, I am not. If you think that I am, then you are clearly not reading what I am writing. You are picking out the little bits that you disagree with and rearranging my arguments in your own mind so that you can believe me to be wrong. I noticed that you did not comment on the study I linked. Facts are painful, no?
#+end_quote

Your actual arguments are generally weak, and there's a lot of overlap between your beliefs and anti vac ones, like the belief in natural immunity being superior, healthy immune systems being invulnerable to diseases, exposing people to dangerous diseases to promote resistance. Even on their own, ignoring the anti vac connection, those are poor beliefs.

The article you linked said there were only small benefits, mostly based on an analysis of working days lost, among low risk populations. They didn't do a cost benefit analysis or anything, so it was of limited use. I never claimed there were large benefits to mass vaccination for flu among healthy adults- I was contesting your claim that it would lead to a weaker immune system through it not being exercised. The study stated something different from what you said and I didn't really care enough to get into it.

You've avoided citing any evidence for your actual core claims though.

  For most strains of the flu, a healthy adult between 16-60 or so will be irritated, but not have their life threatened. This is proven repeatedly in flu research. Most strains of the flu are a minor inconvenience to healthy individuals between 16 and 60.

Incorrect.

The flu virus can infect lots of stuff. It can by random chance infect the brain say. It's not a minor disease, it's a serious one which can have serious effects.

  The more different encounters the immune system has, the stronger it becomes overall, unless a disease or infection is encountered that directly attacks the immune system.
#+end_quote

You make up a lot of stuff about the immune system. I doubt you'll change your view, but to any readers-

The immune system develops specific counters. It develops, say, a counter to a particular molecule on some flu viruses. The next year that counter won't work. The immune system won't be any more effective or strong against a new flu virus without that molecule. The immune system isn't a pokemon. It doesn't evolve into stronger forms, it doesn't gain exp, it doesn't gain EVs. Your immune system as a general matter gets weaker as you age.

#+begin_quote
  The immune system is designed to encounter and react.
#+end_quote

Creationism is a lie. The immune system is evolved, not designed. As such, it varies immensely in effectiveness from person to person.

  That's what the appendix is for. It samples the digestive tract for things to introduce to the immune system.
#+end_quote

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_%28anatomy%29]]

We're not sure of the purpose of the appendix. A top theory is that it serves as a reservoir for good bacteria after dysentery, but we're not sure.

The rest of your post ignores your earlier claims in favor of your new claims about the immune system being some mysterious thing we don't understand (we do) stuff about flu vaccines not being necessary for everyone (I agree) and again ignores the article claiming there are no benefits to universal flu vaccines and a vague claim that it will encourage risky behaviour based on no evidence.

Bye then.
