What evidence do I have? Reality. It is well documented that people will frequently contract the flu even if immunized. That's what they call a success rate.

And you have misattributed me a second time. Please note that I said that healthy individuals:

#+begin_quote
  do not catch the disease *twice,* unless they have a severely inadequate immune system.
#+end_quote

I'm not digging through the internet for articles to prove common sense. Vaccinations are intentionally weakened strains. This means they are less effective at inoculating individuals than the a live strain.

This, in turn, indicates that the immune system is stressed more by the live flu. For a healthy individual, a moderate disease stress is just like other sort of moderate stress. It strengthens the body systems that are stressed. This is true of skeletal muscles, the cardiopulmonary system, bones, our brains, and the immune system. Use it or lose it. Our body will happily devote calories and resources to other things if we don't seem to be needing our immune system very much.

Please do not come back and say that kids, elderly, and the infirm should be vaccinated for the flu. I agree with that. I simply do not agree with healthy adults being vaccinated against diseases that have almost no chance of harming them significantly.

If there's a really nasty flu that is particularly virulent, sure, I could see people being careful. I might even get a flu shot if a really horrible flu was detected. I have never gotten a flu shot in my entire life that I know of. I'm old enough that flu vaccinations were not common when I was a child. I'd have to ask my mother if I was vaccinated in 1976 for that scare.

In short, here's where I'm coming from. People need medical care. Yes. But medical care is not a substitute for staying in shape. For the healthy person's immune system, staying in shape means not sanitizing/using antibiotic everything, and only immunizing yourself against significant disease threats. I have never seen any reputable medical documentation to refute this.

Perhaps I am being irrational in this. I don't think so, and it's going to take a great deal of convincing to make me change my mind, which should be conducted by PM if you want to continue the discussion.
