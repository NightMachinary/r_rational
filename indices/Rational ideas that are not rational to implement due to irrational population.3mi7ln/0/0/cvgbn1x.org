  So to summarize, none of the ideas I saw here are actually implementable plans that would have obvious benefits.

That was the point of the discussion. The plans are not implementable with obvious benefits, *due to human irrationality.*

Several of your counterarguments center around social irrationality of humans.

The resources available to us in space dwarf the resources available to us on Earth. For us to not be aggressively pushing the envelope in space is irrational. But for us to try to push the envelope is also irrational, because it will not be supported by people who don't see the potential.

No government will ever function rationally, because too many people are irrational. People who will vote based on a single letter 'R' or 'D', instead of based on issues, for an example that shouldn't start too much squabbling. Similar types of human fallacies will impact every type of government.

I /DO/ like most of your ideas that you bring up, and they definitely fit.

I'm not entirely certain about mass vaccination for diseases with low death rates. If we don't use our immune system, it might not be ready to deal with the unexpected, and less capable when needed. MMR and similar shots for children, hell yes. Yes to smallpox and polio vaccinations if those diseases ever make a resurgence. If we can find something that works effectively against HIV, yes. Allowing lesser diseases to infect the population every now and then is like exercise for the immune system.
