Rationality does not necessarily equate to plausibility.

If I want to build a shortest-path road from point A to point C through point B, but point B is owned by someone who refuses to allow it, then I will be forced to either abandon the idea, or modify it to be less efficient, going around point B.

Does that make it any less rational to want to build the road so it is as short as possible, generating immediate and long-term savings/efficiency during the building and commuter usage phases of the road's existence?

I would say no. Rational is rational. It is rational to build the road as efficiently as possible.

It is ALSO rational to account for the land owner of B, and build the road around them, if the need is great enough.

But not all cases have rational alternatives. What I'm talking about here are scenarios where partial implementation or modified implementation are really not worth doing, or are even harmful. Public irrationality simply breaks them completely.

The best examples I've seen here are related to substance abuse. As far as I am aware, there has never been an attempt to stop substance abuse through legal actions in a free society where it has been successful. Whenever substance abuse is made illegal, it feeds the criminal element, eventually creating a greater net harm to society.

Does that mean it is rational to stop trying to enforce drug use with laws, and start dealing with it by education and treatment?

Yes. But the irrational public won't let us do that either! The criminal element is more than happy to keep illegal substances illegal, and irrational teetotalers think that somehow what has never worked in the history of mankind can be successfully managed by their elected officials, if they just try a little harder, and pass stricter laws.
