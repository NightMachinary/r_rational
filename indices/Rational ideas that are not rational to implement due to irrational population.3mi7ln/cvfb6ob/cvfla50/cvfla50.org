Yes, though if the number of people who didn't do them were modest, but vocal and disruptive, they could still cause a rational system to fail.

I do not think we would even recognize humans who could accept true communism. Completely rational communism without dissent between the gifted and the non-gifted would basically make us a Borg analog.

We have to account for irrationality whenever we determine what is possible. Some rational ideas simply don't work because humanity cannot be rational enough to properly implement them. Communism is one of those things.

Banning addictive drugs that have the potential to harm others is another. We've tried alcohol, and failed miserably. We're struggling with tobacco. The war on drugs is a laughingstock that only feeds money to international crime and terror networks.

My idea about electromagnetic launch to orbit is, honestly, one of the poorer ideas in the thread.
