The biggest difference with the Culture and current human-tests is that in the Culture, the planning is done by centralized posthuman AIs, and thus "personal preferences" can actually be accounted for. Bear in mind also that the Culture is a post-scarcity and as such, has very little true "need" for work to be done, so all work that is done is desired work. Anything that nobody would want to do, a sub-sapient AI can be created to happily do it instead.

(So basically, you get to magic away the core problems and are left with a version of a Utopia.)
