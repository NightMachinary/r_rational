  If human nature were significantly different, communism would far outperform capitalism because society wouldn't have to waste money time/resources on incentives

I'm a socialist and this isn't remotely true. People's understanding of why different economic systems work has been very heavily warped by propaganda. [[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black/][Here, read this propaganda article!]]

  The point is this: If a deterministic story about free markets generating optimal prices, leading to maximum output was no longer viable, then the failure of planned economies could hardly be attributed to the absence of those features. As Communist systems were collapsing in Eastern Europe, economists who had lost faith in the neoclassical narrative began to argue that an alternative explanation was needed. The most prominent theorist in this group was Joseph Stiglitz, who had become famous for his work on the economics of information. His arguments dovetailed with those of other dissenters from the neoclassical approach, like the eminent Hungarian scholar of planned economies, János Kornai, and evolutionary economists like Peter Murrell.

  They all pointed to a number of characteristics, largely ignored by the neoclassical school, that better accounted for the ability of market economies to avoid the problems plaguing centrally planned systems. The aspects they emphasized were disparate, but they all tended to arise from a single, rather simple fact:in market systems firms are autonomous.

  That means that within the limits of the law, a firm may enter a market; choose its products and production methods; interact with other firms and individuals; and must close down if it cannot get by on its own resources. As a textbook on central planning put it, in market systems the presumption is “that an activity may be undertaken unless it is expressly prohibited,” whereas in planned systems “the prevailing presumption in most areas of economic life is that an activity may not be undertaken unless permission has been obtained from the appropriate authority.” The neoclassical fixation with ensuring that firms exercised this autonomy in a laissez-faire environment --- that restrictions on voluntary exchange be minimized or eliminated --- was essentially beside the point.

  Thus, free entry and multiple autonomous sources of capital mean that anyone with novel production ideas can seek resources to implement their ideas and don't face a single veto point within a planning apparatus. As a result, they stand a much greater chance of obtaining the resources to test out their ideas. This probably leads to more of the waste inherent in failed experiments --- but also far greater scope for improved products and processes, and a constantly higher rate of technological improvement and productivity growth.

In fact, the /original/ Communist argument /in favor of/ central planning was: "Look, the largest capitalist firms all operate on an /internal/ basis of centralized, hierarchical planning, so clearly /the very success of capitalism/ shows that central planning is the most efficient, effective way to do things!"

Then the liberal-capitalist rebuttal to this was, "No, because only markets can generate optimal allocative efficiency."

But the actual truth was, "Certain kinds of markets - namely markets with an egalitarian wealth distribution, easy entry/exit of firms, low economic rents, and low levels of moral hazard - enable many good and bad experiments to be tried in parallel, with the good receiving additional investment and revenue as it grows and the bad being cleaned up by bankruptcy." This has a major implication for our current era of neoliberal authoritarian capitalism, in which increasing portions of social life are subjected to markets, but the /genuinely positive/ features of capitalism are being /reversed/: capitalizing new firms outside the tech and FIRE sectors is increasingly difficult, bankruptcy is getting harder while debts are more stringently enforced, investment capital is getting concentrated into small cliques of de facto planners, economic rents are rising, and moral hazard is rampant.

So to the list of things that Just Don't Work In an Irrational Society, we should add, "capitalism", because people kept trying to worship it as a god rather than understand what made it tick.
