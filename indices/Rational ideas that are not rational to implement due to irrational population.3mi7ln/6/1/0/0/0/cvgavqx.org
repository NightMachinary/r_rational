  It's also possible that the series is simply an endorsement of Communism, but that's not what I seem to be hearing from people who talk about it.

A while ago I posted some of Banks' own notes on the series to this subreddit. He, /the author/, labelled it as "anarchy without, communism within", or "anarcho-communism", and noted that it's a planned economy.

Sure, it's fiction, but to say that a "truly communist" society is /unimaginable/ is still too strong a statement, /given that there's fiction about truly communist societies/.
