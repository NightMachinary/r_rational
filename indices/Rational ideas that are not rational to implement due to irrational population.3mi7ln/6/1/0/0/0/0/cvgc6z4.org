I do not believe I used the word unimaginable at any point. Imagination is quite powerful, and can lead us to lots of irrational places. What we see in the /Culture/ is a fictional display, not a real world display. We see the operation of the government through the author's rose-colored glasses, using scenes and actions that suit the plot, structure, and theme of the story.

We've seen communism attempted in quite a few different countries. All of them failed to produce a state that I would volunteer to live in. Of them all, China is probably the most successful, and they are no longer truly communist, having accepted elements of capitalism.

I do not think that any government can function properly if it is governing humans. However, some governments are more resistant to irrationality than others. Systems of checks and balances and electoral responsibility are awful handy. Democratic republics seem to be close to the most well-suited, though some socialist states admittedly do a fair job.
