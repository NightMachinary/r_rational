Eh, the /Culture/ series is also fictional, like Animal Farm, just less pigs. Flippancy aside, an author cannot portray an entire civilization in a book, so they portray what they want the reader to walk away with. It's also possible that the series is simply an endorsement of Communism, but that's not what I seem to be hearing from people who talk about it.

I have not read any of the /Culture/ series, which is something I keep meaning to rectify, so I cannot comment further on specifics.
