This was the first thing that came to my mind.

During Prohibition, as part of an effort to stop people from drinking industrial alcohol, it was denatured and methyl alcohol was added, making it toxic. They thought that people would change their behavior, because if a rational person knows that there's poison in the alcohol then they'll stop drinking it. The end result was that the United States government killed ten thousand of its own citizens.

(Though there were other problems with this plan.)
