Assuming that people drinking alcohol are accurately expressing their economic preferences, eliminating the alcohol industry to save 10,000 lives puts your estimated value of those 10,000 lives somewhere in the ballpark of 20 million dollars/life.

Many, many people like drinking alcohol. There's nothing irrational about that. Eliminating a 200 billion dollar industry because of 10,000 fatalities doesn't make any economic sense.
