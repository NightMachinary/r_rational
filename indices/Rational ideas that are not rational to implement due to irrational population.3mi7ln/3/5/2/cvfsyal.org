I don't think you can calculate costs by looking at money flowing through the industry that way, since a large portion of the value is preserved either way. The cost is only in the new wealth that the exchange would otherwise generate.

Say I buy a bottle of wine, accurately expressing my economic preferences. (A huge assumption that I do not generally accept.) If the wine were $50, I would be indifferent on whether I buy it or not - but it's $40, so it's a good deal for me. Now, to factor in the human cost. If I buy it, I have $50 worth of wine. If I don't buy it, I have $40 worth of cash, plus one millilife saved. This means I value that millilife at $10, not $40, no?

A rational business will set its price close to that equilibrium point for as many customers as possible, so the estimated value of those 10,000 lives approaches zero.

Unless you mean I should care about failing to incentivize the further production of wine, in which case... Yeah, I kind of don't care about industries in the abstract.
