#+begin_quote
  The actual money spent on goods and services is at least a somewhat reasonable proxy.
#+end_quote

Only in noncompetitive industries, which alcohol is not.

#+begin_quote
  The limits on alcohol consumption for most consumers are biochemical, not financial.
#+end_quote

The limit being biochemcial probably applies only to each visit. I'd say the chief factor is "amount of social occasions attended that, culturally, involve alcohol consumption."

#+begin_quote
  This suggests that alcohol is typically priced well below any sort of indifference price point.
#+end_quote

Without specifying a consumer and a quantity consumed, this... doesn't really make sense. Even if you did specify it, it would need empirical evidence.

#+begin_quote
  If, ceteris paribus, you do not believe this to more true than untrue, your answer should have been "abolishing market capitalism altogether, since people don't know what's good for themselves."
#+end_quote

This is clearly a strawman.

#+begin_quote
  The price of alcohol is much much lower than most people are willing to pay
#+end_quote

Again, this doesn't make much sense.
