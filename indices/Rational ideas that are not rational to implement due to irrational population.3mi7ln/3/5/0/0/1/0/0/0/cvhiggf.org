This is an interesting argument. I sort of suspect that gambling is a net positive in utility because it is entertaining even if it is a net loss from a monetary perspective. For a person who works a repetitive low-skill job, winning $200 bucks on a scratch off ticket may give them a win to brag about that they wouldn't have otherwise. I know I spend a bunch of time and money competing in things for essentially this reason.

Obviously lotto tickets are a loss from a pure monetary perspective, but I'm not sure if money=utility in this situation.
