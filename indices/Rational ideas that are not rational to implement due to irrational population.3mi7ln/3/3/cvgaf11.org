Well, in Europe alcohol is not as demonized as in USA, and since adolescents have the chance to start using it young they already know how to use it responsibly by the time they get a car.

A friend of mine recently went to USA, and her stories about the limitations to drinking that people under 21 years old have are quite ... horrible.
