  Alcohol prohibition.

We [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution][tried that]] and it didn't work very well. I can't really say that the results were irrational, either -- one group of people wanted no alcohol available to anyone, but many people still wanted alcohol so you suddenly had an illegal market.

I wouldn't say that wanting alcohol is irrational either. Drinking to excess is, but wanting to go to a bar to socialize and have a couple beers over the course of an evening is perfectly reasonable.
