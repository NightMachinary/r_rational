Alcohol prohibition. Society-at-large has proven, to my satisfaction, that it cannot handle easily available recreational alcohol. In addition to the tens of thousands of people killed every year by drunk drivers, it's hard to know how many people are hurt by the effects of addiction, which cannot be predicted in advance and often prevents its own treatment. There are some cases where alcohol can't hurt anyone (drinking in your own home if you are known to not be addicted, and such), but the current ease of access to alcohol is doing considerably more harm than good.

Unfortunately, most paths from a drinking society to a prohibitionist society are worse, what with /the mafia/. Luckily, self-driving cars will solve most of the lethal part of the problem.
