Perfectly rational, i.e, "rational" in the economics sense? No.

Rational on the level of [[/r/rational]] or LessWrong? Possibly.

Plenty of us do suboptimal things. I doubt many of us are drink drivers, but I'm sure at least a few of us are addicted to something, and continue to consume said thing, despite having a rational preference not to. Essentially, we want X, but we don't want to want X. Mine is caffeine.
