Addiction is different from using it for a specific purpose every now and again. If you have to have that coffee in the morning or you're incapable of functioning before noon, it's a problem.

There are a vast number of legitimate uses for many drugs. A shot of alcohol a day, helps keep arteries clear. If you couldn't sleep the night before, and you have to drive, a 5-hour energy B12 drink will work wonders. If you need a pick-me-up for a presentation after an exhausting morning, something with caffeine in it might be just the thing. Cocaine, from what I have read, is actually extremely beneficial to the thought processes for a few minutes if taken in moderation, though one must plan for the downtime afterwards. The leaf of the plant is chewed by indigenous people for energy. Coca-Cola was originally a warm syrup drink made from Coca, and served to railroad workers and other hard laborers. Opium and morphine are excellent painkillers. Marijuana for appetite enhancement for chemo patients and for glaucoma. The list goes on and on.

It would be irrational to stop using these chemicals completely, without formulating replacements. It is also irrational to become dependent on them without clear reason. Most of them are harmful over time, with a great deal of use.
