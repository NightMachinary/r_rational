You may be right, that it's rational to use caffeine under certain circumstances. With that said, there's a difference between using something as a performance enhancer and being addicted to it, and I personally fall under the latter category. Whenever I stop using it for a day or two, I get headaches and nausea. I also have a lot of trouble moderating myself when it comes to caffeine.

I drink soda as my caffeinated beverage of choice (Have never liked coffee. Apparently it's an acquired taste, and I quite deliberately have never acquired it) and I find it much easier to buy and drink no soda than to buy some soda, and drink it a little at a time.

I'm genuinely asking this question, because I don't know the answer. Would caffeine be more effective as a performance enhancer if used sparingly, rather than used multiple times each day for no other reason than habit/addiction/preventing withdrawal?

If caffeine does indeed provide a reasonably effective 'always on' performance boost even consumed several times each day, it might indeed be rational for me to keep using it after all. I'm not sure how I would feel about that.
