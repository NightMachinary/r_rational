[[http://www.bigheadpress.com/eft?page=1][here]] is a complete webcomic with one such society in the asteroid belt and a mixed system on mars in the near future. It is a bit campy and certainly an author tract, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.

in a real example I've read that in some places instead of a governing body providing services private citizens manage utilities like businesses. so you could theoretically pay someone for sewers, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3p6quCz-Y0][firemen]], and security, but not pay to maintain roads you don't use, parks, or schools if you don't have kids. It is quite easy to abuse one such system though.
