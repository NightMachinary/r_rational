Assuming you're talking about the designs used in space craft, they do run out of charge, it's just an exponential curve rather than a sudden stop.

For instance, by the time New Horizons reaches the Kuiper Belt, it will have so little power left that it can only operate a single antenna.

Plus, the characteristics that make them good for spacecraft aren't the same as the characteristics needed in a say a car. There's many good reasons not to use them beyond safety concerns.
