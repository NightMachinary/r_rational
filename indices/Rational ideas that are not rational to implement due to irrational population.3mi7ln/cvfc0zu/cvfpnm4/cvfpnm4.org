The problem is the general public does not understand Radiation and Radioactives. It takes a lot of effort to train Radiation workers and a lot to keep them trained. That and to understate, people are afraid of what they don't understand. Thermal batteries require respect as do all things with activity levels not measured in negative exponents of micromicroCuries/ml, but they aren't a problem if they are respected and sealed and have adequate shielding. So I wouldn't want them in a car.

On the flip side if the population was understood radiation it'd mean a much higher level of understanding of basic physics.
