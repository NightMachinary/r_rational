  Assuming that people drinking alcohol are accurately expressing their economic preferences, eliminating the alcohol industry to save 10,000 lives puts your estimated value of those 10,000 lives somewhere in the ballpark of 20 million dollars/life.

No, because you didn't take into account the opportunity cost.

The decision isn't "spend the 200 billion in the alcohol industry, or burn the money." It's spend the 200 billion in the alcohol industry, or spend it somewhere else (or save it).

Standard economic theory (assuming rational actors) would suggest that, whatever consumers choose to spend money on instead, it would bring /less/ utility than spending it on alcohol, but not zero utility.

Not assuming perfectly rational actors (or imperfect information), you could in fact increase utility.
