  If I buy it, I have $50 worth of wine. If I don't buy it, I have $40 worth of cash, plus one millilife saved. This means I value that millilife at $10, not $40, no?

Technically, no.

It would depend on what you would have otherwise bought with the $40. If you buy a book that you value at $49, then the millilife is only worth a dollar.

Ten dollars would be the absolute maximum that it could be worth (because a rational actor would never buy something for 39 dollars for 40 dollars).
