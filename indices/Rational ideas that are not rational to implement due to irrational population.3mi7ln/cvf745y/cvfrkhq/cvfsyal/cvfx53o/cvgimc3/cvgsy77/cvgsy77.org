    The actual money spent on goods and services is at least a somewhat reasonable proxy.

  Only in noncompetitive industries, which alcohol is not.

What measure would you suggest for estimating the positive utility generated by the alcohol industry? My estimate was certainly a convenience estimate, since i knew that data on the size of the industry existed and was easily available.

    The price of alcohol is much much lower than most people are willing to pay

  Again, this doesn't make much sense.

Saying, "this makes no sense" over and over again is not an argument. According to the published research I was able to find quickly, the price elasticity for the demand of alcohol is somewhere around -0.50 [[http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/msceps/courses/understanding%20markets/8.%20Gallet%202007%20Alcohol%20elasticities%20meta%20analysis.pdf][[1]]][[http://offsettingbehaviour.blogspot.com/2012/07/price-elasticity-of-alcohol-demand.html][[2]]]. Doubling the price results in a 1/4 reduction in the quantity consumed, and most of that reduction is, predictably, due to behavior modification of light/occasional drinkers. This suggests that the price of alcohol is lower than most consumers are willing to pay.
