  What measure would you suggest for estimating the positive utility generated by the alcohol industry? My estimate was certainly a convenience estimate, since i knew that data on the size of the industry existed and was easily available.

I'm confused by this. First of all, now you're asking for an estimation of positive utility, while in the quote you were talking about indifference pricing. They are completely separate concepts. Secondly, do you not see the contradiction between using the money spent as a proxy for the indifference price as seen here,

#+begin_quote
  Sure, but meaningful data on the indifference price for purchases of goods don't exist. The actual money spent on goods and services is at least a somewhat reasonable proxy.

While also claiming the following,

#+begin_quote
  The price of alcohol is much much lower than most people are willing to pay, in part because of competition.
#+end_quote

If the price of alcohol is much much lower than most people are willing to pay, than it is certainly not a good proxy for the indifference price.

#+begin_quote
  According to the published research I was able to find quickly, the price elasticity for the demand of alcohol is somewhere around -0.50 [1] [2] .

I can't access your first link. As for your second link, part of it is talking about minimum pricing laws, and the other part is talking about current alcohol prices, both of which are specifying a price. Neither specify the consumer, and are instead using aggregate data, which I have methodological issues with in this case, but I can make my peace with it.
