  I don't think you can calculate costs by looking at money flowing through the industry that way, since a large portion of the value is preserved either way. The cost is only in the new wealth that the exchange would otherwise generate.

Sure, but meaningful data on the indifference price for purchases of goods don't exist. The actual money spent on goods and services is at least a somewhat reasonable proxy. Most/many buyers of alcohol are relatively insensitive to price, which is why bars and microbreweries can make a living. The limits on alcohol consumption for most consumers are biochemical, not financial. This suggests that alcohol is typically priced well below any sort of indifference price point.

  Say I buy a bottle of wine, accurately expressing my economic preferences. (A huge assumption that I do not generally accept.)

If, ceteris paribus, you do not believe this to more true than untrue, your answer should have been "abolishing market capitalism altogether, since people don't know what's good for themselves."

  A rational business will set its price close to that equilibrium point for as many customers as possible, so the estimated value of those 10,000 lives approaches zero.

A rational alcohol monopoly maybe. The price of alcohol is much much lower than most people are willing to pay, in part because of competition. By your logic, trade and economic activity in general would be basically not worth it, since the expected value of each exchange would be close to zero.

What would you estimate to total social good of the alcohol industry at? Not the net social good, which you obviously believe is negative, but if we ignore the costs of the industry, what's your estimate for the total positive utility generated by the production and consumption of alcoholic beverages?
