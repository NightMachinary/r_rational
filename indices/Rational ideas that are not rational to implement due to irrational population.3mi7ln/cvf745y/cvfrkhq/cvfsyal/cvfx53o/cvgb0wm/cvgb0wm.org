  If, ceteris paribus, you do not believe this to more true than untrue, your answer should have been "abolishing market capitalism altogether, since people don't know what's good for themselves."

Many people /don't/ know what is good for themselves. Problem is that often neither does the government or any other organization. And those also have their own agendas which sometimes don't align with their citizen/members.

Extremes like fully embracing or completely abolishing any one economic system is pretty much never the best answer in human societies.

So to conclude, believing that alcohol buyers usually accurately expressing their economic preferences is more untrue than true does not necessarily mean believing that market capitalism should be abolished altogether.
