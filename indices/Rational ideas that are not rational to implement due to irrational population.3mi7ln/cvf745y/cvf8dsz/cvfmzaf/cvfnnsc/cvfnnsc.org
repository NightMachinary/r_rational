I can't think of any case where prohibited drugs of any type have been successfully eradicated through legislation. Some drugs have fallen into disfavor and disuse due to other drugs being introduced that are easier to hide/transport.

The Taliban, in Afghanistan, managed to eradicate poppy farming, if I remember right. I do not think most rational people would want a government as oppressive as the Taliban was, even if it were not a fundamentalist religious state. My understanding was that there was a warning, then the loss of a body part, and a third incidence of farming poppy meant death. I may be mistaken on particulars.

Global terrorism is funded in part by the illegal drug trade, and is more potent than ever. There are quite a few second and third world governments that are in perpetual low-level civil wars with criminal cartels that fund themselves via selling drugs to first world nations that have made the drugs illegal.

I believe there is a fairly clear indication that making drugs illegal gives rise to powerful organizations which actively seek to preserve both the illegality of drugs, and their ability to market them.
