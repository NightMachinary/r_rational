That is interesting, and hopeful. I was unaware of it. I hope that the larger Islamic community starts to enforce the fatwas.

Hearing the speeches of some Islamic faith leaders when they visit the west, and then hearing what they say to their followers when they return to their home countries has a severely detrimental impact on my assessment of the likelihood that mainstream Islam is willing to confront their fringe elements.

Still, large changes rarely come quickly.
