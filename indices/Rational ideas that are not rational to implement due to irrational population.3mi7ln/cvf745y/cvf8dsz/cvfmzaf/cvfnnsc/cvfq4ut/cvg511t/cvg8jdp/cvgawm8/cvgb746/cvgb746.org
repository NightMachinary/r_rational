  Hearing the speeches of some Islamic faith leaders when they visit the west, and then hearing what they say to their followers when they return to their home countries has a severely detrimental impact on my assessment of the likelihood that mainstream Islam is willing to confront their fringe elements.

I agree with this statement, but it has to be noted where the statement applies.

"Mainstream Islam" should really be split into several geographical regions. After all, the world's largest Muslim populations are in Indonesia and India, where they cause /some/, but /limited/ trouble to non-Muslim populations. The trouble they cause is more comparable to "ethnic minorities everywhere in the Third World" than to the unique nastiness of /Middle Eastern/ Islam right now.

Geopolitical Islam /in the Middle East/ right now, and among transplanted /Middle Eastern/ populations in other countries, is a nasty blend of nasty stuff that basically adds up to religious fascism and a desire to make war on nearby non-Muslim populations, /powered by the oil wealth of oligarchs who spread this religious fascism for their own reasons/, even when the fascist interpretations of Islam are actually entirely modern fundamentalist movements that would normally be opposed by conservative forces within Islam (in the same way that conservative forces within Christianity split down the middle in WW2, with many opposing Hitler).
