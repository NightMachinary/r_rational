ISIS is one example of a very powerful terror organization, and Al Qaeda is not gone. Those types of organizations are fueled by hate, and there hasn't been any effective campaign to defuse that hate. I'm not saying I have a solution myself. I'm not even saying there is a solution that involves non-Islamic people.

Until I start seeing a LOT of mainstream Islamic religious leaders denouncing violence to their followers as well as to the rest of the world, I know there is no possibility of reform.

When I start seeing fatwas being declared against terrorist leaders, I'll know that Islam is taking cleaning up it's own house seriously.

Yes, I do expect worse than 9/11 eventually, if we don't stop feeding money into the international terror networks through the black market. No, I'm not going to discuss details about how what sorts of events might happen.
