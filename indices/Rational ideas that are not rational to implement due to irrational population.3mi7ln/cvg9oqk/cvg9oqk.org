I think a lot of people are mistaking flights of fancy for rationality. If we don't have the tech to do it, it's not rational. If it's rational for other actors to mess with it, the problem isn't an irrational populace.

  My example is an electromagnetic cargo-only launch system that we could use to shift raw materials and supplies into space, allowing us to more rapidly develop a space industry.

We don't have the technology to do this, and a space industry is a low priority for most. Most of the benefits come from satellites, which don't need a big space industry. We could possibly develop the technology, but till we do and know how hard it is this isn't a plan.

[[/u/Anakiri]] alcohol makes sex easier, social interaction easier, and brings a great deal of pleasure. It's not in the interests of many to stop drinking.

You can get atomic batteries, and society is rational enough to use them, but they're absurdly expensive and lithium is cheaper. Unless you have a cost analysis that says there's a load of applications where a 40 year battery is necessary this isn't rationality, this is a theory.

[[/u/TimTravel]] communism is a terrible government system for many reasons. It centralizes power heavily in a central government, reduces responsiveness and reducing politician's need to help far away people, and Marx's ideas and many of his successors are a mess. It also gives people strong incentives to do shoddy work, ignore regional problems, and be corrupt.

[[/u/topiary_quail]] in a democracy there are many competing interests, some of which are rationally against each other. Hilary Clinton wants to cut the private sector at the expense of the public sector. She as such appeals to unions, a major powers in the democrat party. Donald Trump wants to strengthen the private sector at the expense of the public sector. He as such appeals to businesses, a major power in the Republican party.

[[/u/IWantUsToMerge]] [[https://reason.com/archives/2015/06/11/why-poor-people-stay-poor]] lead poisoning increases criminality and is more common in poor areas. Financial planning isn't rational if any money you save up is likely to be stolen, and not having babies isn't rational in a high danger environment, children take care of you. Plus, injuries are random and disabilities are random, 'should' has little place in a rationality discussion. We should base our ethics on what works, not on what 'should' happen.

[[/u/narfanator]] if it's rational to conquer any group that's anarchic then it's not rational to be an anarchist.

On drug use, that depends on what the studies say about whether legalization increases or decreases use. What you think people can handle doesn't matter.

So to summarize, none of the ideas I saw here are actually implementable plans that would have obvious benefits.

Comprehensive sex education. Reduces the pregnancy rate of teens, generally agreed to be bad, lessens healthcare costs, reduces abortions, reduces stds. Objections include irrational religious arguments and irrational beliefs that sex education will increase how much sex people have, contrary to studies.

Treating criminals like humans. Many proven benefits in reducing reoffending, the cost savings would be immense and if the unions object we could just keep paying union guards to sit in a room and still save money. Not done due to irrational need by people to get revenge on criminals.

Give homeless people houses and starving people food. It's far, far cheaper to give people their basic needs so they can survive than dealing with them in jails and hospitals. Prison should not be used as welfare for the poor. People don't do it for irrational reasons relating to a fear that money will be wasted, so money is wasted anyway.

Mass vaccination, safety from common diseases. Vaccines massively improve health. Reason why it's not done- irrational fear of it causing autism. Many places are forcing people to vaccinate their children.

Those are the immediate ones that come to mind.
