  When the body defeats a natural flu, the immune response to re-introduction of the same strain is overwhelming. Dead virus vaccinations do not generate the same response, but it helps, so it is useful, and appropriate, in the young, old, and infirm.
#+end_quote

Speculation, which contradicts actual scientific websites. Also, speculation that this overwhelming response leads to a better immunity.

#+begin_quote
  This is the underpinning of vaccination theory. How you can even consider this to be in question is baffling.
#+end_quote

Because it contradicts every actual scientific source I've consulted on actual vaccines.

  Vaccines also don't cause autism, incidentally. Maybe years later, the same strain might make headway against your immune system again, but not in the same season - unless you are immune system deficient. Your body is ready for it, sitting there, waiting like Tom from Tom and Jerry with a raised baseball bat over the mouse hole. The smallest new infection is smashed out of your system by an intense, successful response. That's how the immune system works. That's what vaccination attempts to duplicate.
#+end_quote

You're making up loads of bs. Healthy people can get sick too, depending on the exact nature of the infection and the quantity of infection and their genetics. Immunity, natural or otherwise, is protective, not an absolute defense. Also, vaccination both attempts and succeeds at duplicating it.

You're speculating about scientific matters that require actual research.

  Common sense is rationality without numbers, friend. Protecting the weak is rational. Weakening the strong with unnecessary medical treatment is irrational.
#+end_quote

You're not being rational with your common sense. You're making things up which are contradicted by scientific sources.

#+begin_quote
  A hundred years ago, people said smoking was good for you. Seventy or so years ago, radiation therapy was commonly given (NOT chemotherapy or clinical radiation treatments). We only figured out what the appendix actually does recently. We are still puzzling out how to deal with some of the nastiest viruses. Our fascination with sanitation and antibiotics has given rise to superbugs, and even bleach-resistant strains are possible.
#+end_quote

True, but irrelevant to anything we're talking about.

#+begin_quote
  It is a waste of resources, time, and money to vaccinate healthy young/middle-age adults for the flu unless there's a truly nasty flu that year. The medical community tends to have the view that if doing X helps a certain demographic, then everyone should do X, even if there is no clear reason for it.

Maths and science says otherwise.
