First, Wikipedia is short on examples and specifics, but quite long on references. The Science Direct article is quite extensive and probably interesting if you have deep knowledge of the topic, and it is also laden with references. It was fairly painful for me to read, as I am not a subject matter expert, but the conclusions were written in terms that I was able to comprehend. WebMD mentions a study, and is generally a solid source of basic medical data.

If you believe that Wikipedia is incorrect to include this medical research as legitimate, feel free to try to prove it to people far more knowledgeable about such things than I am. I feel that your dismisal of these peer-reviewed ideas is premature. My belief in immunological systems being strengthened by exposure to microorganisms is not me simply making things up. I'm not turning this information gathering into an all-nighter.

Here are some links and quotes from the links.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut-associated_lymphoid_tissue][The appendix as part of the active immune system]]

/On the appendix. Ten years ago, the medical community had only recently thought they figured out what the appendix was for. Since the last time I looked into it, the medical comunity has found what does look like a better explanation./

[[http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/features/boost-immune-system?page=2][Sucking your baby's pacifier can make him less likely to develop allergies.]]

/Fact. Do you cringe when you see a parent pick up a baby's pacifier and suck it before returning it to the baby's mouth? Don't. A recent study found that parents who suck their infant's pacifier may lower the baby's risk of having allergies. The thought is that germs transferred to the infant from the parent's saliva will kick-start the baby's immune system./

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_hypothesis][The Hygiene Hypothesis]]

/The hygiene hypothesis is supported by epidemiological data. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world. This is true for asthma[41] and other chronic inflammatory disorders.[5]/

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthic_therapy][Helminthic Therapy]]

/Helminthic infection has emerged as one possible explanation for the low incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies in less developed countries, together with the significant and sustained increase in autoimmune diseases in industrialized countries./

[[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867404003356][Homeostatic Expansion of T Cells during Immune Insufficiency Generates Autoimmunity]]

/Importantly, we show that immune stimulation causes an increase in T cell numbers and creates a population of long-lived memory T cells that are otherwise absent from the NOD strain. Indeed, an extensive list of stimulatory factors is reported to reduce the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice, including the following: persistent viral infection, mycobacterial infection, complete (heat-killed mycobacterium-containing) Freund's adjuvant (CFA), and other bacterial antigens (Rabinovitch, 1994). The “clean” domestic environments of Western societies resemble the specific pathogen-free conditions under which NOD mice are housed. This concept of hygiene developed from the original ideas of Oliver Wendell-Holmes, Sr., and Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis in the 1840s (Greenhill, 1966) and was subsequently popularized by Louis Pasteur with his “germ theory of disease” (Mendelsohn, 2002). However, the increase in autoimmunity in Western societies in recent years Kukreja and Maclaren 1999 and Kwoh 1992 may be compounded by the zealous use of disinfectants and antibiotics during the 20th century. Indeed, protection from diabetes by immunostimulation with bacterial antigen or infection parallels the state of non-Western societal contexts and reflects the fact that microinoculations can beneficially instruct the maturation of the immune system in infancy (Holt, 1998)./

  I agree with immunization theory, not farmerbob1's special immunization theory based on their common sense.

It's not MY theory, but I feel it is rational, and I am far from the only one. The Hygiene Hypothesis has several names. I've seen some strange things that quacks have attempted to connect to it - mostly people afraid of vaccines for reasons that have been disproved, or people like the above poster that are attacking it with strawmen. What I have discussed are core to the concept.
