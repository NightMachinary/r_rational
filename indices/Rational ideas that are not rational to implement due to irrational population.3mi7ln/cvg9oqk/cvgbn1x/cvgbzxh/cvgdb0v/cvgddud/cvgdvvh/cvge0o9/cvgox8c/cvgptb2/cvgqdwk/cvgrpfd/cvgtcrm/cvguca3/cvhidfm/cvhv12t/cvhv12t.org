You're misinterpreting the hygeine hypothesis. Epidemiologists doing statistics on children discovered that there was a large and obvious difference between countries that had limited exposure to most childhood diseases and ones which due to various public health policies such as Strachan studying Hayfever in the 1950s. This meant that some certain diseases would reduce the incidence of childhood diseases. As I showed from early citations, vaccines have no effect on autoimmune diseases. Many scientists are trying to search for a magic bullet style infection- a single or small group of infectious agents which are minimally harmful and which reduce incidence of autoimmune diseases.

There have been numerous false hopes and dreams from various diseases.

Measles doesn't seem to have a protective effect, despite early studies suggesting it might. People suggested that this may have been due to the survivor bias due to 25% mortality rate of the disease.

Helminth has shown a protective effect.

Lactobacilli and Eubacteria, gut flora bacteria which children can gain from farm exposure.

Endotoxin, likewise from farm exposure.

Hepatitis A, strong evidence for this one, a 50% reduction in various immune disorders. May only have a protective effect in certain people with a special gene. Hasn't shown an effect in some populations.

For measles, mumps, rheumatic fever, tuberculosis and HAV the epidomological evidence is that they declined before or after the spike in autoimmune diseases.

Respiratory track diseases like influenza, barring measles, haven't shown much of a decline and there certainly wasn't a rapid decline around when autoimmune diseases became so common.

So your pet theory that flu vaccines caused mass autoimmune diseases is incorrect.

If you want to reduce the incident of autoimmune diseases we could ban the hepatitis A vaccine, though that would have serious health implications since it's a pretty dangerous virus and you'd need to do some genetic studies first probably. You can also take children on more trips to farms to prime their immune systems with endotoxins and lactobacilli. As noted, infection with Helminth has some positive effects, although I've seen studies that have noted its protective effects may be limited against particular types of autoimmune disease like asthma or allergic rhinitis.

You can't just throw your hands up say YOLO and mass infect children with diseases and hope for the best. Some bacteria and viruses and worms improve immune function, some don't. Your theory isn't the proper one. Actual science is needed, not common sense.

Edit. This also isn't evidence that the immune system was affected by intelligent design or that infection strengthens it. The effect may be due to the immune system being weaker due to poorer health, or downregulation of the immune system by pathogens.
