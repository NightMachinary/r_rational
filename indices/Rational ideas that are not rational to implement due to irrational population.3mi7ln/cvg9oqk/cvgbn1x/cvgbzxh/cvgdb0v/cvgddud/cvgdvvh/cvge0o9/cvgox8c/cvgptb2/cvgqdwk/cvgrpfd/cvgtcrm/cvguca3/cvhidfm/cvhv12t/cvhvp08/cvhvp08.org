  So your pet theory that flu vaccines caused mass autoimmune diseases is incorrect.

No. I did *NOT* say that. STOP putting words in my mouth. I want to be done with this conversation but you're driving me nuts with the strawman arguments. What I have said *repeatedly* was that healthy adults subjected to live viruses without vaccinations will have a stronger reaction to the disease, with nearly no risk of permanent harm. This results in the immune system being strengthened by use. That's part and parcel of the Hygiene Hypothesis. While a lot of studies are based around children, a lot of the studies were also based on adults too, if you care to look at them.

Challenging the immune system with threats it can successfully counter is shown to be a plausible way to improve immune system health. What I linked is actual science. You don't get to define what science is. Scientists do, and you better believe that the Wikipedia hard sciences folks would be all over those articles if there wasn't science to back them up. That is one thing that Wiki does do pretty well, provide accurate information on hard sciences.

  You can't just throw your hands up say YOLO and mass infect children with diseases and hope for the best.

Where in the hell are you even coming up with this absurdity? Where have I even hinted that this was a good idea? Have I gotten lost and found myself in 4Chan?

I am Agnostic. God is going to have to come down and prove his own existence to me before I'll consider him to be anything other than a fairy tale. I used the word 'created' once. It was an error. I will go fix it now, since you are so bothered by it that it has apparently destroyed your ability to argue against points I actually made.
