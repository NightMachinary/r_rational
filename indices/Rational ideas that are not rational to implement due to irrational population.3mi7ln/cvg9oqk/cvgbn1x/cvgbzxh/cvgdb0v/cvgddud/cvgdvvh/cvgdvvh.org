  Vaccination has been shown to not cause immune disorders like asthma or allergies.

Don't go there. *I am most definitely not claiming anything like this.* I fully support vaccinations for diseases that have a high death rate, or for less virulent diseases, in high risk populations.

  Do you have evidence for your assertion that 'exercising' the immune system with live pathogens leads to better health than vaccines?

Vaccinated people frequently contract a weak-to-moderate case of the flu despite the vaccine. People who were not vaccinated, do not catch the disease twice, unless they have a severely inadequate immune system. The live virus clearly generates a stronger immune response, and a stronger future defense.
