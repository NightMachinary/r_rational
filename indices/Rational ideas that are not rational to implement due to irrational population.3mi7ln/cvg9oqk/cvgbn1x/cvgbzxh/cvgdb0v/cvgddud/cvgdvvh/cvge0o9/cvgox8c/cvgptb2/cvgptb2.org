  What evidence do I have? Reality. It is well documented that people will frequently contract the flu even if immunized. That's what they call a success rate.
#+end_quote

Yes, but you don't have evidence that those who have caught a natural flu can't catch it again.

  And you have misattributed me a second time. Please note that I said that healthy individuals:

No, I got you. People with a live virus in them (who have caught it once, is what I meant) never catch it again, I just phrased in poorly. I want evidence for that statement.

  I'm not digging through the internet for articles to prove common sense. Vaccinations are intentionally weakened strains. This means they are less effective at inoculating individuals than the a live strain.

Common sense is silly. For some vaccines the vaccine is more effective than the natural infector, like Hib (Haemophilus Influenzae type b) and tetanus vaccines, for some it's less effective. Also, many natural illnesses have a high risk of death, 2/1000 for measles say.

You should stop relying on common sense. It's making you state well known falsehoods that are on lists of myths about vaccines. You're an evolved ape, not a superhuman intelligence, your common sense is no substitute for actual science.

Your ideas are not rational to implement because you're using common sense rather than maths and science.
