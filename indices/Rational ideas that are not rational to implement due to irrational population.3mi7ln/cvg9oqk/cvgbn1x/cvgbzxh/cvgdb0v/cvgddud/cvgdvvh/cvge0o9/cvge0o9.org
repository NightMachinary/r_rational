  Vaccinated people frequently contract a weak-to-moderate case of the flu despite the vaccine. People who were not vaccinated, do not catch the disease twice, unless they have a severely inadequate immune system. The live virus clearly generates a stronger immune response, and a stronger future defense.

What evidence do you have for this statement? In particular, that people with a live virus (rarely or never?) catch the disease unless severely inadequate with their immune system?

It seems like a fairly improbable statement, given the variety of flu viruses.
