I disagree with your quirky and unusual interpretation of immunization theory.

#+begin_quote
  When the body defeats a natural flu, the immune response to re-introduction of the same strain is overwhelming. Dead virus vaccinations do not generate the same response, but it helps, so it is useful, and appropriate, in the young, old, and infirm.

That the immune response is overwhelming, that dead virus does not generate the same response, and that it's useful in the young, old, and infirm.

I mean, the article you linked earlier said "Unfortunately, a recent review of influenza vaccination among adults at age 65 or older also suggested that the vaccine was of questionable efficacy.[9] While vaccination appeared to reduce the symptoms of influenza, the heterogeneity and poor quality of the collected research prevented any strong conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing complications of influenza in this high-risk population."

I personally from the evidence think the effectiveness in the elderly is more clear, from other studies, but your own study said it's not great in the elderly.

I agree with immunization theory, not farmerbob1's special immunization theory based on their common sense.

I also didn't say everyone should get vaccinated for everything. It should obviously be based on appropriate science.
