I have repeatedly indicated that this position is a position I hold for flu immunizations. Please do not engage in strawman arguments to draw other diseases into the conversation.

  You're disregarding science in favor of aligning yourself with the anti science anti vaccers who make absurd claims about vaccines.

No, I am not. If you think that I am, then you are clearly not reading what I am writing. You are picking out the little bits that you disagree with and rearranging my arguments in your own mind so that you can believe me to be wrong. I noticed that you did not comment on the study I linked. Facts are painful, no?

  You're claiming that healthy people with appropriate immunities don't get sick from those diseases.
#+end_quote

No, I am not. I am claiming that healthy people with appropriate immunities do not grow severely ill from most strains of the flu, and that is born out in any research you care to examine that isn't entirely focused on the most deadly strains. If someone who is otherwise healthy does grow severely ill from a flu strain that isn't one of the more dangerous strains, that flu infection might have just warned them about an immune system disorder or other ailment.

  This gives people a false sense of invincibility and increases danger.
#+end_quote

It is not a false sense of invincibility. For most strains of the flu, a healthy adult between 16-60 or so will be irritated, but not have their life threatened. This is proven repeatedly in flu research. Most strains of the flu are a minor inconvenience to healthy individuals between 16 and 60.

  Minimizing exposure is always important to minimize chances of an infection defeating your immune system.
#+end_quote

In the case of a disease which has a credible possibility of defeating your immune system, sure. Very few strains of the flu have any significant chance of defeating the immune system of healthy individuals between the age of 16 and 60. The immune system has evolved to encounter and react. In fact, the body aggressively seeks out disease vectors. *That's what the appendix is for. It samples the digestive tract for things to introduce to the immune system.* The more different encounters the immune system has, the stronger it becomes overall, unless a disease or infection is encountered that directly attacks the immune system.

Medicine should work with the human body to promote the body staying in health, not take over the job entirely. For mild diseases, like most strains of flu, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever for universal vaccination, unless you can eliminate the disease completely. And we certainly can't do that with the flu yet. Show me a well-tested universal flu vaccination that is as safe as current flu vaccinations, and I'll take it tomorrow.

The medical community and the CDC promotes universal vaccination, because it's easier to say "Everyone get a shot" than try to explain to the public that some years you need a shot, others you don't. If you are on certain medications or have certain conditions you need a shot, even if you are a healthy adult. Etc.

Excessive, unnecessary medical intervention is not rational. Period. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria is one example where an out of control medical community accidentally created something dangerous because they didn't fully understand the repercussions of what they were doing. I am NOT saying that we're going to create a super-flu, but I am saying that we don't understand the immune system well enough to try to completely replace the natural process when there isn't a pressing need for it.

Encouraging vaccinations for low-risk groups in minimally dangerous flu outbreaks encourages more dependency on medical technology and less on staying healthy. To use your words, this is 'very dangerous and risky for the future of humanity.'

I'm done with this discussion.
