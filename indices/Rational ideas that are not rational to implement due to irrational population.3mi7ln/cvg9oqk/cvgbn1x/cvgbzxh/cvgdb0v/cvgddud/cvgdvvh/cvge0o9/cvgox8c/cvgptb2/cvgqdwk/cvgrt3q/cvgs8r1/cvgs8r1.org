The Flu is a constantly evolving virus. It changes every year, and there are frequently multiple different strains in the same year. If it were possible to completely immunize everyone forever against the flu, then I'd agree to herd immunization tactics. I'm all for eliminating diseases, if they can be eliminated.

But it's not. The flu isn't a single-strain disease like Smallpox, which, once exposed via vaccination or survival, generates a near-permanent immunity.

Even if there were 100% flu vaccination coverage, flu vaccinations are simply not effective enough to prevent it from spreading. A very large part of our population is at risk for the flu, and those at-risk populations will spread the disease quite effectively, even if vaccinated.

I fully support vaccination for more virulent diseases, and for at-risk groups. But as noted in the article above, there's no need for healthy young-to-middle-aged adults to get a flu shot. Even if you consider herd immunity. Healthy adult flu immunization is an irrational practice because it has costs, but no meaningful value.
