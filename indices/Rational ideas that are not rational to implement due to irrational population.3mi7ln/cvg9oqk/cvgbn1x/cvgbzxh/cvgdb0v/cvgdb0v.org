  Vaccines engage your immune system. They put some heat treated or whatnot bit of the 'corpses' of a bacterial or virus infection in a person so your immune system can learn to target that. Vaccinations make you use your immune system, they don't stop it.

Yes, but if everyone is vaccinated, then only a few individuals will encounter the actual, live disease. Vaccinations are specifically designed to be easy for a healthy immune system to defeat. This gives the body an advantage when the live disease is encountered.

It's like eating right, vs. eating right and exercising. You might be healthy if you eat right, but you will be healthier if you eat right and exercise.

As another example, if you are in a low-risk group, and are seriously impacted by the flu, it may be a sign that there is something else wrong with you on a deeper level. Catching the flu might save your life by exposing something more insidious.
