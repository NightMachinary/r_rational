  That was the point of the discussion. The plans are not implementable with obvious benefits, due to human irrationality.

Yes, and they're generally very vague and theoretical. They should at least have some evidence they can work. Lots of things aren't done because of irrational populations making it rational for politicians to note push them.

  The resources available to us in space dwarf the resources available to us on Earth. For us to not be aggressively pushing the envelope in space is irrational. But for us to try to push the envelope is also irrational, because it will not be supported by people who don't see the potential.

A particular approach was proposed, using rail guns to shoot things up into space. You didn't argue about the pure benefit of space so much, and didn't prove your particular approach would actually work, as opposed to more mature and reliable tech like rockets.

Plus, what if due to the expense the risk of failure was too high? It might be rational to try again in a century when technology is more advanced.

You didn't do an actual analysis showing that financially, if everyone was rational, asteroid mining and colonization is currently a rational choice.

  No government will ever function rationally, because too many people are irrational.

There are ways around that. I believe the Scandanavian governments generally employ experts to design prisons, rather than letting the voters decide, hence why they have a much lower reoffending rate.

Politicians who trust scientists can be much more rational.

  I'm not entirely certain about mass vaccination for diseases with low death rates. If we don't use our immune system, it might not be ready to deal with the unexpected, and less capable when needed.
#+end_quote

Vaccines engage your immune system. They put some heat treated or whatnot bit of the 'corpses' of a bacterial or virus infection in a person so your immune system can learn to target that. Vaccinations make you use your immune system, they don't stop it.
