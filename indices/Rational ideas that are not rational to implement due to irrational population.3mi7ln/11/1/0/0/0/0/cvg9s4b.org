Well, partly because the economics definition of "rationality" is presupposing a magic, unreal understanding of psychology and cognitive science, and partly because it's imposing normative preconceptions onto its model of human values, and partly because collective effort is often cheaper, in terms of total effort expended, than summed-up individual efforts.

It's the difference between a train system and a freeway system. The latter has "more freedom" and "more individualism", but actually requires /more/ money and effort to be poured into it to work.

You can value "freedom" and "individualism" in the sense that Anglo-world right-wingers use those words, but you have to be willing to put numbers on those values and trade them off against other values, like "Saving money" and "commute time" and "convenience".
