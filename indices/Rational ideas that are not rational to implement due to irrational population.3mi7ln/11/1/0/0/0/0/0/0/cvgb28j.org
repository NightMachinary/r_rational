Technically, to take a /really/ high-level view, it's /everyone's/ job to maximize everyone's utility. There are certain roles where the government is particularly effective at doing so, /more/ than if we spread out the same roles across the whole population. Thus, the government should take on those roles, and not others.

  [[/u/Transfuturist]][1] 's claim that it's the government's job to make up for people's poor decisions is novel to me, and I'm trying to understand it.

I think [[/u/Transfuturist]] would say that it's part of the state's job to make up for /systemic/ poor decision-making. Take the statement, "people are /predictably/ irrational", and then take the /predictions/, and have the government operate to counteract those /predictable/ irrationalities.

So for example, your losses on stock are not predictable (by the government, certainly), nor is any financial hardship due to having studied a /uniquely/ unprofitable subject in school. However, there are many large, systemic factors where the "irrationality" (often actually decision-making according to misaligned or malign incentives, or even incentives created by deliberate moral wickedness (as with systemic racism, for instance)) is large-scale, statistically detectable, and predictable, and /in those cases/, it's beneficial for the state to step in and correct the problem by providing a countervailing bias.
