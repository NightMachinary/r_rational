  Well, I actually think governments should be attempting to reach post-scarcity eutopia, and that actually includes pretty much every bad consequence ever.

For sufficiently well-thought-out values of "bad" and "eutopia", sure.

  But the system you describe makes sense to prioritize pre-scarcity concerns, although I might add that where losses on stock or financial hardship from a bad degree threatens one's life, well-being, etc, the government should still prioritize their security over the derivative of growth.

I think that depends what you mean by "their security". The security of individuals' life and health, yes. The security of anyone's economic wealth, no -- that's the way to moral hazard.

  As a country's economic surplus increases, more resources are available to improve the minimum quality of life, and I'd argue that that's where more focus should go.

Yay this!
