The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons][tragedy of the commons]] is what I think you might be getting at here. This is a situation where everyone acting with rational self interest inadvertently screws themselves over because they can't step back to see the bigger picture. Its the government's job to see the bigger picture and make sure that a tragedy of the commons isn't the end result.
