I'm a moral anti-realist at the moment. I believe normative arguments are arguments for effective courses of action for individuals making goal- and value-based decisions. I also believe human goal/value systems are mutable, so emotional persuasion can be effective elements of normative rhetoric. When I say "governments should do something," I mean that I believe it would benefit most everyone participating in that plan.
