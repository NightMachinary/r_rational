It is simple. If you put value in the lives /and/ quality of life of imperfect human beings then you are in favor of not submitting said humans to extreme punishments for mistakes in risk-assessment. Being homeless because in the past you had the "stupid" decision to choose a larger food palette over all the right insurances is an example of unfair punishment in many people's eyes. The answer to that is to force essential insurances on everyone while pushing down its cost by decreasing the profit per capita of the insurance providers. Or in other words, government based healthcare.
