The latter is a normative claim, so it's not actually something that that question applies to. I could make an argument that it is based in terminal values that we hold in common, but I'm not interested in that discussion, nor am I certain that we hold common values sufficient to make a successful argument. I honestly shouldn't have commented, since I wasn't interested in discussing it.
