Measured in the metrics of that time? Extremely polite. Because dueling was accepted. You didn't mouth off to someone else aggressively unless you *really* meant it. Today, people troll each other all the time, and I find that horribly rude.

President Andrew Jackson was elected despite having won a duel which he walked away from with a bullet lodged inside him. We'd probably find that moderately horrifying, but it clearly was acceptable to the US population in large part.

The times change. If I have my facts straight, the last fistfight in the US Senate was between Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator Ralph Yarborough in 1964.
