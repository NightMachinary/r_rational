  From what I've heard, guns were ubiquitous (they still are but they used to be, too) and it was common for people to challenge each other to duels for any perceived slight.

You say that as though it naturally follows that good men would settle their differences in mortal combat just because they carry mortal weapons. I suppose I can see why that might be, they carry these things around, they must attribute them some use, dueling is as good a use as any. But I wonder if you could erect a more stable culture. A culture where the gun is like the sikh kirpan, a symbol of adulthood, never to be used in anger(do not agree to a fight until both you and your opponent have disarmed), only in self defense, standing as a symbol of the adult's willingness to shed blood to defend the lives of their people. In peace times, the gun's purpose is to go unused, and in this sense it may also serve as a symbol of tact, and self-restraint.
