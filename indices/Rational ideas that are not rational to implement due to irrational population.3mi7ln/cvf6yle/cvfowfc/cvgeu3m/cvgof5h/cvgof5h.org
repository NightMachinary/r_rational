Yes, I have thought about propulsion technologies a little bit :)

The concept of a electromagnetic launcher to deliver materials to Lagrange points has been around since the 1970's, and all the fiddling about burning up in atmosphere has already been answered by people far more qualified than me. [[http://www.nss.org/settlement/L5news/1980-massdriver.htm][Here's a link]]

As a spoiler, the answer is that there would be very little ablation, because the launched object is moving directly away from Earth instead of a long path through atmosphere like all rockets attempting orbital insertion. The object is also moving so quickly that it spends almost no time in the most dense atmosphere. By the time the outer surface heats up, it's already most of the way out of atmosphere. I would also like to note that superconductor technology has come a long way since the 1970's. There are industrial applications for very large superconductors these days, they aren't all in labs. That's not to say it won't be frighteningly expensive.

Quench guns store electric charge in their coils. That means the electrical grid need not provide the power immediately, or even rapidly. Were you aware that most nuclear plants are located at a fair distance from cities, because people don't want them in their back yard? Quite a few dams and coal plants are far from population centers as well. In fact I'd guess that most power plants are quite some distance from large population centers. If for no other reason, to reduce property costs and taxes on the land. Finally, there are very extensive power grids across most of the industrialized world. We move power around to where it is needed. Putting this facility near an intersection of grids so it won't be anywhere near civilization, and will have access to power from multiple large power grids would seem like a good idea.

All those things you believe we need to worry before getting into the engineering have already been worried about, and either determined to not be a problem, or solutions have been found.

That's not to say there aren't engineering obstacles. It would be a very large project. It would be frighteningly expensive. It would allow us to start developing space.
