Have you considered how fast you would have to be going to reach orbit, without extra rockets? With rockets? Have you considered the amount of acceleration required to get up to the speed required?

LEO is 7.8km/s, so to reach it you'd need to accelerate something quite a bit faster than that to account for speed lost to increased gravitational potential and, the bigger factor I think, air resistance. I don't think it's easy and I have a lot of questions about whether it's sensible or feasible to even have something moving that fast near the surface of the Earth where the air is densest.

That's ignoring getting the electricity to the area, which presumably can't be too near a city since it'll be heated by the fast moving spaceships. Did you know that one of the constraints for determining where to build a something as mundane as data center is whether there is enough electricity available?

These are all things you have to worry about before event getting to the complicated issue that would be the electromagnetic acceleration. I don't think this is very easy and even for something as "simple" as building a normal rocket took SpaceX multiple attempts.
