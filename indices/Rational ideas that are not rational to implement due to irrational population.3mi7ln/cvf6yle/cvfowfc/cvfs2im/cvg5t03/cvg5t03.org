The 'space industry' we have now is really just an orbital delivery industry. We aren't making anything in space, other than in the occasional experiment. The current space program is a combination of R&D projects, government satellites, and extensions of ground-based telecom industries.

When we start manufacturing things in space, for more than just R&D, then I'll agree we have a space industry.
