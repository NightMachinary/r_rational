We do have a space industry - See Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. Plus the old guard of government contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The way you describe it, the real problem is getting from 0 to billions before you even start. The normal solution to this is to create some sort of proof of concept or work on a smaller system or at least do something to demonstrate that your team knows what its doing and that the concept is feasible. Then you'll be rolling in VC, or just get acquired by a big company.
