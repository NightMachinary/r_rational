~All ideas promoted by the freedom-loving right, that're opposed by the compassionate left.

A person should be held accountable for their own health and family expenses, unfortunately people are not rational enough to save for emergencies, or to hold off from having children they can't afford.

Ubiquity of guns should lead to a more polite society, unfortunately (I'm not american so I never looked into this, but IIRC <something to do with accident rates being terrible enough on their own, criminals not giving a fuck who's carrying and going on doing what they're doing in exactly the same way, but with more guns and more organization>)
