If something fails because it doesn't take into account the limited capabilities of humans, can it really be called rational?

It's easy to imagine policies that would work in a utopia. The hard part is coming up with policies that work in real life.

Also, you might want to research the antebellum American south. From what I've heard, guns were ubiquitous (they still are but they used to be, too) and it was common for people to challenge each other to duels for any perceived slight. It would be interesting to see how "polite" that society was.
