The problem with expecting people to be rational about health is that it by nature makes people irrational. Take 10 people who all believe in total self support and personal accountability for health expenses. Let's say they don't have much money.

Let's say they all get injured. Some percentage of them are going to seek care that they can't afford once confronted with the pain and risk of permanent disability.

Or to weaken their rational resolve even more, let's say it's their child or parent that gets injured. It's one thing to make a principled stand on your own health but are you really going to tell your 5 year old daughter that she gets to die of leukemia because Obamacare destroys freedom?

Of course not.

Sick people will always seek care, whether or not they can afford it. After all, it's the rational thing for them to do.

Society and government has to structure itself to provide that care at minimum cost to the rest of the society.

This can be through a single payer insurance system like Taiwan or Canada, it can be through a completely free system like the NHS. It can be through Singapore's system which forces people to save 8~10% of their income and put it into an account that can only be used for health expenses.

But in all cases, the government has to force rationality.
