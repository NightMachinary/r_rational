Well, I actually think governments should be attempting to reach post-scarcity eutopia, and that actually includes pretty much every bad consequence ever. But the system you describe makes sense to prioritize pre-scarcity concerns, although I might add that where losses on stock or financial hardship from a bad degree threatens one's life, well-being, etc, the government should still prioritize their security over the derivative of growth. As a country's economic surplus increases, more resources are available to improve the minimum quality of life, and I'd argue that that's where more focus should go.

However, this is all strictly theoretical. No one is arguing that governments are all shit, I think.
