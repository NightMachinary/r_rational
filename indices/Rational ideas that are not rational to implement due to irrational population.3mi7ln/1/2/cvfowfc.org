We already have maglev trains, supercolliders, and electromagnetic weapons are going through some of the last hurdles before being placed on advanced warships. Certainly, there will be engineering obstacles, but most of those engineering obstacles can be resolved by a fusion of the technologies used for the three of these successful implementations of electromagnetic propulsion.

Launch to orbit doesn't need as much mass as a train, or the velocity of a particle in a supercollider. We also don't need to limit ourselves to the extremely short acceleration window of the weapon. We certainly don't want to use this to launch people, or extremely large masses, at least to begin with.

On the money side of things, I believe you will find that people and corporations with 'billions to spare' very rarely put those billions towards a single speculative venture.

Speculation investments in the millions is not uncommon. Venture capital in the tens of millions for a single project happens every now and then. I can't think of any speculative ventures funded to the tune of 100+ million but I wouldn't doubt they exist. (Saturn, Global Crossing, American Superconductor may have started with this range of venture capital) Billions though? That sort of money rarely moves into a single project unless it's a pretty solid prospect, run by proven industry leaders.

The problem is that there aren't any proven space industry leaders, because there is no space industry. Partly because we do not have reasonably inexpensive launching systems.

An individual with a massive amount of money who might consider exposing themselves financially to such a huge degree would have to contend with levels of risk that are difficult to comprehend. What if they put three billion dollars into the system, and then have the government shut down the launch site because someone recently discovered a rare, endangered bird nesting habitat nearby? What if there is an accident which doesn't critically damage the project, but does raise the insurance rates to insane levels?

The first electromagnetic launch-to-space project will almost certainly be government-built, because it's just too damn risky for individuals or companies to touch - at least until there is one to prove the concept.
