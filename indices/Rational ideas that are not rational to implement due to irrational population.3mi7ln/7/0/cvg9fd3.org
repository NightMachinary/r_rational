Whenever someone criticizes "Democracy", it's worth asking /how democratic actually is/ the real-life system being used as evidence for the critique. A major problem with using the United States, for instance, as evidence to critique democracy, is that increasingly many available studies show that the United States is just not that democratic in the first place: only the top 10% by income/wealth measurably influence the government.

  But people aren't rational, and now we've got Trump v. Clinton in a battle that will be decided primarily by old people in a minority of states.

This is another superbly /bad/ example, in that while Trump is a populist with broad support among his party, he's getting that support by using his wealth to spite the oligarchs of his own party. While Clinton is an appointed politician-princess, and Clinton is pretty clearly more rational than Trump, /Clinton's party is spending its effort to ignore everyone who's not Clinton/. This means that, for all of us who are more left-wing than Hillary Clinton - and this includes, say, the Barack Obama of 2007 who ran against her in the Democratic primaries - the /correct and rational choice/ is one that the established system is too oligarchical to put before the public.

So if you really think that, "People are irrational, and that's why we've got shitty candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump", you're ignoring the fact that a real, operative democracy might actually result in Bernie Sanders facing Ted Cruz or something.

TL;DR: If you've got a system that's 70% oligarchy and 30% democracy, then your prior for blame for the faults of that system must be allocated 70% to oligarchy and 30% to democracy /until you see evidence that more oligarchy would have helped, and that means actually-existing oligarchy rather than philosopher kings or FAI./
