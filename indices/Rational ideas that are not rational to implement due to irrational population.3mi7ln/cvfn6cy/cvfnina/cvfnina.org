I agree with anarchy, because anarchy as a political system can really only work if people are fully rational, because even a few irrational individuals can cause an immense amount of disruption in an anarchic system.

Legalized drugs being irrational, I do not agree with. Making them illegal has never worked, and will never work in anything short of a police state (It's frequently failed in police states too.) All you gain from making the drugs illegal is a higher price which just makes people who are addicted poorer (addiction by free introduction to drugs is common practice.) Stigmatizing addicted persons as criminals makes it more difficult for them to make the decision to seek treatment for addiction. Prison time for drug users costs more than treatment. Criminal organizations form and coalesce into their own underground government and black market, frequently engaging in wars and expanding their criminal activity beyond the drug trade. The educational system has a very difficult time educating children about which drugs are highly dangerous, and which are only moderately so. (Alcohol and marijuana are far less problematic than crack and meth.)

Braess' paradox is fascinating! Atlanta needs to experiment with closing some streets, I think. Other than that, I believe you are referring to things like standardizing building codes, educational standards, vehicle safety requirements, in larger and larger blocks until there are uniform standards? If I am understanding right, how does this impact innovation? If everything is required to be the same, it's going to take a lot more effort to generate change.
