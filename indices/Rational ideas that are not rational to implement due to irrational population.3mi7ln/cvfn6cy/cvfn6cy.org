Anarchy (as a political / governmental method, not as a state of chaos), legalized psychedelics, and in-general civilizational optimization.

Anarchy (my personal agency is never forced to follow another's) falls apart if you have even a small subset of the people not trying to make that rule true for everyone, but everyone having maximum agency makes a lot of sense.

Legalized psychedelices because I really don't think people can handle a $0.10* thing you can get a the corner store that /will/ change your life. * Economies of scale, lack of price increase due to black market.

In-general civilizational optimizations because people get attached to things like weird windy streets, or grid layouts, or are otherwise unable to process that group optimization can lead to better individual optimization than individual optimization can. See, as an amazing example, "Braess' paradox"
