That's definitely part of it.

The other part is all the times where a container of radioactive material has little protection and no labels. A lot of the stories in the two links above are about innocents (or criminals, but that's not the point) unknowingly dismantling a radioactive device for scrap metal. I have no illusion that all of them would've heeded warning signs if they had been any, but it would have helped.
