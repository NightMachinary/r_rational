Seraphnb,

... I had to disappear for several of the same reasons. I was beating my head against areas that weren't [[/r/rational]] or for that matter, even at all rational.

I just stepped back in here because I needed to find a link to send to somebody else, then saw this message. Well. That's a crap of a downer.

I hope the fics that had you and me contacting each other in the first place work out.

For that matter, I hope you succeed in everything you have planned in the future but one thing. And may that thing always be changing for you.

Fare well.
