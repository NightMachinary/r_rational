The biggest thought would be the ability to focus on one skill. You want to be the best at a skill? Spend 12hrs working on it in Wake, then start fresh in Dream for another 12hrs, then head over to wake for 12hrs more.

In fact, if I were searching for others who know how to live in both worlds, I would look first among the highly skilled and second among the highly erratic. The erratic people could potentially be experiencing setbacks or successes in the other world.

Conspiracies would be interesting if you meet up in one world with like powered individuals. Then plan coordinated shenanigans in the other world where you never directly interact. Anyone living in only one world would have no real way to figure out who is part of the plot.
