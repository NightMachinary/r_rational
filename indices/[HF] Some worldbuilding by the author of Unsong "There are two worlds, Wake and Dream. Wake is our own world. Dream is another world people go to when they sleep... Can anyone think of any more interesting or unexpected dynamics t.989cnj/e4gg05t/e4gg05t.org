Why assume people will keep their Dream identity the same as their Wake one? People poof into existence since their infancy. In years of their developmental stage they will find out that doing the same thing as in their Wake hours is wasteful, no matter what they value. By doing the same thing, they won't achieve better school/work performance, they won't make more money, they won't have more fun. So they do things differently.

To be clear, try to imagine this. You try to master a skill in Wake, you get an accelerated rate in Dream. Soon, you'll be an expert in Dream, and sometimes you find out those skill don't pay as good as you first imagine them to be. So you stop, and ignore your Wake who is still trying to master that first skill. You explore something else, hoping that this time, you'll be involved in something more rewarding.

Years after years doing things differently will result in situation that is much different. Changes compounded. Your Wake is now only limited as insight, an inspiration; your Dream will now be the time to do things for real. People may migrate, have different career choice, try to date person other than they fancied in Wake, and have different social circle. Again, changes compounded. In due time, the Dream will be entirely different that the Wake. The Dream will follow their own rule.

Interesting thing about romance; If in Wake your love life is not fulfilling, you are more willing to leave and move on. You'll try to find a new romantic partner in time, and you'll want to make sure that (s)he is the one. You gather gossips, you try to find out how they behave from their Wake friends. Exploiting information advantage that is the Dream world. Once you're sure they can make a good lover, you approach them for real. But eh, you'll find out their Dream personality is not the same as their Wake. They experience different thing throughout their two life after all. And once again, the game of love is one where you have to take a risk.

And the woman often use, "My Wake is having children," excuse to explain a baby that soon poof beside them.
