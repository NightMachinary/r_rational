A group of lucid dreamers who know each other in Wake- people very likely to notice a creeping epidemic of dreamlessness- starts killing its members one by one in the dream, such that the first letter of each one's name contributes to a message. Somewhere, someone assembles a log; first William, then immediately after, Everett. A long time passes, then Kyle, Imogen, Lucy, Lain. Another break. Tim, and Oswald fall off. And then Sarah, Patrick, Eve, Andrew, Polly.
