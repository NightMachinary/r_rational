I have to wonder if people would still call these two worlds "Wake" and "Dream", if they had existed for all of human civilization.

I mean, why would people think Wake is the "true" world, instead of Dream? In Dream you're perfectly cognizant of both of your lives, while in Wake you can only recall your Wake life. It seems more like Wake would be seen as the inferior other-world, not Dream.

In fact, where would humans even get the terms "wake" and "dream" from, in this universe? When you go to sleep in Wake, you don't experience surrealist visions cobbled together by your resting mind. You wake up in a completely different world, in a completely different body. The concept of dreaming shouldn't even exist for the Wake Dreamers. Nor should the concept of being "awake". In our world, being awake implies being free from the limits of unconsciousness. But for the Wake Dreamers, there are no limits imposed by unconsciousness. You just move to your other body in the other world.

I just thought of another question: can a woman get pregnant and give birth in Dream? What happens then? Does the child only remember their life in Dream, but remembers both in Wake? Can the child even reach Wake, or do they just stay in Dream their whole lives? Or is there a third unique layer above Dream, that Dream-children go to when they fall asleep?
