TL;DR: Dream is a pile of dead babies.

If the mechanism through which people are projected into Dream connects to the brain in any measurable way, Wake scientists would begin to notice something odd once brain scanning became possible. This is the best mechanism I can think of for bridging the gap between the worlds, as memories one forms concerning the existence of Dream while awake might not be erased, and if they were erased others would still notice the discrepancy.

Everyone in Dream basically has a discount version of Coil's power. If they try something that doesn't work in Wake, they won't try it again in Dream. This would have really interesting implications for war, and I don't even know how to model conflicts in a world where everyone knows a ton of things not to do.

Even worse, people vanishing from Dream when they Wake would make any kind of strategy hinging upon people being in specific places at specific times downright dangerous. A dog barking in Wake could cause a plane to crash in Dream, so any kind of transportation which requires people to run it is only as reliable as the driver's sleep schedule. Also, if you always respawn in Dream exactly where you left off, vanishing from Dream while in a moving vehicle pops you into existence outside that vehicle. This probably means that transportation technology beyond handcarts doesn't exist in Dream. The only safe way to move anywhere is to walk.

Natural disasters in Dream are even more deadly because you won't be able to escape from them. If a forest fire starts while you are in Wake, you will pop into a blazing inferno and die in agony. If predators exist in Dream, they could note where a person pops out and lie in wait until they pop back in, devouring them before they have a chance to respond. I'm assuming you can't telefrag, but what happens if there's a flood over a massive area? Do you appear above the water and get stranded, assuming you even survive? Do you get placed on the nearest solid surface? Do you replace fluids within your body when you pop in, meaning you could enter Dream while under water? This needs to be clarified.

Face-to-face cooperation with people in Dream is only possible if they share timezones, and if anyone goes onto night shift in Wake they basically have to leave their friends. Assuming they have friends in the first place, as constantly defecting is a great strategy in a world where people will be completely absent and unable to protect their stuff a significant fraction of the time.

I don't think human society is possible under these conditions. Technology just can't be built or operated past the most rudimentary, everything in nature is way more dangerous, and trusting people is impossible when they could take everything you have and be hours away by the time you get back. Sure, people will bring knowledge from Wake, but a modern soldier is useless in a world where the infrastructure to build and distribute guns can't exist. Engineering in Dream would have to be so radically different that Wake engineers would be hobbled. Ironically, Wake advancing past a certain point might wind up plunging Dream into a perpetual dark age as nobody is born anymore who knows how to build all the steps to even make modern tech. An engineer is only as good as his tools, and they won't be able to make them.

The fact that infants appear next to their mothers makes women of childbearing age even more valuable. Dream sex produces no offspring, so the entire world is dependent upon the reproductive succes of Wake mothers. Dream women presumably don't experience pregnancy, so they can remain valuable while creating free babies. However, baby mechanics really need to be redone entirely because babies sleep way more than new parents, meaning that entirely defenceless Dream infants will be lying around on the ground hoping that someone pops in to care for them. Infant mortality will be horrendous. In fact, I doubt anyone would survive. Forget all the other problems, the current Dream is a world filled with rotting baby corpses.
