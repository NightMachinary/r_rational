Arbitrarily bumping age of first Dream visit to three to avoid the babypocalypse:

People are awake for twice as long as they're asleep, so the population of Dream at any given moment will be a third the population of Wake. The largest portion of this population rotates around the earth in darkness, with only a tiny nocturnal minority.

So at any given moment there are only about two and a half billion people in Dream with five to ten hours of time per visit. Popping into and out of existence like they do, I assume they only need about one meal per "night." So there are an enormous amount of resources available relative to Wake: Literally fewer mouths to feed.

I assume people, back in tribal times, would have established communal living arrangements to deal with changing sleep schedules (over which Dream has no control) and they'd leave "offerings" for the desperate, lonely nocturnals to keep them from stealing and destroying while nobody's around.

Very few would start as nocturnals, of course, and there'd be nothing in Dream to predict who would become one. Most children would start on a diurnal schedule, however, and the cultural knowledge of what it means to be nocturnal would be passed to them when they were young regardless of whether they actually became so. Similarly, family and friend relationships would be well established by the time somebody gets the late watch or a night job in Wake. The soon-to-be nocturnal may even know in advance. They can leave notes or signs to let everyone else know what's up, and carry on a sort of conversation.

They might even be able to do the maintenance and guardianship that is otherwise impossible for the vast majority with normal sleep schedules.

The varying sleep schedule issue is another reason to establish tight communities: Much of the danger of popping into and out of existence can be limited if everybody works together as a group.

My guess is that technological progress will look very different in both places, because of the population limits and the limited resource requirements. One wouldn't merely be advanced to the other, but Dream will have an entirely unique set of needs and limits enforced by cultural forces distinct from those in Wake.
