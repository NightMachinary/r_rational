Bump the age back even further and it could become a coming of age event in society. Around 12 or maybe 15, you experience dream for the first time.

It would be interesting if dream world happened on a plane or tiny planet as opposed to earth.clone. Giving this other world 1/3rd the land mass could keep population density roughly the same.

Also, depending on how popping in or out works. Some tasks could be terrifying. Imagine climbing down a ladder in dream, then being woken up. If you pop back to that same place, what if you are not ready to hold fast to the ladder. Imagine the amount of fear you would have that day, and the trepidation you would have as you go through your day knowing that you will pop back to an awkward position. This is even worse for older people with poor balance. They will sometimes find themselves going from luring down on their bed to mid stride.

Last thought; what about special interactions between worlds? Could a medical disease give a person the ability to communicate with people in both worlds? Does a person in a coma dream? And would there be a business built around inducing people into deep sleep so they may take care of business in dream?
