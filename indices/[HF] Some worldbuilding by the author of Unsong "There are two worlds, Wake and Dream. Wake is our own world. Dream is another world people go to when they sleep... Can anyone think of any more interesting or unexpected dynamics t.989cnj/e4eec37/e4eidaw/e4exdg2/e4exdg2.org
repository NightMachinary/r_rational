I would hope humans would figure something out? Like the woman might say "hey everyone, my waker is pregnant, baby's first spawning at [location], [time]" and other people will arrange to be there? Unless we just never got anyone surviving to adulthood ever.

Bear in mind we don't have to build civilization right away, and even if we can't hunt and gather we can at the very least scavenge on baby corpse meat.
