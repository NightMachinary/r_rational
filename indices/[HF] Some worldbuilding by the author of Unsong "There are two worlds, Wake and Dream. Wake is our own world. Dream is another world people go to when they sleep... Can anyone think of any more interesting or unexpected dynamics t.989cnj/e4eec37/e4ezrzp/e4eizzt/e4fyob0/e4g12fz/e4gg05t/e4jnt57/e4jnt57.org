Assuming that people age in both worlds separately given that they can live completely distinct lives and assuming that inhabitants of this universe keep the same sleep patterns that we do here, age is likely to be a significant difference between the two world which could have some interesting consequences in Dream. If people spend 1/3 of their time asleep on average, then a 30 year old in Wake would only be 10 in Dream but would have all of the memories and experience of a 30 year old. Someone like Nicola Tesla who only slept a few hours each night would diverge even further and essentially be a child prodigy, while someone who spent half their day sleeping in Wake would be significantly older than your average citizen in Wake.

If they age at the same rate in both worlds, that leads to different discrepancies. From Dream's perspective, people will continue aging while they don't exist so they would need to cram much more into their existing hours to have the same number of lifetime accomplishments as their Waking self. The Tesla example from before would have the opposite issue: they would age very fast compared to the amount of time they are in existence. Life is likely to be lived at a much faster pace than in Wake.

The post mentions propaganda and how the lessons they learn in Wake would impact their philosophies in Dream. One question that leads to is how closely do people in Dream identify with their Wake selves? The point of divergence is apparently the first sleep after birth. Given that they can live completely distinct lives to the point of living in different places in the world, why would they be inclined to consider Wake selves as anything more than a particularly vivid story?

How do sleep-related disorders impact Dream? If someone is narcoleptic in Wake, for example, they are likely to have a very different experience than someone who has a normal sleeping pattern. What about people with sleep apnea? Insomnia or hypersomnia?

Outside of disorders, some people in our world have varying types of dreams. Assuming the comparison holds, does that have an analogy in Dream? If someone tends to have dreams about their day-to-day life, what advantages or disadvantages would they have compared to someone who has more abstract or fantastical dreams? What about lucid dreaming?

The logistical problems of people disappearing and later reappearing in the same place have already had lots of exploration within this thread and other rational or semi-rational literature. For those who have read Worm, Clockblocker does some interesting interplay with bringing people in and out of the time stream. In this case they disappear from existence rather than appearing frozen, but a lot of the same concepts would apply both in how you can deal with someone "frozen" as well as what the perspective of the Dreamer would do. They may appear in the same place, but the world could move drastically around them. Hopefully no-one is angry enough to dig a spiked pit underneath where you disappeared, for example.

Sports would look drastically different as would any other activities that require a great deal of precise coordination. I'm not a sport guy so I can't do a lot of exploration here, but I imagine something like American football would not be possible given that for any given offensive or defensive play, you might have players suddenly missing.

How much continuity of thought is there between a Dreamer's moments of existence? Do they instantly remember who/what/where they are and what they were doing? If they are in the middle of a movement when they disappear, do they seamlessly continue with the movement when they reappear or do they have to readjust to having been another person for hours?
