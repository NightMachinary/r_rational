If you remember a collection of jumbled images when waking, couldn't you try to communicate by just staring at the same image (maybe of text) for an entire dream cycle?

>Dreamers still have their memories of being American or Russian or whatever, and they might feel patriotism toward their waking nations and try to expand them into the dreamworld, or subvert nations too far away from their ideals. Even if the Soviets win the Cold War in Dream, a lifetime of absorbing modern ideas about capitalism is going to make it hard for the Dreamers to really go all out with the communism thing

This confuses me a lot, I don't think the author is considering you could be born in Wake America and Dream Russia and have two experiences absorbing different modern ideas. The "lifetime" thing makes me wonder when they actually think people start living in the dream world.
