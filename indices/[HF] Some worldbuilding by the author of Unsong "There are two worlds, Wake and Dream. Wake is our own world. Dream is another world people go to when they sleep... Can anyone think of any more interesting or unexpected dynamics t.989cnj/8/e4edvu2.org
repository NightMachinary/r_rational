- Different power structures, different hierarchies. A well known rich man in Wake might have to watch his back in Dream, where he lacks status and protection. A rich man in Dream might have to spend so much time asleep in Wake that his life fell apart.

- There'd be no physical medium for exchange between worlds- any kind of credit would need guarantors.

- For that matter, businesses could operate both waking and dreaming fronts and require employees to spend time in both states.

- Basically a capitalist system would make this into an eternal living nightmare.

- Criminal justice could involve temporary exile from one side or the other- induced comas, or sleeplessness? What would happen to a man who murdered a Waker and then fled to Dream by entering a coma? Extradition?

- Do bodies persist in the world where they are unconscious? Do you need resources in Dream or do you just pop in when you fall alseep?

- No physical conflict between the two nations- and they're made up of the same people. Yet something tells me there'd still be prejudice and bias towards people who spent more time in one vs the other? Different cultural markers or aspects of appearance as signifiers?
