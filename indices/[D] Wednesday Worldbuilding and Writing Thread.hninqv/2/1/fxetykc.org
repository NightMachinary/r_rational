If you want to prevent progress, just have something out there that looks out for progress, and goes after the people who try it. Punishes them -- or eats them.

Two good options are Industrial Magic is Lethally Patented, or, less comic and more grimdark, Industrial Magic Makes You Tasty To Aliens.

Industrial Magic is Lethally Patented: there's something very powerful that thinks it "owns" industrial-economy magic, and that thing comes out and punishes societies that use too much magic in ordinary life.

In /Practical Guide To Evil/, it's the gnomes, who go after anyone who poaches on their monopoly of machinery and automation. In /Worth the Candle/, there's a bit of this with the dragons, who consider the upper atmosphere their property and go after any unlicensed airplanes or flying mages.

So, pick a powerful distant civilization, and say it's not always distant -- it comes and /visits/ if there's too much "commoner magic" and kidnaps or kills the innovators.

No industrial revolution for you! The gnomes have their monopoly.

Industrial Magic is Tasty to Aliens: there's something Out There that's drawn to over-rich concentrations of magic in everyday life, and it colonizes or eats those cities, and nobody ever hears of them again.

No industrial revolution for you! Your customers don't want to attract Cthulhu.

You can see that both of these aren't about how magic works, but about the /social consequences/ for using that magic. So any little thing people do can work just as the rulebooks imply. But the moment it starts to become a system - well, that's when it starts to get the attention of the Patent Enforcers or the Hungry Aliens.

Is this realistic? I'm afraid we know it is, because it really happened. Imperial colonizers in history did both of these things.

Lethal Patent Enforcers: the Dutch conquered Indonesia, and then, to get a monopoly on spices, they sent out raiding parties to slaughter everybody raising those spices who wasn't in Dutch territory. Your civilization isn't allowed: the powerful foreigners will kill you if you keep cultivating cloves and peppers.

Your Civilization Makes You Tasty to Aliens: from all Africa, there's a certain stretch of the west coast where the Europeans took the most slaves from. You know why? Because back then, it was the rich part of sub-Saharan Africa, with the most built-up farms and kingdoms and civilization. And all those people and organized leaders made it the easiest, the most convenient, of all places for the Europeans to go into and demand captives -- to take overseas as slaves.

The richer your sub-Saharan African kingdom was in 1500, the more likely the Europeans turned you and your whole village into a cargo for overseas slavery by the 1600s or 1700s. Because your economic development makes your people look tasty to the aliens.

I know, super creepy, but the worst parts of history are.

But you don't have to be grimdark to get the job done. In /Practical Guide to Evil/ the gnomes are a spooky-comic fact rather than a seriously hostile menace. The story makes it possible the gnomes even have "good motives," that they're slowly working on things themselves and don't trust humans not to screw things up -- anti-industrialization as a sort of environmentalism.

It could even be outright silly: you could have gods that were comically nervous about industrial magic, seeing it as a risk to their authority. Maybe everybody has superstitions about the Forbidden Applications of spells that will draw divine wrath, but also the Loophole Tricks that will let you run your teleportation-smuggling business without getting lightning-bolted by the God of Transport. Why revere the gods' prohibitions when you can, ah, creatively negotiate?

So the basic principle will work in your world, whether you set it up as a wacky fact or a terrifying one:

The easiest way to stop progress? Something big and powerful comes after anyone who tries.
