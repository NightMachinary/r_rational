I read a pdf of a paper from like 1990 about how to terraform venus, which included a 100 year period where all the CO2 would condense in the form of a continual CO2 rainstorm. It seemed scientifically based and was talking about how the colony could be profitable early on.

I googled "old paper about terraforming venus" because google is a wizard I'm pretty sure that this is the paper I read, if you're interested: [[https://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/TerraformingVenusQuickly.pdf]]
