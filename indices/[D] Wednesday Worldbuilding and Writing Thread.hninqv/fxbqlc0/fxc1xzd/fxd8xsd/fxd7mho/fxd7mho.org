So I sorta took this for granted before, but now that I'm thinking about it, how would [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/c0y8rx/comment/er9nlp6?context=1][the crew of this ship]] defend themselves from attack in space?

I'd prefer to avoid enumerating the powers involved in detail again (see the link), but in summary: a bunch of people with superpowers built a spaceship, using a metalkine for the metal parts, a portal for both storage and propellant, and a grab-bag of telekinesis, light-eating, and something something alchemy for steering and life-support / navigation / whatever.

So what if someone throws a missile at them as they're passing Jupiter's orbit, or something? None of them really have fine control at spacebattle distances, and I question if any of them can muster the kind of energy it would take to just brute-force point defense.

What I've come up with at this point is to split the ship into at least three, with each sub-ship optimized for the individuals who will be aboard. Untrained portal-kid is not going to power the main ship, but in combination with the plasmakine, maybe they could get a smaller craft jinking (and spinning, and struggling to hold onto air since the plasma has to get to the nozzle somehow...). The telekine could be much more impressive in a lighter vessel, and if paired with light-guy, they could have the lightest subship. This would certainly confuse any attackers, and improve their evasive capacities, but I'm not sure it would be enough, and I expect many non-attacker-related things could go wrong.

Mostly, I'm thinking they do that until portal-guy and metalkine can arrange for a suitable coronal mass ejection from the star on the far side of the portal, and just hope it functions as an effective "burn everything in that general direction" technique.

But sanity-checking the engines proved helpful, so I figure I should sanity-check this solution. Fwiw, I expect they ultimately had to obtain some more advanced equipment for stabilizing the ship, else they'd probably wind up having a very rough trip with unwanted spinning. And I'm still a bit torn between letting the telekine just ignore how forces normally work, and requiring that they work in a more Newtonian way (where's the equal and opposite reaction if you're telekinetically accelerating a spaceship? You're not pushing or pulling, and you're not throwing out propellant. Are you using the CMB as a climbing net?).
