So DnD's economy is wonky because whoever designed it didn't understand the value of gold. In the rules, fancy magical items cost quite a bit to make. In 5e a +1 sword is something like 500gp. (Let's use nobles.) That's 3027 shillings. (1500 pigs. 320 cows.) Create food and water feeds 15 people. By contrast that many medieval cows (yes I looked for medieval milk production) could make about 900 pounds of cheese a day. This leads to feeding 224 people a day (not counting days when cows weren't milking, but also not counting meat).

So to answer your question, magic would probably make the economy /less/ efficient as arming knights would drastically increase in cost, but their monopoly on force would likely be more complete. This in turn might actually /decrease/ the speed of technological progress, because the price of labor is much lower compared to the price of the raw materials that create the magic. In some ways technological progress relies on high labor prices.

There's one exception to the relative cost inefficiency of magical items: bags of holding and teleport. They would also be 6.6 shillings per pound (weight). Ships were far cheaper at something like 30 shillings per /ton/. However, there's speed to consider. A mage with access to teleportation and a bag of holding could make 900 shillings per day selling spices. Assuming you need a rare and very rare item to level up + the bag, that's 36,000 shillings or /40 days/ to make a profit. Even then, it's not the massive profit you might think; a 20 ton ship going to India might spend 300 days round trip. You're still getting 266 shillings per day by this method at the cost of something like 600 shillings for the ship alone. So mages are like 40x the investment for 3.4x the profit. A profit that will permanently disappear in a few years once there are permanent teleportation circles between all major trade capitols.
