I doubt glass would melt at the altitudes contemplated, where the temperature stays below the boiling point of water. Oxygen isn't just rare on Venus, but practically nonexistent, and Wiki claims it burns at a bit over twice boiling, so I imagine it would be okay as an envelope. So I think either would work out--thanks for answering!
