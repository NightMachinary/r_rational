Rather than making this an instead-of situation, I think it would work best to colonize both. Venus has an abundance of things which are rare on Mars, and vice versa. Venus can supply the rocket fuel, water, carbon, sulfur, and other volatile elements. Mars can supply the heavier elements like iron and silicon, and potentially other rare elements found as ore veins due to the historical presence of water. Together, once they are both sufficiently built up, they would likely be able to survive independently of Earth in the event of some kind of sudden and apocalyptic event, like a nuclear war. We still haven't identified any signs of extraterrestrial civilizations, so the Fermi paradox would suggest that one or more great filters may still lie ahead of us. It's best that we don't leave all our eggs in one basket.
