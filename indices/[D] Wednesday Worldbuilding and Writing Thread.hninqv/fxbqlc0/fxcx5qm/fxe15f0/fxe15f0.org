Glass and most ceramics are resistant to organic acids. That's why you can safely store most of them in glass vials. Glass would melt on Venus, but we've got tons of ceramics which would probably do the trick.

I don't know of any flexible acid-resistant materials however. Neoprene is resistant to some acids, but it has a low flash and melting point and bursts into flames upon contact with nitric acid, which may exist in small quantities as well. Though to be fair I don't know if it would do that in a low oxygen environment.

There are apparently a whole category of thermoplastics, one of which might do fine in an acid environment.
