I'm glad to see this here as I've have written a first draft of a hard sci-fi book about Venus cloud colonies, but I've only edited and posted the first two chapters here a few months ago because I've been busy (excuses excuses). Essentially the habitats in my story are ellipsoid halves 1 kilometers tall, 500 meters wide, and 1 kilometer long- enough for 567 tons of lift at equal pressure altitude. The roof is a giant liquid crystal to regulate sunlight. As most of the weight is taken up by the thorium reactor, ascent vehicles, mining tethered robots, and structure, the residential and office buildings are made of bamboo.
