Consider [[https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/why-colonize-venus-instead-of-mars-c490d14c0531]]\\
That's just the start of a rabbit hole; it leads to link upon link, full of lots of speculation about Venusian flying habitats. Basically the idea is that, since ordinary air is significantly less dense than Venus's CO2 atmosphere, human colonists could live in huge bubbles somewhere around 50km up. The atmosphere contains, in addition to CO2, some nitrogen, with traces of water vapor, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid--enough building blocks that you could skim and break them down to make all sorts of handy sludges.

Rarer materials would need to be either imported from Earth or somehow procured from the surface. This is the biggest difficulty I see at present; the surface of Venus is pretty much hell, and destroyed the one probe the Soviets sent in something like an hour. Supposedly you could have better luck mining the highest mountains, though that would be a substantial investment.

Energy would be plentiful; Venus receives oodles of solar energy, and one commenter on a thread suggested dipping a power plant on a mile-long tether, to get into the regions where ambient temps are above boiling. I don't know enough chemistry to say how the sulfuric-acid clouds would be dealt with, but I've read enough knowledgeable-seeming people waving it aside that I don't feel too troubled. Apparently it's feasible to make organic acid-resistant materials? Not a chemist.

These bubbles would be blown around the world by ferocious winds, effectively giving them fifty hours each of darkness and daylight. It's been suggested (in one of these pages) that the habs would rise during the day and sink during the night, presumably by using ballast tanks and hydrogen gas, to compensate for the shift in insolation. Venus itself is quicker/easier to get to than Mars.

Thoughts?
