Are you trying to stay as close as possible to rules as written? (As opposed to treating them as an abstraction and adding in various common sense limits). Can anyone level up like a Player Character? (In an abstract sense, Player Characters are kind of meant to represent unique are or at least rarely skilled individuals. If you take the rules more literally, you could still interpret it to be that player character levels are rare and hard to get and that XP can't be safely gained by artificially setting up safe encounters). If you make character levels rare enough, whether by fiat or a complex in universe explanation about what levels are or by treating them as an abstraction (of fast-learning, lucky, blessed, and/or talented individuals) then you can reduce the economic impact of magic that way.

One thing that commonly gets ignored or made less annoying by house rules are spell components. If you went the opposite direction and made spell components rarer or more expensive or needed in greater quantity that could magic less economically impactful. Likewise for magic item crafting the XP cost rules could be representative of the crafter literally pouring their soul into their work in a process that is costly enough to make magic items economically unviable and not mass produce able.
