Alright, so I wouldn't be surprised if this has been brought up here before but what would a rational Hell look like. Assuming it has a population equivalent if not (and most likely) larger to that of The Land of The Living (TLoTL) comprised entirely/mostly of suffering-maximizers, how would this work.

I keep trying to flesh out this idea but get hung up on trying to figure out the behavior of creatures that probably don't have primary or secondary drives remotely similar to humans. For example:

- Do they need sustenance?

- Can they procreate or derive pleasure from sex?

- Are they social animals? Maybe an ability to empathize with their own kind? Would these creatures have any sort of innate sense of fairness like that which has been observed in primates?

- If they're not social animals, would a unified inter-species goal be enough to get them to work together? Or would they just fight each other to improve their personal ability to induce suffering?

- Can they feel die or feel pain at all for that matter?

- Basically, what would the demon version of Maslow's hierarchy look like?

Which brings us to our next point, one interesting part about demons/devils seeking to maximize suffering I've seen discussed before is how they would go about it, but I'm more curious right now with why.

- Is suffering something they feed off of for sustenance?
- Are they rewarded for causing suffering with some sort of pleasure, status, money?
- If they are rewarded with pleasure, is it a relatively fixed amount of pleasure, or does it scale such that more suffering equals more pleasure incentivizing them to play the long game for bigger payouts? If so, how does the brain recognize how much suffering has been caused and allocate pleasure accordingly (such that these creatures wouldn't find a way of tricking themselves)? Like how would their brains know that convincing a person to be a suicide bomber results in a specific amount of suffering based on not only every killed/hurt individual but the amount of suffering that ripples out to society through those individuals' interpersonal connections, contributions to society, etc?
- Do they only seek to maximize the suffering of Homo sapiens, if so, why?

Next problem, civilization. Assuming the denizens of hell manage to form some sort of society what would it look like. So for this section of the thought experiment, I'm going to lay out some potential ideas for resources and rules that might exist in Hell. Let's imagine demons/devils can only influence TLoTL by projecting their minds into it and communicating with humans telepathically and certain areas/rings of Hell are easier to astral project from. Let's also assume that souls exist and if they talk a person out of their soul, that person will become the demon's/devil's personal slave in Hell once they die.

- What sort of monetary system might they have in place? (I was thinking they could manipulate people to set up a disaster and sell their plans to other demons so all they have to do is knock over the dominos, also slave trading.)

- What do they do for entertainment?

- Technology?

- Intellectual pursuits? (trying to figure out interdimensional travel to get to Earth)

Bit of a brain dump here, probably missed a fair number of obvious questions that need answering, but I'm just curious what some of yall might come up with.
