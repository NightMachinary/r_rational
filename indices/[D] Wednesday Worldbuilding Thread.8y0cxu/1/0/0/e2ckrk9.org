Would this anti-empathy (not sure what to call this) be directed towards all creatures, including other infernals? How would any sort of social hierarchy arise from this? I'm not sure civilization is necessary within a hellscape, but it would certainly lower the overall threat level of infernals if they're incapable of coordinating. This is what I'm stuck on, predicting what might arise from a large population of creatures with alien psychology in comparison to anything on Earth.

Also, what about morality? For simplicity's sake let's say human morality can be summed up by the golden rule. If demons treat others as they would like to be treated does that mean they're all a bunch of masochists (or, more correctly, creatures that enjoy all forms of suffering)? In which case, what is to deter them from dangerous or disadvantageous behavior, if not suffering?

Maybe I shouldn't be coming at the whole social side of this from an anthropological angle, and relating their behavior and communities to social arthropods would be more useful. I'm fairly sure there isn't a whole lot of empathy in that phylum, which might solve the problem of forming social structures when you can't rely on empathy or morality.

I could see infernals struggling, due to the addictive nature of pleasure they feel when causing suffering, with denying themselves immediate rewards to pursue long-term goals. This would explain why a group of beings with centuries/millennia of practice in the art of verbal manipulation hasn't taken over TLoTL.

More and more I'm thinking a God of Hell might be needed to answer some of these questions. Which makes me feel like I'm falling into the God of the gaps fallacy but then again we're talking about a supernatural realm so a God might not be the most irrational conclusion.
