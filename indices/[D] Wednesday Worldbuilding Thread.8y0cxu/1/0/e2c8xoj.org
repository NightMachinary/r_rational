Imagine infernals as feeling the opposite of empathy. This isn't /quite/ sadism, and would take some emotional mapping to get the full thrust of, but ...

- When they see someone in pain, they feel pleasure
- When they see someone sad, they feel happy
- When they see someone angry, they feel ... er, something. Love?

So basically, seeing a person having good feelings makes them feel bad in various ways, and seeing someone have bad feelings makes them feel good.

A natural consequence of this might be that they feel about The Land of the Living the same way that we might feel about Hell, or slavery, or the worst parts of the third world; it's a huge injustice that all right-thinking people know needs to be rectified, but that's not necessarily going to compel them to actually do anything about it. Demons and devils falling for the same scope sensitivity and time sensitivity as humans is, I think, interesting in its implications.
