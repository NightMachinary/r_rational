There is very little remaining land in the world and most societies reside on large ocean fleets. The first ships themselves may have originally been built on land but it has to be possible to expand the fleet without having to be on land. What is the maximum level of technology this fleet can maintain & what would its social structures look like/is this possible?

Some obvious things that come to mind:

- materials would have to consist mostly on things you can find in the shallower parts of the ocean floor & biological material (bones, fish leather,etc). Mining can be a pain depending on technology level

- power is a problem since in order to have electricity you need a conductor (which is hard to find) and have to extremely through with insulation (since there is so much water). Additionally coal/steam powered stuff need fire, which needs a source of fuel (possibly animal fat, but that is incredibly inefficient). Also having a fire on a ship is not generally a good idea if you have no easy way to rebuild.

- storms. They can avoid most of them by sailing in calmer places that are less likely to have storms. I guess they can mitigate storm damage slightly by spreading the ships out so they have earlier warning & aren't as likely to hit each other but I can't think of a good solution to this.
