The biggest ongoing resource problem you'll face will (ironically) be desalinating water for drinking and agriculture. Provided you can do that at scale you can grow plants hydroponically which solves most of your other critical resources problems up to wooden sailing ships. Though it'll be an engineering challenge to put together a boat on which a tree of desirable size for planks or masts can grow. At the very least your boats will have to be designed to deploy large tarps to collect rain as relying on the surface area of just the deck is unlikely to cut it.

I expect whale oil will make a return as fuel of choice. Presumably with so much more ocean there'll be more whales, and less people so it might even be sustainable.

Unless there's a better source (say shallows full of pre-apoalylse cities) It should in theory be posible to extract iron from blood. It'd be exceedingly inefficient by our standards so steel tools would probably be objects of extreme value but I doubt they'd ever become a lost technology.

Not sure how practical it would be but tall ships with live (possibly fruiting) trees for masts with the roots grown around the keel certainly has a visual style you could build a setting around IMO.
