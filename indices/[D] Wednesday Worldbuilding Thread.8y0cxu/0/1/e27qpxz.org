Could you do anything interesting with plant-based rafts?

I'd try to find some fast-growing woody shrub. Grow a bunch of it, harvest the shrubs, and then lash them together. If you're lucky, you might be able to build a self-sustaining "field" of the stuff that you could use to grow more woody plants.

Repeat, and you might be able to make flexible, self-sustaining "islands".

They'd be at risk during major storms, so you might not be able to use them for permanent habitation. But they'd be a neat way to get extra living space for between storms, or just somewhere to walk around.
