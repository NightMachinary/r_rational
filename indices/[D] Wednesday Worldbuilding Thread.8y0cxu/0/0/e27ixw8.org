If it's post-apocalyptic, it may be easier to recover metals from the ocean floor than it would be to mine anew.

Hopefully you can find a way to grow trees on your ships. Unsure of the chemistry/biology here (acquiring and maintaining nutrient-rich soil sounds hard), but in addition to wood you're going to need pretty reliable and plentiful sealant to be able to manufacture boats. Rubber trees might be able to do this?

An interesting social consequence is that it's a lot easier to sink a ship than it is to destroy a building. So terrorism/military strong-arming from violent factions is probably easier.
