Not to mention factions. If Hell is anything like earth, there's a good chance that those that do work together for mutual benefit might eventually form very large groups like villages and nations. At which point the most practical way of gaining more resources (humans to torture and/or land that is easier to manipulate TLoTL from) might be forming large collectives (which best cater to infernal needs) and fighting each other. It seems almost inevitable that intelligent beings with scarce resources would result in tribalism and interspecies warfare.

I wonder if it's possible for some sort of veganism or human rights activists to arise from the infernals. Even if it's not in their nature to care about the rights of humans, if they're intelligent enough they might still come up with some sort of moral system that includes other sapient beings (I suppose this might be even more plausible if you believe objective morality is a thing). Much like veganism or animal rights activists in human society this would probably still make up a small percentage of the overall infernal population.

Even if, unlike humans, there is no alternative source of sustenance for them, there may be more “humane” ways of causing suffering. Like only inflicting impermanent suffering then removing the human's memories of the torture (which could also prevent them from getting used up). Depending on what exactly suffering is (in a materialist sense) and how they are recognizing it as authentically human suffering, there may be ways to pursue artificial substitutes. I imagine this might work similar to the artificial blood from the True Blood series in which it is less satisfactory but more pragmatic. Perhaps these aren't even things that have to exist but simply be something like a technology/magic more progressive infernals are working towards.

It seems like there's a never-ending number of questions that need answering to create a rational interpretation of hell. Like explaining there existence/propagation, is it: a creator spawning them out of nothing, fallen angels, sexual reproduction, parthenogenesis, growing from some other organism, or humans in hell slowly becoming demons over long stretches of time/torture? This only gets uglier if angels and god get involved with the worlbuilding.
