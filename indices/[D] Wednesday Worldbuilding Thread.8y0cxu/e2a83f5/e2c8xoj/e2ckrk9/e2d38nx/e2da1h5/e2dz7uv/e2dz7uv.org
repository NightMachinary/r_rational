You need /so much more/ though to actually flesh out a society of infernals though. The notes on a possible infernal society assumes that the ratio of infernals to humans is high enough that humans are scarce, but the actual scarcity of humans isn't established, and needs to be before you can start building up a picture of first what it means to be an infernal in hell, and second, what it means to be human in hell.

There's also nothing noted in terms of what hell is actually /like/ as a region. If infernals need food, then they must have some way of getting it. The lazy worldbuilding method would be to just have it be Earth-like but reskinned, with red leaves on the trees, animals that drip with blood and have muscle but no skin, red skies, yellow clouds, or maybe just some generic horrors, but that /also/ seems a little bit too mundane for me, and not "rational" enough.

(Maybe hell has an ecosystem that's built on human suffering in some way? For example, we might imagine the designer of hell creating plants that feed on human blood, assuming that humans constantly regenerate blood in hell at a slow, steady rate. Those plants then form the bottom of the food chain, which gives neat knock-on effects like infernal farmers spreading a human apart so that they can be used most efficiently to "water" the crops (obviously in the framework we're using, this would be done using only the most used-up humans, those who were taken too far in the direction of insanity).

You could actually build up several different competing ecosystems, each of which produces or feeds on human suffering in a different way, which would in turn provide infernals with building blocks in their economy. Plants that grow from patches of human skin? Plants that feed off the screams of humans? Plants that respond to the psychic sensation of pain? Some of these would have to be constructed in such a way that they don't get short-circuited by technology, unless you /want/ the foundation of infernal meals to be plants that are grown with the assistance of screams played from a loudspeaker on a loop.)

We also haven't defined any of the actual /ideology/ of the infernals, nor the schisms that exist within their society, nor the range of preferences or beliefs that they actually have.

I can see infernals having very human-like sentiments toward the systems that their society has in place, lamenting the fact that so much human suffering is essentially getting left on the table, arguing over coordination problems, etc. Of course, an infernal doesn't want society to be well-organized and efficient for the sake of other infernals, it wants that for its /own/ sake, so maybe that ideological division is really just a class division between "Fuck you, I have mine" and "Fuck you, I want what you have".

Or maybe the ideological division is between the long-term and the short-term, which is probably /also/ a class division. If you're safe and secure, you have more leeway to think toward the far future. If you're just scraping by, filled with uncertainty, then you focus on the short term. Short-term thinkers seem wasteful to long-term thinkers, and long-term thinkers seem wasteful (or too extravagant) to short-term thinkers. You could throw some differences in risk aversion in there too, since that tends to be related.

Or maybe the ideological distinction mostly exists among the upper class with regard to the lower class, and is more a matter of strategic preference or a difference in interpretation of the internal motivations of the lower class. All infernals are imperfectly maximizing for themselves, but it might be possible for one infernal to believe that crushing force is what gives power while another infernal believes that maintaining a baseline of living gives power. I don't really see a reason that axes of human political thought couldn't be adapted, with some alterations. An infernal might legitimately believe that a rising tide lifts all boats, while another might view reality as being closer to zero sum.

But that's before asking even more basic questions like geography. If the dead outnumber the living, and infernals outnumber the dead, then either hell needs to be bigger than the Land of the Living, or it's very crowded. And we haven't touched on infernal lifecycles, whether they /can/ die, whether humans can die a second death, whether infernals have genders, whether there's a classical demon/devil split, etc.
