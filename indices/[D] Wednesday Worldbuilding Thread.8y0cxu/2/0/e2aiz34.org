I supposed I'd have to ask if the "extra brains" within the human torso are just enough to handle the problem of a human brain operating a larger-than-human body or if the human torso is essentially functioning as a skull in which case it can hold more brain mass that a horse skull.

I can certainly think of a number of downsides to this though, where what might have been a relatively inconsequential arrow to the human torso is now essentially a headshot (critical hit).
