The bigger your ocean society gets, the less land you'll have available. Every kilogram set afloat in the water will cause the water level to rise as if a liter of water had been added to the ocean. The mass of Manhattan has been estimated at around 100 million metric tons, which, if floated, would displace 100 million cubic meters of water. Of course, that's not much on the scale of Earth's oceans, only about enough to cause three ten-thousandths of a millimeter increase in the average ocean level. However, once we're talking about transforming the oceans into living space for an entire civilization, the issue of sea level rise could quickly become a problem.

You have four possible options. 1) Construct dikes around dry land and shallows, 2) Build upon piles, 3) Disregard land, use floating infrastructure, or 4) Trap a lot of the water above sea-level to lower the sea level.

Dikes are simple enough in concept. You just build them around your remaining land area to ignore a few meters of sea level rise. You can even extend these dikes out into the water and turn seabed into viable land. Obviously, the strength needs to be greater as you deal with greater pressures (deeper water), but at least in shallows you may achieve significant land gains at comparatively low cost. Note: You will need pumps to drain water, and you'll need to plan for water that flows under the dike and gradually rises up into your land from the soil beneath it. Power outages = floods. You will also need to gradually reinforce the dikes and build them up to accommodate gradual sea level rise. Storms should not be a problem if the dike is built properly.

Option 2 is also fairly simple, but would need to be done in shallows to be cost-effective, so this is not an overlapping strategy with option 1. You sink rebar-reinforced concrete piles into the bedrock beneath the seafloor and then build heavy cities and structures upon the piles. You'll only displace the volume of the piles, not the weight of the structures you build upon them, so sea-level rise will be minimized. This is also not a flood risk during a power outage, and storms should not be a problem if the structures are made properly. Nearby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_farm][wave farms]] could simultaneously generate energy and reduce the force of waves against the structures.

Option 3 is problematic. The more you build, the deeper the water gets, increasing the cost of accessing the seabed for resources. Flooding is a potential problem if your floating structures bump into each other and develop holes. Pumps will be needed to bilge out water on a regular basis, and prolonged loss of power will result in sunken ships. Storms could potentially flip the ships as well.

Option 4 is essentially a form of terraforming. Essentially, it would involve building massive dikes in climate zones where precipitation exceeds evaporation and minimizing evaporation, e.g. with floating reflective ping pong balls. The surrounding ocean would gradually evaporate and get trapped in the dike, causing the sea level to drop. Let's say our goal is average precipitation (about 1 meter per year), and about half of that in evaporation.

On Earth, if we built a circular dike with an area of 90 million square kilometers (25% of the ocean's surface area) and made it 200 meters tall (2/3rds as tall as the tallest dam in the world), it would need to be about 5,360 kilometers in radius, or about 16,800 kilometers long, around twice as long as the Great Wall of China. A huge project, but maybe feasible with international cooperation and many decades of construction. Built in the ocean on Earth right now, it would likely take about 400 years to drop mean sea levels by ~67 meters (~218 ft.). This would increase the land surface area of the Earth by about 21 million square kilometers, a little more than twice the land area of the United States. It would also serve as an immensely powerful hydroelectric dam, likely producing an average of 6.7 terawatts over the course of a year, or about 37% of the world's average power consumption in 2013.
