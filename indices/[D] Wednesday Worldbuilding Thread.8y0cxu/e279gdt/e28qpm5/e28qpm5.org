  What is the maximum level of technology this fleet can maintain
#+end_quote

/Maximum/ level? Are we allowed to assume that they started with potentially possible technologies that we haven't worked out yet?

Because things get a /lot/ easier for the Ship People if they've mastered matter-to-energy and energy-to-matter conversion, doubly so if energy-to-matter allows you to duplicate objects in the manner of a Star Trek replicator.

Even without that, though, mining minerals from seawater is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_mining][quite possible]] - including uranium, so using nuclear energy for power may be plausible. Mind you, it's not at all easy to do. The other option, given the possibility of submarines in the fleet, is of course [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining][underwater mining]] for minerals. And a bit of googling suggests that rubber made from kelp is not only plausible but has been done (or at least claimed) before, so the ocean can provide insulators.

For food, the people will have to eat fish and/or other seafood. A world-spanning ocean should be able to provide enough for a decent population; more once people figure out how to cultivate the ocean properly.

Wood would be incredibly rare and valuable. Metal would be kind of expensive but replaceable and maintainable.
