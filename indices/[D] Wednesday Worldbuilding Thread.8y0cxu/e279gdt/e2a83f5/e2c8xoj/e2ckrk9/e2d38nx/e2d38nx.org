As a baseline:

- Infernals have internal feelings that are much like humans, and responsive to many of the same things. They have biological needs that need to be filled, but suffer more psychologically than physically for not having them met. Without humans around, most of their sensations are rather muted.
- Toward humans, infernals are anti-empathic. Sensations and emotions are mapped against each other, and subject to many of the same scope and time sensitivities that humans have. This functions as a multiplier on their own internal feelings.
- Toward other infernals, infernals are mostly indifferent. They aren't incapable of rational cooperation, but they don't bond from it, have no friendships with each other, and feel no camaraderie, protectiveness, etc. except so far as it furthers their rational self-interest. It doesn't make an infernal happy to see another infernal happy.

And some other random assumptions:

- There are limits to how much pain and suffering a person can actually take. If you make life too miserable, the hedonic treadmill will take effect, returning them to baseline, or they'll simply adapt to their new, miserable existence.
- Similarly, there are limits to how much pain you can inflict on someone before they stop feeling it, and sensory satiety results in dulled sensations if there's too much repetition. There's also a point at which you can "break" someone, making them no longer very good for an infernal's use.
- Infernals have a good measure of the emotions and sensations that they're inflicting on others. In part, they've developed this because it allows them to get more from feeding off the emotions and sensations of humans, and in part, they were just built that way.
- Suffering can't be faked very effectively.
- It doesn't really matter that much whether humans are mortal or immortal, how quickly they can bounce back from being hurt, etc. It /does/ change assumptions about scarcity, which impacts infernal society, but that's part of demographics that we'll sweep aside for a bit. Eventually you'd need information like how many people die each day, where in the hell they go when they die, how large the population of humans in hell is, and how many infernals there are.
- Humans are weaker than infernals, not necessarily to the point of not being a threat, but to the point where a human uprising is effectively nothing that anyone would think of as possible.

From this, we can probably answer a few early questions:

- "Suffering" comes in a lot of flavors, all of which have some purpose to the infernals. An infernal doesn't make someone eat something disgusting because they're trying to be creative in the suffering that they inflict, they do it because they want to enhance the flavor of their own food. They want humans to be afraid so that they can feel brave. They want humans to feel pain so they can feel pleasure. All the variety of suffering, from the perspective of the infernals, serves some purpose, otherwise they wouldn't be doing any of it.
- Infernals /aren't/ suffering-maximizers. All they really want to maximize is their own pleasure, contentment, etc., all of which comes most efficiently at the expense of some human feeling the opposite. Psychologically, most infernals can't conceptualize and don't care about suffering on the large scale, or in far-away places, or far in the future, in the same way /people/ don't tend to, unless they're the infernal equivalent of effective altruists.
- Infernals care most about the suffering of those humans around them, which they can palpably feel. To this end, most infernals want as many humans immediately available to them as possible, all as ready for fruitful use as possible (i.e. not insensate or insane).
- Self-interest forms the basis for infernal civilization. Infernals might not actually care a priori about other infernals, but they /do/ care about what other infernals might be able to do to or for them. From this, infernals might come together for mutual defense, enslave each other, make trade, make war, etc.
- While the infernals might have an economy based around their needs and satisfying them, that's the agricultural/labor aspect of their economy. The other end of their economy is in the form of humans, which are graded, traded, and managed in order to get the most use out of them, again, out of self-interest rather than any actual maximizing.

Some notes on a possible infernal society:

- The underpinning for infernal society isn't mortality or empathy, it's a combination of raw power and game theory. Infernals pay their taxes because if they don't, someone is going to come along and injure, torture, or kill them (to whatever extent that's possible). Infernals cooperate with each other in the hopes that both will be able to reap the rewards. One infernal pledges service to another so that both might benefit. Trade takes place because both parties benefit from it. Laws are created for the good of those who can enforce them, and followed by those who don't want the hammer of the law to come down on them. Infernals don't internally care about status, they only care about it externally for what it signals about power. They don't care about keeping to a contract except for what will happen to them if they don't.
- For the lower classes, infernal society probably sucks. It might be a surveillance state, since the upper classes and governments (such as they are) can't trust people to act in their interests unless there are mechanisms of control. If the infernal/human ratio is high, then the lesser infernals only get access to burnt out, communal humans, or maybe they have to go to giant coliseums to see humans tortured there. Their food tastes bland without human disgust to go with it, they don't feel much happiness without human misery and depression, and overall, they're kept at just the right level that they won't try to revolt.
- The middle class infernal has a human or two, as well as a place to keep them. When they eat their meals, their human is there, being gorged on rotten fish eyes or bull semen, enough variety that the human can't be inured to it. Torture has to be rationed in order to be effective, but how good infernals are at that varies. A lot of the infernal's wealth goes toward their human, usually in the form of new experiences for them. Humans get swapped too, because any individual human gets old after a while, and if an infernal has particular tastes, it's easier to keep those tastes sated if you can rotate out a human.
- The upper class has lots of humans, all of them (paradoxically) well-cared for. This care is viewed by the infernals as sort of like how a southern belle on a slave plantation might turn a blind eye to the mistreatment of slaves because that's what keeps the finery flowing. When the upper class infernals have need of a human, they're going to get one that's not at all prepared for whatever misery is going to be afflicted. (This care is either done by infernals who are following incentives, or by humans who get mildly preferential treatment.)
