Hey, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit or the wrong day or whatever, but the question didn't seem worthy of its own [[/r/worldbuilding]] thread.

Let's say that we solve [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-truth-about-centaurs][this problem with centaurs]] by saying that the centaur is kept alive by the horse organs while the human torso is filled with extra brains to make up for the larger body size compared to a human. What would be the practical upshot of this, particularly in terms of how one might play as a race in a tabletop game?
