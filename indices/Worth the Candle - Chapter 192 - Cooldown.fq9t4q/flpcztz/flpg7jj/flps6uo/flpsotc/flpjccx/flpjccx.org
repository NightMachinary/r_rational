Man, I feel for Amy here. I think she ultimately made all the right plays against Hyacinth, but you can /feel/ the optimal path just out of view. At what point was this course irreversible? Could they have avoided killing Larkspur? Larkspur was after them from the start, this wasn't just a case of murderhoboing, but it still feels bad.

And then the one-two punch of Rosemallow. Just oof.
