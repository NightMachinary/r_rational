Going by which facts? We don't actually know anything about these peoples real motives and circumstances which is very much by design. It'd be entirely unsurprising that Amarilys getting pulled back into Anglysh politics was a play by Rosemallow for which Hyacinth served as a useful patsy and that from their perspective Onion's faction was always facing steep odds fighting both against world ending threats and a corrupt aristocracy on the verge of staging a coup.
