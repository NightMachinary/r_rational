And if the countermeasure is instead ented based, a trusted inspector , or an organization? These are all reasonable safety measures to take even at the price of curtailing one's own autonomy in a world where someone soul fucking the head of your conspiracy is a known thing. Kinda like murdering the diplomancer in the two year emperor.

In a past career I worked on nuclear power plants, and around strategic weapons. Part of making sure bad things don't happen is making sure you don't have single points of failure, if one thing fails you still have plans that work around it and procedures to bypass it, or alternate sources. Onion and the Aunt are almost single points of failure for their competing systems (As an aside I'm really looking forward to finding out what thier fundamental disagreement is or if the are just allusions to our own tribal politics hard power/soft power dichotomy) and Mary has shown us the while corrupt and a nest of vipers the lost kings court is a mostly competent bureaucracy, so I don't expect soul hacking someone would be much more effective than a humint source, those are very damaging but are also something that is actively worked against.

TLDR I think even if you make the modifications permanent Soulraping is too much of a known quantity for the lost kings court not to have active measures in place. They'd inevitably get caught. Besides from a general transhumanist perspective: it's mindcrime.
