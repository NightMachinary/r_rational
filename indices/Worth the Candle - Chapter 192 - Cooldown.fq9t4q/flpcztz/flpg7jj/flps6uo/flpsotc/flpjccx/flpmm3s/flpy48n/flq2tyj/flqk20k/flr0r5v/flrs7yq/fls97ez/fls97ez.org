I think you are correct about Anglecynne, but I don't think Rosemallow is short sighted. She is very long sighted. She is the opposite of Hyacinth because she only backstabs with careful consideration of the long term consequences, whereas Hyacinth does it over and over, trying to salvage the failure of the last betrayal with an even higher stakes betrayal. Fully giving up the reigns would be giving up the game, something that Rosemallow apparently believes would lead to disaster. She believes that rationally Amaryllis knows she is worth way more alive than dead. Knows that she can prove her (medium term) good intentions / behavior to this uber soul mage, and figures that Amaryllis is negotiating. Amaryllis says "the offer on the table is..." Rosemallow refuses, and makes a counter offer. Amaryllis responds by killing her. I think Rosemallow didn't take Amaryllis's emotions regarding her mother into account, because Amaryllis should be very logical and optimal like Rosemallow is, like Rosemallow trained her to be. So I suspect Rosemallow would have been the perfect ally, while very carefully building a lot of contingencies to betray them, that might or might not have ever been triggered.
