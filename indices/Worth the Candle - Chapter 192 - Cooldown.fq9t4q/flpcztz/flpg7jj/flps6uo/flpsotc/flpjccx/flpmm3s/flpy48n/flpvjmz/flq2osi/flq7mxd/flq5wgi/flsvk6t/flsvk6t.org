When Hyacinth first came into Bethel and threatened Amy, I thought the thing to do was to make her disappear. The kind of threats Hyacinth made were serious enough that it was prudent and right to just end her.

And darned if my thought did not turn out to be correct. Look how many lives would have been saved (probably).

But then the plot would have been short-circuited and there would be a lot less hand-wringing.
