Ah. Forgot about Zinnia confirming the timeline. Sending a message via earpiece does explain how that could work. I will concede that I was wrong and that at this point there was still a chance for a better outcome with Hyacinth. I do still think that using the meeting to set up such a possibility does still constitute an element of bad faith dealing.
