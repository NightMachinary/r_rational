I really don't think there was any other option.

The word "sociopath" gets used a lot in these kinds of story, but I think it's accurate here. Rosemallow was convinced she would never get caught, that she would never face consequences for her actions.

She kept thinking that /even after she got caught/ and Mary told her to her face "Accept our terms or we kill you".

Juniper had the right idea. If it had looked like she was cooperating (and it didn't), that'd just have meant she was preparing another backstab.
