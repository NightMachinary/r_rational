Larkspur is explicitly mentioned early on by the people trying to kill Amaryllis in the Risen Lands, but they don't meet Larkspur until Chapter 38, immediately after going to Cranberry Bay. It's possible that a different path of action early on could have avoided him, or other quests could've come first, which could've changed the nature of the conflict. In Chapter 37, to address the Rat Rot and Soul Magic concern, they were also considering heading to Quills and Blood or Caledwich- Larkspur could've still tracked them down due to Doris Finch/the elf reserve, but maybe Caledwich would've meant standing for trial rather than getting into a firefight. Somethings would've gotten worse, others would've gotten better.

Furthermore, that's just for meeting him. There are a good dozen chapters between when they meet him and when they kill him, including the chapter where they come up with exclusion zones and potential quests. Because Juniper keeps pushing it off, I'm always curious as to what quests/storylines would've been in play if they'd done 'They Say You Can't Go Home Again' or 'Straddling Worlds' early since they were seemingly earlygame quests. Assuming rat rot and boneitis are constants, once Amaryllis' rat rot was cleared, there were a lot of chain of events that could've led to picking up soul magic. 43 is when they get a bunch of quests, including Kuum Doona. 57 is the start of the next major quest after Larkspur, breaking Fallatehr out, but breaking him out early would've changed things, let alone being able to come to a temporary agreement with him.

For the point of no return, I think handling the final conversation better (with empathy) would've helped, and even summoning the Cannibal someplace secluded might've actually been better for Joon and Mary. It's the little things that add up. More realistically, it was probably when Rosemallow killed Hyacinth's unborn child.
