It's not been confirmed that Spirit is immune to detection by Anolia abilities. The other poster already mentioned entads. But from a narrative perspective, there's no point to giving someone effectively unlimited resources and no social obstacles when we're maybe ~60% into the story. Just because no one we see knows about the magic doesn't mean that there aren't ways to defend against it just as a knock-on effect of defending against soul magic. Not to mention the host of torch-it-to-the-ground contingencies, ranging from treaties and allies to memes.

I personally don't feel that way with the unicorn bones, but someone else posted in this thread about how the unicorn bones are starting to feel like a constant bailout.
