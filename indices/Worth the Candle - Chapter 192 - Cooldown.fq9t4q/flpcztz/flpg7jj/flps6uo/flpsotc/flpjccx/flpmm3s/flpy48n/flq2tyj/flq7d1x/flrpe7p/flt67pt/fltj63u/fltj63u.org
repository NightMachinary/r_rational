After soul-searching and clearly finding out she murdered Mary's mother my guess is Rosemallow would never trust them not to eventually kill her after she's served her practical purpose and thus she would immediately start planning against them. It seems terribly unwise to have such a powerful opponent and let them prepare against yourself while fooling yourself that she has practical purpose.

Hyacinth didn't seem to be such a big threat in comparison and they couldn't have possibly known it would escalate in this manor so it makes sense not to outright kill her.
