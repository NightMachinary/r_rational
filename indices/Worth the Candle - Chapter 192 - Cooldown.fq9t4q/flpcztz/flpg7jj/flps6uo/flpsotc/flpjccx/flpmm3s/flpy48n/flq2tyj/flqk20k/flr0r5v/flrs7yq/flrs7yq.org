  Rosemallow is a schemer, but she's never actually acted against the party (not counting Mary's mother). She also has really good reason to be careful, and history of being cautious.

Her reaction to being told "Give up power, or we kill you" was to answer "Not going to do it, you need me too much".

I'm reminded of that Twig quote that goes "when you have an institution that's designed to breed cutthroats, every now and then you end up with someone who just can't stop cutting".

The pattern with the Penndraigs so far has been that they just can't stop themselves from backstabbing people, even when it's really damn clear it's going to get them killed.

Yarrow's reaction to being told by someone he knew had killed a kaiju (sitting next to one of Uther's knights) that they would kill him if he used his entad was to go "Meh, you don't go anywhere in life by listening to threats" and use the entad anyway.

I'm pretty sure if they'd let Rosemallow go, she would have been exactly the same. She would have kept pulling shortsighted, sociopathic grabs for power, no many matter how many times she got caught, no matter how much Joon threatened her, because in her mind /consequences are something that happens to other people/.
