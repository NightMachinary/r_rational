My guess is that it was the interaction where Hyacinth was begging June and Amy to say why they killed her husband.

Remember how June asked Amy why she played that interaction so cold and Amy only tried to “figure out her angle” never once imagining that her grief was real and that Hyacinth had no alternative motives
