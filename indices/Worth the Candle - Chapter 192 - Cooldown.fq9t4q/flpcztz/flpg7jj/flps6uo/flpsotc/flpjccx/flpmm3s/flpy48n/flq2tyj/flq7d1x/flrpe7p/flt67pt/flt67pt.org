I'm fairly certain this is the complete opposite of the real path the narrative hints at. I'm fairly certain the "optimal path" for all of Amaryllis quest required both her and Joon to be very different than how they are. The whole quest line seems built on the idea of long term investment in the characters within it, which Joon and Amaryllis are completely incapable of at this point.
