  The reason WHY she got Zone'd is probably the same reason Larkspur was trying to kill her;

From the perspective of someone else (like larkspur) there's no reason to think that Amaryllis is anything but totally loyal to Rosemallow (her substitute mother who trained her to be a political player). Sure she didn't stop her getting dropped into the exclusion zone, but she then almost immediately escaped, coincidentally picking up a bunch of powerful artifacts and allies in the process. If you don't know what Juniper is it seems like an obvious setup

So everything where she is trying to get away from Anglecynn can be read as the Rosemallow faction building up an independent powerbase outside the control of the normal Anglecynn political system. Which is a scary thing.
