Yeah. It traces back to Amaryllis feeling like she is being left behind by Joon and the gang back in the Time-Chamber pregnancy arc.

Right now Raven can give Joon similar protocols and opsecs that she developed owing to her experience with the Endless Library and Uther and being really old, Grak is becoming OP and is close to being the best in the world in what he does, Bethel is OP, Valencia is better at social stuff than her, and the Locus/Solace provide what anything is missing in between them.

Add to that what Amaryllis got for her virtue doesn't really help her in contribute something new to the party. It helps the narrative stay away from blah, blah, blah, politics and planning but those are her strong suit. She feels set aside. Its probably why she wasn't as excited as Joon expected her to be.
