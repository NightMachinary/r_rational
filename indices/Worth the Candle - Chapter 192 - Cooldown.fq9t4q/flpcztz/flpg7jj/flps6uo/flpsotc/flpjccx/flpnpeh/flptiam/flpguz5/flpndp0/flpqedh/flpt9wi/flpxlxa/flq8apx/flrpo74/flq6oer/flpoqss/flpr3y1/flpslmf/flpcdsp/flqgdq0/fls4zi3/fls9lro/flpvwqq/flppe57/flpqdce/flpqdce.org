In terms of the cannibal, I was a little let down that the solution was revealed in a sort heavy handed manner exactly as he showed up. As far as I know this had zero foreshadowing.

But that is a relatively minor gripe. i really like how the story implies the Dungeon Master lost control of the story, just as real dungeon masters do. The power up to Grak feels planned and story relevant. The power up to amaryllis feels a lot like the Dungeon Master apologizing to his PCs for letting his storylines get all garbaged up. Like he told his players "sorry this gaming session was an unrewarding shit show, here's a massively powerful buff to get rid of all this accumulated nonsense I've saddled you guys with in the story."

To me, the DM gets fleshed out as a character without even being on screen except for two chapters. Amazing writing
