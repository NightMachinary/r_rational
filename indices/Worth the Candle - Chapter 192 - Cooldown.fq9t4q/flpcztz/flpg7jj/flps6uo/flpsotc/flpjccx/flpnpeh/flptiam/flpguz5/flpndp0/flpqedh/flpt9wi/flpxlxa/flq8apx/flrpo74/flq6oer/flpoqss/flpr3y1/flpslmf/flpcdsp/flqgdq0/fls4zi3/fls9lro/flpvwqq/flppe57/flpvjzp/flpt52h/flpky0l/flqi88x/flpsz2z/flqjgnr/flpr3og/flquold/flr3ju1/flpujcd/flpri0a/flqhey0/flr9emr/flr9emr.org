I like the book so much even though it makes me reflect on myself a bit too much. It feels like too much people can relate to Juniper to such extent for self-insert. Whatever.

Love is whacking his head with a waraxe for the better future of Aerb.

Love is helping her hide the crime by mutilating her aunt's corpse and leave it with victims of an Actual Cannibal.

Strangest romance ever but I love every bit of it. Still ship Juniper with everyone and everything especially Bethel. 'Cause I could and I will.
