[[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dnp2ne/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_172176/f5zhygw/][A while back]], I thought Mary had taken to the bible because of endings and beginnings, alphas and omegas, but really biblical themes pervade the entire overarching narrative: creation, the problem of evil and allowance of suffering, the apocalypse, finding faith in an imperfect world, redemption, the promises of the one true God, and [possibly spoilery theory] a sacrifice of the son of "God", who also /is/ God. Where Mary's gone faithful (which is quite rational with theistic proof), Joon's taking the Ãœbermensch approach.

Joon continues his streak of either stomping his foes or getting stumped.

Stupid anagram: Maritally His Ms

'di era' means you, right?

edit: also oh my god, Arthur's basically the white whale and Joon might as well keep his one leg and be Ahab.
