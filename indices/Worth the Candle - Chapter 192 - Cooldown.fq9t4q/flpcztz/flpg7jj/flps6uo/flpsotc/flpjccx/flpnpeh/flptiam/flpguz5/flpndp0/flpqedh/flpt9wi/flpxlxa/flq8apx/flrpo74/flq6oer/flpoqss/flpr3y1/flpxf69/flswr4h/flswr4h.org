I wouldn't rely on that. He had plenty of people to kill below him, and he doesn't generally focus on targets. I suspect if Juniper simply tried to fly away, at some point the Cannibal would jump at him from below, or fall on him from above. Or just attack Joon after he lands.

But the bag does make him a lot weaker. I wasn't aware of this weakness.
