So here's a question I'd like to know the answer to. Did they manage to bottle Hyacinth?

Giving the information that she has to the Hells seems like it might instigate some problems down the line.

Given the situation it seems possible that at least one member of the Court wasn't caught in time either way, so I suppose knowledge of an Uther candidate is going to filter through to them and they definitely have the nuance to put two and two together with their own problems. It may turn out to be the best thing that Valencia went off with Bethal if they find themselves being observed.
