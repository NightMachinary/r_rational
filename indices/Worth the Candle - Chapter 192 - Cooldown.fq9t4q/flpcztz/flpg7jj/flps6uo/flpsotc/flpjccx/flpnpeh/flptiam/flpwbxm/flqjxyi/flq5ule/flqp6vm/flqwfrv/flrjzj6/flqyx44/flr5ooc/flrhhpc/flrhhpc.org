But again, that whole shtick about "one clone dies then all clone die" means that even as suicide bombers, they'd have to be completely synchronized. If one clone dies too earlier, the impact is significantly reduced. So realistically she can only use one suicide bomber and even then that will cut down on her political efforts until she can build up more clones again.
