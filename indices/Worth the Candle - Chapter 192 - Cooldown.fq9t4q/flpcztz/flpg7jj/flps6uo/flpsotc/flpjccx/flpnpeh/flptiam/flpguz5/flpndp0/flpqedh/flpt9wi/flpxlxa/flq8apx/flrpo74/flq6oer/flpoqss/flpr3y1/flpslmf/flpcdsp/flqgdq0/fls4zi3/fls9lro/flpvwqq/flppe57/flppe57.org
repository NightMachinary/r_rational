Often with an antagonist there is the question of what motivates them. Why are they opposed to the hero of the story, why do they do what they do? Sometimes the audience's ability to discern said motivations is of lesser or greater importance to an author, and will be made correspondingly more or less explicit to the reader through the narrative.

There is a common refrain, not just in writing but in social psychology, that "no one thinks of themselves as the villain in their own story," and many authors will take great care to abide by that axiom. Even if they never spell it out for the reader, they themselves will usually have a good handle on why their characters do the things they do.

So with that, let's talk about dearly departed (or is she?) Rosemallow. Firstly, I don't believe any rule of writing is ironclad (particularly not the one I've just articulated, which I don't believe to be true, anyway). My favourite novel of all time is /Blood Meridian,/ and Cormac McCarthy doesn't even give a damn about punctuation therein. With that context, I'm noting that what I type here is not a criticism, as such, but rather an observation.

Rosemallow appears to be utterly inhuman. She seems concerned only with power qua power. Her motivations are not only opaque to the reader but perhaps to herself. Maybe she no longer has actual motivations beyond the accumulation of influence, the security of her position, and the ability to hinder or harm her enemies. Mary put it better than I could, in 195, anyway:

  “You talk about that like it matters,” replied Amaryllis. “As though there were any policy you wouldn't budge on, any tenet of faith that represented a line that could not be crossed. As though you even had a coherent memeplex.”

Her entire life is bent to political machination, such that she comes across more machine than not. Reading her admitting to her crimes, and reading June seeing her murder an osentensible friend in Amy's mother for barely more reason than that the opportunity arose . . . was disconcerting. And fascinating. However, her lack of humanity, in a word, did simply make her less interesting than Hyacinth's more personal vendetta, at least to me.

I think, all said, I will be sad to see the back of the human cast of antagonists in Anglecynn and their maneuvering. Although that may be an almost ironic label to give Rosemallow and her ilk. I've found that throughout WTC all the most gripping conflicts have been those where June and fellows have been pit against other people in tense, dramatic stand-offs moreso than when he's up against some Tarrasque-esque force of nature.

Particularly Everett and co., Fireteam Blackheart, that fight against Raven, Fallatehr, or the recent string of all of Mary's relatives. Less so Mome Rath or the Cannibal, who, speaking of, did live up to the hype. He's been a narrative sword of Damocles since his introduction and he delivered in terms of raw power.

Anyway, I've now rambled on in a couple directions for far too long. Book 8 definitely delivered in terms of hyped climax from everything after Yarrow and Zinnia came on stage.
