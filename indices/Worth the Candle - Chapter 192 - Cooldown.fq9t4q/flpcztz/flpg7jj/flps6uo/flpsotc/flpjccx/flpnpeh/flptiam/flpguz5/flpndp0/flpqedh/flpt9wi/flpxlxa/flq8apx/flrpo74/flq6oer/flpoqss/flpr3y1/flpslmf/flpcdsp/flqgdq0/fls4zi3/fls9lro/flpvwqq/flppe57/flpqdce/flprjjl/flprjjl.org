Agreed that the paper bag thing came out of left field. In general, I have been half-thinking that Shia LaBeouf would not show up at all just because any method of defeating him would almost seem cheaply earned. There's also the issue that in a world that runs (for June anyway) as rather Harder fantasy (in terms of crunchy-ness) he's a very Soft monster, if you catch my drift, in that he simply operates 'by horror movie rules' and is basically unstoppable.

As to the DM, he's probably one of my favourite characters, but I imagine those chapters are a bitch to write. He gives me a sort of vaguely /The Seventh Seal/ vibe.
