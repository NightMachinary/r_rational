Paging [[/u/Memes_Of_Production][u/Memes_Of_Production]] aka "the harem guy"!

I told you it was the start of a fucked up pattern, and oh my god I can't wait to see this play out.

My bet is 90% of Joon's romantic progression with Amaryllis ONLY HAPPENS WITH DOOMED CLONES, so by the end of it their relationship is extremely one-sided and unbalanced. But you were also right, this is some crazy-ass Harem Bullshitâ„¢
