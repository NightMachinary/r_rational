The trick is to not care if your character lives or dies, only about an exciting story. If I can successfully provoke the DM into altering the fabric of the world to such an extreme degree, that's still a win, because the ramifications of that will end up being extremely cool. And more likely the DM will shy away from that sort of thing.
