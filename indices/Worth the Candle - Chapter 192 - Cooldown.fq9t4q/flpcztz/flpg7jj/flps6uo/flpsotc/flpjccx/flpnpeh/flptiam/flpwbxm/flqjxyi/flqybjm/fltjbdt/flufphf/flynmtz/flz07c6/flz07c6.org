Dunno, maybe, I wouldnt want to hurt the viability of WTC getting published so probably long after I have a hardback WTC. I've been reading WTC a lot lately and copyclans are a topic that fascinate me. In my experience you don't really get puerile material on copyclans or any of the fun forking type thing, without the story involving something skeezy regarding consent or autonomy, so I'm tempted to ignore, Mary's Zinda like origins (Zinda from The Causaul Angel) but I don't want to have to stalk errant mangaka's profiles on deviantart to find someone worth commissioning.
