I've commented above, but I think Mary finding her first crush was an anagram of June's has solidified her self perception as an purpose built artificial being. Her seeming embrace of determinist religious ideology when we know autonomy is one of her core values is her trying to deal with that. I'm going to have to go re-read the Causal Angel again but the parallels and contrasts, to a character there, who I think, grew up knowing their own purpose and that it was determined by their society instead of by an overgod they haven't met, might be interesting.
