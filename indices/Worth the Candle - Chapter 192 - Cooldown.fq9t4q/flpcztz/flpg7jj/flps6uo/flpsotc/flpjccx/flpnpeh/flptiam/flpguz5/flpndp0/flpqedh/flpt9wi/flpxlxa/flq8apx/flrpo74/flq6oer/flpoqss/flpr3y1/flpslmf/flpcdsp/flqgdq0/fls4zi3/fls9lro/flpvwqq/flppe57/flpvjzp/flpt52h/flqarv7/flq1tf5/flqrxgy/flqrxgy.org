Depends what you mean by romantic. They have a strong platonic partnership that has them relying on and trusting eachother implicitly without really remarking on it. But since Amy doesn't feel sexual feelings for him, and he isn't into it if she isn't (as we saw with the first clone). So its not likely to move in that direction
