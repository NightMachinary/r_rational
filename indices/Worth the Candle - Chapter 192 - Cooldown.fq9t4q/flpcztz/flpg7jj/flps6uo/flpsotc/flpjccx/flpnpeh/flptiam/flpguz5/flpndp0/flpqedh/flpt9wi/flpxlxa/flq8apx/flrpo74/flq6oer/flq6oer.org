Aww :) Wonderful.

Also Amaryllis totally modified herself to have more emotions. She's... different, now. In a way I both like narratively and in the prose. Warmer. Maybe it's not self-modification, maybe it's just unanticipated effects of recent events, but... She's not as cold and analytical to June as she has been. It's nice.

I also feel like June has made real progress on his issues, which is super nice. And kind of feels like the point of Aerb, on some grand level.
