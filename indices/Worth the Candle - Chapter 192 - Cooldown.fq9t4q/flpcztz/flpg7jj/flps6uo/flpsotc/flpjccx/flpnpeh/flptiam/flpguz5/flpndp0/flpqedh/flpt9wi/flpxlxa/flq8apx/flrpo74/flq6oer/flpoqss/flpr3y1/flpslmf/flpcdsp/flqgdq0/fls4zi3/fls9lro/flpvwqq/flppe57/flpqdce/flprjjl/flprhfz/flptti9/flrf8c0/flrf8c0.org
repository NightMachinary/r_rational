Yeah, I was really curious as to why Juniper didn't seem to mention that Shia is killed by the main character of the song, and detail the specific ways in which it happens. Even if it wasn't relevant to the actual Tabletop version of him, it could be nice false foreshadowing and led to Juniper trying and failing to Kidney Stab + Axe Beheading before switching to Paper Bag.
