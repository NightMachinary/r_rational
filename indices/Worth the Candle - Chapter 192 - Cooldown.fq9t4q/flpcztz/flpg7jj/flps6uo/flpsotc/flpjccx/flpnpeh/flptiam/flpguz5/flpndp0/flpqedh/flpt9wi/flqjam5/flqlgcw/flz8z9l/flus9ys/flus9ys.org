When Mary said her prayer when entering Anglicyn:

#+begin_quote
  “Lord, let me take this sinful world as it is, rather than as I would have it be. Amen.”
#+end_quote

I thought that the only proper answer was the one given by Arnaud Amalric:

#+begin_quote
  "Kill them all and let God sort them out."
#+end_quote

They still ended up doing that, anyway.
