Note: this is a four chapter batch, so there are three other chapters aside from the one linked above. Also, [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/473773/cooldown][you can read this on RoyalRoad as well,]] if that's your preference. Next set of chapters might be on the slower side: shelter-in-place order means that preschool is shut down, which means that I have about fifteen hours less per week that I can devote to writing.
