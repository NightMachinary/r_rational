Doesn't really matter to me, I just have a format that I follow. I do have a preference for RoyalRoad, for reasons outlined in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fc4uyj/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_185191/fj8jo1a/?context=3][this comment]]. But it doesn't matter that much. (I'd also probably have marked this as the end of Book VIII, as I know some people only catch up when there's a defined stopping point.)
