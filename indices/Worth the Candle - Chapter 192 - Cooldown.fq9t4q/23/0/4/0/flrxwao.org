It's a story, so the fact that a solution EXISTS to every problem is foreseeable. It's the finding and implementation of the solution that makes for good reading, especially in a rational work. If it looks like Deus Ex Machina, it's bad writing (not that this is DEM necessarily, another user pointed or that there is an actual game in real life that mentions the paper bag thing. It just isn't anywhere in the story before it is literally immediately pointed out and used as a solution)

For an example of dumpster garbage story telling, see the kingkiller chronicles, where the Marty Stu main character never encounters a problem he wasn't extensively trained for as a kid in his wandering circus troupe by a master at whatever task it is.
