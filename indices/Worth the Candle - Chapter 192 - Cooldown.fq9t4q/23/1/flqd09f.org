I read Rosemallow as almost a dark mirror of Amyrillis, or a warning. "This is the path you're trying to avoid." She comes across as inhuman, but it's easy to see how she could have gotten from a very Amyrillis like starting point to where she is. Also, we only ever see her when she's "in character," and inhuman imperturbability and coldbloodedness is part of her chosen act.
