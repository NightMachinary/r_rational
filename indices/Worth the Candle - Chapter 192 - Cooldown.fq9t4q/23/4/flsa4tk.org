I get what you're saying. It's both kind of disappointing, and kind of realistic and interesting, that the simplest answer turns out to be true: Rosemallow is just a narcissistic murderer.

I think in the end, her methodology /is/ her motivation.

Like Juniper says, her motivation is whatever it needs to be to appeal to her current disposable minions. She's just so dedicated to a vision of politics where ideology is what you use to move other people around, that she can't understand the concept of having an ideology herself.

That's why she could never work with Mary. That's why she couldn't understand her life was on the line at the end.
