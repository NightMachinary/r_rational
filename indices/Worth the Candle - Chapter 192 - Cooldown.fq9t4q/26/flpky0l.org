I'm very much a fan of the Beast. He adds a frantic panic to any scene that he's in that cuts through the politics and day to day into this desperate struggle to survive.

I think it's chapters are the closest to capturing the feeling of what living on Aerb during it's worst moments would be like for it's more normal inhabitants.

I do increasingly feel hesitant about Fel Seed though. Given the expectations that have been set so far, it seems like it's going to make for some fairly horrific reading.
