I really appreciate the how these antagonists develop over the chapters. And I keep thinking about how a SOC-based Juniper would fare getting through this (or if Val was with him), most likely avoiding CSLB altogether.

Something I have been thinking about though since the last set of chapters is how much impact getting essentialism early impacts Joon and after the fight with Onion, I wonder how a PHY-based Joon would fare instead.
