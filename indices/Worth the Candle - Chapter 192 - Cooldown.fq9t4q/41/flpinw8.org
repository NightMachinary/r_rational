Wow, what an ending to the book.

I'm worried about possible blowback from killing the dragon. Seems like the Draconic Confederacy won't take that easily and it might affect the Bluebeard quest.

Two big new companion abilities. We didn't see much of Grak's, but we already got a sneak-peak of Amaryllis's with Simaryllis.

Speaking of Grak, it felt like ages since we had had a scene with him. It was nice to finally have a conversation between him and Juniper.
