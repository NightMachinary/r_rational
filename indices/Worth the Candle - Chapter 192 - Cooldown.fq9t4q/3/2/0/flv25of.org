Yeah - if we have any more Anglecynn, I hope we get some more details about Rosemallow. She heavily influenced Mary, who has been our central POV into the political machinations of the Lost King's Court.

Was Mary raised by the worst spider to perceive the world as a spider? The text repeatedly implies that Mary is over-cynical, seeing everything as a calculated act of manipulation. How many moments of "is this just an act?", and then reflexive self-doubt "why am I thinking it's just an act?", have we had?

Hyacinth claims that Onion and Larkspur had straightforward, authentic relationships. There's very little "playing the game" in personal interactions that gets revealed in the Anglecynn chapters. She's growing warmer to Joon, and I wonder if that's going to extend to her remaining cousins, too.
