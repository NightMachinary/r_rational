I disagree. I think Hyacinth is fairly representative of reactionaries throughout History, because she doesn't generalize ethics. I think the defining line for her character was, "we never would have done what we did if we'd known what you were." The only thing that her side ever respected was power. They'd have tried to kidnap, mindfuck, and kill without remorse. Power is something that is used against the less powerful, and it's better to destroy everyone than give it up. The other side is evil because they're the the other side, and thus anything is acceptable to destroy them.

Her side was already grossly violating the rules well before the group went back to Anglecynn. Onion already was using trial by combat against other people before she was even born. Larkspur was making deals with Doris Finch, which the text seems to imply she knew about. Her side sent paramilitary agents after Amaryllis, and she never shows having the slightest second thoughts after she found out about this.
