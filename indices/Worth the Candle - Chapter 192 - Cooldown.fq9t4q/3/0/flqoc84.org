My read would be that she considered the first stages of their conflict to be part of the standard "game" that the nobles play. Which has implicit rules on how much it is okay to escalate.

But Onion escalated it by kidnapping Juniper et al, (which she either wasn't part of planning, and Onion did it because he's a sociopath who considers "the game" beneath him. Or she considers it acceptable to use violence agaisnt a nobles minions, not them directly).

After that, from her perspective, June and Amy escalated by moving from a legal battle to a trial by combat that killed Onion with a figleaf of legality. Then they poisoned her and Phlox to cement their power. (Again escalation outside the accepted bounds) So she responded with the only weapon she had that matched that level
