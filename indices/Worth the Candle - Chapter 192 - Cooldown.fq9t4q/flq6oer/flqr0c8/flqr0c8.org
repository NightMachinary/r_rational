  And kind of feels like the point of Aerb, on some grand level.

Yeah, going with the Aerb as therapy theory, my guess about the next step is how he deals with being in a position of power over others (while earlier arcs were him dealing with equals).

So far (with the guards and onion) he seems to have relished the power somewhat sadistically. Now that he has all the power of Anglecynn at his back, on top of his ridiculously powerful combination of magics, he has to start making decisions where he has all the power about how he'll treat people now.
