I don't think that schloss can apply to anything Earth / Juniper D&D group related, and the paper bag is definitely that.

Anyone who Googled the ACSLB rule-page (I did only because I honestly didn't believe it existed, it sounded like such a ridiculous premise for a campaign that I was sure Joon made it up) saw this coming as soon as Joon said he "had a potential solution", a long time ago.

Can't seem to find the chapter though, it was a throwaway comment so I can understand why people think the solution was too meta and came out of nowhere.
