Chapter 192: Cooldown

I don't know if it matters to you but the following two sentences were said about a 1000 words apart:

#+begin_quote
  It felt later than it was. The sun was still out.

  It felt late, given all the plotting and planning we'd done, the run-up to the fight, and the fight itself, but it was only around dinner time, and the light was still coming in strong.
#+end_quote

(in story, between those two sentences, Juniper/Amaryllis finished the second half of their conversation and then Juniper goes into the bottle where he sees Grak)

Chapter 193: Coda I

#+begin_quote
  Did Amaryllis avoid reporting in to the Host for reasons of necessity and duress? â€œThe nays have it,...
#+end_quote

Wouldn't that mean she lost the case?

#+begin_quote
  The only ones who know what might deal with him, the only ones who will try to stop him, the one ones who can.
#+end_quote

one ones -> only ones
