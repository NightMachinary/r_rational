Quite the conclusion to the book!

Juniper has been seriously injured on plenty of occasions and promptly restored by his leveling ability.

That said, aspects of the interaction between the soul and level ups have already been presented to us ("Boneitis" quest). And for symmetrical limbs he can copy from the other side. I wonder how that plays into his prosthetic. His soul will be the template used upon his next level. If the prosthetic is that great, maybe his soul shouldn't have the leg either.

As for the injury to Amaryllis, that was unprecedented. At a few points in the chapter Juniper did something deserving experience, but never enough to level. That doesn't apply to anyone else. A more enduring consequence.

Next: clones. As described, the clones wouldn't be able to use entad prosthetics. That might also be a constraint on the nature of the restoration/replacement, an argument for healing rather than any alternatives. Otherwise the clones couldn't make as many public appearances. On the other hand, the fact that clones can think and plan and write is hugely valuable in its own right in a rational(ist) story. Think of all the science.
