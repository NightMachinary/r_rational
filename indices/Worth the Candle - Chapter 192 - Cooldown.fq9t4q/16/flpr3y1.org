The Hells, I did not see that coming, awesome chapters and it seems like I'll have to start another reread.

I also think the age old question of "who's stronger: The Cannibal or Fel Seed?" became a bit clearer, while I really thought for a few seconds Joon might actually die and we'd see a hell arc the Cannibal is a bit weaker than I expected him to be, he can't fly and can be stilled by magic and while you can't kill a meme as we've learned with Finch, he can be stopped and kept in place even without the paper bag. So I think Fel Seed could just bury him in the magic he(/it?) has acquired over the years rendering Shia immovable and basically a prisoner.
