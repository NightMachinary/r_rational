  The conversation with Raven was very interesting

It has a lot of parallels to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26687037][the conversation we see between Juniper and Tiffany in flashback]] where she's talking about him taking Arthur's death as an excuse to be self destructive and lash out.

  “I worry that you,” she stopped and bit her lip, “I worry there's a part of you that's sinking into it. It's ... well, my uncle, he has a CCW license, and the way he talks about maybe having to use it one day it's like you know that he's just high on this fantasy of getting to shoot someone to death.”

  “You think I wanted Arthur to,” die, but I couldn't get the word out. The words were coming out monotone anyway, devoid of the anger that I should have been putting behind them.

  “No,” said Tiff. “No, no no no, it's, the thing I'm trying to say is that it's like you're waiting to show people how much you're hurt. And I get that. I want to scream at them too, to ask how they can just keep carrying on when he's,” dead, she couldn't say it either, “gone. And I know that I was this, interloper, I wasn't his best friend, I know it's harder for you.” She was quiet for a while as she blinked back a fresh round of tears. “I'm worried that you're hurting, and there's something alluring about the pain, because it's a righteous, meaningful pain. I,” another sigh and a deep, steadying breath, “don't want you to keep going down this dark path.”

But in that case he dismissed her as not understanding, but with Raven he's more open to it, which shows a degree of character development.

Good to see the companions noticing/calling him out on his behaviour. Interesting none made the connection to him manipulating his Spirit to remove pain that was discussed in the thread for the last set of chapters. Actually, did he ever tell them he did that?
