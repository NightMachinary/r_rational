God damn. I feel like I'm repeating myself every chapter release, but it blows me away how you consistently write such excellent chapters.

Cooldown: The conversation with Raven was very interesting. I don't think Juniper was in the wrong with his bloodthirstiness. I do like how Raven approached the conversation though. (Mostly. There is something to be said about her disrespecting his wishes for downtime, but I can understand why she wouldn't want it to fester.) Even if I don't think he did anything particularly wrong, it was worth talking about. I'm actually getting a little worried about Raven. I had wondered why she never put in the time to master a magic besides library magic, but to hear that she had and it had just been stripped from her is rough. I know loyalty is a bad metric and that she is an ell, but its also a little concerning how low her loyalty still is. I do think Juniper is making a genuine effort to connect with her, but most of the time it's just been a little off. That's the vibe I get.

I have less to say about Grak and Amaryllis. Juniper and Amaryllis continue to get along really well. It's interesting to see how they are meeting each other halfway. Juniper is putting more effort into being a better person and she is putting in the effort to be more empathetic and understanding. Good stuff. Grak is becoming scarily powerful. I'm not even sure how you'd counter him if you had too. (Short of something that's explicitly bs like Shia or a dragon.) A little worrying to see him question Juniper's sincerity these days. Its unfortunate that loyalty is always there in the background poisoning the well. In Grak's defense they almost certainly would have never become friends without it.

Coda I: Well. What a way to bait us before leading in to the upcoming horror. Honestly, I don't feel bad for Hyacinth. She brought every bad thing that happened to her on herself. Maybe there was an alternate path that would have prevented all of this, but I find it hard to believe. If she actually cared about Larkspur, then that path was ruined by him trying to actively hunt down and murder Amaryllis through brazenly illegal methods. Even worse they had abandoned Anglecynn with no plans to come back. Hyacinth actively dragged Amaryllis to Anglecynn then has the fucking gall to act like what happened is somehow their fault? Yarrow and Zinnia committed the greatest taboo on Aerb in an act of unprovoked aggression. Hells, Amaryllis tried to work out a deal with her. If Onion runs black sites like the one Juniper was put it is clear that he is just as guilty as the rest of them. I'd buy that he cares about his family, but it doesn't give him a pass for being so immoral. No. She gets some small amount of pity for the baby and that is it. If she hadn't been so brazenly self centered maybe she could have pulled her head out of her ass long enough to realize she is the architect of her own doom. (Not a knock on the writing, just my reasons why her guilt trip didn't work on me.)

And then Shia LaBeouf out of nowhere, but not actually because his existence was very cleverly reminded to the reader in the previous scene. Juniper handled him very well, its just a shame about the dragon who was also carefully foreshadowed. What a great way to end the chapter. The dread was palpable.

Coda II: I gotta say, the mental image of Shia with his arm buried in a gold dragon's eye was not one I expected to have today. Watching everyone pull out the big guns to fight him and seeing him just shrug it off was excellent. This story has a gift for engaging action scenes and its truly incredible how varied they can be. I'm surprised that the GM hasn't smacked down Juniper for unicorn bones yet. I know it is a limited resource, but its bailed him out of a lot of fights at this point. I'm expecting them to run out of bones, try and kill a unicorn for more then get it excluded. Either that or more opponents like Shia who have some ability to counter it.

Family: Damn. I liked Pallida. Rough for her to be gone so suddenly. (Of course she's not actually gone, but for the purposes of the time scales the story works with she is.) Not terribly emotional about Gemma for similar reasons that Juniper laid out. I think I covered my opinion on Hyacinth relatively well earlier. Good on them for killing Rosemallow. I'm worried about Amaryllis's emotional state, but Rosemallow always seemed like a dangerous ally. In retrospect meeting with her at all was a huge mistake from a loss of life perspective. From a personal power perspective I think this is probably one of the best possible outcomes for the group. Amaryllis's new virtue is bonkers. It is the perfect bonus for her and to some extent seems to be the DM accommodating the group's general distaste for politicking. I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here, and I wonder what tricks Blue in the Bottle has up his sleeve. (Assuming they still do that quest.) Probably some truly degenerate necromantic effects beyond even what we've already heard about him for it to be exclusion worthy.
