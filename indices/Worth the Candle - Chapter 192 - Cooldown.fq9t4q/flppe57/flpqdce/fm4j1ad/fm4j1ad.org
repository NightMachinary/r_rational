Someone else posted this, but Chapter 128 mentions that Juniper has a theoretical plan to deal with his own commhazard, and 130 does mention the bag over head solution: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fq9t4q/worth_the_candle_chapter_192_cooldown/flr2jtq/]]

So in addition to the out-of-universe explanation, there is something in the text that at least alludes to it.
