They do have some wicked punishments though, I imagine.

From a purely utilitarian standpoint, if it serves the purpose of maximizing utility then it is not evil. However, as far as I know just about no one seriously holds a purely utilitarian standpoint, and with good reason. The idea that one person's political power can be synonymous with utility also seems deeply, delusionally flawed. But I wonder if Rosemallow would even rationalize things to herself that way, by the end, or whether she didn't bother in her own head. As you said, she seemed in certain ways more device than person as a character.

For me, I love the scenes with standoffish, treacherous tension: the Fireteam Blackheart sequence, Everett's group, and Zinia and Yarrow. It's like conflict foreplay.
