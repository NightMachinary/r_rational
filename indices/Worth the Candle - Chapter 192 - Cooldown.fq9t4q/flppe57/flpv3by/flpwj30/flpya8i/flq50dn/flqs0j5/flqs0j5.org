Well, that's the choice - she didn't need to address her weaknesses at that point because she knew it was pointless. It's a weighing of the scale whether her competence, fingers in the pie, political vision and macro objectives are worth having a known conniving backstabber in the hotseat (Mary makes the case herself).

Narratively leaving her alive is just asking for it. But it's unfortunate that narrative heavily informs these decisions and things are aligned against them such that murder always seems like the simplest option (which then often turns out justified as the most pragmatic option). In a world sans DM fuckery, compromise is an endless bottle of bitter pills to swallow.
