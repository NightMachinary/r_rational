  At what point was this course irreversible?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure irreversible is the right term, but it's pretty clear that Hyacinth was truly grieving over Larkspur's death and wanted the simple truth about his death from Amyarillis in the Mirror Room ( Chapter 185). After A. refuses to acknowledge her part in it, H. leaves to sic Yarrow and Zinnia on Joon, Raven, and Pallida in the Prince's Room (Chapter 180).

Additionally, if Amyarillis and Joon had spoken earnestly after the trial (Chapter 193), somewhere private as she asked, perhaps Hyacinth wouldn't have unleashed ACSLB.
