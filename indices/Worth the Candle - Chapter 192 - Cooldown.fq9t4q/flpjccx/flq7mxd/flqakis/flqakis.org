I think you got your timeline wrong. Hyacinth sicked Zinnia and Yarrow on the group before ever stepping foot in the Mirror Room. When she left she found out that it had gone disastrously wrong which is why she rushed back in the room to make a hasty deal. It's also why she desperately argued to prevent Amaryllis leaving the room to find out what she had done. The whole "deal" fiasco was done in bad faith by her the entire time.

Also she was blatantly trying to lure them to a killzone where she would summon the Cannibal. Her emotions may have been genuine but she was trying to use them to manipulate Juniper and Amaryllis.
