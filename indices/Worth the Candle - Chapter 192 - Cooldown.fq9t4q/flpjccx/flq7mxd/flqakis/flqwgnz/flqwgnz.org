I'm pretty sure my timeline is correct. The text isn't chronological, it splits for a few chapters to show different perspectives. Plus things didn't go disastrously wrong for H, they went (almost) as planned.

While it works emotionally, there in Chapter 185:

" If Raven was here, now, walking into the Hotel Delzora, then when had the enemy action in the Prince's Room happened? It must have been during the meeting, but when? The obvious answer was that it had happened when Hyacinth had stepped out, or been precipitated by something she'd said to someone on the outside, but that meant that she'd made a contract in a hurry because they had been trying to kill Juniper in the other room"

Hyancinth's emotional state after the trial is similar to that in the Mirror Room. More bitter obviously, but I think there was still a chance at that point of straight dealing with her and avoiding the nuclear cannibal.
