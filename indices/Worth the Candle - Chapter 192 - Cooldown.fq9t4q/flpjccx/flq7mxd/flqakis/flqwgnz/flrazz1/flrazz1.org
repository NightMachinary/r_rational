I'm pretty sure framing a full scale magical fight in Uther's castle with a skent being released and Yarrow catatonic as things going almost right is a bit generous. I do admit that the quoted passage is some evidence for your interpretation. That said this was just a guess from Amaryllis after the fact and the timeline is never 100% confirmed. In the dumbest entad chapter the party waits five sentences before Yarrow/Zinnia show up. In the Mirror Room chapter: "Hyacinth arrived in the Mirror Room after not too much time had passed, late, but only fashionably so." This to me indicates Yarrow/Zinnia were already in the room with Juniper's group before Hyacinth ever entered the Mirror Room. To my mind Hyacinth never really cared about making a deal and the whole thing was just a pretense to soulfuck the party and turn them on Amaryllis while she was away from them. She just wanted a confession so she could feel better about all the aggression she was about to unleash on Amaryllis.
