That's an understandable interpretation. That said, this story has a history of unreliable narration so I'm not going to place too much stock in Amaryllis's immediate guess about what happened when she still wasn't even sure what had happened. I actually agree that Team Juniper made a disastrous mistake. I just disagree about when and where it happened. I think Hyacinth had this image in her head of them all being patsies of Rosemallow and treated them as such. It's why when Amaryllis appeared to accept her deal it caught her off guard as much as it did. Then when the party went and met with Rosemallow it to Hyacinth confirmed all the awful assumptions she had about them. At that point she decided to go full hostile and created a meeting in bad faith because in her opinion Team Juniper were already bad faith actors as well.

With all that said, I still think Hyacinth is a self centered fool. Her life would have been so much easier and better if she had never intentionally dragged the party back into a country they wanted nothing to do with. I don't have much pity for her even if she had some misguided ideas about what kind of people she was dealing with.
