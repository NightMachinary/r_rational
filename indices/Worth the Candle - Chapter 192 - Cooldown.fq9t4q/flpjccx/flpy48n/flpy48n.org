The optimal path against Hyacinth was assassinating her long ago. She had gone after them so many times with absolutely no provocation on their part, sicked dragons on them, ambushed a peace negotiation, plotted to have them kidnapped, tortured, soul screwed. There was no possible basis to work with her, and leaving her alive was leaving a dagger at their back -- a Surprise dagger as it turned out (a capability they knew she had). After fighting so long to keep Hyacinth alive for no real benefit, and massive downsides, Amaryllis suddenly kills Rosemallow despite it being much more practical for Rosemallow to stay alive and help them. I'm really not sure what that's supposed to mean about Amaryllis's character growth. Did she learn her lesson from Hyacinth? Does she just love her mom a lot more than she lets on to herself?
