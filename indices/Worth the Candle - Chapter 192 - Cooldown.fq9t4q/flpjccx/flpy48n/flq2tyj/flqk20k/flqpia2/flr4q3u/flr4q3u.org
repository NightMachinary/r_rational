It seems Hyacinth was following her faction course: it's the next logical escalation step after a chain of kidnapping & soulfucking facilitated by deploying an indescriminate death effect, deploying the greatest swords-mas in the world and him getting destroyed, and the relative decapitation of the faction and its future leadership (the most direct line candidate being aborted cements Mary's line's power).

I do think Mary was making a good play recommending counseling and i don't see much better rotes, assassinating Hyacinth was more pragmatic, but there are enough slippery slopes already in play.
