Except Zinnia did the exact same thing just a few days ago with that death-duplicating creature that she released. June was punished in that instance for hesitating to resort to violence immediately, and then they were punished again with Hyacinth. By the rule of three, Rosemallow presented the exact same situation but this time the lesson was learned and the GM rewarded them for it. They learned whatever lesson the GM wanted them to learn, but I wouldn't be surprised if the GM then stabs them in the back during the next adventure for doing the exact same thing.
