Rosemallow was inherently untrustworthy. Her background machinations helped escalate the conflict far beyond what the party was comfortable with and is the reason Hyacinth went off the deep end. Killing her was the smartest play considering Rosemallow murdered Amaryllis's mother who was her ally at the time.

That said I do agree that they should have assassinated Hyacinth. For all the moralizing certain members of the party did about Juniper's bloodthirstiness, it turned out one strategic murder would have saved a lot more lives. Though to be fair thats only easy to see in hindsight. I think considering the knowledge they had they made the best decisions they could.
