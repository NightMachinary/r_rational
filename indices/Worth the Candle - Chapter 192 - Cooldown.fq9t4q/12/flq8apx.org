I'm just sitting around and wondering how much Rosemallow influenced the story.

We had Amaryllis get Zone'd in a rushed trial for nonserious crimes, at which point everyone sent to deal with her dies and she starts popping up all over the place.

The reason WHY she got Zone'd is probably the same reason Larkspur was trying to kill her; Rosemallow. As she was raised as Uther's direct descendant by Rosemallow with hilarious inherited power, wealth and directed education she was intended to be an extremely useful tool to change Anglecynn.

With limited information (and poor memory) we have the Phlox/Onion faction doing these things to oppose Rosemallow. Joining the Host, talking to Larkspur, Hyacinth or Onion would've potentially led to different routes.

Then Juniper and company blunder into Anglecynn, cozy up with Rosemallow kill Onion and accidentally drop a dragon on the seat of government. Valencia, if applied, would've been able to diplomance. Instead Amaryllis went and found out her mom sucked.

TLDR; Rosemallow won because she killed Amaryllis's mom, she lost because she raised Amaryllis.
