I think the thing is he becomes immune to anything you do to stop him. So it will work, for just long enough to have hope, then stop working to crush that hope. Even unicorn bones time loop stopped working on him. Maybe the antimeme bones would have too, but we hopefully won't find out. So I think Fel Seed's power would prove useless against the Actual Cannibal (unless he is Uther and knows the trick). I guess maybe Shia would keep eating Fel Seed's limbs, but never killing him because he can grow them back instantly. Except of course the DM would totally keep the players from cheesing the final boss, because Joon is that kind of DM.
