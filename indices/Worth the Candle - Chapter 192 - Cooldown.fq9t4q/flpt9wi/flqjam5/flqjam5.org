I don't know how planned an anagram like that was, but we really should've seen all these religious undertones coming back when she became the Virgin Mary.

It would not surprise me in the slightest if Joon kept his one leg, at least for a while. He seemed very confident that Solace would fix them up "better than before" - just like she did for Grak, but Druidism doesn't always work on proven certainties.

Not to mention that she /already/ fixed the missing bones in his leg just a short while ago, and both she and the Locus are going through shit.
