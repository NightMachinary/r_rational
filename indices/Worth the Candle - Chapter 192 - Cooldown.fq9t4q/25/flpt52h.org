These chapters were a lot of fun especially in how some of the foreshadowing paid off (the big fight). I was just as surprised as juniper at the dragon appearing.

I'm disappointed in the interactions between amaryllis and Juniper except probably the end of Family. It felt like there was very little romantic tension between them. Also there were a couple points where it looked like Mary was disappointed in Juniper, especially after the court battle and the actual battle.

Did anyone else feel this way?
