Never heard of Causal Angel before, is it good? IIRC /Paradise Lost/ and lots of biblical exegeses also dealt with the dilemma of free will given an omniscient overgod. It's sobering to wonder how much learning about the existence of the DM (and of course, Joon) has changed Mary's trajectory in life - I definitely wouldn't have pegged her as the religious type before the backpack. Maybe she's just hamming it up for the divine voyeur?
