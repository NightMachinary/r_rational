We don't know if a prompt supercriticality event on Erb is physics or magic. In more general we don't really have any discussion of the "Physics plus" of Erb, but we have seen a lot to suggest that it's a computer simulation and on the game layer it's jankey enough that we might think the physics simulation isn't simulating down to fundamental forces on subatomic particles.

I'm still wondering why we've seen only one magic system (soul magic) that was partially excluded, I think there's something significant about how erb works or essentialism works that this one piece of magic is essential enough that pieces of it get excluded but not the soul of it.
