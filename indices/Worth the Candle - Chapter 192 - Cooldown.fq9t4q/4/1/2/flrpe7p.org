  Does she just love her mom a lot more than she lets on to herself?

I'm going with this. Also, one could read Rosemallow's memories leading up to hiring the poisoner as the justification, and ... it almost sounds like their point of disagreement was on how to raise Amaryllis/her mother not wanting to be separated from her. So symmetrically, her mother may have loved Amaryllis more than she admitted to herself as well.
