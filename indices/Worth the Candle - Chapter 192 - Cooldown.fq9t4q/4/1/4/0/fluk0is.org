I mean Hyacinth might not seem like a threat because she's failed so far, but when someone repeatedly tries to kill you, backstabs you during negotiations, and is generally utterly untrustable, you know its going to end poorly. They totally could have anticipated the Cannibal. They knew he was narratively likely to show up eventually, and they knew she had that capability (and the lost kings court is generally the primary risk factor for Shia Surprises). Sure they wouldn't expect her to sacrifice herself, but it was definitely a possibility, and it was a given that she would escalate, likely using some unknown and terrifying capability (like that snake bomb monster dropped on them in ambush that no one but Raven even knew existed, and could have killed them with no warning or defense).
