Rosemallow was the one who deserved the suspicion and attention, she was effectively Amaryllis's mother (by killing her mom) and raised her to be an effective tool in politics.

Having reached a point where Rosemallow says pretty clearly "yeah I'm staging the 2nd Reformation and you're the tool for the job!" along with "oh yeah I killed your mother, our political rivals and also spent immense effort to arranging everything" you kinda have to stab the mastermind before they do mastermind things.

Amaryllis got clowned on when Rosemallow said to her face "lol im not retiring you dumbass, i'm your mother (cuz i killed her) and you need me!" and then Amaryllis killed her. Either they kill Rosemallow or surrender the kingdom to Rosemallow the entrenched operative who thinks she's too valuable to kill.
