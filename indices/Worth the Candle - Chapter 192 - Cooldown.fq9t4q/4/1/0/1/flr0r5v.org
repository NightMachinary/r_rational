Oh, I agree about killing Rosemallow, but they could have probably left her in position, learned her secrets, and tied up Anglecynne in a bow, their supposed goal. That was never an reasonable option with Hyacinth. Rosemallow is a schemer, but she's never actually acted against the party (not counting Mary's mother). She also has really good reason to be careful, and history of being cautious. As for Hyacinth, I've been advocating her for murderhoboing for a while -- it was clear that going in to negotiate with her was never going to work out.
