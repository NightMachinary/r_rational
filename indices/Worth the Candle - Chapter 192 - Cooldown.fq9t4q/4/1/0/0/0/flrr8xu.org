Especially since they had critical information missing.

From their perspective, Onion agreed to a trial by combat, and died after trying to kill them. He knew the risks when he went in; Hyacinth would have known that, and wouldn't have killed herself over it (even if she hated Mary and Joon for the rest of her life).

What pushed her over the edge was her unborn child being killed. She told them about it, but Mary and Joon didn't take it seriously because /they're not the ones who did it/, and it just didn't occur to them that someone else could have poisoned Hyacinth until it was too late.

From their perspective, they played completely fair, and they won. From Hyacinth's perspective, they killed her unborn child out of sheer pettiness after killing everyone else she cared about.
