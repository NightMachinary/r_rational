Did this happen? The only scene I can recall is in the mirror room chapter when Hyacinth demands that Amaryllis confess to murdering Larkspur and Juniper wasn't there. Obviously even if Hyacinth had no ulterior motives confessing would be lunacy. Especially since Hyacinth was arguing in bad faith and her people were attacking Juniper as she had this conversation. She even rushed a deal so that Amaryllis couldn't figure out what she had done before making it. I'm pretty sure they were already past the point of no return with Hyacinth the moment she sicked the dragons on them.
