I can't discount an actual in-story character's framing of the timeline in favor of counting sentences. That's not how fiction works for me. To me, the author is literally telling the reader in case it wasn't clear from the H's actions.

It's possible that Hyacinth is pure evil and Team Juniper didn't err in handling her. I think the evidence favors another side, but regardless, as long as it's unclear, I find Evil Hyacinth and Good Team Juniper a more boring story than one in which Team Juniper made a terrible, disastrous mistake.
