I think you're giving Hyacinth too much credit for meaningfully playing her own game here. Based on what we've seen in this update, it really seems like what we saw throughout the story from her was Hyacinth as manipulated by Rosemallow, as a member of Onion's (and Larkspur's) faction. She seems less like a pointlessly adversarial bitch and more like someone completely out of her depth. Not that she was a nice person, but I feel some amount of sympathy for her.

As people have pointed out already elsewhere in the thread, our views on Anglecynn's nobles come mostly through Amyrillis, who sees them all more or less as Rosemallow. And while there certainly seems to be truth in that perspective, Onion and Hyacinth at least seem to have been very much not that way. Being full time Machiavellian doesn't actually come naturally to (most) people. Our view on the lost king's court has been pretty one dimensional, until now, and now that we've seen the humanity in the den of vipers, I'm almost sad we probably won't see much more of them.

That said, I'm still 100% with Juniper. You can't take fighting a man named Onion seriously.
