The only hint we've gotten, I believe is from the Librarian herself in Book One Chapter 49

  “Because,” said the Librarian, “I am not a demon.”

  Dizzy seemed to buckle, the words causing her discomfort. “Then what are you?”

  To Davo, the Librarian seemed to shrink. “I am a failure. I failed to protect those in my charge. I lost everything to a world full of pettiness and greed, of small minds and narrow thought. And yet it was enough to defeat me.” Her sadness grew to fill the small dome they were in.

  “You work for them,” said Dizzy. “You are one of them.”

  “Yes, and no. I am nothing like them. This body is real. Once it is destroyed, so am I. I would appreciate if you didn't try to break it again. The repairs are exhausting. The only magic I can affect comes from these.” She held up the small box again. The gem glinted. “Without it, I am no more powerful than you.”

So someone whose cause was defeated in the past, not a mage (or at least not a conventional one since non demon magic has already essentially been confirmed), and someone with a tenuous connection to the demons. This points to her ACTUALLY being Davo in a trenchcoat standing on Fanny's shoulders.
