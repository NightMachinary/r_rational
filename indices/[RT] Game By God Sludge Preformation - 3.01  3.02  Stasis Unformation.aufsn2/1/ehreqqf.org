Some days since this appears to have ended, my remaining lingering feeling is regret that I never had a opportunity to try to deduce a Sludging culprit in this fiction.

That and playful Vned thoughts: "Wouldn't it make more sense to let each of them out as soon as they could telepathically ask to? And wouldn't that allow the also-fun outcome of someone finally, much much longer than anyone had ever endured that experience for, asking about her and the organisation finally realising that she was still in there?"
