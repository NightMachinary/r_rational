One of the things that makes this story so interesting, is how it constantly shrugs off expectations and makes 90 degree turns that while unexpected are interesting. It would not surprise me if this is the end, but I think it's more likely that this is another twist. Of course, there's also the possibility that this entire story is just an attempt at the Author to troll readers, and thus the abrupt end.

It would make sense in the course of the story, it does explain the multiple Chekhov's guns and even perhaps the intense emotional backstories attributed to some of the characters. Considering the dramatic shifts in tone and POV though, I think it's equally likely that the last couple of chapters were day dreams by one of the main characters.

I guess we will have to wait and see. We should have an answer in a few hours.
