And the sasapariller strikes again!

Gotta say, I didn't realize it was Haley's perspective till the end since I was using firefox's reading mode. I thought for a second it was Sean who had revived like Jesus. At this point the story still makes sense, Aslan's used his giant pivot to kill Sean, but the narrator-switching shenanigans ensured that it wasn't his victory even after. I wonder whether Aslan even knows if that kind of thing is possible.

This is the longest arc of the story so far, and it seems to be coming to a head; I'm excited to see how the author will handle this. For truly rational story shenanigans, he would only use mechanics that are known to us - this pretty much necessitates that Sean be revived at the stone tablet.
