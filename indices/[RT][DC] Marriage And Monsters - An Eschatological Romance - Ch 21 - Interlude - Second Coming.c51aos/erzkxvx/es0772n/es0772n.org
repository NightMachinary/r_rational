Well, again, there are about 37 different ways to revive the dead or prevent death in Pathfinder, and we know that Haley has a munchkin's Pathfinder ruleset, so Sean's death doesn't really have weight with me. There are so many ways to reverse or avoid it. I think this is supported by the "I'd rather live forever with you" angle because that's entirely possible with the power Haley now has.

Though narratively it also makes sense that he would be revived at the tablet. I actually thought that would happen anyway and that he would hijack Aslan's resurrection, but I guess not.
