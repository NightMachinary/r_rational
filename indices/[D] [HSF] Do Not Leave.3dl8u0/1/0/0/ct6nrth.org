From your Wikipedia links: let's assume an inner bound of the Oort cloud at 2000 AU. Further, let's assume that this boundary is the bubble about which the hypothetical aliens are concerned.

An AU is 1.5x10^{8} km, and New Horizons (our fastest probe) is happens to be slowing asymptotically to 15 km/s. So it will travels an AU once every 10^{7} seconds: About 2800 hours, or 120 days. 1962 AU - subtracting the 38 AU New Horizons has already traveled - would schedule arrival at the Oort cloud in about 620 years.

Unfortunately, Voyager 1 is our current speediest probe at 17 km/s, and it has a substantial head start. It's currently 132 AU from the sun, and it's faster speed means it will arrive at the interior of the Oort cloud in only 520 years.

So even if we believe this is not a hoax, /and/ we trust that aliens are telling the truth... no big rush. 520 years ago was 1495.
