This sounds like the start of a beautiful tale about rowing and fighting the power. Please go on.

But seriously, I think that we've already got /some/ probes past the Oort Cloud, so either it's a matter of time, or a hoax.

If it's a matter of time, we should work on trying to improve our technology as swiftly and soundly as possible. Whoever's waiting outside the Oort Cloud /needs/ to get several kinds of giga-drill to the face when they decide to walk into /our/ motherfucking Solar System.
