Protective implies that they're protecting /us/. If the entities doing the protecting and detecting are different - right of intelligent species vs search-and-destroy pest exterminators - then it is, if not likely, at least plausible.

Protective, for example, could just mean that there's a cloak which hides the presence of life on our planet which can modify EM radiation but not physical objects, and artificial objects that pass it would thus be likely to be detected by the exterminators, after which backtracking and probably subsequent extermination would be trivial.
