The rational thing to do is assume that it's a hoax. Most of the efforts involved with this message should be in trying to figure out how someone on Earth would have managed it. Even if they can't figure it out, the rational thing is probably /still/ to assume that it's not legitimate, just on balance of probability. If I see someone vanish a coin before my eyes, I assume that it's a trick, not I'm witnessing magic.

That aside, step two is to gather more data. That means another mission to Pluto, which means another decade and a half for construction, launch, and transit. That's assuming you could get the project green-lit at all, which probably wouldn't happen unless searching for the signal again was part of some bigger mission.

The thing is, we've already sent out some things that are going to pass through the Oort cloud given enough time. We can't exactly send a recall signal to them. If our second mission to Pluto confirms that it's not a (conventional) hoax and there's not further information waiting for us there, then our only real option is to make some new probes that can race ahead of the Voyager and Pioneer probes and bring them back home, /or/ start improving technology as swiftly as possible so we might be able to mount a defense against whatever's out there.

But I doubt that it would change anything at all, in the day-to-day, given the timespans involved with the probes.
