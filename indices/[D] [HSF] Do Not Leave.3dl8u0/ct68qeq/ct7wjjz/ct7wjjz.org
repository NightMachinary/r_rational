Edit see [[/u/pleasedofthenerdful]] 's comment: see +I read this year or last that Voyager or another of the probes passed out far enough that it saw other partical currents exceed the magnitude of the solar wind: effectively that it was now in interstellar space. here it is it's [[http://www.wired.com/2013/09/voyager-left-solar-system/][wired]] which is high on conclusions low on data highs noise to signal ratio for a rational Mind, but good to look at to find what data might be interesting to investigate.+
