I really, really, really like this premise. I'm a big fan of lovecraftian style outer horror aliens, like in Blindsight.

Assuming your second probe gets there and the beacon is legitimately alien, then in the long term you'd have to send out new probes to catch up with the old probes and grab them, but space is pretty huge, you'd have some time.
