While [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program][Voyager I has entered interstellar space]], it has not yet exited the Oort Cloud, which is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud][mindnumbingly huge]]. However, I don't think we have the means to prevent it from eventually exiting at this point, as it's travelling 10 miles/second relative to the Sun and out of reaction mass/delta-v.
