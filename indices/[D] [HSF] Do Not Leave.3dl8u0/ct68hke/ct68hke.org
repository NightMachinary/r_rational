Step one: check for hacks, bugs, and other errors that would cause this message to appear /without/ it being sent by a beacon on Pluto. I assume this is possible.

Step two: Attempt to crash New Horizons into a comet or meteor, and probably fail.

Step three: Whether or not it crashes into the cloud, immediately fast-track development of another probe bound for Pluto, to investigate the beacon. Keep in mind that it took nearly 10 years to reach it last time.
