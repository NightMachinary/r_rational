I think that, as stated near the end of the story, Quirrell has a blind spot in his rationality regarding altruistic motivations. So he probably couldn't conceive Harry intentionally handicapping himself in order to help Draco in a way that doesn't strictly help Harry.

EDIT: Or not. The other comment seems to disprove this.
