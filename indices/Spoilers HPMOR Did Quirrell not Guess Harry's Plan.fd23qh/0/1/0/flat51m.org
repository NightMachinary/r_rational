The /actual/ lesson would not have been "wait for divine intervention," but rather "notice when you cannot win the immediate conflict and at least pretend to lose." This is not something Harry ever /really/ learns, because Quirrelmort doesn't understand how someone like Harry operates.

If he CAN save them, he WILL.
