This would be in the real world so no magic. It effects your ability to solve problems. Bacteria doesn't count, though I think killing things wouldn't be too hard. You could probably get to a pretty good level by killing animals in Africa. I don't have any clear numbers in my head but if I had to come up with a timeline I'd say you could train to the limits of human ability in under a year and after that it starts getting much harder.
