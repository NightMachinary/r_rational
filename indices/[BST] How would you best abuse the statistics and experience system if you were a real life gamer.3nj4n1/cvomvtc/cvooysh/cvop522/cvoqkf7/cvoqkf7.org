Grey area, which means exploits! If I had to give a hard rule I'd say paying people to kill for you does not work but killing with anything you own would work (sentry guns, drones etc) but another person piloting said drone will not work and you have to setup the sentry gun, trap etc yourself. Has to be owned and if it's operated has to be operated by you. Anything that layers deep like you giving an order to kill someone would not work.
