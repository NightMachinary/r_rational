Take a tour of duty as a Missile Drone Pilot. Your job is to push the button that fires rockets into pre-approved targets from behind the safety of a desk. Or just work at the abattoir. If possible one that deals with exotic meats (did you know you can order crocodile off the internet?)

Might I suggest scaling XP to the difficulty and risk required to do the thing? That way your MC will naturally be pulled towards greater and more ridiculous challenges (so long as she's not just manufacturing difficulty that is by doing the whole thing blindfolded).
