What I mean is: a gun is the type of technology that exchanges "skill required to use" for "skill required to create." You can take that further and end up with a doomsday weapon designed by a scientist (i.e. a nuclear bomb) where you only have to push a button and it'll kill a bunch of things for you.

Or, one step further than that, you can create an /AI/ that kills things for you, without pressing any buttons at all. A sentry gun, for example. (In D&D parlance, this would be a /trap/. I don't /think/ trap-kills traditionally earn XP for their creators... but I'm pretty sure the hunting-and-trapping kind of traps executed by parties usually /do/. Confusing, that.)

Or you could, you know, just hire henchmen to guard an area and kill tresspassers, which is effectively the same as a sentry gun. Or is it?

You could take your sentry gun and stick it on some sort of drone, or maybe a very dumb animal. Who earns XP then? It's going off and satisfying your goals without you needing to give any commands, and yet there's theoretically no "agency" there to track an XP gain for.

At what point along that scale do you stop earning the XP? Does the XP get assigned where the moral responsibility does? Where the causal responsibility does? Who earns the XP in the Saw movies? In the Final Destination movies? Does a Roko's Basilisk paperclipper earn XP /before it exists/ (in some sort of aphysical character sheet, presumably), whenever people acausally trade with it?

Edge cases like these are where all the exploits would lie, I would expect :)
