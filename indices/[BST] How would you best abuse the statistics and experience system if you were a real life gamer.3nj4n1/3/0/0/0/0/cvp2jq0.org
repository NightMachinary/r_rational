In D&D-derived games, paying people to kill for you doesn't earn XP because it avoids the purpose of the game, I suspect.

In /wargaming/, on the other hand, there's a certain point in every unit's rank progression when they become an /officer/---and thus, mostly act through others. But they continue gaining XP and levels from doing so! You'd expect a general to have more XP than a colonel, even if neither has fired a shot in the last 10 years, no? The general likely has more /strategic/ experience, which helps him be more effective in moment-to-moment confrontations as well.
