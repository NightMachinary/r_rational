First, don't spend your skill points; improve by grinding until you can't do that anymore. At STR 1, doing a few pushups will probably get you another point of STR, but at STR 99 you'll need to exercise for days to go up. Spending a skill point gets you the same bonus in each case, but it's more valuable when you're at a point that skill points are the only way to advance.

Whichever stat represents willpower (Wisdom?), grind that for a bit to start; you're going to be doing a lot of mind-shatteringly boring grinding, so best to be able to handle it.

If it's "any lifeform" that gives you ASAP, then start by getting a lot of earthworms. Cut them in half to double them, let them grow back, repeat. When you have enough, drop them in a meat grinder and turn the crank until you don't get anymore benefit from killing worms. If worms don't work, try the same experiment with rats -- catch a few wild ones, breed them like crazy until you have massive swarms, then dump halon gas into their enclosure to kill them all painlessly.

Find out the difference between Intelligence and Wisdom. If it's "Intelligence gives you options, Wisdom helps you choose the right one", great, but it's important to know. Focus your points into these two stats to start. Exact split should depend on what the stats mean in your system. Use the extra brainpower to figure out better ways to gain XP. You are your own recursively self-improving mind, so work that.
