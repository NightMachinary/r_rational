Explore the limits of low XP for easy kills, and if the number is more like 1 than zero, get a job as a crop duster spraying pesticides and insecticides. This is the real moral quantity solution.

Also, look into what generates quests. Amazon Mechanical Turk may be a good source of microtasks. Your goal is XP/hour after all. See if you can impair yourself to increase rewards. Does tasks while also lifting weights help? If so, multi-task.
