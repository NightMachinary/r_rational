OK, so animals give experience based on their strength - which is utterly irrelevant if I'm armed. (It's possible humans have levels based on their higher intelligence and skill, but those actually pose a threat to me, so they're probably out.) I'd need to experiment with the XP system a little first.

Google suggests the strongest animals in the world are the Blue Whale and elephants, which makes sense. Killing animals is ethically dubious, and it's just my luck that cetaceans and elephants are [[http://media.giphy.com/media/12onQxcLlPQdtm/giphy.gif][both quite smart]]. Alternative target would be factory farms (lower XP per animal, but higher population density, and it's less unethical) or, y'know, people.

Worse still, I need to kill them extremely rapidly, so I gain the benefits of experience before I level up too high. Also, by the time I'm superhuman enough to talk my way into nuclear codes or buy the stock market, I'll probably far outlevel even a Blue Whale, which is an unfortunate catch-22.

Still, the ability to gain superhuman INT, WIS, and eventually CHA is too valuable to pass up.

The greatest damage-to-effort ratio for an untrained civilian is probably explosives, the instructions for which are readily available online. Some kind of bombing campaign seems like the obvious choice. It's woefully inefficient, but I'm going to have to level up enough this way until I'm personally competent enough to make a lot of money very quickly. /Then/ I can set up a mechanism for killing some huge number of animals at once.

After that, I'm done ... right?

Well, maybe. If I find that I'm /still/ too close to a merely exceptional human, it'd probably be necessary to turn to mass murder. Nuking a city is the obvious route, although the sheer level of preparation involved is irritating.

Anyway, then I reorganize the government into a utopia or whatever, and settle down to a Solomon-like existence of scientific research wile acting as a consultant on the "hard" problems.
