Do tumors or bacteria count as high level life forms? They're certainly capable of killing powerful humans. Otherwise, it's going to be hard to munchkin this since you don't get to kill much in real life. Even someone who legally kills like a soldier or executioner won't be killing enough people to actually help much, not to mention that killing people to gain power is a drastic enough step that doing it isn't really munchkining. Although it does raise the question of how many levels you can gain by killing rats or slimes before those stop giving you experience.

Does "intellect" refer to what one would normally consider intellect or is it like in games where it affects your ability to perform magic but [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatisticallySpeaking][doesn't change your ability to figure out problems?]]

Also, a lot of your ability to munchkin this depends on the details. How /much/ can you increase your stat by training before training it any further causes a practical problem? How much experience can you gain by killing rats?
