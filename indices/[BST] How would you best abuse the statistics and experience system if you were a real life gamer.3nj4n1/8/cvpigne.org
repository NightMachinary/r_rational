As far as leveling via slaughter, you need to test the limits of the system's abstraction - do you have to kill it with your own hands? By some process you set in motion? By an agent of yours, be it an autonomous process, or a pet, or a human employee?

It seems fairly obvious that you would want to optimize a system for the highest level of abstraction possible. If that's killing it with your hands (or a knife - though how the universe distinguishes between a foot of thin steel and a meat grinder or guillotine lever has to be handwaved, unless you have a perverse and anal-retentive god), you want to work in a slaughterhouse (or breed whatever's fast and still counts - bacteria would be ideal, but OP said no). If you can abstract it far away, you want to be the owner of as many slaughterhouses and fish farms as possible.

With tasks, the same applies. It all depends on the definition of task, and your involvement with it. Can you write a script to accomplish thousands of tasks rapidly? Can you be the owner of something that accomplishes tasks? Is any action whatsoever a task (so you're a master-level walker and blindingly fast typist in a couple years)?
