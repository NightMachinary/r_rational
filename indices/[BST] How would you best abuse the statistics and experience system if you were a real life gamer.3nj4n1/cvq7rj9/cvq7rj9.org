First off, I'd address what the stats actually are. Among other things, I noticed a lack of CHA stat, the split of DEX into AGI/DEX, and the standard INT/WIS split, which as always is probably pretty poorly defined.

Unlike the others in this thread, my suggestion would be to grind AGI first and foremost, under the hopes/assumptions that it would allow you to complete other grinding tasks more quickly. This might need to be combined with INT grinding if that's needed to actually perceive your increased speed, but ideally you can munchkin some way to trigger your increased AGI to use for sped up thinking, and further training.

If necessary, depending on how quickly power levels can ramp up, you might need to dump some stats into CON/VIT to survive at high levels of speed, especially if you want to pull some Flicker-style near-C tricks.

As someone who views animal life as on a scale roughly comparable to human life (if generally less) I would likely have issues with several of the levelling schemes that others here have mentioned. My best bet would most likely be fighting with combat robots, preferably ones that I created. Depending on how XP distribution is calculated, it's possible that I could design something akin to a flamethrowing deathbot with a simple to exploit flaw to "defeat" several of them in quick succession while still leaving the underlying parts reusable so that I don't have to rebuild every time.

If "killing" something like a robot wars-style robot doesn't work, I'll try painting a smiley face on it, to see if there's some rudimentary pattern matching going on, and gradually build up from there.
