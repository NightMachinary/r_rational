Agility and Dexterity are basic skills? Those are too similar, especially when you're missing Charisma. Also, Wisdom doesn't seem like something you can deliberately train by reading (compared to Intelligence). There's got to be some distinction between Wis and Int.

Step one would be to test the system. Do I know my own stats? If I kill something or accomplish some task, do I feel the tingle of XP gain? If I bench 200 then spend a skill point on Str, can I know bench 240? Does another point get me to 280? 288?

Then get your basic skills up (except strength) with training before embarking on your slaughterhouse career.

Completing tasks seems worthless to munchkin compared to killing things for experience. There's no scaling in tasks. The key to munchkining killing is to /never increase your strength/. Apparently, you gain experience based on the difference in strengths in things you kill. Humans don't need strength to kill. Stay weak and kill.

The abbatoir is a fine solution. Probably the best depending on the relative values of working at a fish factory or chicken house. For variety, you could also become a veterinarian at a "kill shelter" and put down a few pit bulls every day. Or get a specialty in large animal euthanasia. Work at a horsetrack or a travel to zoos and circuses.

Or become the new Dr. Kervorkian administering end of life drugs to other humans, preferably former powerlifters.
