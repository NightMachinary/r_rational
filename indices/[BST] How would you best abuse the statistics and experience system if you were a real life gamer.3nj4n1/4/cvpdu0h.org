Get some sort of auto-scroll program with an adjustable speed for reading text. Feed it the library of congress or some other suitably big and useful source of text.

Speed-reading should be an exercise for my int, memorization should be an exercise for my int/wis.

The more I practice speed reading, the more I get int. The more int I get, the faster my speed reading becomes. The more I try to memorize what I'm reading, the better I can retain it, and the more I train -those- stats as well.

Gradually, I increase the feed speed, faster, faster, repeating the text on a big wide loop to memorize it completely, the process feeding into itself, my stats steadily increasing, the exponential acceleration cancelling out the exponential costs.

Eventually I'll have to use my burgeoning int to make a monitor with a faster refresh rate... my mind will be far faster than even a high-end computer monitor. but by the time my brain's that fast, that sort of mechanical jiggery-pokery should be easy.

Fairly quickly, I will have memorized masses upon masses of scientific facts, skills, and other useful things, and will have incredibly high Int and possibly Wis. At level 1.

Now I have a knowledge base for figuring out suitable processes for all my other stats... maybe some sort of electromagnet adjustable weight training set? homemade combat robots to test my body? Who knows, I'll be much smarter by then, much more capable of optimizing.

Maybe I'll even figure out an even /faster/ int-training scheme, and go yet farther again...
