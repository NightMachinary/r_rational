  The best way, the absolute best way, to get me to stop reading a book once I start is to have your characters consistently act inconsistently with their imputed intelligence. (Either way, although smart people doing dumb things offends me more than dumb people doing smart things.)

  ...

  ...consider the many [reality TV] shows in which people are chasing Bigfoot or aliens or whatever. Many of them are /reasonably/ intelligent, if not well educated. They can work their ghost detectors and Bigfoot traps, no problem. Most of the things they do are not inherently illogical. But their basic /premise/ is so messed up that they can't help but do really, really dumb things (including accepting data and advice from people who are obviously crazy) on a regular basis. Fictionally, they'd probably be interesting characters.
