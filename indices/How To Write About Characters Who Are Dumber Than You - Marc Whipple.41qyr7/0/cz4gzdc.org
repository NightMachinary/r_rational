I was reading the article that this one is somewhat of a response to, [[https://medium.com/@MrGrahamMoore/how-to-write-about-characters-who-are-smarter-than-you-c7c956944847#.9k25dhbq3]["How to Write a Character Smarter Than You"]], by the guy who wrote the screenplay for "The Imitation Game", when I started thinking that he was just talking about giving the /aesthetic impression of/ intelligence instead of /actual/ intelligence, and going to Arthur Conan Doyle when you could just go to the things Turing actually wrote was kind of dumb ...

And then I realized that I had actually read that article [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vwa0c/crosspost_from_rwriting_how_to_write_about/][on this subreddit]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vwa0c/crosspost_from_rwriting_how_to_write_about/colgzzi][already voiced my opinions there]]. So I guess I don't need to repeat myself.

As for writing dumber characters, poor impulse control is definitely a part of it, but simply not seeing optimal solutions is a bigger part, and one of the hardest parts to get right.

Someone who is dumber than you will arrive at /less optimal solutions/, even when they have enough time that impulse control isn't an issue. This is difficult to model, because once you've seen an optimal solution, nonoptimal ones look ridiculous (and they tend to look /equally/ ridiculous even if they're at varying levels of difficulty).

I've known plenty of dumb people in my time, and if you see them doing something dumb they'll give you an explanation that makes sense to them. If you point out a smarter way of doing things, often they'll say, "Oh, yeah, that's better" and switch over (though sometimes they'll say "But this is how I've always done it" or "This is simpler" and then there's not much you can do).

Poor impulse control is one way to model dumbness, but I would argue that it's not even that necessary to what you're trying to write about.

The best way to properly model a dumb person is probably to get a dumb person to study so that you can convincingly portray their actions and thoughts, but that goes for almost any character you might want to write about.
