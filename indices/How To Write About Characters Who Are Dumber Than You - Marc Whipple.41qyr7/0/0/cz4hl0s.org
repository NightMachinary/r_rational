Ah, I like the idea of dumb people still optimizing but doing so within a constrained set of options or ideas. I'm assuming most people, to themselves, see themselves as picking good/reasonable decisions. They didn't consider a great solution, then pick a bad one. They considered several solutions and picked the one they thought was best with the tools at their disposal, including their ability to think up of and evaluate solutions.
