I'm familiar with Stephenson's work. I'm also someone who was deeply interested in the potential of BeOS... and very quickly aware of a number of deep flaws that pretty much doomed it from the get-go.

/In the Beginning was the Command Line/ was also deeply flawed. It hits some strong notes that resonate with those actually familiar with the events, but Stephenson himself was clearly not personally familiar with what he was writing about nor was he working with people who were. He uncritically accepted a lot of popular myths of the history of computers, and in turn perpetuated and promoted the mistakes he should, in his assumed role of a documentarian, have been correcting.
