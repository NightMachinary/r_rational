Re [[https://medium.com/@MrGrahamMoore/how-to-write-about-characters-who-are-smarter-than-you-c7c956944847#.7lrughxhg][the other article]] ... I really don't like Holmes, because [[http://www.sherlockian.net/acd/thetrick.html]["the trick"]] didn't work on me. It's not Conan-Doyle's fault. It's the passage of time. Holmes' brilliant deductions, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, are based on the casual knowledge of a well read popular fiction writer of the late 1800s and early 1900s. From the point of view of a well-read scholboy in the late '60s and early '70s, the gaps in Holmes' knowledge were jarring.
