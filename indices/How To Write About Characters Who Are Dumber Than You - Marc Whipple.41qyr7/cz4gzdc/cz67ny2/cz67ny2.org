Figuring out which less-optimal-solution accurately would come from considering dumb-person traits like having a smaller working memory.

What solution would you come up with if you only knew about [the number of facts you needed for the optimal solution] - 1? - 2? This simulates not being able to hold all of the information in your working memory.

What solution would you come up with if you were limited in the number of causative steps to complete it? Smaller working memory means you can't conceive of as many steps in the solution unless you can abstract them.
