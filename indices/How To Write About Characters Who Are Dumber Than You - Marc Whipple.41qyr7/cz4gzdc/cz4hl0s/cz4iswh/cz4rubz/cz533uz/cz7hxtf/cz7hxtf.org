On the subject of BeOS, its worth noting that Stephenson wrote [[http://artlung.com/smorgasborg/C_R_Y_P_T_O_N_O_M_I_C_O_N.shtml][In the Beginning was the Command Line]] the same year Cryptonomicon was published. This essay is brief history of GUIs and operating systems, and compares BeOS to the Batmobile. As evidenced by this essay, if Stephenson didn't think BeOS was the /next-big-thing/ he probably thought it was the /thing-that-should-have-been/.
