  And then I realized that I had actually read that article on this subreddit and already voiced my opinions there. So I guess I don't need to repeat myself.

    My gold standard for fictionalized Turings is Cryptonimicon by Neal Stephenson [...]

I really hated Cryptonomicon. It pretty much completely failed at actually depicting smart people for me. Stevenson did do some clever stuff, the trick with the laptop display in the cell was cromulent, but he threw in a lot of things that were simply wrong or gratuitously weird... like he was trying to be Robert Anton Wilson or Hunter S. Thompson without actually being weird enough himself to carry it off.
