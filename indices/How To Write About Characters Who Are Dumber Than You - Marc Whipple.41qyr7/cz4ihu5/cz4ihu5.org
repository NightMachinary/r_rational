One thing that writers can do to is to hide information from their characters. So long as you can consistently keep track of what each character doesn't know, but the author and sometimes the reader does, this works.

So long as you're not writing a straight detective/puzzle story, of course.

Though you have to make sure that the character really doesn't know about it. One of the things that gets me screaming at characters is having them /forget/ things that have been established as common knowledge for plot-related reasons, and then "remember" them (or "discover" them) later on. If everyone knows about Chekhov's Gun, then having them look for a "missing weapon" instead is really annoying.
