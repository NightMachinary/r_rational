He's responding to an article that was about the opposite subject, writing about people who are smarter than you. So I think this is more of a generalization of that idea; it's hard to write about people who don't /think/ like you. He's not saying that women are as smart as him, he's saying that women are basically the same as men and writing women characters doesn't require any deep insight into the female mind, all you need to do is just flip gender and use your imagination. Substituting values systems is easy too, because it's simple to imagine how you'd behave if you had different values. But imagining different ways of thinking (which is what dumber and smarter are) is a different skillset. This (he says) extends toward the autism/neurotypical divide.

So if he's an intelligent man on the autism spectrum, all of his characters will think like him. They might have different values and different genders, they might look different and come from different backgrounds, but they're all going to be intelligent and on the autism spectrum, because doing otherwise is too hard.

(Assuming that I'm right about what he's saying, he's saying it in a clumsy way.)
