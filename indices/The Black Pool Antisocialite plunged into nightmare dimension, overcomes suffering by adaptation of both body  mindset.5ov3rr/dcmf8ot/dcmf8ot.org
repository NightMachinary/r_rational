That was actually pretty great. I felt like it had a strong Kafka-esque vibe to it.

EDIT:

I definitely meant Kafka, I don't know why my brain grabbed the word "Dostoevsky." They really shouldn't be associated strongly enough to be close enough together for my brain to grab one when it wanted the other, unless the association is temporal and not conceptual.
