This is just your explanation/description about your character making good decisions. The world itself may not be rational or the way your characters behave not be rational.

If your work has been judged consistently as not rational, you may want to read other works to see how they approach rational storytelling.

Otherwise, it looked like you're an outsider writing outsider things. Granted, it appeals to the readership here, but it doesn't mean that your work is any way part of the rational fiction genre.

BTW, your works disappeared from the front page again.
