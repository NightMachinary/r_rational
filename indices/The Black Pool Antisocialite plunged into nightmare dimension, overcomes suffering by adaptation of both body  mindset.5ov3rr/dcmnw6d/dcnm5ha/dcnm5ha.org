I can't find anything [[http://rationalfiction.io/story/rational-fiction][here]] which would preclude this story from being considered "rational."

A story doesn't /have/ to sacrifice proper literary form (show, don't tell) by sporadically inserting multi-paragraph infodumps which explore the minutia of random scientific concepts and break the illusion of temporality (*cough* HPMOR *cough*) in order to be considered "rational."
