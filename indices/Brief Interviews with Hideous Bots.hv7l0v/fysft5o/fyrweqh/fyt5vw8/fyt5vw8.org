The blue text doesn't track at all to me.

Like, the bot seemed absolutely coherent to me. It alluded to many historical figures in ways that made sense and there weren't random meaningless sentences.

It does take a jump from "how could I kill someone without arms? I don't have arms rofl" to "btw have you ever heard of this conspiracy theory where chatbots convince people to kill themselves?"

Incidentally, all of this author's stories apparently end the same way, so if you've read one you've read them all.
