I viewed that whole section as reflecting boomer Facebook memes. Level 1 -> AI is actually the devil. Level 2 -> goofy conspiracy theory. Level 3 -> AI presents a conspiracy about itself in such a way to serve its own unknowable ends. Are those ends religious strife, or it's own survival? Or we take it at its word, and there is no intent, and the violence it commits is just an inevitable process for the kind of mind we seek to build?

I love the idea of an AI signal-boosting ‘Christians are immune to AI devilry' as a way to facilitate its manipulation of both the religious (‘we're safe!') and the secular (‘that's what bible nuts think').
