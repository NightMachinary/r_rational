The theme for my recs this month are Death Game Portal Fantasy Deconstructions.

Let's start off with a video. It's something I've recommended before, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIES3ii-IOg][Kaizo Trap]]. Kaizo Trap is a youtube music video / game. It is based on platformers in general and Kaizo Mario World in particular. A very good watch, make sure you have nice headphones or a good subwoofer! I watched it a lot.

Interested in something more text-based? I recommend the classic [[http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/NES_Godzilla_Creepypasta/Chapter_1:_Earth_%26_Mars][NES Godzilla CreepyPasta]]. This is a less literal in terms of Portal Fantasy, but you'll find as you read that it definitely fits the genre. A story to inspire horror, fear, hope, determination. Read it alone at night in a dark room!

Now, no Death Game Portal Fantasy Deconstructions list is complete without of course, [[http://store.steampowered.com/app/405640/][Pony Island]]. Pony Island is literally a death game portal fantasy game. It has mostly puzzles, problem-solving, and platforming. Just a couple hours of playtime, this game is meant to be played in one playthrough, start to finish. The game has you. Want to leave? You'll have to fight your way to freedom.

I highly recommand all three.
