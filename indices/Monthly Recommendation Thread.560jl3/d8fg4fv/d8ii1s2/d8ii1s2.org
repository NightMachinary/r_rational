I like the books and I like the message they tried to pass on about gender/sex, it's an interesting perspective on it and that's what I look for in my SF.

However, the author seemed to ignore or gloss over that humans are in fact a sexually dimorphic species. It's simple to guess an individual's sex with a very high degree of accuracy just by looking at height, for instance. If you add in fat distribution, body/limb size, muscle mass and so on, then it really breaks immersion that the AI is unable to use the correct pronouns when she has to. It becomes kind of condescending, actually.

Regardless, I second the rec just because it's a fresh approach to an old subject, and the plot is pretty interesting.
