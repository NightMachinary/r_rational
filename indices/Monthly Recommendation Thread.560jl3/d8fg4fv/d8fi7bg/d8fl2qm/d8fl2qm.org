I'm halfway through the second book. The thread, and the my own problems with some of the straw-manning of colonialists in the second book triggered my edit walking back the very rational claim. That said I'll probably finish the trilogy by Monday and render judgment then. I am delighted, despite it's lack of physics porn, which is usually a requirement for me, I think the best endorsement I can give is the second book reminds me of a Science Fiction version of The Traitor Baru Cormorant with a more experience and capable protagonist.

Edit: Typo: originally called it rational not rationalist.
