A more-detailed summary:

#+begin_quote

  1. Sasuke has married Ino and had five children with her. However, the family relationship is extremely strained: Sasuke is very authoritarian, and borderline abusive, in his efforts to restore the glory of the Uchiha. He likes only one of his children, while constantly expressing disdain for the others, and hating one of them so much that he never even speaks to her. (The reason for this is eventually explained.) How will this situation turn out?

  2. While on a mission with his genin team in the Land of Rice (formerly the Land of Sound), Sasuke is astonished to see a boy who seems to be a clone of Itachi. Soon, other clones start turning up as well. Who is behind this? Has Orochimaru somehow returned?

  Note also that the story actually is only 600,000 words--the last 200,000 consist of several epilogues and exhaustive author's notes.

It's my second-favorite /Naruto/ story (after /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/).
