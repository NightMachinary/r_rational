All Radch ships are meatfuckers on a massive scale.They're more abhorrent to Culture mores than the Affront. It's not exactly the ships' fault though. It's hard to draw the line between what's an active part of the HS, and what's a victim of the HS.

Maybe I should finish Ancillary so I can try writing a crossover. Mianaai gets displaced into all the local suns, Radch officers get slap drones, and Radch ships get fabricator lessons.
