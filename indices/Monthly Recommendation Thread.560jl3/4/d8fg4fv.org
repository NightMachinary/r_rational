The story is +very+ /YMMV/ Rational with reasonably irrational actors. It is centered around a breakdown of a biological based Imperial singleton/copyclan/multiple-clone-network that has problems due to it's latency. It's told by the surviving element of a servitor warship AI where the warships uses captured civilians as bio-based drones. LOts of good identity discussion and implications extrapolated from some very bad substrate choices and some anachronistic elements.
