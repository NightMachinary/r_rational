Mr Robot season 2 finished last month. The world does have some holes, it's not completely rational or rationalist, but it's the best representation of hacking I've ever seen in fiction. And the world is generally great, violence is swift and brutal, characters are motivated and have extreme flaws. You'll only need the first episode to know if you'll like it or not.
