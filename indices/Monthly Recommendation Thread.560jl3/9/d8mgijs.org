[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seed-a-worm-au.340626/][Seed]], a Worm fanfic that's terribly written with tense issues and stilted dialogue throughout, but very well crafted (so far) in plot and world building. Its main conceit is Taylor gets Blasto's shard and uses science to become super powerful in order to make Brockton Bay safe. Again, so far.

If you can't mentally correct every word of almost every sentence for grammar and style as you read then it'll be hard to enjoy this.
