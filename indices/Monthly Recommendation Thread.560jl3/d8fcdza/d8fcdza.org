Undertale recommendations (all of these have extreme spoilers, be warned):

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5296460][The Golden Quiche]], by [[/u/Sophiera]] . Excellent worldbuilding, interesting magic system, great characterization even for the OCs. She also authors a book on Amazon which I, annoyingly, still haven't gotten around to reading yet, so I would not feel it appropriate to recommend it.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5170448][Strange Places]], by AyuOhseki. Interesting variations of the original undertale story, includes the existence of the misanthropic "Player" without getting too meta for my tastes, at least.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4942816/chapters/11345293][One by One]], by CourierNew. Haven't read this recently enough to give a synopsis, but it is an exceptionally good one from what I remember, and many people consider it a headcanon ending to the story.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5056333][Flowey is Not a Good Life Coach]], by unrestedjade. Goes in a very different direction from the rest, and frankly, I haven't and don't plan to finish it, but that's not because of it's quality. It's just too dark and psychologically-shaking of a story for me, though some of you may enjoy it.

[[https://tratserenoyreve.tumblr.com/post/135227136600/i-had-a-thought-the-thought-continues-here][The Thought]], by tratserenoyreve. An impressive comic looking at what might happen if a certain nihilistic character took a more immediate interest in what's going on.

edit:

There is also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleAUs/comments/4ax1d4/heyo_want_some_fan_fiction_well_i_got_some_for_ya/][this]] massive, curated list of fanfiction by [[/u/Cyrus67]].
