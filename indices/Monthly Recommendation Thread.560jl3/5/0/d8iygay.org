I'm going to jump in here and recommend against this. I was intrigued by your post, and by [[/u/ToaKraka]]'s summary, so I decided to start reading it. I got up through Chapter 74 before I gave up.

It's got a really interesting premise, and I love the degree of detail that went into the plotting, character backgrounds, and seemingly throwaway details that emerge later on.

The problem is the /writing/. The author has the issue where they over-rely on a few good tricks.

For example, stylistically, the author does this a /lot/:

#+begin_quote
  He went upstairs with heavy, tight-lidded eyes and laid down on Hajime's bed, on his back. He spread his arms and his legs wide over the mattress.

  Trying to process.

  Everything.

  His mind had the pieces of a puzzle and he was determined to solve.

  As much as he could, anyways.
#+end_quote

There were chapters where none of the lines wrapped on my screen, because every single paragraph.

Was just.

A single sentence, or a fragment.

This is a technique that has its place, but oh god it is overused. It honestly kind of reminded me of reading a Wildbow story: I only got a little way into Worm, but I read all of Pact, and good lord does Wildbow just put his foot on the "this is a moment of crisis" pedal and not let up, where every single scene in the last half of the story is wrought with incredible tension. In The Blood does that, except with every scene wrought with pathos, angst, and shock. It's true in physics and it's true in writing, it's the /differential/ that makes interesting things possible.

Similarly, the writer has one character arc that they way, way overuse: it's "I am a deeply compassionate and sensitive boy whose gifts lie in areas other than combat, but am being forced into The Path of Badassery by Sasuke." There are a few variations on this -- one of these characters is a girl, one of these characters is actually really gifted at combat but just psychologically unsuited for it due to the aforementioned compassion and sensitivity, one of these characters is being forced into their path by someone who isn't Sasuke -- but it's just /not interesting/ to get the same arc four times. There's all these other characters that show up in the first dozen-odd chapters that then get shunted to the side in favor of Sasuke Continues To Be Wrong About Everything, Forever. I was really disappointed, because I liked how it started and really dug the level of detail. But I don't think this story is actually very good.

(But then, I also couldn't get through Time Braid, so what the fuck do I know about Naruto fanfic)
