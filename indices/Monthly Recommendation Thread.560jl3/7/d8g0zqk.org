I have been waiting for this thread ever since I watched [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/14075/Zetsuen_no_Tempest][Zetsuen no Tempest]]. It's a magical murder mystery drawing some inspiration from Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. While this might be an unorthodox recommendation I honestly believe it is the best anime example of rational fiction characteristics I have seen. I wouldn't disagree with saying it temporarily approaches rationalist even. At one point it has four main actors with different beliefs and conflicting values who are literally talking things out while updating beliefs based on new information. That part is in my humble opinion interesting even just for its novel use of predominantly literary dialogue in a naturally more action oriented medium.

Having said that, I am essentially recommending the show based on /that part/ alone. It does also contain typical magical action elements and after episode 12 the show rapidly becomes noticeably worse in every way. It then takes waiting until episode 20 for more plot answers to appear.

I understand that might sound negative but I really believe even the first half on its own is strong enough to consider. It's in a weird position where it's both great and bad at the same time resulting in its actual quality being very subjective. While certainly not for everyone, optimistically this is a good and rational anime that just happens to end semi conclusively mid season; With an epilogue you can skip to. If the linked additional plot information seems interesting please give it a chance.
