I've recommended [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/31764/Nejimaki_Seirei_Senki__Tenkyou_no_Alderamin][Tenkyou no Alderamin]] before, but now that the series ended I think I can give a more wholesome recommendation.

I'll try to keep it short

Pros:

- MC which is preaching for "science"/rationality
- Show, don't tell
- Interesting twists/solutions
- Interesting characters, that also get development
- Nice art
- Good animation in the beginning, and smart use of animation at the end where the budget/time was obviously reduced
- Interesting world

Cons:

- Elements of "Look at how awesome the MC is!!"
- Less serious attitude in the beginning
- There are some convenient Bad Guys^{TM,} though they don't have too central of a role
- The animation does deteriorate somewhat in the later parts of the series
