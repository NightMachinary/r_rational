Yeah. I mean, look at a name that's 2,000 years old: John, say, or Augustus. Those are borrowed from different cultures, but they're clearly "white european" names, and I'm sure Japan, Korea, Thailand, Uganda, the Navaho nation, etc have their own traditional names that have been used for a long period of time, but they'd sound to our untrained ears like "modern" names in that culture.

I mean, look at Asimov's names: the Foundation series is set some untold number of years in the future and the main character is named Hari Seldon which, while I've never heard it before, it sounds very european. (Hari due to its spelling sounds a tad Asian, but not overly so).

Then look at Frank Herbert's Dune series: everyone just has traditional English names (Paul, Jessica, etc) except for the aliens. Using one at random, her name is Chani, which is apparently a Hebrew name. Another alien, Stilgar, has a name that could probably have been generated from combining two name "portions" together.
