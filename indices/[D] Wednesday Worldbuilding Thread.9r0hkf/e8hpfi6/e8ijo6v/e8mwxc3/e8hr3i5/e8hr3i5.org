that is a hard question...

There are many tips out there how to get names... None I read are obviously suprior to me.

Maybe mix some new names in. Or write them differently (like many do nowadays). Or maybe use nicknames.

Just don't stress too much with names you can search and replace them easily (as long as you don't write wordplays or use too many nicknames based on the character name like batarang for batman)
