[[/r/namenerds]] is a great resource.

I think do research into the history/provenance of the names you want to include, and perhaps include some really, really old names. The name Tiffany is actually a very ancient medieval name that got brought out of obscurity with a book in I think the 1940s or something, but now people don't think of Tiffany as an ancient name, they think of it as modern and trendy like Ryan or Jayden.

Think of your society: if it comes from America, then biblical/classic names like James/John/Mary will still be around. If it comes from Japan, the names will again be very different - Kumikos or something, I don't know Japanese names.

This is another great way to create names that look namey while also being "new": [[https://www.reddit.com/r/namenerds/comments/49yi1c/thoughts_on_dithematic_names_and_creating_names/]]
