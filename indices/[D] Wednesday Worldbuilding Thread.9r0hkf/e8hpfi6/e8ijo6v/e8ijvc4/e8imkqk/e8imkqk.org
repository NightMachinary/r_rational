Ah, I think I see what you mean. You want to make "generic" names that are ethnically/culturally ambiguous. For that, I would suggest [[https://www.behindthename.com/][Behind the Name]], which has pretty much all the names. On the page for any given name, you can see popularity across cultures, as well as versions in other languages, and where it comes from. I think using variants from there might help things feel more ambiguous without being too weird.
