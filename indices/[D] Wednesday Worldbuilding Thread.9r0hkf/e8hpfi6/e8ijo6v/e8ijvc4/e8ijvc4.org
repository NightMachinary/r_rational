True, but doesn't that apply anyway from a given starting pool which is going to be culture-determined? Like, I can see a specific type of parents picking a foreign name just for the heck of it, but most Americans will probably go for something American-sounding. My problem I guess is I'd like sometimes to make my stories feel unrooted to any specific setting, so that the reader doesn't get too tied into a cultural or political context, without resorting to names that are too weird or ludicrous.
