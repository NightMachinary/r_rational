A little weird problem that I face when considering writing sci-fi stories set in the future of our world... I am always on the fence about how to come up with names for the characters.

I find the idea of inventing names outright often leads to rather silly results, especially when considering time intervals that aren't too long (there's easily been Johns and James for the best part of one millennium now, so it's hard to imagine names as changing too radically unless on very very long time scales). However with just using realistic present day names I find that an annoying consequence is that the story will feel rooted in one specific country and culture, depending on which language I use, and that's not always necessarily something I want to draw a focus on if it's not key to my topic. In fact I like the idea of generality that comes with abstract or unknown names, I just don't feel they are very realistic or even credible in a lot of cases (if I were a linguist I might try to speculate about that, but alas, I am not).

Is there an approach you would use? Maybe mixing up different names from different cultures? Just try to avoid using names altogether? Or you just don't care/think much about it?
