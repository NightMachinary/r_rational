I was thinking about the Reckoners series by Brandon Sanderson. In it people who have gained superpowers are more apathetic towards other people. They don't view them as having moral standing and that they are expendable/there to be used as they see fit.

I thought it was a good take on drunk with power and that got me thinking about what a world would look like if we took that saying literally. What would a world look like if people that had super powers got literally drunk off of using them?

How much different would the world be if their inebriation scaled with their power? Or if they had a limit til they blacked out/died from over consumption? What if they just hit a maximum inebriation rather than having a death/black out limit?

Just something I was curious to get your views on.
