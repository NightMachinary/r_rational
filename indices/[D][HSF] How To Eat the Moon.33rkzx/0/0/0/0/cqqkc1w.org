  You use a thin-walled chamber made of regolith with vacuum surrounding it.

That could work. Also if you go to bigger sizes, the volume to surface ratio increases, so insulation efficiency isn't that important.

    There is only a little iron in the regolith (from meteor impacts), Native iron, you mean? Or are you including all ferrous compounds?

I was thinking all ferrous compounds, but it turns out I was misremembering what I had read -- it's the metallic form that is 0.5% or so. In oxide form, iron is fairly common in lunar soil. Something like [[http://www.lunarpedia.org/index.php?title=Iron][15%]] depending where you look. However, metallic is more strongly attracted to magnets than oxides, so if you want to get pure iron with relatively little processing energy, you could magnetically [[http://www.lunarpedia.org/index.php?title=Iron_Beneficiation][separate out]] the metallic particles.
