To reduce the amount of abrasive moon dust around the work site, maybe create a thin layer of sintered glass over a large area. The mining robots could collect regolith at the edge and roll it back to the work area in sealed containers. Another possible option instead of sintering would be to throw down a layer of some kind of chemical binder that makes the dust clump together like a thin layer of asphalt.

For power storage, one way would be to fill a big thermos with rocks and store the energy thermally. This would be converted to electricity using a working fluid based TEG or Seebeck based thermopile, with the cold side referenced to the night sky and/or a shaded area. Regolith itself is a pretty good insulator, and the walls could be sinter-printed. So you could actually create hot and cold "batteries", and eliminate the need for photovoltaics.

Ceramics tend to be good electrical insulators, so if we can't get plastic, that might work. Silicone maybe?

Iron for the magnets (and maybe structural materials, etc. too) can be collected by sending a rover out over the loose regolith with a strong magnet. There is only a little iron in the regolith (from meteor impacts), but it can be extracted relatively cheaply from a large area this way.

Graphite could work for lubricant. Carbon isn't exactly common on the Moon, but is probably more so at the poles where the frozen volatiles (CO2, methane, etc) can exist. There are craters from C-type asteroids. At the bottom of these, there are likely to be carbon sources including diamond. This can be cut into bushings, etc. using lasers.
