  In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_science][planetary science]], *volatiles* are the group of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_elements][chemical elements]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compounds][chemical compounds]] with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)][low boiling points]] that are associated with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet][planet]]'s or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon][moon]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)][crust]] and/or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere][atmosphere]]. Examples include [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen][nitrogen]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water][water]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide][carbon dioxide]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia][ammonia]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen][hydrogen]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane][methane]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide][sulfur dioxide]]. In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrogeology][astrogeology]], these compounds, in their solid state, often comprise large proportions of the crusts of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons][moons]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet][dwarf planets]].

  In contrast with volatiles, elements and compounds with high boiling points are known as /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_(planetary_science)][refractory]] substances/.

  Planetary scientists often classifly volatiles with exceptionally low melting points, such as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen][hydrogen]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium][helium]], as *gases* (as in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant][gas giant]]), while those volatiles with melting points above about 100 K are referred to as *ices*. The terms "gas" and "ice" in this context can apply to compounds that may be solids, liquids or gases. Thus, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter][Jupiter]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn][Saturn]] are referred to as "gas giants", and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus][Uranus]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune][Neptune]] are referred to as "ice giants", even though the vast majority of the "gas" and "ice" in their interiors is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid][hot, highly dense fluid]] that gets denser as the center of the planet is approached.
