I'd like to offer kudos to our players: for reasons discussed [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1492#post-7683153][here]] they have just been hit with a giant nerf bat. I was expecting a lot of whining and probably some rage quitting. Instead, they have risen to the challenge, buckled down, and started figuring out how to get back what they lost.

You folks rock.
