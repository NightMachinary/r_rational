I haven't bought any groceries since November.

In a combination of poor and good foresight, I'd seen where COVID was going while it was still in China, and stocked up to last out a potential lockdown/lack of service. Only, while the first wave was as bad as I'd thought it would be, delivery service picked back up more rapidly than I'd thought it would, and I went back to regular grocery shopping through the online app. Come winter, most of the non-perishables were still in the cupboard as I'd just been going through the stuff I'd bought to top up through quarantine.

So I've been working through the backlog, and I'm /still eating it/. Dried beans and mushrooms, frozen vegetables, pickled goods, canned tomatoes, jarred sauces, UHT milk, rice and pasta, and a decent amount of alcohol topping up the caloric limit. The slightly worrying thing is that I'm still not short on options. My diet is as varied as it was before, and it's entirely what I'd before thought of before as 'emergency food'. The UHT milk is something I'd literally never bought before, but it's /so convenient/ and I've developed a taste for it. I don't think I'll bother going back to fresh when I can just buy a few gallons and leave it there for a few months instead.

Have I genuinely just been throwing money away for years, buying food that only keeps for a few days on the marketing value of 'fresh', when long-lasting, still-tasty stuff is cheaper and easily-available? Is there some X-Factor I'm missing that makes produce-aisle spinach expiring in two days better than the frozen spinach I can toss into a sauce more than a year after purchase?
