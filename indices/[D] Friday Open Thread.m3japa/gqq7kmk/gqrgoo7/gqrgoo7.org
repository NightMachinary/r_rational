Preserved food is more interchangeable than fresh food, so more producers can compete for the sale, so the market drives the prices down, and the margins with it. So the stores you buy from have an incentive to push fresh food, which has higher margins.

Nutritionally, some of the nutrients of preserved food will leech out to the preserving liquid, but if you're including that when you cook then I don't think you're missing much. You're also eating more preservatives. If too much salt and vinegar aren't going to be a problem for you, I don't think it's a problem.

Culinarily, some foods benefit more from fresh ingredients than others. You mentioned tossing frozen spinach into a sauce, and that's an ideal case for a preserved food. Sauces, stews, roasts, and really any slowly cooked or thoroughly mixed dish is going to be fine with preserved ingredients. Raw or seared foods would do better fresh. Salads or grilled vegetables would be dishes I'd expect to taste better with fresh ingredients.

Also, food generally takes longer than two days to go bad. If the food you're buying at the grocery store goes bad in two days, it's not really that fresh to start with, and that does impact the flavor. That missing X-Factor in your fresh spinach might only exist if you get it from the local farmers' market or your garden.
