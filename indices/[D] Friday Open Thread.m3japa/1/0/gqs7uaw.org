By the way, the Netflix show with the same name is just that: a show with the same name. And the same premise. And a few character are similar, too.

It diverges pretty quickly from the book, in all the bad ways: no character development, no clear goals, "evil" characters are just generic assholes, die in stupid ways when the actor's contract expires and minor spoilers: the writers somehow manage to introduce a new character in the third season, in what's supposed to be a walled off community.
