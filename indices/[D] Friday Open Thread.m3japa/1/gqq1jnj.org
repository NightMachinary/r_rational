I just finished Under The Dome by Stephen King. I'll be posting about it in tomorrow's thread because it's extremely fertile soil for munchkinry, but I wanted to recommend it here first and invite any discussion from others who have read it. I wouldn't call it fully rational, but in almost all cases the characters act according to their goals & capabilities, and it's a fascinating "what-if" scenario with a lot of implications that are satisfyingly explored.

For what it's worth, it's also a deeply insightful examination of tyranny and the psychology of tyrants.
