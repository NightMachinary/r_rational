  I'm outperforming all my coworkers in very quantifiable ways (and I think in most subjective ways as well)

Then you're outperforming the people who are getting promoted. That means there has to be a problem somewhere.

It could be that the managers view you as being more competent than they are, a threat to their own position if they ever let you move up, and that could be causing some resentment. There's not much that could be done about that, if that were the issue.

It could also be that managers see you as a resource that's just more useful where you are right now, doing what you're currently doing, because moving you up would mean replacing you with someone less competent. Not much that could be done about that, either.

Or it could be that those other people who got promoted have worked there longer than you, or have a more personal relationship with the managers than what you're aware of. You didn't provide any details about that. Nepotism is a real thing. There's no real solution there either.

Regardless, if it's objectively true that you're doing better than the people who are getting promotions, and that you're also on good terms with everybody (which I assume means you're being a socially/professionally appropriate level of personable/friendly), then it has to be the case that the problem is not an issue with yourself, the problem is an issue with the managers - be that resentment/jealousy or capitalism or favoritism/nepotism or whatever else - so you shouldn't feel personally hurt about it because the problem is that you're better than them.

Go ahead and feel bitter about it. It's unfair that less competent people end up in positions that would be better filled by someone else. But that's not a new problem. All kinds of room-temperature IQ morons throughout history have been able to get a small loan of a million dollars from daddy so they can grow up to waste their money on solid gold toilets, while people who could've used that money to effect change on the world in a more substantial way than installing golden toilets have died in obscurity. It's perfectly fine to be bitter about the fact that people who aren't qualified to optimally exercise authority are more often than not the ones who end up in positions of authority, and it's perfectly fine to be bitter about the fact that those people almost always believe that they're entitled to be where they are because they got where they are by being the most qualified to be there. But that should have no effect on your own self-worth. The problem isn't with you, the problem is with them.
