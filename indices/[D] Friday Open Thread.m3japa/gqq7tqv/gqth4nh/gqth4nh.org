Other people are getting promoted where you are not. You are, as per your own report, working hard in all the ways that can be expected, under rational rules, to lead to a promotion.

This leads to the idea that perhaps the rules are /not/ rational. Perhaps there is some common feature to the people who are getting promoted that is not the case for you? It might be worthwhile to see if such a feature can be found. It's possible that, for example, the people who get promoted are the people who share their lunch with the boss, regardless of actual work done.

Or it's possible that your direct boss's bonus depends on how much work his team does - and he's always promoting the people who do /not/ contribute to his bonus, to get the useless slackers out of his department and keep the team that actually does the /work/. This is counterproductive, because it rewards people for slacking off and not doing more than the required minimum work; but if it is happening, then that's a possible explanation.

Another possibility is that the people who are promoted have some paper qualification that you are lacking (such as a BA in business administration or similar); even if the course teaches you nothing that you don't already know, getting a BA might make you a better candidate for promotion.
