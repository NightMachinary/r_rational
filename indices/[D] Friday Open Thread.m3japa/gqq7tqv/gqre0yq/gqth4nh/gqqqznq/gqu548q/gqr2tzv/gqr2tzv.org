If you're a good competent worker you're more valuable working than managing.

​

There are studies that show that people that work faster get perceived as having a lower time value, more things will get asked of you etc. If an employee takes 3h to do something and another takes 1h, the one that does it in 1h will get a lot more done, and his time will be seen as less 'valuable' because more of it is available and smaller quantities of it generate more returns.

​

This means more things are asked of him, he's got more work, more stress, more chances to fail and make mistakes etc. I know it's weird but as an employee you should try to be above average, more than that and it's counter productive.

​

Do you have the qualifications and expected age to be promoted ? Do you dress and have the general appearance of someone that'd be a manager in your company ?

​

Other than that depending on how capable you're, look into alternative income sources. Affiliate marketing is fairly simple if you can use a computer. Do your own research, trading time for money is not ideal, depending on things you can't control like who your boss feels like promoting is not ideal. Transition gradually and play a different game if the one you're playing doesn't favor you.
