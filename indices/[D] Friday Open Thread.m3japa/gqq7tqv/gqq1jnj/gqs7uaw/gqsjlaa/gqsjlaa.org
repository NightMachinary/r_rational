I got to correct you on one thing; it's not a Netflix show. I mean, I guess it's a show that is apparently now streaming on Netflix, but it is not produced by Netflix, like a initially thought you meant.

This sent me down the memory lane of watching it as it came out (on actual tv!), almost eight years ago. And yes, it was pretty bad, especially after the first season.
