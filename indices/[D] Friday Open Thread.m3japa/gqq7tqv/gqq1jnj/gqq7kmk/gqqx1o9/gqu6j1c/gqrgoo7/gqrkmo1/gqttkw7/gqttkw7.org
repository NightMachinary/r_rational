I've heard the same thing about frozen fish being better than fresh fish. They flash-freeze it on the boat within hours of it being caught. With "fresh" fish, 80% of what people buy is imported, and the vast majority of it is frozen at some point in the process anyways (unless you live within 100 miles of where it was caught). "Fresh" fish might be almost 2 weeks old by the time you buy it. Frozen fish is functionally only a few hours old, even if it's been continuously frozen for close to a year.
