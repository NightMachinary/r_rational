Frozen: hell yes, it's fresher than unfrozen; just avoid freezer burn.

Canned: depends upon method of preservation and the specific foodstuff in question. For example, anything with vitamin C will degrade over time, exposure, and heat, so it needs to be frozen or eaten fresh. You'll see added ascorbic acid in orange juice, etc., because its vitamin C content degrades very quickly after juicing (and for standardisation of product nutritional value as well).
