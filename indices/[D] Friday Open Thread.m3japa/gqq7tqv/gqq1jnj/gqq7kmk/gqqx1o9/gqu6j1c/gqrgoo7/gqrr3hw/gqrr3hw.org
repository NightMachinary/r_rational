There are a lot of foods that are perfectly fine frozen or canned, and more foods that can be cooked in ways that are perfectly fine etc. It all depends on how you're cooking! If you're throwing stuff into sauces with pasta, basically everything is gonna be fine. If you like a lot of crunchy or fried foods, not so much; I wouldn't want to, say, pan-fry zucchini from anything other than the farmer's market if I had that option!
