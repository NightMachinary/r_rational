I haven't studied extensively, but most things I've read say that canned vegetables are the worst of the 3 vegetable options (canned, fresh, and frozen). Fruit too,, for that matter.. They say many nutrients will begin breaking down almost immediately and be entirely gone within 2 or 3 days. For this reason, frozen is actually the best for many of them, and it also keeps for like a year without any trouble.

I think for milk, meat, and sauces, you'll be fine, but try to have at least half fresh/frozen fruit/veggies. BTW, "half" is just some decent-sounding BS I just made up (but it makes sense, right?).

Edit: I suppose I have to agree with fassina2, in actuality. Foods that are less processed tend to be better for you, but processed shelf food isn't really any worse than processed "fresh" food. Like, eating a TV dinner isn't going to be worse for you than going to McDonald's (not that I advocate doing either really ðŸ˜„).
