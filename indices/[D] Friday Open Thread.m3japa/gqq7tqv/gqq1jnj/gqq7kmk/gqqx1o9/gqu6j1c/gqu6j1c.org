I'm very much not a nutritionist, but I suggest checking that you're getting enough micronutrients of the various types. Consider that some citruses for example will keep for several weeks in the fridge, and are a good source for vitamin C. It may be best to simply find a valued nutritionist around to consult with on your diet.
