Breaking out concrete "what would change if I was promoted" might help; is it money? different day-to-day work? feeling recognized? etc

Not knowing what to do about it def contributes to a feeling of helplessness. It sounds like having actions to take + way to evaluate progress is what you're lacking at work, can you come up with your own plan? Like, "I will leave in a year if there's no pay change"
