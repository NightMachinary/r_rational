I think everyone else's advice is spot on and collectively better than anything i could do, so I'm going to go the opposite way and mention something I've been struggling with myself. Most people aren't managers.

Landing a manager position is a little bit like becoming a movie star (but not as exclusive). There's hard work involved, there's also the "who you know" aspect and the "right place right time" aspect, but equally important is just random luck (or at least effectively random to you). Maybe the boss had just had a nice conversation with the other person right before learning that this new position would open up. Maybe conversely you did some small inconsequential thing that mildly annoyed big boss right before the position opened up.

So let me say it again. Most people aren't managers. There are many exceptional people that aren't managers. It sucks, because I really feel like I would make a pretty good manager (better than all but 1 of mine in the last 10 years at least), but I've never had the opportunity, and of course, nobody is going to hire you at a new workplace for a manager position if you don't have any manager experience. But...that's life. Most people aren't managers, and of the people that are, it seems like at least half of them got there by being best friends or related to the manager's boss, so that's even fewer manager positions available. So it's nothing wrong with you, it's just that most people aren't managers. Including you.
