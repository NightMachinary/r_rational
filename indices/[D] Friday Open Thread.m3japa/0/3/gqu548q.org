Would it be extremely impolite/social faux-pas for you to grab one of the relevant bosses for a conversation and ask them directly: not what you should be doing to get promoted, but why you weren't promoted before?

It seems that they just aren't keen to promote you, and it is hurting your mental health and self image, so it might be worth to do it simply to try getting a true answer, even if it won't help you to get promoted. Just asking "I need the money, I get good reviews, I'm good at my job, why haven't you promoted me when you had the opportunity?" I understand it may feel/seem like whining, and maybe damage the way they view you, but it seems you are starting to need the answer more than you actually need the promotion.

If this seems too daunting, I suggest starting with the other answers, specifically trying to note everything in common with those promoted that you're missing. Do they hang out in the same pub? Do they have more seniority? Do they seem similar physically? Have some formal qualifications? There might be legitimate reasons you're missing, or it might be politics/sexism/racism, and nothing that you can really solve. It's entirely possible that shitty people are doing shitty things to you, and you may need (in your current situation) to bear it, and the only thing left to do is work to maintain your mental health, and carry on. If you're willing to give more details in private, I can try to give another perspective (and maybe think of something you missed, or suggest other work venues that you skipped over).

Edit: I thought of another suggestion: if you're so good at your work, and it may be that they don't promote you because you're more valued in the current position, ask for a raise. They may or may not be willing to more adequately compensate you. If a simple raise is not possible, perhaps suggest some bonus scheme for particularly good stats? If this continues with no proper compensation, consider simply keeping your head down and putting in less effort.
