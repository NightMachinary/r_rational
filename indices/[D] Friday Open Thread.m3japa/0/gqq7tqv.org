I have been passed over for the same promotion at work five times; it's a bad minimum-wage manual-labor job and I don't like it, only working there because it's currently what fits my schedule needs. It's not realistic for me at the moment to work somewhere else, at least not for a long time, and most places i could work at in the short term would probably just be worse. I'm not desperate for money, I'm able to get by without issues but if i got the promotion i'd probably be making substantially more than double what i am now and it'd help so much.

I'm outperforming all my coworkers in very quantifiable ways (and I think in most subjective ways as well) and I keep getting passed up. Socially I'm on good terms with my coworkers and superiors; I've been super direct to management that I'm eager to move up. I keep getting brushed off anyway.

I'm so bitter about it; everyday i need to interact with the people that have been moved up instead of me, they're very nice people, as is my management, i'm just at a loss at the unfairness of it all. I feel dumb for placing my self-worth on this but i can't help it. I've asked management directly what else I could do to improve my chances and I continually get the same answer that I'm doing perfectly and there are no further improvements for me to make; other people are surprised that I haven't been moved up yet (or at least they're telling me this to make me feel better, I don't know anymore). I have a reputation for being a hard worker.

How do I stop feeling personally hurt about this? It's making me so depressed.
