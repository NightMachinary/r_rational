There's more you can do with stocks than buying but yes it works. You can do a lot of weird shit, like bet a stock will go down and if it does go down you get paid and other things.

​

But yes, your method works. Seeing that this is the case I'd use FX where you can multiply your returns because of the way it works, i.e say you'd get 1000 profit on FX you'd get 100.000 because it can multiply your money, I forgot the specific word for it.

​

I just thought of this, doesn't this dice only mean you make a choice at the top 95% percentile of every person on earth, so compared to experts you'd basically be at their level without their knowledge 1 every 20 days.

If this works based on your personal skill, you could get technically on the top 5% of the top 5% by getting all their skill and knowledge.

But since we know that these 'experts' and hedgefund managers can't even do better than random chance most of the time, and even the times they do it can be attributed to random chance, the skill becomes less useful.
