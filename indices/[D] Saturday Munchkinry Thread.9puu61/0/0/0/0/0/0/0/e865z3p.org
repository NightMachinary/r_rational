You're assuming this trading skill is much more powerful than I'm assuming it is.

The average trader performs with the market because the market will grow anyway and with enough diversification you'll get the same growth the market did. It's not a skill related outcome, it's an expected outcome based on statistics.

i.e the market is a massive sample, it's going to move. A trader picks stocks from the sample, his picks will move and so will the market.

All he's doing is getting a small sample of the results of the market. This small sample size can be higher than the market, or lower. But on average over a long enough period of time it will equal that of the market.

To keep it short, there's little impact from skill on stock trading / investing if at all. You could maybe (if skill has any effect on this) get an average 5% extra from the market rate consistently with the top 1% skill in the planet.

With a top 5% you'd get maybe 2% advantage on the market on average. While that's not bad it's not as great as you are thinking it is.

TLDR the bell curve is not that wide. So while you could do well, it's like 1-5% better than average give or take.

And that's depending on where the base value is taken, from your skill or average skill, and if skill has any effect on stock returns.
