  All he's doing is getting a small sample of the results of the market. This small sample size can be higher than the market, or lower. But on average over a long enough period of time it will equal that of the market.

That's exactly my point, that you're not relying on skill but just the fact that it's as though you're picking only the best subset of the random results you would expect to get from normal trading.

Again you're not necessarily impacting your skill here you're skewing probability, so having every trade you make be as good as the best 1/20 trades (assuming the most extreme case where you always roll a 20) of someone else is /insanely/ good.
