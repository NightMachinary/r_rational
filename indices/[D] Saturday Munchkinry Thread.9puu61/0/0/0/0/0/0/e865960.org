  So seeing that even the most skilled at it are fairly incapable of beating the market, I'd say that if you got the top 5% of the expert outcomes you could make some money.

It says the top 5% of outcomes for a specific attempt you're applying the roll to, which is a very different thing from getting the /average/ outcomes that you would expect from the top 5% of people.\\
If it uses your base then you're still going to do much better than average simply by trading in a basically competent manner and getting the outcomes people who do that get a minority of the time, since again beating the market isn't possible typically. If it's going off the average then you should expect the exact same outcome because almost by definition the average trader performs at market level since the market is the average of the constituent traders.\\
Getting the top 5% of expert outcomes is absolutely amazing if you're getting the outcomes the best traders can only normally get 5% of the time, and importantly since you're only picking good rolls you can consistently do this (well not top 5% say since you won't have either roll be 20 most of the days, but still very good) so you won't have any failures which average out your successes.

Importantly the advantage here is going to also be massively amplified by the fact everybody will want to give you their money to invest since you can substantially outcompete everyone else. So eventually you'll likely become a fixture of the financial market and probably the richest person alive since a massive portion of all financial trades will flow through you with you taking some small cut.
