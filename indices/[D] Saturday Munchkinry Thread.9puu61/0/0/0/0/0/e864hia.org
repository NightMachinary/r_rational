I'm fairly sure you get the top 5% based on your base, or the world's base, depending on the skill. i.e there's a bell curve of possible outcomes, you get the top 5% of that curve, the curve is based on either your skill or average skill..

From what I know and read, nobody beats the stock market consistently. They can technically do it for a few years because of random chance, but then they return to the mean.

So seeing that even the most skilled at it are fairly incapable of beating the market, I'd say that if you got the top 5% of the expert outcomes you could make some money.

You could get rich out of this, but it's just not as OP as some people are thinking.
