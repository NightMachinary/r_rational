  I don't think you could influence elections with this. You can effect one roll, elections are too complex for a single roll cause a visible change.

You missed the whole point which is that you only need to affect the roll for the success of your bet on the election results.

  PS. It's take decades to become the richest person in the world or even just billionaire using only the stock market returns, even starting with a large sum of money. Even with a hedge fund, you could maybe get a large annual bonus + salary out every year, in addition to your personal returns, but that's it.

Again this misses the point because while people can't normally make cash from beating the market this way that's because /they can't beat the market/, but /you can/. Plus if you're offering good enough returns the hedge fund could just funnel the cut of the profits you make directly to you personally, normal hedge funds need not be your guide.
