  You missed the whole point which is that you only need to affect the roll for the success of your bet on the election results.

Have you ever played DnD? Are you aware that there are rolls you can make that even with a 20 you never win? The winner is decided, your roll may make you not lose money on your bet by people not charging you, but it won't change the winner of the election. There are limitations, it's not just this BS system where you have a 5% chance of doing anything you want.

  Again this misses the point because while people can't normally make cash from beating the market this way that's because they can't beat the market, but you can. Plus if you're offering good enough returns the hedge fund could just funnel the cut of the profits you make directly to you personally, normal hedge funds need not be your guide.

That's jail bait my friend.
