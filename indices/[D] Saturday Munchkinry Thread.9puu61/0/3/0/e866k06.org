  For that 24 hour span you can replace your "natural roll," or that of someone you can see, with one of these numbers, 1 being a critical fumble and 20 a critical success.

I don't think you could influence elections with this. You can effect one roll, elections are too complex for a single roll cause a visible change.

​

You could make politicians stutter or trip though, so that's fun..

PS. It's take decades to become the richest person in the world or even just billionaire using only the stock market returns, even starting with a large sum of money. Even with a hedge fund, you could maybe get a large annual bonus + salary out every year, in addition to your personal returns, but that's it.

People rarely get rich young from stocks, business is where the 'quick money' (10 year time investment) is at.
