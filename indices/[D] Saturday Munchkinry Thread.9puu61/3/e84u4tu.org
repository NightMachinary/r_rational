Your superpower is forcing other people to listen to you.

When engaged in a conversation the other party is unable to leave or to change the topic on their own accord. They are unable to ignore your arguments, and must react to them in a meaningful way. They may lie or deceive you, or even stay silent, but they must at least listen to you and consider your position.

Lastly: this is just a subconscious reaction, but they may realize their own behavior afterwards if they reflect upon it.
