Yes. However, I'm not sure if somebody will figure out your paranormal power (or mistake it for some kind of evil mind manipulation) if you use it on the masses. That /might/ ruin your reputation. Same goes for completely converting a politician from "bad" to "good".

If other people talked with a local politician and suddenly all started voting more responsible, I'd be startled and confused.

I think becoming a lobbyist works better. This way you have access to many private conversations with selected politicians, and as political decisions always are made by countless parties, you can simply target the neutral and undecided representatives. It's subtle and as long as you artificially reduce your rate of success, you should stay under the radar.

In the end you goal could be creating more rational agents in politics, preferably ones who align with your own moral values. I don't think you can really convince people of latter just by forcing them to consider your position, but reminding them of various biases sounds fine. Should be enough to make an impact on politics and the world.
