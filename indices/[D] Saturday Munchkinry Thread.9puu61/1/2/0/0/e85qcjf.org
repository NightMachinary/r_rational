  I'm not sure how you'd convince CEOs and politicians to do the chant with you

That's what I meant about tricky logistics, yes. But I don't think it's an insurmountable challenge. All you need to do is to get a meeting with /one/ influential person, and ensure that they're interested in the interaction as well (i. e., won't get rid of you at the first opportunity). Perhaps whammy one of their less famous relatives first, suggest to them to arrange a meeting.

Once you're talking, convincing them shouldn't be hard: you could try to set it up as a joke, or lie your head off about this new fascinating psychological effect which could be witnessed when, for example, people play pattycake, we could /exploit/ it in our business practice, and would they like a demonstration?

Then just suggest to your new friend to schedule meetings with his other influential friends, and have them introduce you as "eccentric, but brilliant".
