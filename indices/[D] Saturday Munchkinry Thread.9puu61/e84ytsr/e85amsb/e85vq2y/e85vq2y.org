sword?

not really sure that would be the best tactic in a comic book world with real physics...

i would go with tank, stealth tech, power amour (I assume you meant that with full plate), sniper rifle, gun (maybe laser weapons) and spear for prepared melee and knife/sword cane always on me.

but yeah I think petey can't afford that...

I see your comic book career:

go pro athlete

buy big houses and other expensive stuff (weapons?)

your powers get discovered, you get fired

bills (shouldn't have used loans), legal fees...

you get bankrupt...

you rob a bank/investor/anti-doping agency chef

you get arrested

you go full villain

Sorry, but that is how comics work. ;-) Also you will never be able to sell technologies... just use them to rob banks.

petey could sell his webs to clothes manufactures. He only needs to add UV blockers.

but they would steal it and he gets arrested for his revenge attempts...
