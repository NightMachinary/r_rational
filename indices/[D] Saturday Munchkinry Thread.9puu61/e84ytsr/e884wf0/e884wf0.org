/Why/ would I fight? I have no interest in being a vigilante. And as cool as swinging across the city looks, it's also super dangerous - one webshooter malfunction and I crash down into the middle of a highway? No, thanks.

Though, crawling up buildings could be fun, but I imagine it'll lead to some very tense conversations with security guards and/or police officers.
