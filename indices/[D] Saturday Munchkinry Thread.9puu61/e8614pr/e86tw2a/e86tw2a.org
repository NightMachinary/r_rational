if you get to lvl 7:

- illusionist should choose hallucinatory terrain as 4th lvl spell

- now you can hide everyone in a 150 feet cube and make it look like a cliff/huge bolder

real munchkinery: * go to plane with different time scale(? / speed up time?) to have more time (you could go to the feywild and hope to be lucky)

- make scrolls of hallucinatory terrain (just 2 weeks and 2.500 GP for each scroll)

- go back and cast it around walls... maybe make it seem like the walls are cliffs(?) and there is a river around it (there should be water or the illusion fails)

- hope they leave before the spell duration (24h) ends... maybe use one scroll to make a small (150 feet cube) replica of Town farther away, so army thinks Town is in that direction (and farther away than the illusion)

Hope for Natural 20 strategies:

If you don't get to 7th level use minor illusion/silent image to make a really tiny Town in the distance. You probably need to get close to the leader with disguise self or something like it or your familiars. Maybe the artificer can enchant the enemies leaders telescope so whoever looks north/south/east through it sees the town in a realistic position (always at the same distance)

You would need to take out scouting parties or convince them the town is there.

I just realized Town may be already under siege. Then those strategies would be useless...

If the main strategy is useless... Instead maybe convince them, they got tricked by an illusion and the town isn't there at all. It is all some kind of trap... maybe the walls are where a dragon sleeps... or tesseraque... or something... or in reality there is only a wood wall and behind it are traps and pitfalls or just a hill... Best if someone makes his checks, they get told they see the illusion of Town. If someone fails there checks, they believe there is a dragon/hill/tesseraque hidden under the illusion of Town. (You would need to convince your DM that that works)

basically you would need to make two or more illusions above each other.

And maybe a way to convince the leaders.

also artificer looks boring... lets your DM make you original stuff? Like a potion that gives everyone who is in range disadvantage against illusions? (or at least a -5/-4/-3/-2/-1 ). Smoke grenades would work. Maybe just burn stuff for smoke...

honestly not sure what else the illusionist can do... I think I am to strict with the no harm vow. (are pitfalls hidden with illusions allowed? they could be just tunnels and the Hezrou would be the only ones heavy enough to collapse the tunnels with spikes and other surprises in it)

What spells have the warlock and artificer?

Any magic items of interest? (something that gives you new abilities not just more damage/better stats)
