Just have the Artificer make a Giant Eagle as their Mechanical Servant and put the fighter with Sharpshooter on their back with a bag of holding full of arrows and maybe a spare bow. Optionally, cast (regular) invisibility on the Giant Eagle (it won't be making attack rolls, and thus won't break invisibility).

Send the pair out to kill the army. Let the fighter just shoot into the army below from maximum range (see if the DM will let you shoot an extra 5 feet due to shooting directly down) -- this'll make it so nothing the Gnolls have can hit you. Focus the Hezrou if you want, but no reason not to just kill the full army. Primary constraints are whatever the DM decides exhaustion should be for the Giant Eagle and the Fighter, and just how "by the rules" they play ranges (since, they could in theory say "You're max range with a longbow is the same as the Gnoll's, thus if you shoot at them from 600 feet in the air, they can also shoot at you from the ground. I'm going to roll 200 attack rolls against you now.").

Likely, you should be able to kill the 12 Hezrou via Sharp Shooter Longbow (by my math, each arrow will do ~(1d8+15) / 2 ~ 10 damage, and about every other arrow will hit a Hezrou. Given the fighter can fire 2 arrows a round, this means it'll take about two and a half minute to take down a Hezrou.

Presumably, the Giant Eagle can fly in a holding pattern for at least a half hour, which should be enough to take out all the Hezrou in a single flight. If they stick around, they could also solo the full army -- Gnolls should drop in 1 or 2 hits with sharpshooter.

Greater Invisibility is nice, but only marginally useful since it only lasts 1 minute, and it'll take more than 1 minute to do anything worthwhile with arrows.
