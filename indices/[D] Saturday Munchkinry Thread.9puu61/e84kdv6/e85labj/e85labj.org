It seems like the best primary use of this ability (though it has some use in medical testing as pointed out by boomfarmer) by far is getting rich people to pay you exorbitant fees to transfer various disorders from them to people they pay to accept their conditions for them. Given the whole pattycake thing you're not really likely to be able to transfer conditions to unwilling recipients.\\
This is still the best strategy even from an altruistic standpoint since you could give most of the money to charity.

Once your abilities become high profile enough you could probably find some terminally ill people willing to take on an arbitrary amount of potentially very bad conditions for the greater good (and in exchange for payment to their families). After you've found those willing recipients you will be able to massively step up your operations healing thousands of people per day and making staggering sums of money in the process.
