Thank you for the input!

Humans can pass "harmlessly" through it, their clothes are targetable, so you could "throw" a force field at a human that would hit their clothes, and their hair if it was sufficiently long enough, and those would either hold them back or be ripped off of them, depending on the amount of force being used

This is for a particular character in a story I'm working on, and the character does eventually use telekinesis to move things into orbit, but I'm trying to bridge the narrative gap.

1. Student/Young professional
2. Telekinesis
3. ???
4. Profit
5. SpaceX

I'm imagining they invest in/buy calls on a stock and use TK in some way to discreetly assist a company. If that fails, then they may short a company and cause them some minor issue that causes a small drop they can profit from. If all else failed they may resort to theft, but the character in question would probably sooner go semi-public with their power or go to work for the government.
