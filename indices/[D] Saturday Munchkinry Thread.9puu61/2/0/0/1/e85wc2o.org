he makes a student/nano satellite and throws it up there and sells services (like gps or spy satellites... satellite phones... )

he could make really good magic tricks...

there are those street performers that pretend to be floating

[[https://www.google.com/search?q=street+performance+floating+man]]

could be a nice student job... he still can study.... (if someone is looking for tk people not so great)

just to get enough money for rent...

or sell magic training stones... you focus your mana in to them and they float... instead of $199,99 just $99,99 for a short period...

well, he could also make stuff (like clean highways or make shoes) if he can multitask

or make really small watches...

well, robot challenges should be still able to winnable through cheating

he could just use private financed ones with a false name and a wig...
