a force field that doesn't prevent a human fist?

I assume it doesn't work around humans (or you could target their clothes)

it looks like telekinesis can generate more energy than the human body. So turn a generator for electricity (boring)

maybe steal money (not really a good way to make money)

push satellites into orbit... and sell pictures... and sell your own gps...

look up prizes you could get with cheating (like use your power to make your robot win some DARPA challenge)

sell people a fuel efficiency elixier/crystal/sticker and use your power to cheat at tests

can you make atoms/molecules react? in a macro scale? if you can make some expansive chemicals (like enzymes)

get the remote without standing up
