The gnolls are not the problem. Between the men-at-arms and the unbroken walls, they should be driven off even without the party's involvement. The hezrou are the problem; all strategies should concentrate entirely on eliminating/destroying these creatures.

I'm not familiar with 5e, but is it possible for your Alchemist to create an Apple Of Discord-like item - that is, something that everyone who sees it wants and will fight for? Dropping one of those in the path of the oncoming army will drastically improve your odds as they stop to fight amongst themselves.
