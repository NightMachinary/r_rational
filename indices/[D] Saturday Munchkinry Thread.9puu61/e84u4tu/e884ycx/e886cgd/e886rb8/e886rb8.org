That's the thing. I can make people think about their votes, and consider where to place them. But, in the process, these are people who have actual /reasons/ for voting how they do - I am, in the end, doing little more than encouraging a certain amount of self-analysis. Their reasons for voting - or choosing - as they do do not go away just because they're forced to rethink things. Indeed, there's every chance that they'll rethink yet come to exactly the same conclusions as they did the first time around.

That local politician? If he's voting the way that he is because he's getting a bit of money on the side, or because someone's putting pressure on him outside of the public eye, or because he genuinely does not care about the people he represents - well, whichever way he is, my polite query isn't going to change any of those factors. (In fact, by +encouraging+enforcing self-reflection, I may be merely improving his rationalisations).
