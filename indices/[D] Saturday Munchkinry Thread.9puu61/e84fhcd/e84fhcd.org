You gain the ability to use Portent dice, as for a Divination Wizard in 5th edition D&D.

At midnight each night, two random numbers between 1 and 20 pop into your head. (You can roll 2d20 yourself as long as you do it within 5 seconds of midnight.) For that 24 hour span you can replace your "natural roll," or that of someone you can see, with one of these numbers, 1 being a critical fumble and 20 a critical success. Once you use a number it vanishes, and unused numbers vanish at midnight.

That said, it's only a d20. Getting a 20 for Portent means you can guarantee one action you take that day resulting in an outcome in the 95th percentile--you're not gonna win the lottery, but a nat 20 on your Charisma check when asking out that cute barista would probably get you a date.

Given that it's unpredictable (some days you'll get two 12s) and that the best-case scenario is 2 chances to limit results to either the top or bottom 5%, how do you munchkin your fancy new power?
