  Still even if that was the case (which clearly isn't) you CAN do it with a 5% chance. And because of your power have other people bet and manipulate their rolls..

The fact that would be kind of broken doesn't really count against it, since the whole point of this exercise is finding ways to munchkin things.

  I'm sure a lot of people are going to put their investment money in a fund in Kongo or some other. Besides to trade in the american market the company has to be taxed in america, so you'll get taxed american taxes. Even if you live in fantasy tax haven #69.

Sure you might need to pay some taxes, but if you aren't in the US nor is your hedge fund it doesn't seem like you are going to need to pay income tax at the very least. Plus it's entirely possible you could work out any number of other legal methods of investing other people's money for them in exchange for a fee without having it be an actual hedge fund.
