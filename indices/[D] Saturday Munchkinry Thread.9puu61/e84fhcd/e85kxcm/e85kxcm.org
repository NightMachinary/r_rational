Well as already pointed out you can use this to get rich off the stock market. However once you've become the richest person alive you could do much more by setting up prediction markets and betting on the outcome of particular events happening. That way you can use your probability manipulation to skew pretty much all major world events in whichever direction you want which will massively add up in terms of long term influence. For instance many election come pretty close so you could swing a massive number of election by doing this.
