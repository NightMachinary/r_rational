  True but you'd get a 50% tax on that or something absurd, so you'd basically be throwing money in the trash.

Given the scale involved here you'd probably just want to go move to some tax haven so you can mostly disregard taxes anyway.

  A hedgefund's profit are not that high either, it does not equal it's returns. A few million maybe if that depending on the size of the fund.\\
  It'd also take years to build the fund, get clients, do marketing, build a brand. Not even counting the years it'd take for you to get recognition for your skills and to have a good track record.

Given nobody else can even approach your gains and you can deliberately spend high rolls on figuring out which extremely high risk stocks to pick, comparing you to a normal investor would seem very wrong. After all if you deliberately go with strategies that are high risk high reward (normally) you can basically ignore the risk since you're guaranteed to get a good result.
