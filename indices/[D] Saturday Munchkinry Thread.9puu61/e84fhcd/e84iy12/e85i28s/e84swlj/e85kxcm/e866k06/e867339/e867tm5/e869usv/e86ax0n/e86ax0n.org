  Well yeah there's a reason I specified that the elections had to be close so it could plausibly go either way. If the winner is already nearly certain it wouldn't much matter, but some probability manipulation can still do a lot. It never said we were talking about actually increasing your skill here.

A close election still has a winner. By your logic you could kill anybody or destroy the world by betting enough times that will happen..

  If you're the one you actually owns the hedge fend there's no reason your salary can't be basically equal to what the hedge fund makes in profits.

True but you'd get a 50% tax on that or something absurd, so you'd basically be throwing money in the trash.

A hedgefund's profit are not that high either, it does not equal it's returns. A few million maybe if that depending on the size of the fund.

It'd also take years to build the fund, get clients, do marketing, build a brand. Not even counting the years it'd take for you to get recognition for your skills and to have a good track record..

You can give yourself dividends. Those can technically equal your profits, but you'll still be taxed by a large amount. So yeah technically it works but it's not as strong as you think.
