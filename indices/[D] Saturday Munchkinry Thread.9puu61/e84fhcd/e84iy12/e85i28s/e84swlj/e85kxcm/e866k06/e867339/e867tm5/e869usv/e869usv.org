  Have you ever played DnD? Are you aware that there are rolls you can make that even with a 20 you never win? The winner is decided, your roll may make you not lose money on your bet by people not charging you, but it won't change the winner of the election. There are limitations, it's not just this BS system where you have a 5% chance of doing anything you want.

Well yeah there's a reason I specified that the elections had to be close so it could plausibly go either way. If the winner is already nearly certain it wouldn't much matter, but some probability manipulation can still do a lot. It never said we were talking about actually increasing your skill here.

  That's jail bait my friend.

If you're the one you actually owns the hedge fend there's no reason your salary can't be basically equal to what the hedge fund makes in profits.
