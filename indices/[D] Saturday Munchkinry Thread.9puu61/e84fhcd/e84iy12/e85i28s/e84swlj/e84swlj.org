The real power is that you know what you rolled. If you portent a 1, do your thing with a 1 and then do the opposite.

Attempt to flip a coin to see if protons do decay; heads they do, tails they don't. Regardless of if you know the answer, it's a 50-50 chance. So, if your portent was 11-20, you know you flipped correct and if your portent was 1-10, you know the opposite is correct.

Imagine a game with a clock labeled 1 through 20. In this game you must roll a d20 against some target x between 1 and 20 on the clock. You get points equal to the number of spaces you need to go clockwise around the clock to go from your roll to the target, with a direct hit being worth 20 points.

So if the target is 5 and you rolled a 3, you get 2 points. If you rolled a 6, you get 19 points.

Irrespective of the target, the scores will be uniformly distributed from 1-20, so your portent will equal your score. So, you can get what the target is by starting from your game roll and moving clockwise a number of spaces equal to your portent.

Then, play the game with the target being the nth digit of some string of text you would like to know encoded in base 20.

You can get about 8.6 bits of information with this method each day, and a kilobyte in around 3 years.
