You win the stock market every day you get a 15+ by giving yourself a 75% chance of choosing good stocks for the day on a luck roll. You don't ask for the best stocks, just stocks which will rise, which is roughly 50% of them anyway. You could become the first hedge fund manager who actually beats the market consistently by moving out of the market when you get crappy rolls.

Furthermore, putting bad numbers on others' sense motive checks and good ones on your charisma checks means getting clients is easier. Money is the best superpower, and this one is really easy to turn into a lot of money.
