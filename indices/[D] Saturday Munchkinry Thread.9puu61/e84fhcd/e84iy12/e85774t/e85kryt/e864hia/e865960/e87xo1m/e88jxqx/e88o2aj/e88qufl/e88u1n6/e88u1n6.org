Years? I see the problem. You can execute one natural twenty trade every ten days on average. That is not enough volume to increase market efficiency, but it will double your stake on an incredibly short turnaround. Every month in more volatile markets. That is why I say the concern about time is ridiculus - you gain very little by raising capital where you do not own the full returns, and in fact, since it makes your volume larger, it may even cripple your earning capability, because there are not a lot of high-volatility markets for billion dollar investments.

And trying to own the market really will just get you dead. The stock market is meant to be a mechanism for capital allocation, not a way to become king of the world. If it starts to become the latter, that does not mean they hand you a crown, it means they shut you down.
