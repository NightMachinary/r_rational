  You are still massively raising both your public profile and the complexity of your financial structure in order to, what, cut down the your time to get super rich.. very marginally? Noone is going to invest until you have a track record. Once you have a track record of good trades long enough to be compelling, you are also going to already have a very substantial bankroll. So involving more people in your stock market shenanigans is utterly pointless.

How much you'd cut down your time is debatable because you'd be showing dramatically better results than anyone else that aren't limited to just one area like you'd expect from somebody using insider trading or the like. So I suspect you could get some money to speed things along a few years in your plans from some people willing to take interest in high risk high return investments.\\
Still this early stage is ultimately not as important and will last less than a decade either way before you can start the next stage in your plans.

  It also makes rich people richer through no merit of theirs - Literally, you are proposing to turn yourself into an "I win" button for the 0.1%, who will be making bank not because of canny investing, or any other fact except that they had a bunch of cash on hand when you started.

The point is that the status quo stays exactly the same except now a few percent of the global GDP is being funneled to you and various organizations under your control. While you can certainly own many massive companies there's limits to how much power you can accrue this way. Whereas by making yourself an integral part of the financial sector (plus you'd probably make the market more efficient which would improve economic growth) you can start accruing enough wealth to equal a large nation in power.
