Everyone will want to invest with you, and you should say no.

Whatever your starting stake is, it will grow absurdly quickly. And as long as you are only managing your own money, all of the stake is yours.

Managing other peoples money gets you a faster ramp, but ramp-up is not your problem. Â¨

Not making giant waves and getting bloody well assassinated is. For whatever your target level of personal wealth is, you will be less of a disruptive force in the market if you only execute trades with your own money to get there. Sure, you could end up controlling a huge faction of all trades as a money manager.. but that just de-legitimatizes the market as a social mechanism, which you do not want.

Heck, in general, I would recommend just not ever appearing on the forbes list of the ultra rich - you can always earn more money, so you have no particular need of a huge bankroll unless you have a specific project you need funded. (Molten salts Thorium reactor commercial scale prototype! )
