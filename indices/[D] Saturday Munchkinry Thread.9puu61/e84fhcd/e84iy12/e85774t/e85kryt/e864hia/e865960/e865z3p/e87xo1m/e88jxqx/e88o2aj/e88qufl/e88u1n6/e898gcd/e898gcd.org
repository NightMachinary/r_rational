  Years? I see the problem. You can execute one natural twenty trade every ten days on average. That is not enough volume to increase market efficiency, but it will double your stake on an incredibly short turnaround.

Well you don't really need the number to be a 20 for it to still be pretty advantageous anything over a ten should beat the market if a 10.5 is /average/. Plus numbers 10 or below are about equally useful, since I can make a small trade and apply that roll to it, then short the company with a much larger some of cash on my own and take advantage of the lower performance than usual of my small trade. So it's important to note that I can basically make 2 large investments/shorts every day with them just being successful to different degrees.\\
Importantly though the roll doesn't just say it applies to skill/ability style checks so you could use it to enhance the performance of an existing stock or (as pointed out in my answer regarding prediction markets) to alter the probability of practically anything and thus steer world events.

Also worth noting is that once it becomes obvious how well your investments always do people will start copying you thus causing investments that would otherwise have only been top 5% (if a 20) instead do much better, with the same also being true for your shorts.

At this point though I do doubt there's really much point to actually doing hedge fund type stuff beyond /maybe/ a short initial period if you can find interested high risk investors. Since you seem better suited to just trade stocks yourself since you can accomplish the same effect.

  And trying to own the market really will just get you dead. The stock market is meant to be a mechanism for capital allocation, not a way to become king of the world. If it starts to become the latter, that does not mean they hand you a crown, it means they shut you down.

You're not going to be king of the world though, you're just siphoning a portion of global GDP to yourself and various organizations connected to you. The effects are distributed enough to not be massively noticeable to many individuals and certainly not enough to cause much outrage. Plus much of that earnings will be from the success of companies you own, since you can save the really good rolls for buying startups that will later turn out to be the best 5%.
