I think you're vastly overstating the risk of assassination here, how often do you hear about billionaires getting assassinated after all? Plus you can certainly afford the level of protection afforded to world leaders.

As for managing other people's money if you're taking say a 5% cut, then you could possibly speed things up pretty quickly to the point where you don't need to take other people's money. At a certain point though making the financial system heavily reliant on you will allow levels of profit not otherwise possible without causing more issues than otherwise. If every billionaire or massive company has to accept some very small fee to you in order to stay competitive with everyone else I really doubt that's going to be something that voters will care all that much about.
