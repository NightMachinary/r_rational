You are still massively raising both your public profile and the complexity of your financial structure in order to, what, cut down the your time to get super rich.. very marginally? Noone is going to invest until you have a track record. Once you have a track record of good trades long enough to be compelling, you are also going to already have a very substantial bankroll. So involving more people in your stock market shenanigans is utterly pointless.

It also makes rich people richer through no merit of theirs - Literally, you are proposing to turn yourself into an "I win" button for the 0.1%, who will be making bank not because of canny investing, or any other fact except that they had a bunch of cash on hand when you started.

Why on earth would you do this?
