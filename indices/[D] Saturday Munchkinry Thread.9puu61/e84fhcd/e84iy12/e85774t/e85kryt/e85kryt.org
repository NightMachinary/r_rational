  I just thought of this, doesn't this dice only mean you make a choice at the top 95% percentile of every person on earth, so compared to experts you'd basically be at their level without their knowledge 1 every 20 days.

It gives you an /outcome/ in the top 5%, and most of the trading done in the stock market is being done by experts anyway. So given how much chance there is in the stock market getting a number above a 10 is going to make you outperform the market since plenty of people already outperform the market /on a specific trade/. The difference which gives you a massive advantage is that you /always/ outperform the market.
