Wouldn't this just make you 95% better at making predictions at a 20, but since making accurate predictions is very unlikely specially in vague terms like specific letters in a phrase, it'd amount to very little since you'd only be 95% better than wrong 99% of the time?

Assuming average is a low value being on the 95% percentile of that is still low, unless you have a very wide bell curve going on. An IRL example like height you'd end up around 6'3, so not very useful, 95% percentile of IQ is also nothing insane (less than 130).

So you can see that the effectiveness of this is not high enough to do this kind of thing.

But I guess you could spend years and somehow get to something useful with this method..
