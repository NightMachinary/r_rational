This time I have a power from a children's book to munchkin:

You have the ability to "absorb" diseases and physical issues from people by playing pattycake with them and doing a specific chant about the issue you're absorbing. You can also pass those issues on to other people in a similar way. The person you're absorbing or passing on issues to must consent to playing pattycake with you and say the chant at least once, though they don't have to know what will happen. You can also recover from diseases and physical issues quicker. How do you use this power?

(For the record, I use "physical issues" because the original story had stuff like hiccups and bloating being transferred.)
