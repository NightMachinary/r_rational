Telekinesis is a frequent subject covered here but I wasn't able to find a previous thread that addressed this particular question:

Telekinesis with no real rules about what can be moved except it doesn't work on humans. It can be used as a projected force field and the field itself can be shaped, and there can be subdivisions within the field. A competent user could for example form a massive torus and accelerate the air to incredibly high temperatures. It can also be used for more simple brute force, like throwing a force field to stop a car. The fields can also be brought close together and have a fairly high upper boundary of how much pressure they can exert, perhaps as high as 100 gigapascals. I see for commercial work a common use of this ability being excavation, as it's very well suited to moving dirt and it can be used to tear stone apart, as projecting the fields has no rules other than it ignores humans.

How could you munchkin this power to make money in a way people don't know about? You have limited starting capital, you can probably get up to around 50K-250K in a small business loan. Detection is paramount, you can't be caught using the power and you also want to avoid being too suspicious/conspicuous. That's an arbitrary line, but I trust your judgment.
