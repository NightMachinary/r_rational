The party, after a gruelling journey, has arrived at the city of Town, populated by around 10,000 people. They narrowly managed to outrun the horde of perhaps 4,000 gnolls, evil super-strong hyena-people who were hot on their tails. With perhaps 1,500 men-at-arms and the unbroken walls of the city, can the party turn the army away, or failing that, save the people from the horde?

This is all Dungeons and Dragons 5e.

We, the party, are 6:

- A Wizard (Illusionist) who is sworn to harm no creature.

- A Bard (Swords) who is the party face

- A Warlock (Celestial) who is the primary healer

- A [[https://media.wizards.com/2016/dnd/downloads/1_UA_Artificer_20170109.pdf][UA Artificer]] (Alchemist) who can make items

- A fighter (??) who can use both sword and bow

- A pugilist, who refuses to share any information with the party.

The town's walls are defensible, but the enemy has among their numbers 12 Hezrou, spread out throughout the horde, which are living siege engines. Seeing as the heroes are among the only people who can make a difference with regards to the oversize demons, we have been saddled with that particular responsibility. We are all *level 5* at the moment, but have acquired enough XP to move to *level 6* on a long rest. However, we have opted to explore the catacombs beneath the city to try to find a tunnel out of the city, either away from the main body of the horde, or directly underneath it. We intend to delve the catacomb again before we rest to find an area to keep the civilians, which might bring us up to *level 7*. How can we defeat 12 CR8 Hezrou, given that they are surrounded by 100s of CR1/2 gnolls each, before next morning when the gnolls will likely attack?

Details:

- The Wizard and Warlock both have familiars.

- The Artificer might be able to enchant the Fighter's weapon to deal magic damage.

- We have found a long tunnel in the catacombs, but we don't know which direction it leads. Finding which way is goes is helpful.

- The demons were presumably not summoned by a creature, but rather entered the world through portals (think Out of the Abyss).

- We have potential allies - both a teleportation circle within the town might bring in a powerful hero, or a Green Dragon ally who split up with up before we got to the town. Both might be contacted with a Sending (which the Wizard does not have yet), but should not be relied on.

- The men-at-arms have ballistas arming the walls. These might take out one or two Hezrou on their own, but shouldn't be relied on.

- The horde outnumbers the men-at-arms. If the wall falls, it's over.

Ideas we've had (reveal after giving it a little thought)

- Level 6: Have the Bard cast Dissonant Whispers to get the Hezrou to attack the gnolls around them - the gnolls have no ability to de-escalate and will attack the Hezrou back

- Level 6: Have the Wizard Disguise Self/Tongues to infiltrate the gnoll camp while the bard does his thing - Disguise Self gives no save, only revealed on investigation, so could take advantage of the chaos caused by the bard to abuse pack mentality and get gnolls to attack other Hezrou

- Level 6: Get the Fighter the Sharpshooter feat or the Warlock the Eldritch Spear invocation (Level 7) and Fly them above the camp, so they can rain down terror from above. Ideally combined with Greater Invisibility (Level 7).

- Get the Artificer's Mechanical Servant to be a Large Eagle and use Enlarge on it to get it to carry rubble and bombard the enemy camps.

- The pugilist has Mold Earth - teach it to the casters within the city and have them start digging escape tunnels. Alternately, make tunnels under the gnoll camp for quick collapse and exfiltration.
