I can only come up with marginally effective strategies. And I'm using internet sources, so I hope it's all canon.

​

I would split the party.

- Have the Artificer work on the ballistae; load them up with spells (like protection from evil to make them last longer in the fight) and formulae. A tanglefoot ballista could wreck the plan of an army. See if the villagers can make large scale alchemical fire under his guidance.
- Have the pugilist to direct villagers to make traps with mold earth. The illusionist can cover them later.
- Have the bard, illusionist, and maybe warlock make the enemy's night before battle a living hell. Start fires everywhere with prestidigitation and invisible servant. Use acid or poison (if available on food supplies) Use enthrall to make the enemy fight each other. Blind hezrou or use illusions to make them stomp around. Use loud noises and alarm spells so they don't sleep. Smokesticks plus illusion to make them think there's an invading enemy. Invisibility and impersonation would help a lot here. Ask the DM for will save modifiers for sleepless gnolls, and then use enthrall again during the battle.\\
- Point out to the DM that gnolls love fighting each other and do it all the time anyways.
- Were this another DnD, I would have the warlock counter summoning or dispelling demons, but 5e's don't have that power for reasons?
- Weaken a section of the walls for a killing zone when it falls. Have it prepared with alchemical fire, archers, and all sorts of nastiness.
