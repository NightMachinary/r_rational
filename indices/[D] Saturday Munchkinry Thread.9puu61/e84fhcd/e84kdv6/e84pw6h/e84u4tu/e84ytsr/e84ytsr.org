you are spiderman in a world with real physics

your powers:

sticky feet and hands (through cloth and you can turn it off)

fast reflexes (not a danger sense or precognition)

superstrength (you can lift cars and survive some hits)

tools:

web shooters (including web)

How would you fight?

Cause I think spidey could lift stronger opponents up and keep them from getting leverage. (like the hulk) If he sticks his feet to the ground and his hands on the back of his opponent

And groups could be webbed together (he does it sometimes but mostly he webbes only single people). he could also swing and uses the webline (or a second one) to knock them over. (not sure if I made myself clear)

of course I want also to know how would someone be able to beat spidey

either one of his villains... heroes he worked with... or normal people (of course their powers have to follow somewhat the laws of physics too)
