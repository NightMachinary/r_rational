  If that was the case in my neighbourhood and I could stop them without too much risk (cause superpowers). I would do that.

One thing to bear in mind is, the powers under discussion (Spiderman, but with inhumanly fast reflexes instead of actual danger sense) will /not/ remove the risk. Nothing in this power set protects you from a bullet in the back. (Bullets outrun their own sound, so you can't hear it before it hits).

On top of that, simply becoming a vigilante and beating up criminals has a bad habit of leading to your becoming simply a bigger thug, unless you are in some way answerable to someone else for your actions.

Also, in all honesty, wearing a mask and a costume is a /terrible/ way to hide your identity in real life.

Given all of the above, I'd suggest that in the hypothetical in question (i.e. you have the powers described in the original post /and/ there is a lot of crime in your neighbourhood) then joining the police is a far superior action to becoming a vigilante - you get better supplies, more help, the ability to call on backup, etc.

And, even if the police as a whole tend to the corrupt, you can still try to change that around - pay attention /personally/ to the little crimes, and so on.
