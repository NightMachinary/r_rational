Well I'm not that into comic books. So I was answering as if, I was peter on earth.

On earth the powers wouldn't be discovered, you'd be strong and fast. Maybe the top athlete in history, there's no doping involved so that wouldn't stop you.

And sports organizations don't care if you have a mutation that can give you an advantage, nowadays most sports are dominated by people with genes that give them advantages anyway, i.e height, arm length, long legs, higher O2 capacity etc.

I doubt you'd even learn you could climb walls, unless you try, and who in normal circumstances would try that ?

So it'd be more like, assuming peter lvl intelligence or even average if you want, pro athlete make millions, retire early or don't depending on how the situation is.

If you made more than 5 million, you can technically live the rest of your live with 100k+ a year only using dividends and bonds. This is the lazy retire early route

Or you could go businessman and go full elon musk if you want.

Swords are good weapons, they can be worn and are light. And as you know, weapons are force multipliers, i.e 1 punch deals x dmg, 1 sword slash deals 3x-10x dmg. Since you're multiplying from a higher base strength value they could cut a lot of things, very powerful. Of course they'd get damaged, but you can replace them.

Now if your world has better weapons, and other comic book tech we don't have sure use that.

PS. large rifles like a sniper rifle are very difficult to use in enclosed spaces, there's a reason militaries all over the world use submachine guns for close quarter combat.

Long weapons get in the way, they are worst at shooting from corners and a lot of other things, do some research if you want.

Besides if you're fighting humans why do you need more damage? A gunshot will kill anybody, multiple shots even more so. Sure they can be armored, but they still go down from it. It still breaks ribs, knocks the air out of their lungs and incapacitates them.

It might not kill, but incapacitating is fine in most combat situations.

But sure as I said if your world has better tech than our own, and peter can get his hands on it, use that.

Just don't assume he can built that in his basement, building things is not limited by intelligence, but by equipment and materials. Unless peter has a full fledged forge in his basement, magical batteries, and future circuits he can't ever 'make' high tech things, even current tech equipment would be very difficult to manufacture.

Just as an example, any retard can google how an assault rifle is made and how it works. But he can't build it at home, no matter how smart he is.

He doesn't have the steel, or the equipment to heat, mold, forge and do all kinds of other things at home. It's an equipment and resource limitation, not intelligence.
