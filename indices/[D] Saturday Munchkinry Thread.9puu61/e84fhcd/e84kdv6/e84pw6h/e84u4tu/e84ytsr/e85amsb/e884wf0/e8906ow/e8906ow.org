Well, it depends...

In 1980 there was much crime in New York. If I believe the interview/docu podcast I heard, that was because police would only investigate crimes if that could make it in the newspaper. (Theft under 10.000$ would be ignored)

If that was the case in my neighbourhood and I could stop them without too much risk (cause superpowers). I would do that.

Now there is another problem there. Police district manager whatever (chiefs?) try to keep the number of crimes low by downgrading crimes to some that wouldn't get tracked by the statistics.

The stop and frisk(?) they do in NY is also because those searches/arrests look good in the statistics...

but yeah, where I live I wouldn't go out fight crime, cause I wouldn't find anything.

But if I know a victim which the police ignores I would help them. And if then more asked for help (via internet or flyers or a bat signal) I wouldn't be able to say no.
