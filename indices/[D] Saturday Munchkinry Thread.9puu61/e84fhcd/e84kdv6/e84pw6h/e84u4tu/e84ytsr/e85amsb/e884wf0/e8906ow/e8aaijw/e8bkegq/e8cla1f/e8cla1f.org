Well, you don't /have/ to become a police officer. My point is merely that becoming a police officer is a superior option to becoming a vigilante; though you have a point, in the case of systemic corruption of the police force, then influencing the person in charge of the whole affair is likely to help more (assuming that such influence is, itself, possible - one must take into account that those benefiting from the corruption might well move to block such attempts, and/or attempt to influence him harder).
