sniper rifle cause I wouldn't want to go near my opponents. Knife, taser, webshooters and gun would be always with me (If I expected always live and death fights). A sword would be to suspicious for everyday use (cane sword maybe). If I expect a fight I would prefer a spear (or something similar) over a sword (better both). and a shield...

yeah I wouldn't expect him to build stuff from scratch . (Even though he did invent his webshooters and "found" the formular for his webs... and most impressive made an awesome costume) I assumed he would buy it... if he got somehow rich...

Well athlete is a good choice. Just not sure if that works out if it is known there are superpowers in the world. Maybe go for car racing... or esports... cause his fast reflexes should help there and I don't think they can dope.

Just keep in mind some (woman) athletes victories got cancelled cause someone found out they had the wrong chromosomes. Nowadays I think that is no reason anymore... too lazy to confirm via google (Just to show some "mutations" are called unfair)

In the movies at first stuff is always sticking on his hand. He only needs to touch a wall to find out he can wall crawling. (But yeah I wouldn't crawl on walls, cause you are only sticking to the paint of the wall. And there is isolation under that. And both aren't designed to hold you. Or webbing...)
