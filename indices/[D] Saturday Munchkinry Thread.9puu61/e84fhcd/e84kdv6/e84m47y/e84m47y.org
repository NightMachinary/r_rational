Several thoughts: you'd be a boon for medical testing purposes, because you would be able to demonstrate the effects of a drug on a person with and without a particular disease.

If the practice has no effect when the song mismatches the disease, with tailored songs you could be used to diagnose specific diseases for which there are no good tests.

You'd also be able to remove complicating ailmets, allowing doctors to treat an ailment in isolation before returning the other ailments.

But all of these require a way to store ailments, which requires a battery of healthyish patients. Enter the prison industry. Reduced sentences for time served as a diseasr battery.
