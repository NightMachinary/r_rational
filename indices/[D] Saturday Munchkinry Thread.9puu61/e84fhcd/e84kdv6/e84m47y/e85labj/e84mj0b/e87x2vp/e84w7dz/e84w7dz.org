Egoistic: become healer and get money

altruistic:

same, but give some to charity and don't give absorbed diseases to homeless people

illegal/ethical questionable:

become magic healer for the rich and kill evil politicians/tyrannts (give them something that will kill them like the effects of poisons after the poison is already out of the body)

maybe I would hide the power by saying the chant makes you have good luck...

also I will get more money if I buy a wellness resort with a private lake/well/geysir/bolder and pretend the powers are from that thing only my resort has. and charge huge prices and only heal a few guests...
