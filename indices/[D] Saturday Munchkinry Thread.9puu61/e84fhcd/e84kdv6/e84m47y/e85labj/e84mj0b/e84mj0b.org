Do mental issues count? If so, you could find people with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoia_(psychology)][pronoia]] or similar disorders, take the disorders off, then transfer them to business competitors, CEOs of companies you want to hijack, or politicians.

Logistics may be a bit (read: very) tricky, but it effectively approaches mind control as long as you're able to prevent your thralls from interacting with other people too much.

(That's aside from the obvious applications, such as diagnosing people, curing people by transferring diseases to animals (if possible) or braindead patients, transferring traumas of soldiers/athletes to less physically active people (for a payment), assassinating people, trying to set yourself up as a religious messiah, and so on. Generally speaking, I think it would create a new market with two groups of people: those who are willing to pay to get rid of injures, and those who are willing to heal off someone's injury for a payment.)
