problem is I don't want to become a police officer. (spidey also wants to become scientist/researcher)

I am one of the persons who will help the person in front of them, but ignore all the rest of the horrors in the world...

That said, I'm not sure police officer would be the best way for me to change the problem... Better to try to influence (or become) the politician at the top of the system.

I mean I could go on the roof of a building and studying while waiting for some robbers to appear. As a police officer I couldn't study or go to school/university.

But yeah, more resources would be great

That said, maybe listen to the podcast, research if it is true (google for proof it is wrong) and contact the us representative and ask them to add trust in police or ask the police chiefs how their actions have stopped the problem and ignore bogus sinking crime rates (maybe introduce a new counting system to explain why it jumped up or install a separate police branch that is responsible for an accurate statistic)

No clue if that will help... but since I'm on a different continent I can ignore it.
