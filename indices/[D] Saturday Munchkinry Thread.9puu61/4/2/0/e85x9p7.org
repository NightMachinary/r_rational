not sure he would want to kill...

most his criminals don't kill (on screen) and he has already bad press...

but web whip could be a good weapon against tough opponents

i think spiderman has good powers to fight tough melee fighters... and the way I picture him fighting it is more effective to capture tough/invulnerable opponents.

(web them up, if they can't free themselves and lift them off ground if they can. )

He could kill them afterwards, but not sure why he would do that. Let the police kill them if they can't be contained.

(I think Hulk would be too tough to strangle. Maybe try shooting webs inside his mouth... still I think Hulk would breath out hard and the webs would fly out/rip/have holes.)

In group fights webbed up opponents could be better than dead people, cause the others will be less likely to run.

Also less likely to get bad press.

Still I think group fights should be avoided. And (car) chases (just put a tracker on them... much saver for bystanders)
