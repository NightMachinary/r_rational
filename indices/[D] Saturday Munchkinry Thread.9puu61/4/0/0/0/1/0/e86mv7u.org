  Well athlete is a good choice. Just not sure if that works out if it is known there are superpowers in the world. Maybe go for car racing... or esports... cause his fast reflexes should help there and I don't think they can dope.

Unless your mutation gives you high levels of testosterone or something it should be fine.

I don't think reflexes would give you enough of an advantage on the esports scene. Things there have more to do with matchups, meta knowledge, strategy, map knowledge etc. Maybe in some shooters, but overhaul not really that substantial. Reflexes help of course, but not enough to be at the top.

  Just keep in mind some (woman) athletes victories got cancelled cause someone found out they had the wrong chromosomes. Nowadays I think that is no reason anymore... too lazy to confirm via google (Just to show some "mutations" are called unfair)

This is a thing because it was a man competing in the women competition. Even if she/he didn't know that was the case.

Nowadays the chromosome testing was abandoned, they measure testosterone levels to define your gender, it's still not perfect but it's what's being used.

But that's a gender thing, not mutation thing.

It's gotten to a point that the body types of olympic athletes are more similar to his competitors than to his/her siblings.. That's how competitive it is, and how important those traits are.

Spears are better 1v1 for humans, with superstrength I'd assume you'd want something that can hit multiple opponents at a time or at least control a larger area (angle wise not reach wise). With realistic physics spears would get stuck on your enemies and crack often.
