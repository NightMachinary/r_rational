Is he against killing and other crap? If so this discussion loses a lot of it's it's appeal.

​

For starters I wouldn't be a hero. So it's just be annoying, for working out and other activities. I'd probably go full pro athlete make millions.. And go from there.

​

If I had to fight I guess I'd be smart, go full plate, sword, submachine gun etc. Super strength makes armor even more OP.

​

But I don't think that's the answer you want ;P
