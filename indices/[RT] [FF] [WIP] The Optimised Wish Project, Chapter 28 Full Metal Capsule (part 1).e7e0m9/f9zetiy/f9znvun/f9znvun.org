I guess there I used "brothers" to mean "brother and sister"; I may have unwittingly translated the Italian custom there (in Italian we have gendered nouns, but when talking about groups of both sexes, we generally use the masculine form).

And you're totally right about capitalising Dr. Gero, it's driving me mad because I realise I'm inconsistent but I always miss some...

(I won't comment on your other guesses besides: yeah, /obviously/ there's going to be some major divergences...)
