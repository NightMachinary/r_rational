I'm going to guess that Piccolo still kills shenron here, and Kami doesn't bring the dragon back immediately. He only did so as a result of Goku impressing him, and this doesn't seem set to play out the same way.

Of course, it's that's not to say Goku (or someone else) couldn't later convince Kami to do so.
