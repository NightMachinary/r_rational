  The decoys are programmed to activate randomly, almost simultaneously to the real Dragon Balls, in groups of six. We can't predict the exact moment of the activation of the real set of Dragon Balls, but this way, it is fundamentally impossible to tell which is which, even if the enemy happened to take the precaution of recording the data stream being acquired by their radar.
