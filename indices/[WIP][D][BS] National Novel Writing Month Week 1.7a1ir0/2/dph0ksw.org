I've got past the first 10,000 words of my '28 years later' novella, and already I'm feeling the benefit of actually planning. If I'd gone into this blind all my characters would still be pottering round their home town, growing food and making ammunition and generally expositing about the beautiful world building I did for them. Well three of them would be doing that, and one probably wouldn't even exist cos I wouldn't have realised I needed him yet. So yeah, onward and upward, and yay for having an actual plot this time :-)
