Soooo, here's a copy of the first [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Ixd02wGrskTA1u12UWykwBkLsB-yzPqABUkZf0JE-s/edit?usp=sharing][chapter]] in my Scooby-Doo fanfiction.

I feel like it's cheating including this in my word count, since I wrote this several months ago, but the second chapter is almost done and I'll post that tomorrow or late tonight with more than 3,333 words.

There has been some pretty major changes in the gang's backstories (more like nothing). So I'm making up some fairly unusual ones and created a 'contradiction' in each of their personalities for each of them to deal with. I suggest reading the chapter I posted before looking at the spoilers.

[[#s][Velma]]

[[#s][Shaggy]]

Scooby-Doo's 'contradiction' will be posted with the second chapter and Fred's and Daphne's are for the third chapter.

Feel free to weigh in with any comments on how I'm writing the characters. My biggest worry is not having the right 'voice' for my characters.

Also should I be writing Scooby-Doo, or Scooby Doo? I'll find out when I watch the Scooby-Doo movies tonight, I guess.
