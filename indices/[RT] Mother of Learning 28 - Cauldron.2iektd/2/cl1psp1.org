It seems like an easy way to make the invasion succeed is just to soul kill everyone that stops it. It's not entirely clear to me what the limits on soul killing are, but given the number of people they've done it to, it doesn't seem to be all that costly (though granted, it's been a while since I read through this one, so maybe it was explicitly stated at some point and I missed it).
