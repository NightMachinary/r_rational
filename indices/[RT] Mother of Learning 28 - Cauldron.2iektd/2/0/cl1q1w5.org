Soulkilling seems pretty low-energy for Red, but it there are a number of clues that point towards Soulkill being actually "eject from the time loop".

1. The Lich in the first runthrough notes that souls can't be destroyed, so he uses the soul blending spell between Zack and Zorian instead of using some kind of Soul Killing spell. It's possible Red Hood knows more than the Lich, but if I had to guess I'd say that the Lich is a better practitioner of soul magic since he's a soul entity. There are some other references to the immortality of souls throughout the series that make me think you can't destroy them. I think it's relatively safe to say that the soulkill doesn't actually kill souls.

2. Red Hood doesn't use this on any threats except ones that he specifically believes to be time travelers. Since souls kinda exist outside of the time loop, it seems like a simple way to make the invasion a success would be to soulkill all the opposition. Red Hood seems reasonably bright (or at least reasonably willing to take advantage of the time loop) and he doesn't do this until the Aranea tell Zach that they are time travelers.

I'm guessing Red Hood is planning to aid the invasion in the final runthrough outside the loop, and he wants as much information as possible to make the invasion a success. If Soulkill instead actually just kicks souls out of the loop, it would explain why Red Hood only used it once the Aranea are revealed (to him) to be time travelers. He won't lose important information by kicking them out of the loop, so he can still execute the invasion as well as possible.
