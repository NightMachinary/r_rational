I'm calling it now, HJPEV made the mysterious reality warping cup whatever it's called and it rewrote reality to the way it is in the story. Probably from a universe where he didn't take the unbreakable vow.

Also, I thought Ozland was secretly HJPEV. But now the actual HJPEV shows up? What's going on here I wonder.
