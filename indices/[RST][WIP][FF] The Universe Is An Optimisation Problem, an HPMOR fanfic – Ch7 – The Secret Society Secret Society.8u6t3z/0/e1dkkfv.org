I finally got around to giving this another go, and I think I'm glad I did. The author explicitly attempted to reintroduce the idea that magic is weird and not understandable, but I think they succeeded too well - it went beyond "this is weird and I don't understand the mechanics behind it" to "I have no idea what the hell is happening or what half the setting is".

This is in large part because it's missing the real world juxtaposition the original Harry Potter series had - rather than half wizards and half real world to orient yourself from, it's half wizards and half alternate reality dystopia, and the dystopia sections were focused on a particularly weird and confusing part. It was only in the last two/three chapters I really got my feet under me enough to manage more than parsing what the hell is going on in the scene.
