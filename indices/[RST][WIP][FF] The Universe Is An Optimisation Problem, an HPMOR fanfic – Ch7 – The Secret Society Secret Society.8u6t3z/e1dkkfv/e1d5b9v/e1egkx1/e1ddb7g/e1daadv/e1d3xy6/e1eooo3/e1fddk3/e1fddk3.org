for newcomers who want a general overview, this is an hpmor fanfanfic which draws on significant digits and to a lesser extent, orders of magnitude.

it takes place in 1995, in an alternate universe (well, not quite) where the department of mysteries has discovered an almost unlimited well of magic (with consequences), muggleborns are prevented from attending hogwarts until their fifth year and often learn to control and develop their accidental magic, while wizarding society has experienced an incomplete industrial revolution, illicitly financed by contracts with muggle governments and corporations.

the first chapter is confusing but it'll be a while until i figure out how to reorganise it.
