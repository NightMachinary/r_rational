It could be but it's too cliche. It could be much more interseting if Fallatehr actually have strong moral or at least non-socipathic/non-egotistic goals, but his goals/moral code don't fit into contemporary society. Analog could be early-modern surgeons digging up corpses and doing dissection on them, action abhorrent and immoral for their contemporaries. The moral problems of Soul Magic are not dissimilar to problems of invasive brain-computer interface reserach, wich is forbidden for healthy patients in most of (or all) western countries. This total ban could be seen as barbaric from some point in the future.
