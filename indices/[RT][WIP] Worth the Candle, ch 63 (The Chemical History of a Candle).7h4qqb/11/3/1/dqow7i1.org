Joon is smartish, but has little interest in academics (or extracurriculars) and doesn't apply himself very much, preferring to spend his time and effort on his mildly antisocial hobbies. What Arthur said was more supposed to point to "I've seen how quickly you pick up on new information and solve problems relative to others".
