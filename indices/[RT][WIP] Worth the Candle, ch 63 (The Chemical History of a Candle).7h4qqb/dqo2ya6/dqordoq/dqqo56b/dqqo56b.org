This is one of those mistakes that I'd normally be fine with, since it's an understandable mistake in-character, /especially/ given that Juniper's skill/knowledge in programming is meant to be equivalent to my own when I was 17, and /I/ made the mistake because I didn't look up anything up when writing that.

But it's also a mistake that doesn't serve a plot purpose and so only serves to annoy people with imprecision, and I would only deliberately include something like that if I were a stickler for verisimilitude, which I'm (mostly) not.
