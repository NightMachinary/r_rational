Not exactly a typo but your definition of a null pointer error could be misread.

#+begin_quote
  the program tries to go look up *what* some variable is, and finds out that there's a null (empty) value *where that variable was supposed to be*.
#+end_quote

This would be more accurate as

#+begin_quote
  the program tries to go look up *where* some variable is, and finds out that there's a null (empty) value where *that variable's address* was supposed to be.
#+end_quote

Your original read as if the program did the lookup first and found a null where the pointer was pointing, rather than the pointer itself being null.
