So, if the devils are like gaolers who are increasingly clever and insidious with their psychological warfare as you get lower in the hells, then it's possible they've tortured all the dirty laundry out of all the dead people you know. The question is what would they try to convince you of. That all your loved ones are suffering in the worst ways and you should join them out of commiseration? What's their end-game - propagating misery? Or like you say, getting the suicidally depressed as more fodder for the hells?
