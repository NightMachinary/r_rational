Ah, you know, I have this horrible habit of reading comments like that when I'm on my phone and thinking that I'll answer them later when I'm at a keyboard, then putting responding to them lower on the list of things to do when I'm at a computer, then sort of forgetting about them because they're not in a place that I normally interface with. So I apologize for that. (I also sometimes do this for reddit comments.)

Re: skin magic, that's a read and find out question (i.e. I can neither confirm nor deny, etc.).

Re: St. Paul's cathedral ... I honestly have no clue, but that's how it happened IRL. Probably because cannons are cooler? Or it might have been one of those cases where someone started doing the math and the quest for alternate solutions stopped.

Re: hovertext, it's a pain in the butt and I'm probably dropping it soon once I have some time (read: desire) to devote to it, mostly because it's non-functional for mobile, tablet, or alternate format users, and thus needs to be spelled out in the text /anyway/.

Re: partial draining of bones ... read and find out, maybe? I'm not sure that we'll ever go there, but if we do, I'd rather it were a surprise.

Re: leveling up skills, I've been shying away from showing every in-game message, mostly because they can really screw up the flow of a paragraph meant to convey some other information to the reader or set a mood/tone. Joon has re-capped both Blood Magic and Bone Magic by this point, both at 24.

Re: entads, they take some time/effort/bonding to "set", which is when the inheritance rules are established, though some entads simply don't (heirloom entads are a subset of entads). So there's a window where magical items can be sold or given away, before there's a risk of them simply sticking with the person who made them (which does sometimes happen). More on this later ... maybe.
