This is apparently a /very/ regional term for the ability of a checker to jump more than one piece in sequence. I didn't know /how/ regional it was until I started looking for corroboration that other people actually used it; it might actually just be localized to my small town.

So, apologies for that, because there's no way that you'd be able to get that from the text. (I'm fine with having a little bit of Midwestern cultural artifacts, but that one probably goes too far, given that it's hyperlocal.)
