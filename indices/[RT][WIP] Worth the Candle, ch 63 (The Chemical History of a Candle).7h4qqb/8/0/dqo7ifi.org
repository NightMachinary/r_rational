I'm guessing the author will only convey snippets of it because it sounds like a true game state file that is very, very large.

Our hero will need very high intelligence to parse it. In these kind of games you end up just boosting your INT stat all game long if you're playing a caster, because you need every point you can get. This seems to be the same way, though for a different reason*.

*in the games, all the big enemies are 'resistant' to getting hit with magic and you have a better chance the higher your int stat is. And, of course, the bosses are outright immune to any really 'save or lose' spell, which is why it's generally better to invest in direct damage spells despite them not being very good against mook level enemies...

And many games try to bring in magic immune enemies, making it where the best role of a caster is buffing your companions, since game developers can't really make enemies immune to physical attacks - that would make warrior and archer characters completely useless.
