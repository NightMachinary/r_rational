  Do you mind if I ask you why you're writing it?

That's a weird question. Not /bad/ weird, but ... there's a set of all the stories that I want to write, and out of that set, which is /enormous/, I've chosen this one, and I don't know that I can boil the "why" down to something sensible.

I guess when I decide to write a story, I have three big criteria:

1. I like to write the sorts of stories that I like to read, because after a few years I'll have forgotten enough of the details that I can come in somewhat fresh to it and have the incredible experience of reading something written /exactly/ to my tastes.
2. I like to write things that are fun to write. What makes a story fun to write varies, but worldbuilding is a big part of it, and little flashes of insight when I've figured something out are another.
3. Given the above, I would much rather go for something that's in low supply, particularly if it's something that I have high demand for (i.e. works that fill holes specific to me).

So this story has a lot of things in it that I haven't seen done in other places, and the high-school-friend-group thing is modeled (almost unethically) closely on actual people, which gives associated therapy/catharsis/nostalgia for me.

But I'm not sure that answers the question, because there are /other/ stories that I could have written that would have filled those same needs and wants for me, and the next thing that I write will have those same three criteria as above, but I don't think that I will be able to say "I needed to write /Worth the Candle/ before this other thing". I'll hopefully be a better writer by the end of this, and hopefully have changed somewhat in the process of spending hundreds of hours writing and thinking, but I don't think it's a prerequisite for those other things that I'll write, nor do I think that I'm writing this because of an honest sit-down consideration of what was most important (or highest utility) for me to write.
