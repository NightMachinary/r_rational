I'm getting a hostile AI vibe from the elf guy, in the sense that he's a foe that the party will assuredly lose to if they engage with him for long enough.

He appears to have (maybe literally?) dialed his Insight up to like a hundred, and seemingly keeps pulling way too much info out of Juniper's tiny misstatements: several times in the last few chapters he's caught a slip up, queried Jun about it, then watched for a reaction while letting the massive Insight-Poise mismatch do some major body language/mind reading work. (e.g. the "residual" statment/Matrix implication cluing him in that Jun is dream-skewered, thus revealing a weakness that can be uniquely targeted by via soul magic?) I just get the feeling that he's mining a ton of info from the smallest of clues and using it to build a way too accurate model of Jun's situation.

All we really know about the guy is that his goal - above escaping the prison/personal freedom, his centuries-long experimentation, or even his immediate personal safety - is to gather information on Juniper. Which makes me think that his curiosity on the subject may go hand in hand with him being able achieve all of the aforementioned, in addition to in him being able to beat the party in a fight. (And given his supremely twisted set of morals betrayal seems kind of inevitable...I know Jun isn't your standard lawful good protagonist, but I can't see him unleashing this psycho on the world to go around casually reprogramming people's minds. And the elf guy almost assuredly knows that Mary was lying through her teeth about him ever getting a pardon/freedom to use soul magic, so now everyone involved knows that one side is ultimately going to end up dead/enthralled.)

If so, then maybe the elf guy's win condition revolves around gathering enough info on Jun's condition to customize a method of attack that is inherently "unblockable" due to the party's unfamiliarity with soul magic, or perhaps Jun's particular weakness to it. (If he's already grasped the entirety of the situation then I could easily see his goal being as basic as rewriting Jun to have access to the superweapon on par with King Arthur.) And Jun wins by ferreting out enough soul magic training to be able to ditch his almost certainly more intelligent tutor (since being hundreds of years old should translate directly to a high Knowledge stat?). This doesn't really bode well.

It's like the soul mage is tailor made as an enemy to counter Juniper: the party is forced to treat with him rather than just kill him, they're playing an infosec game governed by social stats ("dump" stats...), and there's inherent time pressure that forces Jun to engage in such a losing game in the first place.

Even the null counter demon puppet person seems like a challenge deliberately concocted by the DM, with this one subverting the whole "companions are safe" expectation. Like a stage magician the elf guy kept burning potential trap card after trap card, forcing the party to worry about threats like numbers disparity and soul-link mechanics, while quietly sliding the null into the group without much of a fuss. (Apparently she's such a nonthreat she can be countered with a "punch to the mouth"? Really guy?) It could be argued that he left her behind with his rage mutants to die, but assuming he's an enemy that's cleverer than the party he could have by that point modeled Jun accurately enough to have predicted his penchant for "heroism"/avoiding the cowardice debuff.

It could be I'm making the guy out too be way more hyper competent than he actually is, but like I said he just comes across as a threat they'd never have gotten close to if it weren't for their current desperation. Which kind of puts the ball firmly in the bad guy's court here.
