I'm a big fan of asian webnovels and was introduced through this subreddit from the [[/r/noveltranslations]] discussions on /Mother of Learning/ (yours are way better).

I want to recommend the Korean novel /[[http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/][Evolution Theory of the Hunter]]/. I'm having a great time reading rational fiction and since I'm so new to the rational scene, I'm not sure if this will be something you'll like. It just reminded me enough of /Mother of Learning/ that I wanted to know what you guys think about it.
