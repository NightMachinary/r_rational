Heh, you got me there! On the other hand, METAL GEAR RISING REVENGEANCE is so great I can't NOT re-recommend it. I played a couple missions today and it just really GETS me, you know? You'll also see me reposting the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=ted+chiang+author%3Ablazinghand&restrict_sr=on][Ted Chiang Thread]] every 3-6 months! Actually, this reminds me, I should post it again here in this thread!
