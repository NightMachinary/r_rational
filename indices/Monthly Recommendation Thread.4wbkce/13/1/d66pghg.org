I like WaitButWhy's treatment of [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html][Elon Musk]], [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html][SpaceX]], and [[http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html][Tesla]]. Hardly unbiased (the author seems to be a bit of a fanboy), but still an enjoyable read.
