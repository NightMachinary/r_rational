My literal reaction to the ending of 100 Years of Solitude. I didn't want to spoil it in my review, just on the offchance that some reader really cares about it, but by the gods that ending was insultingly bad. By far the laziest and most nonsensical ending to a book I've ever read... and I've read Schrodinger's City, so that's saying something.
