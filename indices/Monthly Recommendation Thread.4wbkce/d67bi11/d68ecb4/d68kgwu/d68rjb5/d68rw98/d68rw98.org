...well now I kind of want to read it >.> That sounds like a way more interesting book, even if it has a shitty and pointless ending. A lot of shows and book series that start great and end terribly. A bad ending can be infuriating and saddening, but I definitely don't regret watching, say, Battlestar Galactica. Beats 100YOS being shitty and pointless the whole way through.
