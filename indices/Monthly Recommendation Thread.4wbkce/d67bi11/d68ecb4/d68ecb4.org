FTFY.

I have a love--hate relationship with that book. I finished it ages ago, and you could still hear my howl of frustration echoing through the years.

What [[https://benprice.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/dfwcartoon.gif][DFW]]'s writing does best is capture precisely how the mind turns in on itself, which results in its metamorphosis into a one-man mental version of human centipede (Sorry for the imagery there. I could have said ouroboros, but that fails to express all the shit DFW puts his reader through).

Recently [[/u/DaystarEld]] [[http://feeds.soundcloud.com/stream/276212563-rationally-writing-episode-4-fanfiction.mp3][talked]] (or should I say /ranted/?) and [[http://www.daystareld.com/review-100-years/][wrote]] about how much he hated magical realism. I wonder how many in this sub feel that way. /IJ/ is not magical realism, but pretty much everything Daystar Eld hated about /One Hundred Years of Solitude/ applies to it as well. It starts out Kafkaesque and gets even weirder from there. And the way it ends, I can't even, it's just oh gods, I'd better not spoil it for you, but...

Check back when you're done, __2BR02B__, and tell us how hard you threw that book across the room.
