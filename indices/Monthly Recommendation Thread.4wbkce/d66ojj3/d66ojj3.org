[[https://www.amazon.com/Math-Girls-Hiroshi-Yuki/dp/0983951306][Math Girls]] is a great book to read about advanced math concepts as explained by high schoolers interested in college-level math. It really helps to understand how to actually do math through proofs. I recommend reading the free samples provided by bento Books [[http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/][here]] since it gives a better sneak peek than Amazon does.

[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K15IO4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1#nav-subnav][Dormia]] is a nice fantasy book about a young boy hero whose powers are about preforming miraculous feats of balance, agility, and perception while walking in his sleep. It's not very rational in the world building (too many improbable things which work via author fiat for the Rule of Cool) and the protagonists are clever, but there are no moments of rationality I can point out. It's mostly a good recommendation for the people who already like this sort of story.

Finally, the fourth book in the Gentlemen Bastards Sequence is coming out on September 22, 2016! The [[https://www.amazon.com/Thorn-Emberlain-Gentleman-Bastard-Sequence-ebook/dp/B00UFWTMW0/ref=bseries_seeMoreDPInfo_0_B00UFWTMW0#nav-subnav][Thorn of Emberlain]] will rise!
