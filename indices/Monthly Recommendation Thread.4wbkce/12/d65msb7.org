An entertaining passage from /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7522][King Coal]]/, written by eminent propagandist [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/88][Upton Sinclair]], author of such delicious works as /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140][The Jungle]]/ and /[[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16470][The Profits of Religion]]/:

  To his amusement [the protagonist] found that in the eyes of his Irish friends he was losing caste by going to live with the Minettis. There were most rigid social lines in [the coal-mining town of] North Valley, it appeared. The Americans and English and Scotch looked down upon the Welsh and Irish; the Welsh and Irish looked down upon the Dagoes and Frenchies; the Dagoes and Frenchies looked down upon Polacks and Hunkies, these in turn upon Greeks, Bulgarians and "Montynegroes," and so on through a score of races of Eastern Europe, Lithuanians, Slovaks, and Croatians, Armenians, Roumanians, Rumelians, Ruthenians---ending up with Greasers, niggers, and last and lowest, Japs.

I'd call /most/ of the story /nearly/ as fun as /The Jungle/, which is one of my favorite books. Near the end, though, I got too bored to finish it. Compare:\\
- [[#s][/The Jungle/'s ending (IIRC)]]\\
- [[#s][/King Coal/'s later chapters]]

/[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/208056][Project Horizons]]/, one of the most popular spin-offs of /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190][Fallout: Equestria]]/, has finally been posted in its entirety to FIMFiction.net. Previously, it was hosted on Google Docs, on which reading is rather annoying, and I vaguely remember disliking the EPUB version that was provided there (it was either badly formatted or out of date, I think)--but, now, it can be downloaded with ease (including in HTML format, if you don't trust FIMFiction's EPUB generation). With 1.8 million words, its length is /[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com][Worm]]/-tier!

I read it up to its in-progress point, some years ago, and I /think/ I enjoyed it--but, nowadays, I can remember nothing about it, so I'm currently re-reading it.

I've recently been playing /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/21130][LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4]]/. I can't help but feel that, in comparison to its predecessor /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/32440][LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]/, it made several missteps...\\
- Extremely long cooldown timers and animations on firing spells (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, you could fire your blaster and swing your lightsaber much more often, and only throwing a thermal detonator took a long time)\\
- An unnecessary overabundance of persistent physics objects that serve only to impede movement and clutter the screen (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, there were no persistent physics objects at all, IIRC)\\
- A somewhat-cumbersome interface for switching between spells/abilities (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, most characters had only one special ability--Force, thermal detonator, small size, etc.--and only a few, IIRC, had even two. This is a mixed pro/con, since switching spells often takes the place of switching characters, so you no longer need to scroll through a zillion characters every time you need to use a different special ability in Free Play.)\\
- Being forced to trudge repeatedly, back and forth, through the same areas of Hogwarts just to get to the next story mission (or even just a cutscene!) (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, there was no such "secondary hub world". This is a mixed pro/con--since, once the story is done, Hogwarts is a very nice [[http://knd.wikia.com/wiki/Professor_XXXL][XXXL]] level in Free Play.)\\
- No characters with double-jump or high-jump capabilities (while, in the /LEGO Star Wars/ games, all Force-users had a double jump and a few other characters had a high jump, and the platforming was slightly more fun, IIRC)

Maybe it's just rose-tinted glasses (/LEGO Star Wars 1/, /2/, and /The Complete Saga/ were some of my favorite games, many years ago), some of it is the PC port's fault (I played /LEGO Star Wars 1/ and /2/ on the GameCube and /The Complete Saga/ on the PlayStation 3, while I'm playing /LEGO Harry Potter/ on PC with a keyboard), or I'm just misremembering (I haven't played any of the /LEGO Star Wars/ games--even the lackluster /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/32510][3]]/--in /several/ years). (shrugs) In my opinion, though, even /with/ these flaws, this game is still more fun than the rather infuriating /LEGO Star Wars 3/, so I /would/ recommend it, even at its current price of $20 (I got it and its sequel /[[http://store.steampowered.com/app/204120][LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7]]/ for $5 each in the sale of April 2014)--and, of course, /LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga/ provides even /better/ content at the /same/ price!
