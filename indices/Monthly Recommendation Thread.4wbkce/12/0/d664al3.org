Oh yeah, the Lego HP games were sorta lame, in my opinion (we made it through a third of the first one before giving up). Same for Lego Jurassic World, unfortunately. Our favorite so far has been Lego LOTR, though it was also the first we played, so the novelty might have bumped our perception of it up a bit too (Lego Hobbit and Lego Marvel have been pretty good, too). [[http://www.metacritic.com/search/game/lego/results?sort=score][Metacritic reviews]] don't look to agree with me, though.
