  ---I bear these people because Craftsmen, broadly speaking, do not love what they cannot use, and destroy what they do not love. So I make myself useful in some minimal way, as do others of my kind.\\
  “Because you're afraid of us?”\\
  ---No. Because I enjoy flying far and fast, and I find this work more pleasant.\\
  “Than what?”\\
  ---War.\\
  “I'm glad to hear it,” she said. “But don't you find it sad that you have to live like this? That you can't just hum in a cave somewhere?”\\
  ---No.\\
  She waited.\\
  ---I find it funny.\\
  “What?”\\
  ---We are what we ever were: huge, strong, and ancient beyond your reckoning. We have crossed vast gulfs of time and space. And you think (the subsonic dread returned in sharp pulses rather than the earlier sustained note, and her mind named the dread pattern laughter) you think because looking at us you can say that one draws a salary, this one bears us from place to place, that your limited comprehension gives you any measure of safety or control.
