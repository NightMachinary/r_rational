Elon Musk biography is *amazing*. This guy is a superhero, and this book pushes you really hard to be more ambitious and start working on important stuff.

The Inevitable is a pretty cool futuristic book, I think people here will enjoy it.

Creativity Inc is mostly about management, but still very inspiring, I loved it. Written by a brilliant guy who founded most of the field of CG.
