[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe][Steven Universe]] is a show primarily about the interpersonal relationships between a group of sentient alien space rocks with superpowers. There's also a good bit of singing and crying. It's pretty great.

It's very continuity heavy for a western cartoon, so it's best to start at the beginning, but the show doesn't really get going until the second half of season one. I've seen something called the "Flood Order" (a la the Star Wars Machete Order) floating around some SU communities, which condenses the first 26 episodes into 10, and I'd be curious how effective it is at hooking in new viewers.

Flood Order (Episode Title [Episode #]):

- Cheeseburger Backpack [3]

- Laser Light Cannon [2]

- Bubble Buddies [7]

- Steven's Lion [10]

- Giant Woman [12]

- Steven the Sword Fighter [16]

- Lion 2: The Movie [17]

- An Indirect Kiss [24]

- Mirror Gem [25]

- Ocean Gem [26]

You're going to miss out on some callbacks and minor side characters, but I think the hope is that if you get into the show, then you'd go back and watch the cut episodes.
