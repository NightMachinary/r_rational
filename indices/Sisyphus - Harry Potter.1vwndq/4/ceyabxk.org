So, after rereading this again and doing some thinking about what now:

It seems that, as of life 101, he's got it figured out. Now he knows how to make it past the final battle with Voldy, what are the limits? How much further can he expand? Could he go about optimizing the world with his centuries of stored knowledge? I'd spend a few Ravenclaw lifetimes testing the absolute limits of magic, maybe seeing how it works and/or how to exploit it.

Dunno. This is a good deconstruction, but certainly not rationalist or even particularly non-Idiot-Ball. Thanks for sharing!
