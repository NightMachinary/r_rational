I agree with [[/u/Dragfie]], the intro is long and confusing. It took me a while to get through it, and I almost gave up. I'm glad I didn't, because the rest shows promise.

Unsolicited advice - trim the prelude to just the last few paragraphs. Let the woman in white be a mystery that is slowly revealed thru flashbacks or dreams or something. The prelude will then let the reader know who/what Arthur is, some mysterious background info, and where the next chapter will pick up.

The rest is fairly decent, and I hope it goes somewhere good.
