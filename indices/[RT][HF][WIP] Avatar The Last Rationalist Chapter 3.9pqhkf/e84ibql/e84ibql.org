read the first chapter until after Dr snow and the woman leaves and have some feedback if your interested:

To cut strait to the chase, basically; it's boring. The writing itself is good and it's only the 'story plan' that needs work on, and in very subtle non obvious ways.

You would think that it would be interesting, there is action, intrigue, interesting and well written characters, but its missing the core that puts it together, and I'll try explain what that seems like to me as best i can:

- You don't know the rules of the world. So it starts off as if the avatar reincarnated into some kid, but then you see its just a normal world, and then out of nowhere come some supernatural people hinting they know about his avatar powers. All these things are so... random. You try to instill some context in the world and then break it immediately, it just gives the reader a sense of confusion, not understanding what is going on and that detaches their interest from the story, making them not care about the characters, intrigue or action. Pretty much the whole time I was reading i was thinking 'when is there going to be some explanation' until i dropped it.

- The MC is not relatable. I tend to not like this criticism, because he doesn't need to be, but i can't think of a better way to explain it. We jump through his life too fast, it all seems pointless and like useless information, a better way to do that (if you really want to) is flashbacks, a good example being WOC. If WOC went through all the flashbacks first, and only then to dropping down, with the basic world's rules explained to us within the first few paragraphs, no one would have got to that point.

- Too many changes to the world. One pitfall I see in a lot of stories is adding too many random things to the world that doesn't necessarily push the story forward. I guess its kind of more like: either change it all or none of it. Establishing an earth like world with one supernatural difference, then adding a second out of nowhere and so on causes the same problem as the first point. Even if you explain it later, at the time it is just confusing.

I think this is why the commenter below wanted a summary. So he could know whether its what he enjoys and if its worth continuing. Hope this helps.
