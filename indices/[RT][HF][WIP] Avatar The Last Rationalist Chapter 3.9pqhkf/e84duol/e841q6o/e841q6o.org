You should really have a description, especially on ff.net. Many people need more to go on to read something other than knowing that this story involves rationality and is set in the A:tLE universe.

Look at HPMoR's for example:

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell.

It doesn't spoiler much but it at least gives you an idea of what you're reading before having to actually invest time.
