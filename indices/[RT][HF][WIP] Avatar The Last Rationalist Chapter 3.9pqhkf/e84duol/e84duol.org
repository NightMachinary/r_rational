Alright, I skimmed all three chapters. Some feedback:

- First off, I don't know if you're going to get a lot of attention here with this story. "Character from the real world gets swapped with main character from this series (and also gets convenient vision giving him background info)" is a really fanfic-y kind of story that most people aren't really interested in. You might get more interest from a forum like Spacebattles, except /these/ guys hate rationalist branding and your fanfic has a lot of that.

- The first half of chapter 2 is almost nothing but the intro of /The Last Airbender/ in prose form. This is the kind of stuff you normally want to get past as fast as you can so you can get in the meat of the action (if you don't just start /in media res/).

- You really need to use commas in your sentences. For instance, "Fishing was all about patience something Sokka knew Katara could never understand" should be "Fishing was all about patience, something Sokka knew Katara could never understand". As it is, some paragraphs are flat out unreadable.

Overall, aside from the fact that I'm really not in the initial concept (Avatar is a setting that really doesn't need portal fantasy stories), it looks like you just need to get better at writing. I don't really have the skills or the technical know-how to give you advice, but in general I think you need more direction. Like, ideally, each scene needs to have a purpose, information or emotions it wants to convey, and deliver them in as few words as possible. I didn't really get this impression from reading your fic.
