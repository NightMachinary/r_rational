For me the grimdark can be cathartic to read, can't say for sure /why/ though.

As for writing it, though, I think the rampant instability and violent potential of powerful magical development combined with an insufficiently savvy society makes for great explorations of game theory and rationalism. I mean, imagine If every major field of study had a nuke level discovery being made, /all at the same time,/ and that all of them were heavily balanced in the direction of offense. A magical universe is /terrifying/.
