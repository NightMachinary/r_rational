I suspect that this is actually surprisingly hard with the ~WW2 era tech they appear to have, combined with the short period of transmission from the ship. We could do it today with an array, but they don't look like they can pull off beamforming or interferometry in Aerb ;-)

Sparrs warder telescope sounds like a winner though!
