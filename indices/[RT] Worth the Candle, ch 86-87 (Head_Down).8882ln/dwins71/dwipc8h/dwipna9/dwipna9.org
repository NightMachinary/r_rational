Maybe, but the pitched channel might already have given them away. Rattle-Clack might even have departed in anticipation of the fight.

In my imagination they might also have noticed that the ship is nowhere near where it claims to be. Not sure what sort of system they'd have for that, in an absence of radar, leaving magic. If they trust the operators, that suggests duress.
