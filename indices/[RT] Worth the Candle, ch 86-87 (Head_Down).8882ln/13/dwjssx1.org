Am I the only one that thinks Joon should have responded to the Fools Choker strike by having Rattle-Clack respond into the radio with:

"Oh god, I'm so glad you guys saved me, I don't know what would have happened to me without you. Let me clean up all of this blood and I'll be heading back up in 15 minutes."

Thus, winning some extra time before they are attacked. In this case, it would have turned out to be enough.
