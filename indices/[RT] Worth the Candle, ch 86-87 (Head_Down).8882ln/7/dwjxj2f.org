That battle would have been a great time to use some enhanced arrows again. That's an ability to /abuse/. Approximate destruction range for a void arrow is (500 ft/crystal)*sqrt(2000) = ~4 miles (!!!) However, if each arrow had a small flash-bang grenade attached, (or a real grenade attached, depending on the desired lethality), you would not have had much of a fight at all ;-)

I wonder what kinds of magic can be embedded into an arrow? Likely flower magic. Wards? Put a little bit of warding power into an arrow, and then shoot the arrow. If you embed the destructive kind of warding against life, and key it to activate appropriately, you could have wiped out the army without risk.

Speaking of which, that bow is a /fantastic/ wealth multiplier. Forge an arrow out of gold! Fire arrow into unpopulated desert plain! Profit!

If the bow can replicate a void crystal and the required electrical circuitry to make the thing trigger, it'll definitely replicate a computer chip. I wonder if you could duplicate a cell phone (or any other small object with a sufficient value/mass ratio)

In short, that bow is very, /very/ useful. Possibly one of the most useful items they have
