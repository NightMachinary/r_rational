True that. It's the least potent application of the bow, compared to the other uses. That would definitely limit the value, but you could probably still get substantial value out of it, provided that you sell the gold-arrows well before they disappear. Just spend a day selling melted down gold arrows at various cities before anyone can realize / word can get out that the assholes selling golden arrows are thieves.
