If you imagine descending into the Earth, gravity will get weaker and weaker as the amount of mass below you decreases, and the amount of mass above you increases. Eventually it will balance out and you'll be perfectly weightless at the center.

If we imagine Aerb as a finite, thick plane, then we should see something similar as we descend. At the bottom, gravity will be exactly the inverse from the top.

However, we know there is a big old hole. Let's imagine that plane again, except that there's a cone cut out of it with its tip at the top. As you descend one of the sides, more and more of the mass is above and to the side of you.

I'm not quite sure how this works at the top of the hole, though. If the cone is obtuse enough (it's wide instead of narrow), would you notice an effect at the top of the hole?

*Edit:* Of course, we already know that gravity is different because Aerb's star isn't crashing into the ground.

Amusingly, you could almost explain this with a hypertorus, but it would be metastable at best. And then there's the whole day cycle thing which just says fuck you to geometry.

(I've been trying to imagine a geometry that allows for a day cycle, but I'm not coming up with anything.)
