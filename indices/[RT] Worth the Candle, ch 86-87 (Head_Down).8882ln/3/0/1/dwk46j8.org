In order for it to balance out, the entirety of the river would have to evaporate and then diffuse out of the top.

(I'm not a chemist, physicist, meteorologist, or mage. Take this with a good heap of salt.)

It probably would all evaporate. If you imagine a starting point with an infinite expanse of dry air, and then drop a river into it, you'd expect the river to eventually evaporate entirely (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure][vapor pressure]]]. Because the space is infinite, you will always find more dry air the further down you go.

I'm not quite sure how that interacts with pressure and temperature.

There's also the interesting question of gravity. Assuming that the hole is infinite, you would expect “downward” gravity to fall off as you get deeper, but “sideways” and “up” gravity to increase. This potentially means that you could have very cold, low pressure (I think?) atmosphere on the bottom of the world.

Actually, this reminds me of another thing. The world is closed but apparently flat (see [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26627424][Common Knowledge About Aerb]]). If you travel far enough in any direction you get back to where you started. Assuming that this applies vertically as well as horizontally, then you expect that if you go down far enough you'll eventually end up falling from the sky.

(Assuming that the world is on a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4xgwpl/eli5_a_hypertorus_universe_that_has_the/][hypertorus]], and that my ability to reason about higher-dimensional geometry is good. (It's not.))
