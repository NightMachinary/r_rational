Yes, that is true. However for the question of geological water cycles evaporation has a double meaning. Literal evaporation and the convective air flows that transport that evaporated water/ water heavy air somewhere else.

If all the water from the river evaporates due to arbitrarily long falling lengths, it still needs to rise; since there is no heat source, that just doesnt happen.
