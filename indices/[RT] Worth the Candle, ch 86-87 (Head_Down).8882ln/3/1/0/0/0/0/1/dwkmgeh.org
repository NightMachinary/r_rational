There's more air below than there is at the top of the hole. Thus there is more volume to diffuse into.

I think you an get a situation where the water flowing out would match the water flowing in, but there would be some weird requirements --- I think the humidity would have to get higher the lower you go so that it always diffuses up.

There's also the issue of whether the mouth of the hole is big enough to for its air to hold the entire cross-section of the river. We know the river is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/32597586][a mile “thick”]] (wide?) and the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31367205][Pit is a mile wide]] --- note that the description from chapter 86 says “dozens of miles wide,” but it's referring to the depression the Pit sits within.

Even if the river is relatively shallow, that's a /lot/ of liquid water that you have to balance out with vapor.

I'm just an interested layperson, though, so take it all with a big grain of salt.
