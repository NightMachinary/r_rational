I find it unlikely that the rate of upward air movement, and the amount of water vapor in that air, is even close to the amount of water going down.

There isn't an air river flowing up from the pit. Sure, there would be some tide-like airflow in and out as the pit equalized against the barometric pressure, but not enough to lift any damp air from a hundred miles down.
