The ecology, physics, geology, etc. of the Bottomless Pit boggles the mind. I now get why its a capital M Mystery.

It gets ever wider and has no end, meaning the WHOLE of Aerb is floating above it; what happens when its circumference comes unto the hex boundaries?

Whats happening with the water deficit in the above world? Over geological timespans that should have an impact! Very rough calculation: Yangtze flowrater of 10^{3} km^{3/year} vs earth water amount of 10^{9} km^{3} gives us a million years for one earth water unit to drain. Even if Aerb is 10 times bigger and the flow rate that much smaller its a HUUUUGGEEE problem! Also erosion(!).

The energy cycle is /really/ weird, deepsea like. A of nutrients in the form of fish/soil from the river - I'd expect fish-snapping batlike creatures in the upper kilometers and plants that grab the soil from the water, like in rainforests.

For energy some point you need to resort to rock-dissolving lichens/bacteria. A really low flux energy source - but the area is infinite! (possibly, see hex boundaries) - see also the life of the Tuung in that area. (WTF is up with that super fucked up sort of life?) Magic as external energy source would be invaluable. Also the excluded nuclear energy - maybe instead of thermal vents and volcanism (can't have volcanism because ALL OF AERB IS FLOATING ON THE PIT!!! ) we have Oklo-style natural reactors as hydrothermal vent equivalent?

What sort of hyper efficient vertical transportation infrastructure do the Tuung have?

How deep can a suffiently funded probe fall and give feedback? I am imagining some sort of heavy, high-terminal-velocity aerodynamic radio torpedo, and a big horizontal hanging antenna. How high is absorption in the wet air? There are frequencies that dont get absorbed that much. A couple lighthours? Heck even lightseconds would be incredible!

And...Whats up with the air pressure? That /must/ be automagically stable, or we would have dropwinds. If pressure increases towards the bottom, suffiently well equipped people just die of O^{2} partial pressure toxicity.
