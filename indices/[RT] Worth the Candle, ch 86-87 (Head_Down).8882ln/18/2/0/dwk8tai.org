I've looked it up a few times, and just never been able to internalize it. And it's not just that, it's an inability to internalize that there /is/ a rule, which means that I don't stop myself when I get to the sections where I'm going to be using it.

There are a few grammar rules like that; I constantly fuck up the "x and y" pronoun rules unless I'm going really slow and deliberate in my copy-editing.
