Not a typo, but word choice:

#+begin_quote
  “It's ... sentient?” asked Amaryllis.

  “If not, then sapient,” said Esuen.
#+end_quote

I might swap "sentient" and "sapient"; "sapient" (etymologically "wise") seems stronger than sentient (etymologically "having senses"). Though usage of "sentient" has drifted wildly after science fiction became a thing.
