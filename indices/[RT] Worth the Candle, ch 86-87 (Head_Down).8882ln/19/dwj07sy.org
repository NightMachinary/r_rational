Maybe that's just me, but it seems something changed recently (happened already with chapter 85) on archiveofourown that makes FanFictionDownloader unable to correctly parse the contents from that web site (it only gets the chapters titles).

Not a big deal, but I can't find a way to download a selection of chapters from the website either, but maybe that's something only members can do ?

Also, the download > mobi button has repeatedly not worked form me today... but just with that specific story : with an other, randomly chosen, one it worked ok. I'd suspect the difference of size in that case.

My current workaround > get the whole epub and edit the book with calibre ^^

Well, I thought I'd share this, just in case the problem hasn't reached the ones in charge of ao3

Oh, and thanks for the excellent work ! :)
