Well that was intense. Poor Taft, I liked him.

More relevantly, can the party even use Kuum Doona as a reliable base of operations, given its +wanderlust+ automatic relocation defence ability? They can teleport to any place they have been to before, but if Kuum Doona doesn't occupy the same space it occupied when they last been to it, would they still be able to return? In fact, I would imagine this ability was added to it /specifically/ to counter teleportation and the like.

Perhaps it could be stopped, or the teleportation key could be somehow synchronized to it?
