Having thought about it for longer, I'm not sure why skydiving wouldn't work with appropriate effort. But teleporting down to the desired level prevents any aerial interception during descent. Heck, you teleport down and jump in the glove for the ride to the wall. It seems many times safer than what they did in the story.
