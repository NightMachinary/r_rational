Well, Larkspur tried to negotiate with Joon, but as soon as Joon tried to run, Lark chased after him. Then, Lark tracked his group down and sent five choppers full of people after them. Aside from that (which isn't conclusive evidence by any means), we're mostly going on Mary's word (which is fallible, but becoming less so as time goes on).

At high levels of soul magic, we don't know that the copies revert over time: presumably, you could make a set of values that were more self-consistent (and therefore, stable). Furthermore, repeated application of the soul hacking will likely adjust other values into a more stable configuration. Finally, those people were originally sentenced to the same prison as Fallatehr, so it's a good guess that they're evil. Since they value Fallatehr, they are likely to want to save him at any cost, and would be tremendous pains in the ass anyways. Valencia, lacking a soul, is immune to soul magic, so it's not a concern with her.
