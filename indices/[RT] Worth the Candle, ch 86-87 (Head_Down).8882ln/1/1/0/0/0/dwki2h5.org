I get your point, but we have only limited evidence that e.g. Larkspur was trying to kill them and wouldn't have been willing to negotiate and/or take them alive.

Like, I get the reasoning, and I mostly agree with it, but overall it's not that far from "He had a dark shape in his hands and we were in a bad neighborhood so we shot him 20 times just to be safe".
