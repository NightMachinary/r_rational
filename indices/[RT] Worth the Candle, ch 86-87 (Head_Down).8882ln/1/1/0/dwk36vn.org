Do we have strong evidence that Aumann or Larkspur were evil?

Aumann, I can sort of buy. He kidnapped Mary at gunpoint, left the heroes to maybe starve to death in a desert fortress, and /maybe/ tortured Mary before rolling it back with time magic. I'm not sure it makes killing him and the people who worked for him morally justified, but fine.

Do we have any evidence Larkspur was evil? All he did, he did in the name of catching a group of known international terrorists. He tried to negotiate with Juniper. He /maybe/ set Fenn up to die Task Force X style, and /probably/ made a deal with Doris Finch (and the cousin marriage thing is gross)... but we don't know if the Fire Team had orders to kill witnesses at all, and the deal with Doris is more shady than evil, the kind of stuff intelligence agencies do all the time. I'm not sure killing him and his men is justified, especially given that he was running out of duns to track them down.

  and I can justify killing Fallatehrs lackeys because they were in many ways copies of him.

Yeah, but the "copy" part would have reverted over time. Really, there's not much difference between them and Valencia, but Valencia was Joon-bait and the others were generic henchmen NPCs, so they had to die.

  Well, that guy was pretty weird by any standard

It's more the "birdfucker" part I was objecting to.
