This is especially a concern in the context of no quest for Amaryllis regaining power. I definitely see a conflict between them. Especially considering that she has control over all of their gear. Perhaps if they are lucky, Amaryllis will be too focused on the coming technological revolution to worry about political power. She might actually turn out to be more powerful that way, so it's not the worst idea.

One important difference between Amaryllis and Welexi is that Joon has the loyalty of the party, so that interaction won't be quite so one-sided. I do think you're right however: these are the protagonists, but they are definitely following their own path (which is not that of a hero). Until recently, however, almost everyone that they fought/killed was evil in some sense (Aumann, Lakspur, Fallatehr), and I can justify killing Fallatehrs lackeys because they were in many ways copies of him.

Well, that guy was /pretty weird/ by any standard. Suicidal or crazy in some sense. Speaking of which, oh shit what happenes if he interferes with the arrow?
