When mind-controlled by Fallatehr, Amaryllis reflects that the group isn't that far from the stereotypical "murderhobo" RPG party. They have killed /a lot of people/ in the name of "It was more convenient that way".

I mean, yeah, they do need to access that fortress before the locust dies, and there was no way they could let Fallatehr live (though they were kind of casual about killing his minions), and Larkspur and his minions needed to die because... he made a deal with Doris Finch, I guess?

And when you're looking at it objectively, beyond the whole "The hero killed 20 gazillion people during the movie", there's not that much evidence that the protagonists are "The heroes". Everyone is assuming that their quests will allow Juniper to become some sort of god and rewrite reality to not completely suck, but they don't really have any evidence that will happen (especially since it obviously didn't happen to Arthur).

Also, one of the main objectives is to get Mary back "in power", somehow, but do we know if that would even be a good thing in the first place? She obviously has the loosest ethics of the group (I keep thinking that Fenn and Joon weren't wanted serial murderers before they met her); she's argued before for "It's okay to steal things because us getting more powerful is an inherently good thing". We don't know exactly how she ended up in the Risen Lands with a Black Ops squad after her (she claimed to be on a semi-official mission to retrieve the key, but I think it's fairly obvious she was striking on her own), except that it probably involved her family being assholes. But... given that we know of her, it's not ridiculous to imagine that she was banished because of something awful she did and had to work from there.

Overall, a lot of this is giving me the same vibe as I got from Welexi's crew in /Shadows of the Limelight/, except that Joon has more agency and a better read on Mary than Dominic did. All of that to say, if my read on this is right, then I look forward to seeing this house of cards collapse :D

Miscellaneous comments (wow, it's been a while since I've done those):

  “I was under Esuen's sway when I took it from the rail company,” said Souno. “I am the only one who knows of your malfeasance.”
#+end_quote

Sounds like Souno is /not/ happy about this situation. We're getting a lot of "Character is mind-warped but retains their personality and agency" this book. I like it! I hope we get more of his perspective in future chapters.

  “It is,” said Val, looking up from her book. “And that's not okay.”
#+end_quote

I love the idea of Val being shaped and becoming more assertive by reading Harry Potter. She's being raised by J.K. Rowling like the rest of us, the only difference is for her it's happening of the course of weeks, not years.

  Amaryllis placed a hand on Valencia's shoulder. “We'll leave V behind. She's the most capable of us, and if things don't go as planned, she'll be able to get you to safety, beyond the reach of the other tuung. Either we'll be back within a week, or she'll be more than capable of taking care of you, especially given the resources that we plan to leave you with.”

"Guys, you know what goes well every time? Splitting the party. Let's do it again!" Well, I hope she wins a lot of archery-and-soul-drinking contests while she's offscreen.

  and then I was inside the black void of the glove, a place so familiar that it was becoming like home.

  “Just shut your fucking mouth or I'll kill you myself you weirdo birdfucker,” said Fenn.

Subplot! Also, not cool, Fenn. I like these little moments where she reminds the group that she's actually pretty racist.
