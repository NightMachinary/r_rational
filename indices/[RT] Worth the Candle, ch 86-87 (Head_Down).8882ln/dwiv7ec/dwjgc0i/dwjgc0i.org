Discussion here [[http://www.askamathematician.com/2012/08/q-if-earth-was-flat-would-there-be-the-horizon-if-so-what-would-it-look-like-if-the-earth-was-flat-and-had-infinite-area-would-that-change-the-answer/]] about a theoretical infinite flat earth says the horizon would look basically the same

Atmosphere is also going to be a factor, although we can treat air as effectively transparent its not entirely, and you get a lot of diffraction from other light sources (can't remember exactly how the sun works in Aerb but lets assume its the same) and raleigh scattering so at a far enough distance those would start to affect vision a lot. I'm not sure how the maths works out, but you could also say your world has a thicker atmosphere

edit: I found a discussion of a similar problem that might interest you.[[https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/69741/how-could-there-be-a-horizon-on-a-flat-earth]]
