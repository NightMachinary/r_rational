  Larkspur and his minions needed to die because... he made a deal with Doris Finch, I guess?

  Do we have strong evidence that Aumann or Larkspur were evil?

They're both ruthless people who wanted the party dead or captured at best. /Not/ killing them would have been stupid and risky. Especially Larkspur, who became desperate enough to use the strategic elf Bone reserve and make deals with people in forbidden areas, and was constantly on their heels.

Any protagonist who tried to keep them alive would have been painfully, unbelievably moral, from my point of view, and a chore to read about.

I don't see the moral quandary over someone killing the assassins hunting them. Or killing a mage that has captured and tortured someone they know, and has an ever-growing thirst for gold that they sate by taking it from wherever they find, killing whoever is in their way.

Amaryllis has some sketchy morals, especially with her recent idea of the ends justifying the means, because June will be a god later, and can fix everything then.

This whole recent mission has certainly been a lot more morally grey-black than earlier missions. But that doesn't mean the party have secretly been monsters the whole time.
