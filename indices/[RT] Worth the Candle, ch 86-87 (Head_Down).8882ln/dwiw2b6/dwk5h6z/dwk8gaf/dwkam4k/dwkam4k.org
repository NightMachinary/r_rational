Most people in life or death situations, even in rational fiction, maintain behaviour that is not too far outside the bounds of â€˜normal'. When there is a significant chance you and your closest companions are going to die within the next minute in a dark bottomless pit in a foreign land after spending the last half hour fighting for your life then I'm unwilling to judge you poorly for any but the very worst of behaviour.
