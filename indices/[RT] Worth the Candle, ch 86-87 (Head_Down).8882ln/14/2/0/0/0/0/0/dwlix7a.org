Sounds like it's not actually an infinite plain --- it loops instead.

  *** Common Knowledge About Aerb

  1. Aerb was about ten times larger than Earth, flat instead of a sphere, and shaped like a hexagon. If you went far enough north, you would end up in the south, and it was the same in any direction. (Amaryllis gave me a measurement for Aerb and I had to approximate Earth's size given that I could only remember how wide the continental United States was.)

  2. Aerb had no time zones, because the sun was in the same apparent position no matter where on Aerb you were, with no parallax. Despite that, there were still seasons, because the sun got smaller in the winter and larger in the summer. There were also regional variations in temperature caused by something called the projection layer, a super-atmospheric phenomenon that Fenn was ignorant of and Amaryllis didn't know too much about.

Of course, it might still be an infinite plane, but each Aerb tile is almost identical ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation][many worlds style]]). That would be nearly impossible to prove, I think.

I initially though that would break down pretty quickly. Then I realized that if somebody, Fred1, walked from Aerb1 to Aerb2, then Fred0 would be walking from Aerb0 to Aerb1, etc.
