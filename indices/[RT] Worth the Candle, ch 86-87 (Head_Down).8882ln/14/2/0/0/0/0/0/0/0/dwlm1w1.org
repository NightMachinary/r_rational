I'm guessing the infinite flat plane thing includes elf knowledge. It strikes me as something so obvious to ask about that somebody would have made real effort. On the other hand, maybe elves like to keep their secrets.

You might be able to determine what's going on by measuring the curvature of space, but I bet that would only raise more questions given the “fuck you” nature of the sun and the moon.

I suppose there might be some sort of curvature that makes sense that I just can't imagine because it's not analogous to a 2D world projected on a 3D object.
