Look for longest sightlines. [[https://beyondhorizons.eu/lines-of-sight/][Off the cuff]] I found 450 km, but that's for mountains in ideal conditions. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility][Wikipedia]] mentions 300 km, but limits this to objects on the ground and reasonably sized, the latter of which mountains are kind of not.
