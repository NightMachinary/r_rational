I think a major problem a lot of us have is that it's good for a lot of it, then it just starts dragging for no real reason. There's so much potential for a great story, but it just feels like the author is bogging the narrative down. I think people complain because they want to see improvement, a return to form from earlier parts of the story where there felt like actual progression after a dozen chapters, rather than the same internal monologue on repeat for weeks on end. I feel a downvote isn't needed if it still fits into the category of the subreddit, which it does, and would only serve to discourage the author or make them double down instead of seeing that many people have valid criticisms that we hope get addressed
