What's especially annoying is that a lot of time is spent on these characters that just aren't interesting or well-written and are annoying. I don't remember half of the people in the group and they all feel like background characters, yet there's multiple chapters dedicated to these characters that I doubt many, if any, care about. Honestly, there's a lot of other really puzzling pacing issues. I guess we're just all deluding ourselves hoping Delve will eventually return to what it was like in its initial chapters, me included.
