Well we haven't seen a full dps at silver rank. But the next ch will show that even at lv 24 Rain would be trashed by that blue. If you pick my argument rationaly, then offencive auras are powerfull enough to compete with dps classes or they don't. The first option will lead to OP main character because is aoe and he can avoid frendly fire, also combat would be very dull. The second option would make the skill allotment a waste of actual skill point to be expended in support skills. The same argument can be have with the wards. AoE skills are very difficult to balance in games for a reason. Thats why most aoe classes are support, they make the everyone else do their shit better, period. In the end we would get either an OP MC or an hippicritical MC with a "do what i say intead of what i do" motto.
