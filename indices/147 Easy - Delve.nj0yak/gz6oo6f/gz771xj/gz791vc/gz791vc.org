A lot of people say that, yet somehow the author still has 2200 patrons (meaning probably about $7,000/month) and an incredibly active comments section and discord server.

Shoot, I even agree with the statement, yet I just finished reading the chapter and now I'm in the comments. I was a patron for a while before finally giving it up because I just didn't care that much about the story and got tired of being teased. I left it for a long time then went back when it popped up here on r/r.

What is it about this story? Large, LARGE sections of it are incredibly boring, the pacing is glacial, there's no particular conflict, the protagonist isn't particularly proactive and hasn't had much of any character evolution, the worldbuilding hasn't evolved much in fifty chapters...yet somehow we're still reading. Seriously, what's going on?
