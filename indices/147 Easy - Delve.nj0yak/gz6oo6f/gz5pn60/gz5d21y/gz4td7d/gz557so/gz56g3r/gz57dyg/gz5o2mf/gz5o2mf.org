I was trying to figure out if he gets much more useful in combat before 26, when he can take Ethereal Aura. If so, then it may be to his advantage to get a blue under 25 in that it allows him to upgrade so he can deal with a blue over 25.

The only real advantage he gets before 26 is getting to choose new offensive auras.

Maybe being a walking blender (Shear) will be amazing? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
