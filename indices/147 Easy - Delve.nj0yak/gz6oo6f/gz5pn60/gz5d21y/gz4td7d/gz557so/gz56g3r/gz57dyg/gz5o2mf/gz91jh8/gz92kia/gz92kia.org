Yeah, that's a good point.

I went back and looked at the [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/627111/133-breaking][fight with Hegar]] and I think he might have been able to kill Hegar if he had Shroud/Radiance/Ethereal Aura. He does 10k DPS for 2,700 MP and it brings Hegar [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/631237/134-unbreakable][down below 6k HP]]. I suspect if he weren't worried about mage burning himself he could have opened with 2 seconds of 10k DPS, which looks like it would have killed Hegar outright.

Anyway... I also forgot about the synergy skills. Aura Synergy will go from an 80% boost to a 140% boost at level 24 (with maxed aura skills), which ain't nothing.
