I mocked things up on an old sheet.

It's a decent 50-100% all-around bump but nothing major. Suppression is a good addition. Max DPS without Extend goes from 3.5k to 5.7k at 18m radius.

In contrast, level 26 has a max DPS without Extend of 586k using the combination of 5 elemental attacks at once, at 62.5m radius, with Wards and Suppression active. This does exhaust his mana in a single second but it refreshes multiple times a minute.
