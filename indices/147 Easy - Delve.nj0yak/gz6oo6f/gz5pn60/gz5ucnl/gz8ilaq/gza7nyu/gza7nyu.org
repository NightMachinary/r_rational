#+begin_quote
  Are we reading different stories? The linked chapter only says diplomacy is not an option. It says nothing about their intelligence or lack thereof.
#+end_quote

I don't want to quote the full context because it's long, but it's the six paragraphs that start with "Tallheart blinked. â€œA normal monster might recognize a weapon and choose to keep it, but not a mere stone. It would perhaps use it as a tool, but then it would discard it." The clearest part is here:

#+begin_quote
  *The chapter said:*

  The implications were unsettling. The existence of a hyper-violent pack of roid-apes was horrifying enough without them having learned to make tools. It raised terrifying questions about just how intelligent a monster could be. A few months ago, Rain might have had qualms about killing such creatures, but no more. He didn't trust the opinion of just anyone, but he trusted Ameliah. If she said diplomacy wasn't an option, then it wasn't, end of story. The smarter a monster was, the more urgently it needed killing.

  Monsters were monsters. They might act like they were alive---eating, sleeping, even playing and forming complex social structures---but they weren't.
#+end_quote

It's true that what I wrote is a meme and not a literal quote, but I think it's a fair representation. Rain, Tallheart, and Ameliah are in the deeps, far from any human settlement that might be endangered by the Hababas, so they don't have the "proactive self-defense" excuse. Our heroes are here solely to kill things in order to level up and they are keeping the deepstone club heads from the Hababas that they killed yesterday. Therefore "it's okay to kill them and take their stuff."

As to the 'all it said is that diplomacy is impossible' element, if that's the only part one leans on then that just makes it worse. Try substituting it with a different group: The +monsters+ African tribesmen can have a society, play, use tools, wear clothes, understand the significance of a crown, and build structures...but +they totally aren't intelligent and self-aware+ diplomacy is impossible, so they aren't people, so it's okay to +kill+ enslave them and take their stuff." See how it becomes much more obvious that this is not okay?
