Maybe a small child. Birds build houses, bears build dens, a new one every day if the season requires shelter. Pigs and cows demonstrate quite a bit of intelligence but we still eat and/or hunt all of them. Something having a bigger brain than a particular threshold doesn't suddenly make it immoral to hunt when your life is in danger, even of you knew it might be there.

Otherwise we'd all be vegetarians.
