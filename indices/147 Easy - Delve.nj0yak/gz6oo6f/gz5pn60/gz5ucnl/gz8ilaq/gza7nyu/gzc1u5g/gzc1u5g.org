But the excuse was never that they're not intelligent. In fact that whole section (the one starting with "Tallheart blinked") goes on and on to make a point of how much more intelligent these hababas or their leaders are likely to be than their more typical counterparts, because a =blue boss= must be properly introduced.

The reasons I see presented for killing them are:

1. The primary purpose of the trip is to hunt and kill monsters.
2. The way down is still a mystery and this group of hababas is particularly dangerous. The kind of enemy that you don't want to stumble upon while exploring (as we saw last chapter), or worse, blocking your escape route(as has been discussed in previous chapters).
