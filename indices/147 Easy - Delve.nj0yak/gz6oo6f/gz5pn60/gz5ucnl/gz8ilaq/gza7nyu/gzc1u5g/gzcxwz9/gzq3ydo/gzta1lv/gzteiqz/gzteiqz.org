Well this is where the disconnect is, I think.

"My buddy was gonna show me his sweet hunting spot when we got attacked by a couple bears. They were foaming at the mouth and way aggressive, it was crazy. We had to put them down. Anyway we went off the trail through the woods to get to his spot when we found more of them. These ones were weird man, they had all these marker trees set up and old leaves piled up like they were using the same den for a while. And all of them had the same foamy mouth going on. They were right by the trail and I saw one carrying a live turkey ant tearing off its feathers to make it scream. We put those down too. And this was right by the trail too like, what if those bears hurt someone? These weren't normal bears and there's something weird going on in that forest man."
