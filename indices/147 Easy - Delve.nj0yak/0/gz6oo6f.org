I think I'm at the point where I just have to drop this. There's been far too much naval gazing for so long, too much dragging the story by bogging down the chapters, and we finally get another blue and it's underwhelming because we've already been told that nothing will happen without certain levels being reached, so we know we're about to have to sit through more of the same stuff again, and I just can't get excited for the weekly chapter of this anymore. I think I'm just going to sit on this until next year before I bother picking this back up. It's got so much potential waiting in the background, I just don't want to sit through the most boring training arc ever, especially since it's taking place in the title-naming location and it's somehow still boring
