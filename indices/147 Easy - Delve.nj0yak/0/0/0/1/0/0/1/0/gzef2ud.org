  You mean how he's aiming to get a bunch of damage auras so that he can be combat effective?

He's not really doing that to be combat effective, right now the reason he's going to be picking 3 more damage auras is simply that he already picked two, and by the rules by which he expects rare classes to work, he absolutely has to pick 3 more or he shoots himself in the foot.
