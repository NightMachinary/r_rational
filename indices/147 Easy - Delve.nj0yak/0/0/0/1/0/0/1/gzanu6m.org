You mean how he's aiming to get a bunch of damage auras so that he can be combat effective? Valid point, although I'd say he's still a strong support (Force Ward, Essence Well, and Winter), it's just that now he also wants to be secondary DPS.

My question is, after he reaches level 26 and gets his 10x damage boost, will he be able to keep up with dedicated DPS builds of the same level or will he still be in the same "not good enough" role but at a higher level?
