I'm reading because it's free and sunk cost fallacy kind of, it's also not awful, it's just too slow to be especially interesting, meaning i'd never recommend this to anyone and i'd probably give it 3 stars right now.

basically it's not bad, but it have fallen to mediocre due to shooting its pacing with a shotgun and forgetting it was a thing that ever existed.

i like how the system is build up and how the world works, but its too slow for me too feel the author will ever do anything with it, honestly if i dropped this and found it again in 2 years i'd be like "sweet something nice to read", and then be disapointed by the fact 100 chapters just amount to them doing a half delve in this dungeon.

many novels do have the opposite problem where they are too fast and keep escalating until the world no longer make sense, that is also bad, the middle road is usually the best one.
