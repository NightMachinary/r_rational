How much does Rain's combat ability increase with a new level cap of 24? I know 25 is where things start to skyrocket, but 24 with some additional metamagic skills and other abilities should still be quite the improvement.

The info about monsters, abberants, and unique names was really interesting. I wonder why such special monsters would eventually be named by what is essentially a facet of reality itself, and what's really the truth of the system. And I don't think it's a planet-sized energy harvester this time.
