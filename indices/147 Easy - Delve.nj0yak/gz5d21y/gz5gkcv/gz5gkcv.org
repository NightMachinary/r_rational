If we wants to unlock the higher skill caps in the maximum of five trees, he has to take skills in offensive and defensive wards next. (See “Legendary Monolithic” in the [[https://bestspellever.fandom.com/wiki/Class#Monolithic_Classes][class table]]) So, we won't see new metamagic skills until he passes level 25.

Prismatic Intent and Ethereal Aura ([[https://bestspellever.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Compendium][skills list]]) are going to make him much more effective on a team.

Also, it looks like he won't be able to unlock the fourth tier of the skill trees until he's past level 25. If XP progression continues as is (unlikely) he would be able to at level 29.
