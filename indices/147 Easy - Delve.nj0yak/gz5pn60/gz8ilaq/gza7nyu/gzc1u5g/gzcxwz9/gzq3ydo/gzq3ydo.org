If we're gonna make this into a poor racism analogue well maybe not French people but if you ever have the misfortune of a redneck showing you how he prefers to tie a noose, or perhaps threaten to murder your family in <wrong state, thank god>, you learn pretty quickly that /in some situations you can't take the risk of finding out how it would turn out/ if they ever had plausible deniability.

In the case of the dungeon monsters, we haven't seen them make threats or speak with an accent or anything but we have seen them torture weaker monsters and attack on sight.

Besides, aren't these supposed to be mana constructs rather than anything even alive?
