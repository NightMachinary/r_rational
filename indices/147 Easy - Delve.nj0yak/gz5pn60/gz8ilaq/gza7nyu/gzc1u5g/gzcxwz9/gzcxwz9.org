Yes, exactly. The team has ample evidence suggesting that these creatures are sophonts, albeit primitive ones. The monsters are living on their own in the depths, no threat to anyone, but it's okay for Rain et al to show up and kill them so that Rain can level up.

We as the audience are supposed to be okay with it because the monsters aren't human and we are strongly invested in seeing Rain gain levels. I'm simply pointing out that there's a serious moral issue here.

EDIT: I didn't respond to your second point, sorry. I don't think that it would be a good excuse to say "I wouldn't want these French people blocking my escape route, therefore I will kill them before continuing."
