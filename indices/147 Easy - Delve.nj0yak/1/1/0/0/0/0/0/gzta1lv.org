"I wanted to get rich, so I took the train down to Alabama last night, intending to find some rich people to kill and loot. I walked into this huge mansion, figuring there would be rich people upstairs. There were a bunch of teenagers playing XBox in the living room. I wasn't here for them but I couldn't take the risk of them being between me and the door so I murdered them all."

See how that doesn't really make you sound good? Or, if I were going to stick closer to your statement in the parent post:

"I wanted to get rich, so I took the train down to Alabama last night, intending to find some rich people to kill and loot. I walked into this guy's house. He had a sunburned neck and an Alabama accent. He had a piece of rope and offered to show me how to tie a noose, so I shot him in the face."

I get the point you're trying to make, but it doesn't hold up in the context where you have made a positive choice to come /into the other person's house/ with the intent to commit murder.
