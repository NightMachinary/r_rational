Brockton's Celestial Forge has been pretty good as far as tinker fics go. Yeah it's an infinitely scaling tinker, but I feel like the author does a good job of showing people's character flaws and strengths. The protagonist /does/ want to do good by humanity, but he's sorta forced into the villain route to keep his abilities secret and scaling.

It does focus a lot on the tinker powers though, which slows the story down a lot. Thankfully, the author is a freak and writes like 20k words every week.
