Not >6 months old, but I wanted to recommend it anyway (don't hate me): a “wizard” having a physics like understanding of magic (diff eqs, orbitals, whatnot), is teleported into a world with Xianxia style cultivation. He attempts to bridge the gap between the two magical systems, while we enjoy his and the cultivators amazement at the feats they each make (eg, a person that punches through stone: in a cultivation world thats nothing, but for a wizard it may appear quite impressive. And vise versa.)
