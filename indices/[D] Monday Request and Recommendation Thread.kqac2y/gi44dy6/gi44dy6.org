What are you guys following on RR that isn't less than 6 months old? I feel like I've found nothing fun for a while..

â€‹

Here's my list:

- Wake of the Ravager
- Ave Xia Rem
- Delve
- Forge of Destiny
- Eight
- Worth the Candle

That's it, I had more but they're all either in hiatus or ended.. What am I missing out on ?
