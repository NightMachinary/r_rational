Some more stuff

Re:monarch is very good and pretty young.

Magic Smithing is decent and also pretty young.

Zombie Knight Saga has been going on for a long time and it's very good.

Ar'Kendrythist is somewhat controversial here but I've found it to be getting better and better. Very good.

He Who Fights With Monsters and Defiance of the Fall. Popcorn stories and pretty fun.

Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends. Litrpg xianxia done with a very consistent power structure. Sometimes a bit off but usually pretty good. Sometimes very good.
