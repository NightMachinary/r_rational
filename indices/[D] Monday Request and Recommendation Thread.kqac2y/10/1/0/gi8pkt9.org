Anti-rec Kiss of Shadows. LKH was a great author when her ex-husband was doing her editing. Her best book was Obsidian Butterfly. To quote the 'most helpful' amazon review on Kiss, which is a one star review by the way, "This book is a trash fire." I read Meredith Gentry up to about book 5 when it devolved into reverse harem orgies. You aren't doing yourself a favor by starting that series. Read Kushiel's Dart and it's sequels instead.
