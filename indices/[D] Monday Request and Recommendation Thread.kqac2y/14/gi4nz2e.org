I started reading [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38100/meet-the-freak][Meet the Freak]]. It has an eight feet tall Canadian guy as the protagonist, getting isekai'd to another world. But within the first chapter it turns out that pretty much all the residents around him are also from other worlds. Some getting isekai'd a few days ago, and some getting isekai'd a decade past. The setting is also pretty unique, with most people living in mountaintops since it floods every week up to a certain elevation. Overall, I've got conflicted feelings though.

The story has some really good munchkining, with a highly munchkin-able magic system. The protagonist is pretty knowledgeable and shows it. The characters are also pretty smart overall and usually act the way you'd expect real people to act (a bit too much sass in my opinion though). What I don't like though are the harem vibes. The author said he won't be making one, but with each new "main" character being female and getting saved by the protagonist it kinda feels like the setup to one of those trashy harem litrpgs on KU. Some of the decisions also feel inconsistent morally, but I can't really put to words what. Overall, if you really want some munchkining and aren't too discerning about anything else I'd say give it a try.

I also started HPMOR again. Does Harry get more bearable and less snobby than he is in the beginning? He acts like every one of those iamverysmart guys I've met in school over my life and it's very annoying. It's like he's more a walking font of Wikipedia articles than any substantive character, and it's quickly making me sour towards the story.
