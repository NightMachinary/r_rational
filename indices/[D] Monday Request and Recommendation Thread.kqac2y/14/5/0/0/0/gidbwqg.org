That's a kinder phrasing. Big difference between saying something is bad unilaterally, versus it not being to your tastes.

Perhaps a helpful metaphor is a friend comes to you with an oil painting they're proud of, and you say it's bad. They come back to you three years later, saying they've spent hours upon hours each week on it, trying to improve, and you say it's still bad and hasn't gotten any better.

While that would be comical if true, it's unlikely and uncharitable to their efforts. It's also rather a mean way to approach radical honesty as a personal policy of expression.
