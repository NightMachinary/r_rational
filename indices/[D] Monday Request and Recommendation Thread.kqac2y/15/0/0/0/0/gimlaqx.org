Very interesting and thank you for sharing! Maybe time for some virtuous deception ploys? Tempered of course by tales emphasising respect for other's agency.

Although that's difficult even as an adult. Manipulate someone into making a choice they'd be more happy with, or respect their right to make suboptimal decisions?

And even that assumes perfect understanding of future consequences. What if you're wrong? Yet too, what if you're right---gah, this is troublesome to ponder.
