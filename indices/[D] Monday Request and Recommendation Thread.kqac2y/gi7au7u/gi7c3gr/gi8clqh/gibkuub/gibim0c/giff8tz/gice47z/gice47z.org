While there are probably no new flash games appearing, with something like [[https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle][this]] and the archive [[http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/][archiving]] flash games, we probably don't have to worry too much about these old games.
