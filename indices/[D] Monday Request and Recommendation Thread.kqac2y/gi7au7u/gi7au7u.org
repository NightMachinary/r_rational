Some game recs:

- Monster Train: A rogue deck-building game. You need to build game-breaking synergistic combinations to win, so people here will probably enjoy it. I personally like it a lot, especially the undead class (which is not unlocked at the start, unfortunately).
- [[https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/]] : A catalogue of a lot of flash games. Kind of like an App Store on Windows where everything is free and without microtransactions.
- [[https://amanita-design.net/games/machinarium.html][Machinarium]]: A 2D puzzle point-and-click adventure with superb hand-drawn graphics and very good puzzles (and some not so good puzzles which you can skip by playing a minigame and unlocking hints). Old, but one of the best games I ever played. It's also a Flash game. (It's such a shame Flash died. The gov should force these things to become opensource upon dying.)
- Antichamber: A 3D puzzle game with unique graphics and non-Euclidean physics, where you have to seriously challenge your intuition and assumptions to proceed.

An anti-rec for Delve, since I have seen a lot of recs for it in this sub, even though the response on its own threads here is mixed. I regret reading Delve a lot. It's bait-and-switch; Delve starts as a slow-paced litrpg that focuses on running some numbers in choosing what skills and attributes to take, and has good writing on the RPG system itself. It also has that experimentation attitude we all adore. Unfortunately, other aspects of the writing are quite bad, and the author switches to slice-of-life around chapter 45, and the whole RPG system pretty much disappears from the story. The MC is also a complete moron in social skills and game theory, and even his supposedly rational build turns out to be mediocre as he has trouble beating monsters half his level, and is, in fact, more a poignant demonstration of the fact that we nerds often dedicate a lot of attention to some noncritical but interesting area while ignoring what matters. All in all, we get the story of a rational-wannabe failure whose life goes nowhere, while the narrative pretends to be still following a disrupting hero.
