This is a really minor point that wouldn't impact my enjoyment of the story much, but it just jumped out at me.....wouldn't her getting dumped in a new world impact the "fate" of that world just as much as surviving in her own world would?

Just as she was supposed to die in in her world, presumably she wasn't supposed to exist in the new one.
