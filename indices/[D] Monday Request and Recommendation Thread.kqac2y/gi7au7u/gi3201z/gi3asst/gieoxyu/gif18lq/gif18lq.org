Completely agreed with this. To add the MC tends to be not think things through properly and is successful often due to plot armor. There's been numerous time I agreed with one of the other main character [spoiler]Irulon[/spoiler] about how stupid the MC was. It's a fun story but don't expect it to be rational at all.
