I've been dabbling around in cultivation novels, and I feel there's only 3 worth reading.

Cradle, as mentioned by another commenter, is probably the best and highest quality of them, written and published by a professional author, although it does play the cultivation genre pretty straight. Excellent western take, and the payoff and progression is amazing, especially when it culminates in awesome volumes like Ghostwater or Wintersteel. Often considered one of the best progression fantasy novels too.

Forge of Destiny on RoyalRoad. Follows a commoner girl joining a sect and studying her way up. The setting is relatively straightforward for cultivation, but it does some cool stuff I rarely see in cultivation that I greatly appreciate. Cultivation novels basically never focus on school arcs, and FoD so far is only in school, and has a lot of focus on character development and writing. You see a lot of the other sect students and they get a lot of development, which cultivation novels basically never do. The MC also specializes in musical arts. She even attaches herself to a lord as a vassal and is going to try to help her in her goals. It doesn't do anything unique in the setting, but it's approach and focus makes Forge of Destiny a unique cultivation novel and one of the best.

And finally, Forty Milleniums of Cultivation. The only actual Chinese novel among the three, and the only one that doesn't play the genre straight. Preliminary warning, but this is a translated Chinese webnovel, so the writing quality may be a bit...bad and unbearable, if you're not of the crowd used to reading translated webnovels.

It takes a lot of the setting from Warhammer 40K, but really only that and makes its own amazing story. It combines high tech and cultivation, and instead of grimdark the novel is more about the glory and brilliance of humanity and protecting the common people instead of abusing and taking advantage of them.

This series relies the most on your understanding of typical cultivation tropes as it deconstructs the typical themes and tropes and goes against it, and is pretty much the only Chinese cultivation novel in its stance. The starting 200-300 chapters can be a bit generic, although there are still a lot of great moments, and from there on it's just constantly amazing.

It does a lot of cool and unique things. Starting with high tech cultivation, it's also the only cultivation novel that's about protecting the common people, and there's also a lot of philosophical debates and genuinely interesting and competent villains.

Among all cultivation novels, even Western ones like Cradle and Forge of Destiny, I'd say it's the most rational of them. It's hard to describe and do the novel justice as I feel my words are poor and insufficient, but for those savvy in cultivation and it's tropes, FMoC is phenomenal and unique. Definitely worth reading, if translated web novels don't bother you.

I'd recommend Cradle over the others in terms of writing quality and ease of accessibility, but if you're going further into the cultivation rabbit hole these other 2 are definitely worth checking out.
