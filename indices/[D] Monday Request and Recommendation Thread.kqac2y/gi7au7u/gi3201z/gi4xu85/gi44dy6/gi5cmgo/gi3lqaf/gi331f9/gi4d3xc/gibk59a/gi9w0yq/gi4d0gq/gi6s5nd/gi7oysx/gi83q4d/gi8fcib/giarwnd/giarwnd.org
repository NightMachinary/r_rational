Forge is a little weird in that it was originally a quest that was edited into a story. Parts of it do not translate well, and that's why you end up seeing the character go on missions you never saw the description of, or make decisions about what to do next that seemingly come out of nowhere. Without the constant chatter of the quest threads and the author's presented options / out of character explanations it can be hard to really get a handle on the narrative and it can feel like a slog, especially when the character seems to plateau in power. You don't get to see the training options being picked over and over to try and reach the end of this level's experience bar.
