Can I correctly assume that you have heard of Critical Roll?

If not, they have two campaigns, both with over 100 4 hour long episodes.

I would recommend starting with Campaign 2, as they started recording Campaign 1 after they were already fairly far along, something like level 9-11. The better audio is also a big factor.

You can always go back and listen to Campaign 1 after catching up to Campaign 2 if you like it.
