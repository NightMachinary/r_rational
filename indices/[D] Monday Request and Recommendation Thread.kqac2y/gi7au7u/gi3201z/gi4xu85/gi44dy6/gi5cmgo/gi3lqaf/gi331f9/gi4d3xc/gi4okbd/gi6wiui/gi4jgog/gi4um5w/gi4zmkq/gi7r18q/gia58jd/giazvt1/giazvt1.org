I remember killing myself laughing at the Rockport Unlimited, and the race, crystal kingdom, and western town arcs are notably good. The second campaign is really slow, especially at the start, but some of the characters are memorable (Duck, the goat, some of the minor characters) and it has a strong ending and some really, really high points in the middle. Kind of enjoying the new campaign, there are some issues in pacing and the characters don't seem to have a lot of agency, and the dad really needs to read how a rogue works if only so he can realize he could be sneak attacking every turn, but I really do like parts of the setting and Travis is a surprisingly OK DM.
