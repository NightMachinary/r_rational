I'd highly recommend Fantasy High - it's a little more comedy-focused Practical Guide or Worth the Candle, but as the narrative unfolds it becomes clear that Brennan Lee Mulligan (the DM) has created a really fascinating, richly-detailed world with a plot that ties together so many narrative threads. Whilst there's a combat encounter every other episode in the first season, I think the players are sufficiently skilled at unique and innovative solutions - and keeping the comedy going - that I didn't get bored watching those.

It also has a really great emotional rationality, if that makes sense? Some characters (well, some NPCs) will come out with engaging, meaningful emotional responses and advice that, honestly, I feel is very applicable to real life situations.

The story itself is set in a world that, except for the country the main characters live in, is fairly standard DnD fare. The action of the first season is set in Elmville, which is a sort of a modernised DnD world - cars exist, but they run on elementals, there's a genie who runs an ice-cream shop, and the main characters are all students that attend the Aguefort Adventuring Academy, a high school that essentially trains adventurers.

It's also very aware of a lot of DnD cliches, and I think avoids them or runs headlong into them in hilarious and interesting ways. For example, the Principal is very clear in the welcome speech that, yes, they are essentially training the students to become murderhobos - "and what a noble, dignified profession that is!"

Tl;dr, Fantasy High is a comedy DnD podcast in a modern setting with two seasons, the first one fully on youtube, the second one mostly on Dropout (a streaming service that you can do a three-day free trial run of).
