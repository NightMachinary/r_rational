Seconding Fantasy High, but that campaign is only one in the "Dimension 20" series. The Unsleeping City is another, which I found to be even better. This one is an urban fantasy set in real life New York City, with magic an monsters being hidden from normal people by the Umbral Arcana. It's a bit darker and grittier in tone, but still hilarious. Lots of very powerful emotional moments, too.

These two campaigns aren't continuations of each other or anything, so you can watch them in any order.
