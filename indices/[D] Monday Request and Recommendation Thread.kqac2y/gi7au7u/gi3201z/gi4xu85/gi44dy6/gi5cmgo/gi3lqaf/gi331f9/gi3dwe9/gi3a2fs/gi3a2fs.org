40 millenniums is a solid story, but be warned that it is looooooong. Like Chinese webnovels are extremely long. On top of that, some people find the first arc somewhat boring. It only really starts getting really good AFTER chapter 400ish when the second arc begins. So keep in mind you might have to stick to the story for a while before it gets really good. That said, when it gets good, it gets extremely good. Easily my favorite translated cultivation novel. It "borrows" a lot of inspiration from Warhammer 40k, but the author takes that inspiration and makes it their own.

Also when it comes to translated chinese cultivation webnovels, I highly recommend sticking with wuxia novels and avoiding xianxia novels. Wuxia uses cultivation to tell a story while in xianxia cultivation usually is the story.

Also xianxia tends to be much more a category of stories of generic adolescent self insert power fantasies while wuxia can actually be good. Which is why xianxia mc's are almost always selfish immoral/amoral evil, but readers are told to root for them b/c the real antagonists are somehow even worse.

I should note that this isn't limited to chinese xianxia, even western litrpg's or western cultivation novels tend to have mc's that are selfish, if not selfish assholes.

--------------

Random thoughts: Not very sure if xianxia as a genre lends itself to the evil mc because of actual genre limitations, (it's very rational to be selfish in xianxia world since eternal life is an actual possibility), or if it's just that xianxia has never actually had someone write the genre well.
