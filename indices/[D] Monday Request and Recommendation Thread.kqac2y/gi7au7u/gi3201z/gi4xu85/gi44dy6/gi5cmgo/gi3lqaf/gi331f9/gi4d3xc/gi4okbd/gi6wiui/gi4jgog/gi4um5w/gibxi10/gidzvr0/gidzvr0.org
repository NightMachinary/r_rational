Absolutely *Godsfall*. It's criminally underrated, but the worldbuilding and characters are fantastic. Premise is that every god died in a Civil War that rendered most of the planet uninhabitable and left the remains to survive in a magicless ravaged world. A hundreds years pass between then and the start of the story, when seemingly random mortals start to awaken to the divine power of one of those dead gods. Features some really smart players with creative problem solving. Highly recommend.
