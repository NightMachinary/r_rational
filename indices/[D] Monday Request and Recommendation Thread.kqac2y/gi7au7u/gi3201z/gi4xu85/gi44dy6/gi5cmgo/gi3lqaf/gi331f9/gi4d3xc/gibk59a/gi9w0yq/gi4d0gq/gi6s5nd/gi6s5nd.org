Can anyone recommend me rational RWBY fics? Rational-adjacent is alright too, I'm looking for fics that fix or at least better address the characterization issues and poor writing that plagued some characters of the show.

I found Adam's transformation from ruthless terrorist to incompetent stalker especially egregious. How the Ace-Ops are handled was also frustrating to me.
