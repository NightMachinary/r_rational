So apparently this thing is over 2400 chapters? Are those like 2 sentence chapters of what? Just how many words is this thing?

A huge problem with lots of works recommended here is their insane length. Too many stories just drag on, introducing endless side characters and side plots while the main plot just slows to a crawl.

I can't imagine what kind of work would be 2400 chapters without being extremely bad. Unless chapter is somewhat of a mistranslation and it actually means something else in Chinese fiction...
