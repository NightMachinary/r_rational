Anyone have any good tinker fics?

Every fic I read seems to be taylor/si saying "I want to be a hero!" Which is literally the least effective thing you can do with tinker powers. Its really starting to grate at me. I get wanting to be a hero but honestly you are 10-100x more effective creating jobs, repairing buildings, investing in public transport, giving college grants, sci-fi power generation, vertical farms, space elevator, in atmosphere anti-endbringer rail guns, offensive teleportstion tech, or for the love of fuck just repairing the God damn Brockton bay ferry.

Sorry for the rant, but every fic I read about someone saying I want to be a hero! Just kills me. I understand conflict driver but a lot of stories seem to lean on it more than 2 bottle of vodka drunken college kid.

Edit: for people who might say "write your own." I'm trying but 3k words does not a story make. Writing is genuinely hard.
