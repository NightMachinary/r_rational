The problem with cultivation novels is that a lot of the best in the genre are parodies of the crap you find in the rest of the genre. Stuff like 'Cultivation Chat Group,' 'Ascending, Do Not Disturb,' or to a lesser extent 40 Millenniums (this one is more it's own thing than a parody like those other two) can be funny, but you're better off going into them with an understanding of what to expect normally.

In my opinion, the best example of a 'typical cultivation novel' that isn't too badly written is 'I Shall Seal the Heavens.' It has all the standard tropes, almost everything is played straight, and the translation is decent with footnotes to explain many cultural references. This isn't one of the western interpretations or designated gateway novels, but it's understandable enough that a western reader can pick everything up pretty quick.

I haven't read it myself (couldn't get into it), but 'Coiling Dragon' is frequently recommended as a gateway series because it's written like a western fantasy with a XianXia-themed coat of paint.

Both of the series are completely translated on Wuxiaworld, though you might want to read in incognito mode because the website has a free-chapter limit that you can ignore by closing/reopening an incognito window.
