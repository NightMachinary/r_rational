Hm, Wildbow's Pactverse is kinda like that. The world runs on Animism; basically, everything is made of (or has?) Spirits inhabiting it, and they decide whether or not something works. They're pretty consistent and slow to change their opinion, though, so you can squint a bit and make generalisations, and you'll be able to make out general rules. Note that none of the main characters Wildbow has written are particularly rational characters. Blake trusts his gut more than any fancy logic and calculation, and the trio from Pale are thirteen.

Another one where exploration of the world's real foundations is discouraged would be [[https://katalepsis.net/][Katalepsis]]. Basically, trying to make sense of the rules of magic drives people insane per se. Magic is cushioned by lots of occultism to dress up the ugly truths that would destroy a human brain to "safely" let people interact with it. Wouldn't call the main character rational, either; she was on lots of psychopharmaka from a young age because people thought she was having hallucinations (she wasn't).
