Well, there's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-cyoa-v1-the-von-neumann-steamroller.58752/][(Worm CYOA V1) The Von Neumann Steamroller]] where the MC gets to a stage where going further just looks like incrementing transfinite cardinals.

  Edit: for people who might say "write your own." I'm trying but 3k words does not a story make. Writing is genuinely hard.

This is kinda what it boils down to. Writing is hard enough, and when you put the added requirement of having things semi make sense, the burden of research, crosschecking, note-taking, and so on that you have to do even for things that may not make it into the story gets a lot higher. Doing a full "tinker uplift" story which actually remains interesting as a story in addition to being sensible is something you'd probably do as a 3rd or later major project, rather than your first or second. This is especially the case since Worm is set in a modern setting, where aspects of the real world could make a pretty big difference.

Plus, you have to think about it from the perspective of someone who wants to write fanfiction. Most of the time, the motivation is going to come down to either annoyance with some aspect of canon that they want to change, or just to experience more of the canon world by changing things in ways that personally appeal.

And the second plus is that it's not even unrealistic. Most people don't automatically think about the ways they could be the most effective from first principles, instead just kind of reacting to the situation they're in. Like, you take 10,000 hypothetical people at random into a situation where they have a power which drives them towards parahuman conflict, there is a whole institution which actively supports this conflict and suppresses efforts to work outside it, where trying to do anything independently is very likely to get them captured by someone who will force them to participate in parahuman conflict, and what are the results going to be? Very likely literally 0 out of those 10,000 will make any especial effort towards maximising positive impact, and even if they do they aren't likely to be very successful unless they have a long lead up time. Which they don't have if they enter the Worm universe at the time of Taylor's trigger - the world literally ends in a few years. Changing the world from within the Protectorate just isn't going to happen - it's a government institution. Change only happens on a scale of decades.

So you're essentially forced to go full villain, but where do you get your resources? You almost need to start a billionaire to even have a chance. And then not only that, you have Simurgh, Mannequin+S9 who will actively seek to remove anyone too effective, and Contessa will stop you from improving the world too much that the rate of new parahumans would decrease.

Of course, all this goes out the window if the power is OP enough, but barring that you're talking Elon Musk level effectiveness and motivation as a lower bound. Or a large amount of patience and luck to survive Gold Morning and be in a position to improve things after that.
