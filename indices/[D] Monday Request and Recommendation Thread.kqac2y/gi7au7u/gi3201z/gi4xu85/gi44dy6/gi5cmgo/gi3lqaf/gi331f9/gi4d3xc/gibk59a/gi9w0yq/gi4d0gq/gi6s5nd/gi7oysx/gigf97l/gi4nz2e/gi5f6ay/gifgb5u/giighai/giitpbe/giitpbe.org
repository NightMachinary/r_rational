A small snip of our yesterday's session:

/Narrator (me): Crazy Bed (my older son's PC) and Mini Monkey (my younger's PC) are stranded on an island. They are hungry, and want something to eat. But the only two things to eat are bananas (Monkey's favourite) and spinach (Bed's favourite)/

/Narrator (me): What should MiniMonkey and Crazy Bed eat for dinner? Maybe they should mix spinach with bananas!/

/Monkey: no, spinach is eek! Only bananas!/

/Crazy Bed: No, spinach is yummy/

/Narrator: Well, Crazy Bed is older, and says spinach is yummy, so it means spinach is not eek. (Appeal to authority)./

/Mini Monkey: maybe Crazy Bed thinks wrong? (scepticism)/

/Narrator: Why? Why do you think He is wrong? (Maieutics)/

/Mini Monkey: Maybe spinach is yummy only in his mouth? I like ONLY bananas./

/Narrator: How do you know? Maybe we mix bananas with spinach and find out?/

/Both: NOO !! Noo!/

/Narrator: but I think this is the only way! Either you both eat bananas mixed with spinach, or nothing at all! (False alternative)/

/Crazy Bed: nooo we can eat our favourite things. Me spinach, and Monkey eats banana./

/narrator: Ok, Monkey and the Bed, both get their favourite food. But also, there appears a pie made of spinach and bananas, mixed. Do you want to try?/

/Monkey: noo! yuck/

/Crazy Bed: maybe..can we get Nutella on it?/

/Narrator: a magical jar of Nutella appears. It promises to give you a spoon of Nutella each straight to your mouth. OR, you can chose to eat the weird spinach-banana pie and then each get TWO spoons of Nutella on it. What do you chose? Is it better to take a small spoon of yummy Nutella, or risk eating a weird pie to get TWO spoons? (Weighting options)/

/Monkey: I want one spoon with no Nutella ./

/Crazy Bed: I want a whole jar of Nutella and then I even eat the whole pie!/

/Monkey: Oh yes, mee too!/

/Narrator: the Magical Jar of Nutella says to you: Each of you must hide behind a tree, and eat half of the weird pie. If You both eat, you get a whole jar of me. If both of you cheat and not eat, you get no Nutella. If only one of you cheats, the cheater gets a whole jar of Nutella, and the not-cheater gets nothing. What do you do?? (this took several minutes to explain to them, because they wanted to lawyer their way out of it, but after a while we established a proper Nutella Dilemma)......./

After our story was over for the day, I asked them questions about it, and encouraged them to explain to me what choices they made were "good thinking" and which were "weak thinking" (logical mistakes).

By now, the older ingrained some basic avoidance of the most common fallacies, at leas the ones that can be explained to a 4 year old. The younger simply became a sceptic: he loudly complains if a cartoon character or a book character does something irrational.\\
As a weird side -effect, they both developed strong aversion to lying, and are angered by being lied to. Not sure if this is good or bad yet.
