Not rational nor adjacent in any way, but I've played [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/858210/Nova_Drift/][Nova Drift]] for sixty hours over last three weeks and now I /must/ recommend it.

Most people on this subreddit would probably agree that Factorio appeals to them. Well, take the main addictive thing about Factorio---the endless possibilities for tweaking and optimization---and apply it to a rogue-lite. Unlike any rogue-lite I've played, here it's very easy to force any build you want (especially after a few between-run upgrades, but even before that), and instead of "just one fix to the advanced circuits production line," it's "just one fix to my 'shield that burns enemies in the radius of the whole screen because who needs shooting in a space shooter' build."

And the variety of viable builds here is staggering. Almost anything can be hilariously broken if you survive long enough and choose the upgrades just right, so the endless tweaking is always justified.

It might be the best rogue-lite I've ever owned.
