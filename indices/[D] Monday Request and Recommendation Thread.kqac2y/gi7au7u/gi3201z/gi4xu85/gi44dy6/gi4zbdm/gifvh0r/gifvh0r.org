I've got mixed feelings about The Pen is Mightier. The setting works well, and I'm a sucker for the Tower of God style "progression-based society". My main issue with it is that it feels like it's being written very quickly, with not enough focus being placed on the things that make it unique. SPOILERS in the paragraphs after this one.

The protagonist is set up as a more intelligent kind of climber that values other things over combat, and he's rewarded with a pen spirit that generates infinite ink. He never once writes with it other than to sign a contract. He spends a lot of words thinking about ways to transform the pen into a spear. I think these facts help illustrate the problems with the work.

The main character relies almost exclusively on combat prowess after the first scene, and only uses his intelligence to gain advantages in fights or munchkin the powers presented to him. Tens of chapters later, he has only laid one trap since the one that he had already laid at the beginning of chapter 1. He usually just chops things to pieces with an axe and gets compliments from his party members for how well he does at that. He's a far cry from the character as originally presented, much closer to a generic progression fantasy character, and I have to imagine it's a result of the update schedule and the outside pressure to keep the story exciting.

Reminiscing about his missing brother between bouts of murderhoboism is not enough to get the reader to believe that this is supposed to be a more 'romantic' character interested in storytelling and discovery.

Edit: As of the most recent chapter he has used his pen to write... after being explicitly directed to do so in order to design an upgrade for himself. Nothing that's meant to be read, by himself or others.
