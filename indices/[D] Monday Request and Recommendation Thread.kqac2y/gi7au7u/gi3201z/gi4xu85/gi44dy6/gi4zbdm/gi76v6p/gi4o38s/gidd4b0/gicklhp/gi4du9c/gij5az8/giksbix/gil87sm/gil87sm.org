He continues down the path of becoming a bit too accustomed to killing. He gradually becomes stronger and more competent as an adventurer, participating in the contest put on by Emir (the gold ranker) in the iron rank restricted space. More stuff to do with the Builder's conspiracy, where he gets captured and tortured, but is broken out.

He and the team by this point are considered one of the better iron rank teams - possibly the best available in that region of teams that still consist of 100% iron rank members. For that reason they're eventually chosen/volunteer to go back into that rank restricted space to counteract something the Builder is doing there. The magic of the space is accelerating or whatever so through months of constantly fighting monsters they quickly get to mid-bronze and become pretty competent as a team.

Then the climax of the arc is a battle with some of the Builder's forces (and the vessel inhabited by the Builder itself) in which Jason heroically sacrifices himself, and dies.

After some interlude chapters, we find out the function of the world-phoenix token. Jason revives in the exact location he was born - a hospital (now out of service) in Australia on Earth. I'm not going to say any more about this plotline, but I will assure you that it's not done badly or in a "jump the shark" kind of way. In fact I've been enjoying the latest arc even more than the original arc, though this may just be personal preference. I do think the writing has gotten better quality overall too, though.

Oh, and yes - there is some grander goal, which involves both worlds.

That should give you something to go on :)
