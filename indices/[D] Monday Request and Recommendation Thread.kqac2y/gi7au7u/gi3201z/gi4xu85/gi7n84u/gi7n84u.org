This genuinely sounds like a great idea, but dialing down on the stupid tropes. Like, an arsty but intelligent high school kid who hates everything in school except art finds the Secret of Gauss's Journal, which allows him to use the Mystic Pythagorean Arts to channel great mathematicians past, all of whom encourage him to pursue his much greater talent in math than in art. But he can only use the Arts for a certain amount of time per day so he has to actually solve the problems himself with only vague, incomplete hints from the mathematician spirits that drive him insane from the back of his own head. Each episode could have a different mathematician and we could see their personalities. Ramunajan thinks everything is obvious and can never explain his reasoning. Gauss never says the answer unless he is perfectly totally sure that his reasoning is utterly immaculate. Euler occasionally says stupid garbage on everything except mathematics. Galois constantly makes really uncomfortable analogies to French revolutionary politics. Newton and Leibniz show up together and constantly take pot shots at each other. It would be great.
