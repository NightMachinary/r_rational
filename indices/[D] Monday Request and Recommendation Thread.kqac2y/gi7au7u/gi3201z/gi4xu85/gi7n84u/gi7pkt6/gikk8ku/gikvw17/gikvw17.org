Probably develop a litRPG system and defeat it? Nobody ever accused manga of being realistic. "This game is so high level we can't follow it! He's developing whole paradigms in real time! He's standing in the AI's blind spot!"

Honestly, AI does kind of ruin games of strategy like chess and go. It probably shouldn't be that way, but it does. The cheating alone has ruined chess this year, it was bad before but it's impossible over remote. It might as well be Words With Friends at this point, also known as "your friends lose badly until they suddenly play perfectly."
