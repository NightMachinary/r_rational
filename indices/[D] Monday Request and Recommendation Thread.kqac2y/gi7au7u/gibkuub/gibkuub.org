Re: Delve, it may be about to get better. Chapter stamp: 136. Apparently the author had an arc planned from the beginning that just culminated with an event. The litrpg aspects are about to take up renewed focus.

That said, the pace is still glacial. I suspect it'll be a gripping read in novel form, but as a webnovel it can be rather torturous in its plodding.
