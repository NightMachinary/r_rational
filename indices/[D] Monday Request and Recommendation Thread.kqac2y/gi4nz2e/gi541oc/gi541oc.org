  I also started HPMOR again. Does Harry get more bearable and less snobby than he is in the beginning? He acts like every one of those iamverysmart guys I've met in school over my life and it's very annoying. It's like he's more a walking font of Wikipedia articles than any substantive character, and it's quickly making me sour towards the story.

You know how Phil Connors becomes a better person in /Groundhog Day/, but his character development is the core plot arc of the movie?

HJPEV is a lot like that. He does get much better by the end of the story (at least IMHO), but if you find him insufferable such that you're just sitting around waiting for him to pull his head out of his ass, then you likely won't enjoy an entire 650k word epic about his character arc.
