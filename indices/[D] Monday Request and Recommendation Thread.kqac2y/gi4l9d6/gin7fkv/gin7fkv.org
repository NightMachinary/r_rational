You could try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5834947/1/Aeon-Entelechy-Evangelion][/Aeon Entelechy Evangelion/]], a crossover with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CthulhuTech][/CthulhuTech/]]. It's not explicitly rational, but I remember it being fairly well put together. Writing quality is very high, too.

Beware, though, it's tragically unfinished. You could also try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4716493/1/Aeon-Natum-Engel][/Aeon Natum Engel/]], the "first draft" of /Aeon Entelechy Evangelion/. It's finished, but 1) I haven't read it, 2) it's supposed to be worse quality-wise (though still fine by fanfic standards).
