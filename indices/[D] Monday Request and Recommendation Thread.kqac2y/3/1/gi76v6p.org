Here's some that I follow and can name off of the top of my head.

Super Minion\\
Tower of Somnus(this one might be less than 6 months old)\\
Magic Smithing\\
Vaudevillain\\
Infinite Realms: monsters&legends\\
MetaWorld Chronicles

He who fights with monsters\\
Azarnith Healer

Keep in mind these are just things older than 6 months, some are good fun reads and others are just popcorn reads.
