Can't be stuffed with a description. I wrote one already for a few of these in a non-weekly recommendation thread a few days ago, and a few of the rest were mentioned there by other people.

Following: Menocht Loop, Delve, Journey of Black and Red, Humble Life of a Skill Trainer

Stuff a little less rational: Super Minion, I Don't Want To Be The Hive Queen, Confessions of the Magpie Wizard*

*(chapters from books 1 and 2 got taken down as the full book got published. Use the wayback machine/internet archive. It worked for me a few months back, idk if all of book 2 is in there though since I read it as it was posted)
