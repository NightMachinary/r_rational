1. Definitely recommend He Who Fights With Monsters. Somewhat rough start, but consistently gets better and better over time.

2. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33020/blessed-time][Blessed Time]] is 7 months old, and not too bad. Time loop "prevent the disaster" type of thing.

3. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55559974-iron-prince][Iron Prince]] (published book, Goodreads link) was good, although it's not older than 6 months. Basically space military wizard combat school, with a story arc classic of sports [films|anime|insert media type]. So, nothing new conceptually, but interesting and done fairly well.

4. If you haven't, I recommend checking out the author of WoTR's other story, Apocalypse: Generic System. It's not on RR any more - the first book is on Amazon for $5 ish, but you can access the all chapters of that plus some of the second book (still in progress) for $1 on Patreon, or you could try to find the wayback machine of the Royal Road chapters. (Don't know if that actually works, but the chapters were posted there at one point.)
