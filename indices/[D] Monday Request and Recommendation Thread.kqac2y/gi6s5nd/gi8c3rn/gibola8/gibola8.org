I read quite far into TGWP, up to the hydra farming with his time summon then stopped reading to wait for it to finish. Then when it finished I heard it wasn't actually finished, because a sequel is coming.

Would you recommend I complete reading the first book, or is it a false ending that doesn't tie up all the plot threads?
