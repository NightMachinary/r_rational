Pretty much all major hanging plot threads get wrapped up by the time the first book is complete. There are a few minor ones that looked like they were intended to be addressed in book two, but in the grand scheme of things book one is a pretty satisfying conclusion. If you got that far into TGWP and were enjoying it I'd recommend you just go ahead and finish what there is. At this point its looking like the sequel is never going to actually be written.
