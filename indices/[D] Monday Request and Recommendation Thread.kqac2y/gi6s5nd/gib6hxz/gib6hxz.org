[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12466638/1/Broken-Blades][Broken Blades]] might be what you're looking for.

I can also vouch for TGWP and to a lesser extent Forged Destiny. Also if you don't mind crossovers [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11250544/1/XCOM-RWBY-Within][RWBY Within]] is a great XCOM crossover, not the most rational read (very little involving RWBY is) but still fairly enjoyable.
