[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13401844/1/C4C3][C4C3]] is a very humorous Adam fanfic (not crack tho) where he gets split into three copies by the Relic of Choice, each of them pursuing their own goals (going after Blake, leading the White Fang again, finding out about Salem). No redemption at all (at least so far), Adam is still a dickhead, just one that is fun to read about. I'd call it rationalist-adjacent, the three Adams use their newfound triplicity without ever holding the idiotball and even abuse it as far as possible.

It also has like three chapters dedicated solely to Neopolitan and Adam torturing each other and having sex. It's by far the worst part and I kinda have a hard time recommending this fic because of it lmao. Read it if you like smut, otherwise don't.
