"I Shall Seal The Heavens", "Renegade Immortal" are good cultivation novels by the same author (Er Gen).

I tried forty-millenniums-of-cultivation but did not like it.

I read a bit of Lord of Mysteries and it seemed promising.

"The Warlock of the Magus World" is also pretty good, and has very rational characters (the MC is probably the most rational character I have ever read). I skimmed a lot of it though, especially as the author has a habit of repeating information. The story also has the near-fatal problem that while the author pays lip service to risks (e.g., saying the chance for some plan's success is 70 percent), almost everything goes the MC's way. Another big problem is that with a self-centered, rational MC, we aren't that invested in other characters. Together, these significantly lessen the tension.
