The first book of Cradle is also extremely meh. It's my understanding the author wrote it fast, was surprised it sold, and then started putting effort into the sequels. So on the one hand Cradle gets a lot better, but on the other hand, the first few books have a very whiny protagonist who is on the weak side. I really don't understand why people like Cradle as much as they do, but then again, I tried about 200 translated Chinese and Korean cultivation novels before I read it and the flaws just jump out at me. I'm not really up for a discussion of specifics since I stopped/dropped Cradle after finishing book six (when book six was the latest book) and I barely remember the series other than not thinking much of the protagonist (his catchphrase is the word 'apologies' and is overused). I plan to give it another go if the author ever finishes the series as people keep talking it up. My impression does not match its hype.

I'd rec 40 millennia above Cradle. Forge of Destiny is above average for a cultivation story, but stylistically "The Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality" and "Ze Tan Ji" do what it does, but better. Also I believe both of them are completely translated while Forge is still ongoing.
