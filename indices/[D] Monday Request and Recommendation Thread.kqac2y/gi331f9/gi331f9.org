I have been on this community since it was formed. But for the last year I have slowly lost track.

What new awesome stuff came out?

Also how is the old stuff going? I have not read Practical guide for evil nor Worth the Candle. How are they doing? Are they worth jumping back on?

In all those years I have always avoided cultivation novels. If I wanted to start, where would you suggest? forty-millenniums-of-cultivation ? Or something else?
