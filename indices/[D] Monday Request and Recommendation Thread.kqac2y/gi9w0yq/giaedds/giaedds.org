/Tales of Mu/ is set in a universe actively hostile to would-be experimenters and the scientific method, but the protagonist isn't very rational per se. Tales of Mu also appears as a glowfic setting, but I don't think I've personally read any glowfic set /in/ Tales of Mu without the protagonist ending up going somewhere else that can be analyzed.
