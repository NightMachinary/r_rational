Nice, I'm glad. I wish more people would give feedback after trying a recommendation.

As to the book, I'm the same. I tried the Iliad when was in my early teens after I learned that Alexander the Great idolized Achilles. Unfortunately my translation was by some stuffy brit from the 50's, full of footnotes and extremely dry. It was such a slog it actually put me off that kind of book for over a decade.

This book is perhaps more faithful to the tone the story held throughout most of history than any of the academic translations that quibble over this or that word. The Iliad is a story about warriors, for warriors, the kind of thing that rough men might share around a campfire or tell their children to get them into the right warrior mindset. "Remember when Menelaus ate shit, hahaha", they might say. Or that's my thinking, anyway.
