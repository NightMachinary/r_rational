I've found [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/infinite-realm-monsters-legends][Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends]] to be worth the read too, although it's more a mashup of cultivation, litrpg esque classes, and Skill training (in the vein of those anime where someone reaches enough understanding of a skill and transcends reality). The system and worldbuilding are actually very well done, and most of the main characters seem smart enough and competent enough. The author has done a good thing and made the main characters special but not /too/ special. People exist with even more talent and power than them. I'd say some of the characterizations comes off a bit stiff at first, but the author has quickly improved in that, and recent chapters have been really good in terms of characterization.

Rational-adjacent. Most of the reasons sects and guild work make sense. People get more mentally influenced as they get more powerful (they start to embody their power more than themselves), so the system in place is something that just barely works for the current state of civilization. All the powers are balanced, and balanced well. And nobody at the top are schmucks.
