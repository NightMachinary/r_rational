I would suggest the *[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0989671763/ref=bseries_primary_1_0989671763][Cradle]]* series by Will Wight. Among other things, it has the virtue of having been originally written in English, and thus does not suffer from a poor English translation like most cultivation stories.

It's actually one of my favorite book series, so I can definitely give it a recommendation in its own right! If you give it a try, I'd suggest making sure you read at least the first half of the first book, whereupon something happens that will probably make it obvious if you'll enjoy the rest of the series or not. The first two books are widely considered to be the weakest, though there are really good parts in both.
