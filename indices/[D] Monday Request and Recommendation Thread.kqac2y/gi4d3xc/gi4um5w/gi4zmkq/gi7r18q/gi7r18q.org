I'm assuming you've tried The Adventure Zone? Definitely obsessively edited, especially after the first ten episodes or so. I'd give it into the rockport unlimited arc, as the first arc is based on a canned campaign, but they still invent some random characters and lore so I don't recommend skipping it.
