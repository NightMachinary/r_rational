Yeah, Critical Role is the Ur-D&D podcast, but it's not really what I'm looking for. I listened to ~150 hours of it back when I had a commute, but the same properties that made it such a good commute listen make it a terrible sitting-at-home-looking-for-dense-novelty experience - it's not edited, each episode sprawls, and it's pretty standard save-the-world fare. Once players started checking how their spells worked before the livestream, that helped with the sprawl, but it still drags just a little bit too much for this brain to keep attention - especially when I'm mostly watching for clever and original spins on classic fantasy, not the voice acting/improv comedy/singing. And they regularly pull out a battleaxe to solve the problem. It's just not for me.

Fantasy High, by contrast, has none of these problems - it's obsessively edited, the cast isn't constantly interrupting the game to sell you merch or sing a limerick, and Brennan is an absolute font of originality and humor.
