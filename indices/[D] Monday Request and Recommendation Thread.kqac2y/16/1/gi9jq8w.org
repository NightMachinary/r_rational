It's a Ranma 1/2 crossover with surprisingly well thought out explanations as to what is going on... but it's also unfinished at 71K words. Probably rational-adjacent at best but you'll like it you like Ranma. Not sure if that is to your taste. I still remember some of the scenes after reading it 15 years ago, so it stuck with me enough to mention here. Gets better around chapter 2 or 3 when the Eva timeline is integrated.
