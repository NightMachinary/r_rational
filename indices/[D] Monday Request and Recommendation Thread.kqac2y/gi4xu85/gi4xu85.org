Can I get [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxCukwjjhhg][every sports anime ever]] but it's something like the International Math Olympiad or integration bees or something? I'd write it myself but I don't want everyone to find out how stupid I am

Like, a kid who hates math is possessed by the ghost of Euler and he meets a math prodigy the same age as him and then it's just Hikaru no go but with background characters shouting things like "He's doing integration by parts!" "But his Math shouldn't be at a high enough level!" "So...the younger generation really is incredible. Dattebayo."

pleeeeease
