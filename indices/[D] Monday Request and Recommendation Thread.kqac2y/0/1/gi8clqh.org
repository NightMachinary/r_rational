Rain's build technically isn't too bad, as some number crunchers have found out that his damage skyrockets into the millions once he reaches silver, but you're right in that he completely ignores the crucial fact that his build is worthless until then, which is pretty much a death sentence for anybody without protagonist plot armor. Basically everything he does is completely idiotic and a death sentence too, but luckily his protagonist plot armor saves him from the stupidity of his actions.

It had potential until it moved away from the litrpg optimization and moved into the typical isekai idealism, sadly. Quite baffling too, the way the author shifted focus. It's like a thrilling mystery/horror novel suddenly turning into an eroge harem romance halfway through a mystery. A real shame
