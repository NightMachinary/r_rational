I think the author has bathroom syndrome. There's a reason no one details multiple normal bathroom experiences in any kind of fiction. Similarly this author, and many other web novel authors, describe in explicit detail functionally identical character interactions. Sort of like Robert Jordan with braid tugging and skirt smoothing. You describe their nervous tics once and then just say or ideally imply that they are nervous in later situations and the reader can infer the tics or not.

I blame anime conventions for this. Eastern novels that are essentially written anime do this all the time. Cheek puffing, pouting, etc, possibly because anime uses an excessively emotive way of communicating. Authors in and and influenced by anime adjacent genres seems to think that writing the same character but with different behavioral quirks for each "character" is complete characterization.
