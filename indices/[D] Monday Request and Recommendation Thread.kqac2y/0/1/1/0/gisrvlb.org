That's definitely true, moving the story into another genre can be doable depending on the story and execution, but Delve falls flat in this. Despite 100+ chapters, the characters have no depth or even anything interesting about it. I've read some real shitters of a novel and most of them still had more interesting characters. Even a short story introducing an ordinary character like Worm does with Kevin Norton are far more appealing than Delve's characters with far fewer words.
