  An anti-rec for Delve, since I have seen a lot of recs for it in this sub, even though the response on its own threads here is mixed. I regret reading Delve a lot. It's bait-and-switch; Delve starts as a slow-paced litrpg that focuses on running some numbers in choosing what skills and attributes to take, and has good writing on the RPG system itself. It also has that experimentation attitude we all adore. Unfortunately, other aspects of the writing are quite bad, and the author switches to slice-of-life around chapter 45, and the whole RPG system pretty much disappears from the story. The MC is also a complete moron in social skills and game theory, and even his supposedly rational build turns out to be mediocre as he has trouble beating monsters half his level, and is, in fact, more a poignant demonstration of the fact that we nerds often dedicate a lot of attention to some noncritical but interesting area while ignoring what matters. All in all, we get the story of a rational-wannabe failure whose life goes nowhere, while the narrative pretends to be still following a disrupting hero.

I disagree that his build is worthless... If he had any other build, he would have needed a lot longer to reach level 18 and so would not necessarily be stronger after 6 months of being there. It's an okayish support build but it's a build that will scale very well at higher level. It's true that it's not a good build to solo out monsters but having a build that's useful for support could make sense in this world where convincing a strong team to help bring down a blue is needed for advancement.
