I have two boys, 3 and 4.

I do not tell them rational stories, because that would be boring to them. I try to tell them very simple, interactive, pseudo-RPG stories where they must make choices for the characters, and explain why. Sort of like a continuous puzzle-adventure.

When they make their choices, I explain to them the most basic concepts of thinking, and how their choices affected their story.

Their favourite character, is Crazy Bed, a literal sentient bed that goes on silly adventures, which usually involve being trapped/stranded, and having to escape.
