This comes free with the Worm fandom - Taylor herself had powers approximately infinitely more useful if she never, ever put on a costume. Intel gathering, materials and food production, ect. Heck, she had far, far better scaling available than most actual tinkers - spidersilk does not require special ongoing maintenance. So if ignoring the obviously superior applications in favor of facepunching bothers a writer, they are just not in the fandom to begin with.
