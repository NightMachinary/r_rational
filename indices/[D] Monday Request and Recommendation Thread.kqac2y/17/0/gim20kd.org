  I understand conflict driver
#+end_quote

The conflict drive is one part of the problem, but the other part is that "Tinkertech" is not regular technology and can't be used in large scale projects. Without regular maintenance done by the Tinker, Tinkertech falls apart. Here is what the /Worm/ canon says about this problem:

#+begin_quote
  [Lily:] I'd have to give up my arbalest.  Without tinker maintenance, it won't keep working

  [Defiant:] I will maintain two of these packs for you, and you can switch to the spare if one needs repairing or recharging.  Some of it's of Dragon's design, but the maintenance will be left to me. 
#+end_quote

The only two Tinkers who can partially get around this limitation are Dragon and Masamune and that's what they concentrate on:

  Masamune wasn't present, but from what I knew of the guy, he wasn't even close to being a front-lines combatant.   They'd recruited him from the ruined area of Japan, a somewhat crazed hermit, and gave him work in figuring out how to mass produce their stuff without the maintenance issues snowballing out of control, like tinker tech tended to do in large quantities.

That said, there are quite a few Worm fics in which the apparent "Tinker" power is actually something else, which lets the characters get around normal Tinkertech limitations. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10230499/36/Memories-of-Iron][Memories of Iron]] is probably the best known example.
