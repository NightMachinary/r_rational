For cultivation novels, start with /Cradle/, or /Lord of the Mysteries/, or /I Shall Seal The Heavens/.

For easy reading, choose /Cradle/. The author is American and the stories blend cultivation tropes with more familiar epic fantasy tropes.

For humor, epic power advancement, crazy scams and bold protagonists, choose /I Shall Seal The Heavens/. The story has some silly and crude moments. But overall, the scope is epic, the action is continual without being exhausting, and the core story is huge and sincere.

For a world of wonder and awe, a smart plot and a thoughtful main character, choose /Lord of the Mysteries/. The author was influenced by Lovecraft and goes for a truly grand and mysterious backstory, with a hero who focuses their rise to power not on fighting, but on figuring out secrets and plotting survival.
