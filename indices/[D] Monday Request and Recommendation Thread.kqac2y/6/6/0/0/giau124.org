MC is cradle is polite which is rational. He prepares and plans for fights. He builds tools, weapons and armor to increase his chances of victory. There's a particular fight he just pulls out a magic bazooka and wins against a person that's likely stronger and better equipped / funded.

MC has to train and advance normally without exploits, bs ancestral master or returner knowledge..

The worldbuilding fixes a lot of plotholes other stories in the genre have. People are respectable. Beating weaker people is extremely frowned upon. Having a disciple fight a weaker person dishonors his masters.

People are powerful but to reasonable levels, they are still human, physics still apply. The cultivation system is good and well made. The pacing is great.

The book one is ok though, it's miles ahead of most cultivation stories. There's a hook, a plot that's not cliche school, mean young masters, infinite money exploit or found an ancient treasure / master that makes him OP..
