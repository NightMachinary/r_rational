Practical Guide just concluded the 6th book, the next is supposedly the last and will continue in March. I'd very much recommend carrying on with it.

WtC also seems to be quite near to ending, but it's harder to say. Could all be done in the next chapter drop, or it could take more than a year. Still, you'll definitely want to read it as well
