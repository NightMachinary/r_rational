It's been a long time since I've read it, but I don't remember any problems with the translation in the first arc. It's an above average chinese webnovel translation imo.

That said, you kinda have to be fine with the translation quality of chinese webnovels. If you've read any others in the past and found it ok then you should be fine, but if not it'll be somewhat jarring. You kinda have to go in knowing they are written and translated in a particular style. Many find the style unbearable, but if you don't mind that, it should be fine.

Oh another cultivation story I would also recommend is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293.][Ave Xia Rem Y]]. Ignore the bad title, it's an english language cultivation story that's written in the chinese style. If you find this story readable, you shouldn't have any real problems with the 40 millenniums translation.
