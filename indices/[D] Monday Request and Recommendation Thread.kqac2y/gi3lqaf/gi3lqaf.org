I recommend [[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34381315][The War Nerd Iliad]](don't mind the title ^{^{1}} ), a fantastically brutal, clever and funny translation/adaptation of the >2.5k year old epic saga of the siege of Troy done in modern language. Unlike other adaptations of that kind it also changes the structure and the tone in order to make the story more coherent and interesting to a modern audience, but without losing the cultural essence which makes this story so interesting. Simply the idea that people like Alexander the Great and Caesar and countless other emperors and kings read this book(or had it read to them)and idolized its characters should be enough to get you interested.

An excerpt:

#+begin_quote
  Odysseus sees that Thersites the radical, the jailhouse lawyer, is orating at Agamemnon, who's too stunned to react. Thersites is the ugliest man in the army, some kind of spinal case. A commoner too, and he's picked up a little ideology somewhere. He talks in a high, whiny voice, and he's on his usual theme: The Unfairness of It All.

  “You there, Agamemnon, ‘the king' as you high-and-mighty like to call yourselves, how come you get all the pretty slave girls, and we get the dregs? Why should your lot guzzle tender meat every day, whereas the ordinary soldier gets bread and a little oil? And how come ...”

  Odysseus wastes no time arguing about justice. He employs an older and more puissant rhetoric, hitting Thersites in the face with the tree branch. Thersites' teeth spray out of his mouth and he flies through the air, landing on his back, out cold. Odysseus turns to the crowd, growling: “Any more democrats?"

If you've ever read a more 'scholarly' translation you'll notice it also omits all the lineages, the interminable "X son of Y son of Z" that happens every time a new character is introduced. This is by itself worth the price of admission.

^{^{1}} The title is a reference to a persona/alias that John Dolan took while writing a column in the satirical counter-culture newspaper the eXile. It was popular enough in its time that Dolan, a prize winning writer and poet, tried to capitalize on it by connecting this book to the persona, which is unfortunate IMO as I imagine the name puts off more people than it attracts. Dolan and another guy from the eXile founded a podcast a few years ago, The War Nerd Podcast, which deals with current and historical events/conflicts, again from a critical, counter-culture perspective. It's pretty good if you're at all interested in that kind of stuff.
