I've been reading [[https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/][/Vacant Throne/]] by towercurator for awhile, and with it wrapping up, it's as good a time as any to recommend it.

The story starts with a young woman, Alyssa, who is about to be murdered. Except she happens to see the angel who's come to collect her soul, and is able to avoid her fate. Since she's supposed to be dead on Earth and would interfere with the fate if she was alive and walking around interacting with people, she gets dumped on a different planet, Nod. Like many Isekais, it's a world of magic and monsters in a medieval setting, and Alyssa decides that if she's going to live here she'll need to adapt, learn magic, and get a job. She has to start from scratch and survive in a dangerous world (though she does have a gun where other people fire arrows) while her power grows.

The world is pretty well described. There's history there, though often it's more alluded to than explained. Alyssa does travel around a bit, and we get to see more of Nod a she does, and it feels lived in, with politics, factions, religion and class differences.

The writing is well-done. The style is pretty straightforward, and (to my recollection) there were no spelling/grammar mistakes.

The characters are well-written. The story focuses almost exclusively on Alyssa, but we see the story develop through some of her companions in some interlude chapters. Side characters don't get that many lines, which I felt was a shame since there were some really interesting ones, and would have helped flesh out the story a bit more instead of it centering just around the main character.

I did have a bit of a problem with pacing. Sometimes I felt the story went on longer than it should have, especially the parts that involved travelling. Though even those parts were enjoyable, to a degree. There were also times when I felt like Alyssa's character development was a bit too slow, or even took a step back, mainly in the way she looed down on some other characters for something that wasn't their fault, or even was spiteful to someone who was helping her.

Overall, I very much enjoyed the story. That Alyssa has to work and earn her power made the payoff that much better than if she had simply stumbled into it. I like how genuine the character were, even the more outlandish ones. I'd recommend the story mainly to people who like stories that focus on figuring out and developing magic, since that's a huge part of it.
