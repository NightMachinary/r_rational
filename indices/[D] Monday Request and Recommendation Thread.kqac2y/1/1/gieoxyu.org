For those late-comers I follow this up with a semi-rec:

This story is NOT rational; The MC completely ignores many super obvious exploits with her earth tech and just generally "good" things she could do that are obvious. The world also lacks a lot of "obvious" things which would be a consequence of the setting. (Which I am happy to expand upon, for those curious)

Other than this, the story is great in all other aspects: If you can ignore the above and can deal with little progress on your MC you will super enjoy it IMO.
