The thing is.. if this is a thing that happens, then the place she gets dumped off on should not be a standard medieval fantasy setting.

It should be the ultimate schitzoid-tech, kitchen-sink magics dumping ground for everyone that fell through the cracks in all of creation.

Like first person she meets:

Matilda. Occupation: Retired Warlord/Arch mage. Mentor figure to the Chosen One. Reason for exile : Egregiously Failing to die when the Dark Lord invaded The Humble Village.

Age: "Lost Count". Disposition: "Snark"
