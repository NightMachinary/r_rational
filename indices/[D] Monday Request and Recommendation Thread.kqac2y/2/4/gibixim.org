There are a few Mahjong titles that scratch that itch, I recommend Saki if you want the cute girl version and Akagi if you want the cool guy version. Both are very very effective if you just want to see prodigies doing ridiculous things and side characters observing them and losing their shit over it. Mahjong knowledge not required, in fact not knowing how to play Mahjong might actually be a better experience, at least for a first watch/read.
