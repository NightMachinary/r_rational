Tossing some tried-and-true pharmaceuticals into that +/-2% margin and passing them off as the active ingredient is a good idea! Or even not and saying you did, lots of supplement etc. companies apparently get away with really lax purity standards. The way I'd envisioned it is the end product is sort of a viscous oil that'll leak out of your ear and dirty your clothes, and also out of your nose and taste kinda gross. So it has to still be majority oil by volume & mass, not just a trace ingredient in the specified ratio. So to get the necessary amount in the appropriate locations their face would really need to be dripping with the stuff lol.

The moon thing would more require that the light of the full moon fall upon the constantly mixing surface of your vat / cauldron / beaker, the exact mechanism [redacted]. Maybe it has to do with some specific wavelengths of light in some specific orientation and quantity etc. Genie magic works in mysterious ways.

I reckon a good first step would be to sell it cheaply as a supplement on Amazon, seeding your initial reviews with a few hundred fake ones emphasizing the need to follow the exact instructions to receive the purported effects, with lots of accounts describing initial failure under inexactitude followed by stunning success after precise adherence to the specified instructions.
