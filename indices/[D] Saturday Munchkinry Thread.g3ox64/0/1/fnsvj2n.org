  Using the resources currently available to you, how do you most effectively publicize this knowledge for the betterment of all humankind? Alternatively, how do you maximize profits in a pharmaceutical context?

I have no particular interest in maximizing profits, I'm going to skip that option and focus on publicizing it.

It is, of course, easy to just post the cure to some blog on the internet and it is now, in theory, available to everyone. The problem is that this won't benefit anyone because no one will believe it. The trick is to persuade people to believe you.

Making some of the concoction isn't difficult and is well within my means, so I would make up a bunch of doses by hand on my own -- maybe enough to treat 20 or 30 people. Then I need to convince people to put up with a month of treatment. I would try to find a few people -- maybe 10 or so -- who have incurable diseases like late-stage cancer. I have enough money saved up that I could offer to pay them some retainer to put up with applying this three times a day according to my exacting instructions. I'm hoping at least half of those would actually follow the instructions properly.

Once I have, not one, but several "miraculous cures" I would reach out to doctors at major research universities and invite them to replicate my results. Again, I would focus only on completely incurable diseases because even a skeptic would need to admit that /something/ unusual had happened if I (and my research collaborators) could produce multiple cures for such people.

Of course I have wasted many months performing this "slow rollout" and condemned millions of people to an unnecessary death -- so I wait until I have gotten coverage in some major newspapers. Then I go immediately to publishing my "wacky treatment". Sure, at this point only the conspiracy theorists would give it any credibility, but that is still millions of lives that are getting saved. And the research by official research institutions can proceed at its own pace -- which will only be accelerated by mounting evidence that a small fraction of conspiracy theorists who follow my recipe ("small fraction" because most won't succeed in following the procedure correctly) have experienced inexplicable results.
