Point it at someone famous and alive. Never actually end the conversation. You can now easily and repeatably demonstrate that magic is real, which is possibly the biggest news ever.

Try to connect to Satoshi Nakamoto. Sure, that's not their birth name, but it's /a/ name, connected to a person we know as much about as many obscure historical figures.

If they're dead they might be willing to give you the key to the giant early bitcoin stash (or another more modest bitcoin stash, since it's quite plausible the key to the big one was just lost) and/or enough evidence to demonstrate their identity, in exchange for fame or your promise to use some of that money for whatever posthumous desire they may have.

If they're alive, you might be able to blackmail them for same, if they wish to remain anonymous and you can bluff that you have evidence to unmask them. Possibly you can uncover that evidence the hard way if you get enough information about them during the conversation to direct your investigation.

(If it doesn't work, there may be other dead people known to have the key to a crypto stash or another; I'd have to look it up.)
