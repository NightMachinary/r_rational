You stand in a cubic block of space. You cannot exit this space, nor can you move it. The boundaries are invisible and intangible, and everyone else can freely move across them, making you look like an idiot.

However, you have macroscopic awareness of everything in the space (3d vision), as well as a form of telekinesis slash matter manipulation. You can mentally move matter around slowly but forcefully, allowing for things like shaping stone and mushing brains. You can also slowly expand your space of influence by focusing hard, at, say, 2 cubic metres per hour. It doesn't necessarily have to expand as a cube shape - you could grow out tendrils, for example.

You start off in a house in a town. How would you munchkin this?
