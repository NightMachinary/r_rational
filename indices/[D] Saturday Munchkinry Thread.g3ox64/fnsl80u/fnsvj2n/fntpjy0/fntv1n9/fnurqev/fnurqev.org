To be fair, it's not like the medicine stops working if it becomes scientifically recognized. If you can get a half-dozen folk to believe you, you can all reach out to local news or scientific journals. All you need is one bored scientist, or better yet get the attention of someone trying to "prove you wrong." Once you demonstrate it works in a controlled setting, even if you have no idea why, the information can still be recognized in the scientific community.

For a fun real-world example, there is no complete understanding of how Tylenol works. There are some ideas that have been suggested, but no concrete method.
