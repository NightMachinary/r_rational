My first instinct is to obfuscate some of the wackier elements while still keeping them in the production and application process. I've not much knowledge about the preparation of regular medical products, but assuming I did, I'd probably advertise it as having the lavender and avocado parts as a natural way of making the 'medicine' (additives) have a pleasant smell/taste. Tell the people that take it to use it as a skin salve, making sure to apply it to the sinuses and everywhere on the face (it's like suncream - you have to remember to put it on your ears and the back of your neck!). The thrice daily thing needs less obfuscation in order to appear feasible - I could see people accepting that as something necessary for the medicine to work. The hardest thing is the preparation under the full moon. How does that apply if you prepare it on the moon? Orbiting the moon? On another planet? And so on. Presuming that it works on a cycle that just happens to line up with the cycle of the moon as seen from earth, the best I can think of is simply keeping a small scale operation where manufacturing happens on the day imports arrive - which happens to be the night of the full moon.

After that, if the panacea becomes famous enough, you can create an 'R and D' team to 'discover' what you already know. You can point them in the right direction, of course, but empirical evidence will be more likely to be accepted if it comes up naturally, I presume.

Gradually refine the formula until you get what you were given originally, and people accept that it works.

This strategy is definitely not the best, because I'm not very knowledgeable about this stuff. I'd hire people to try and alleviate that when I get enough capital, but that's contingent on getting said capital. As it stands, though, I think I've covered the points that would differentiate this from marketing any old medicine.
