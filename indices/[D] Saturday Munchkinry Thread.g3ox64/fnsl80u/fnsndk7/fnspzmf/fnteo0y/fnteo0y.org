  So to get the necessary amount in the appropriate locations their face would really need to be dripping...

I still agree with the parent that the easy way to get this done is to require people to apply it liberally to the entire head. Pour it on your head like shampoo and let it run all over: the genie didn't say that the opposite nostril and ear need to stay dry.

  The moon thing would more require that the light of the full moon fall upon the constantly mixing surface of your vat / cauldron / beaker, the exact mechanism [redacted].

It's definitely an array of giant 10m industrial tanks. But it, an input buffer, and an output buffer are all in a TOP SECRET courtyard in the middle of the manufacturing facility. Shipments come in when they come in, do whatever you like titrating your legitimacy-adding pharmaceuticals at a constant rate, and make sure bottling goes out of the output at an approximately constant rate...no one needs to know that the central tank is empty for 28.5 out of every 29.5 days.

I say "Top Secret" because your employees and customers need to expect that it's a semi-legitimate scientific process. But the other side of the coin is that you really need to not keep this secret: you need a dead-man's switch so that if you tragically get hit by an asteroid the secret doesn't die with you. Upload it to random subreddits. Print out the instructions and hide them in sealed jars. Get as many other people as you can in on the secret - take out a home equity loan, cash out your retirement, and give $1k up-front, $1k on completion to as many people as you can to send you thrice-daily videos of them following the protocol to get your exponential growth kick-started.
