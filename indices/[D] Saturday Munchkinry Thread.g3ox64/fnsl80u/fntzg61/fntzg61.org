You can talk to anyone alive or dead, but there's a few caveats.

- You can only do this once and never again.
- You can only talk to one person.
- You can talk to anyone you like even if they never knew the language you spoke when they were alive. They'll understand you and respond in English (or some other language of your preference).
- This only matters if you pick someone currently alive, but they'll remember having a conversation with you afterwards.
- You have no supernatural ability to force them to answer your questions. They could even choose to say nothing at all in response. They are only required to listen to you speak.
- You can't ask anything about what happens after death. Or you can try, but they won't give you any answers. Or they might mess with you as a joke. Depends on their personality.
- You need to have a clear idea of who you want to talk to. Such as "Julius Cesar" or "Elon Musk" works. But you can't do "smartest man in history" or "17th President of the US" if you don't have a name or idea of who the person actually was. No using phrases or criteria to filter out a specific individual if you have no idea of who the person who meets the criteria could have been.

How do you best munchkin this for fame, riches, power, or personal amusement?
