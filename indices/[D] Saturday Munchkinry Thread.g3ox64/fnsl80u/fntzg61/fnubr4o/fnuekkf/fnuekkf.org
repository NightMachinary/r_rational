  You can't ask anything about what happens after death. Or you can try, but they won't give you any answers. Or they might mess with you as a joke. Depends on their personality.

I would try to munchkin around this rule as much as possible, preferably by securing the cooperation of a terminally ill patient with a family they love that badly needs my (financial?) support. They either cooperate with me after they die or I cut off my support to their family, so I don't have to worry about them just keeping silent. Preferably I should also secure all kinds of other motivations for them to cooperate.

The issue then is, they can't talk about what happens after death, but can they talk about what does NOT happen after death? I could just have them continue listing everything that doesn't happen after death, eliminating possibilities one by one. Or better yet, what is enforcing this secrecy rule? If its some kind of intelligence like a king of hell monitoring the dead and punishing them for revealing details about hell, could we outsmart said king with secret gestures, words, topics, etc.? For example, before my partner dies, I could teach them a number of keywords to say depending on what type of scenario they have found themselves in after death. Even something as simple as starting the conversation with "Long time no see" to mean that they are in a hellish environment, and "Oh hello!" to mean they are in a heavenly environment. Or more generally, answer my yes/no questions by talking about themselves if yes, and talking about me if no.

Example conversation:

Me: Hey partner, is the afterlife heavenly?

Partner: You know you can't get an answer for that.

Me: Are you in hell then?

Partner: I can't say.

Me: Have you seen <religious group X> in there?

Partner: You shouldn't probe for such information.

Me: Should I perform <action Y> before I die?

Partner: I already said I can't answer questions like that.

â€‹

From that I would learn that my partner is in hell, that religious group X wouldn't go to hell, and that I should do action Y before dying.
