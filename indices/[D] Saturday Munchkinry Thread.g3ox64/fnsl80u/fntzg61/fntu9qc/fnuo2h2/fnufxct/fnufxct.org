How strong is my telekinesis? Could I buy pencils (or get a partner who can leave my cube to buy them) and crush the graphite in them into diamonds, thus securing riches for me and my partner without ever leaving my house? It's a good thing we live in the internet age so I can communicate with various people through phones and text and even order item/food deliveries, so I wouldn't ever need to leave my house. That said I should probably regularly extend my block of space towards other structures I might need in an emergency, like a hospital or a hotel.
