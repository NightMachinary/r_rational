How "cannot" are we talking here? Mental compulsion? Death-on-leaving? Inexplicable physical resistance? What happens if someone tries to drag me out of the space?

My initial reading was inexplicable physical resistance (which is, admittedly more munchkinable :P). That allows for doing things like "building" a space elevator (though I suppose that'd be a hell of a climb). Also brings up questions about what "me" is (can my acoutrements pass through the barrier? bodily fluids? severed limbs? funky meditative shenanigans to redefine "me" to something weird?)

  telekinesis/matter manipulation

  ...

  You can also slowly expand your space of influence
#+end_quote

How fine grained can I go with either of these? Can I split atoms with my telekinesis? What about fusion (fusion probably doesn't even strictly require fine grained control, just strength)?

Can I use a space-filling curve to mess with the expansion rate? What happens if I try to claim a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Horn][Gabriel's Horn]]-shaped space?
