A genie whispers in your ear that the cure for a slew of both deadly and inconveniencing diseases is a decoction of lavender and avocado oils (1:2 ratio, +/- 2%) prepared under the full moon and applied liberally to the right nostril and left ear thrice daily over a period of a month. After a month has passed, the effect is nigh instantaneous, the body suddenly finding hidden resources with which to heal itself over the following hours. You know the genie's words to be true (your wish being for the knowledge of a panacea), and can envision an industrial process to prepare this substance within acceptable tolerances. “That's really stupid,” you think, “but OK.” Using the resources currently available to you, how do you most effectively publicize this knowledge for the betterment of all humankind? Alternatively, how do you maximize profits in a pharmaceutical context?
