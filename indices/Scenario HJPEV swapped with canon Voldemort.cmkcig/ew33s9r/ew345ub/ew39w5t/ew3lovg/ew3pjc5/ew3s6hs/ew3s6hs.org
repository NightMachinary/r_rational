There's no maybe about it, the one known case of proper bad person trying to cast a patronus involved instead of a patronus summoning a horde of maggots which promptly ate the user alive.

Voldemort in canon 100% would not be able to cast a patronus, Snape was special in being able to. Voldemort works with dementors because he's evil and dementors are seemingly smart enough at least to negotiate with so he is working with them the normal way you work with people, just help them get what they want and match their ideals. He'd probably just apparate away or try physical bindings if the dementors ever made to attack.

That said, if HPJEV tries to counter dementors using his HPMoR tactics he's screwed as dementors had totally different weaknesses and just general properties in HPMoR. At least his normal patronus should still have some effect, as long as he actually focuses on happy memories, not just overcoming death as canon dementors have nothing to do with death.
