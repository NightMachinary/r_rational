Why would a wizard ever go anywhere without their wand, though?

Doesn't it control, activate, or serve as identification for like ninety percent of their stuff in general? And isn't it a necessary focus for casting anything you haven't practiced into the ground hard enough to go wandless/wordless on?

It just sounds like walking around your house and forgetting to bring your electricity for all your high tech gadgets, if that makes any sense.
