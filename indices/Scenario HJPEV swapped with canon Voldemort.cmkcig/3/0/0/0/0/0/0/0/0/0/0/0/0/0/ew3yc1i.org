I mean, they just represent depression and work to induce despair as a result, it should be perfectly possible to become desensitized to always being somewhat morose and generally just not truly happy. Note this would also leave you unable to cast a patronus correctly, the trick is likely becoming densensitized without becoming a wreck of a human being unable to really connect to people or feel joy, but for a lot of dark wizards being a horrible person who struggles to find long term happiness in life is likely to just fuel the evil douche thing and be entirely on theme. It does very strongly imply too that Raczidian is not the only person to have failed, or he would not be "the most famous", to have a most famous of anything kind of requires there to be a less famous of it too.

And yes, it works on others. For example [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Lethifold][lethifolds]] share with dementors as having the patronus as their only known counter, and in general have a lot of similarities. The big one being that lethifolds literally kill and eat people and seem to have a slightly more mundane origin, even if we don't know what it is, they're not categorized as non-beings which seems to be reserved for the more embodiments of emotions kind of thing. No others are known that the patronus specifically counters, just those two for ones you actually need it for.
