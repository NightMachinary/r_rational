The Fidelius charm can be done well. I remember stumbling across a fic called Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches which (despite the penny dreadful title) had some absurdly clever uses for it, including Fidelius turf wars as people tried to out secret a secret by using secrets.

It's not exactly Rational Fiction^{TM} , but it definitely has a relatively rational and intelligent version of Harry as a main character, and the actual setting is absurdly interesting, since it takes the idea of Harry Potter's magocratic nobility and just sprints off into the sunset with it.

They even get the Granger family into it to abuse rune crafting, it's great.
