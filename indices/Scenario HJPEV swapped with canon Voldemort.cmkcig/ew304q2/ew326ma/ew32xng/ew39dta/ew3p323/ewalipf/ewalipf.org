I disagree here actually, because unlike anyone else in Britain she killed Voldemort using high level magic, which is pretty damn impressive and competent to me.

Sure, she didn't have her wand, but even if they had a dozen Aurors with wands in there with her the results would have been even worse: aka, him killing them all then killing Harry without getting scratched.
