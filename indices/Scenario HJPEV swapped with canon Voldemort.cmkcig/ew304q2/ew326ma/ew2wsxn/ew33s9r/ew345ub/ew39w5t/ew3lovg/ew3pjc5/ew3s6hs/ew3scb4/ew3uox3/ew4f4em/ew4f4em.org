Which part?

- Voldemort definitely in his youth can cast a patronus. I remember reading somewhere dark wizards (in one case, on the scale of Voldemort or worse) can't cast patronuses. Instead maggots will appear or something. So current Voldemort would probably not be able to cast a patronus because of the whole horcruxes thing

- Dumbledore thing was a joke, Snape proved his loyalty by casting a doe patronus which symbolised his love for Lily Potter. Dumbledore considered this reason enough to trust him (even years after her death) as the reason for Snape to betray Voldemort. Other than that the Potters have stag (James, Harry) patronuses, having the same patronus would situationally be proof of loyalty to them.

- Realistically Verresmort could just cast a patronus (or learn to, been a while since I read that series so I've forgotten his capabilities) to prove his identity to Dumbledore, after which with Dumbledore vouching for him (he was at his peak influence in this era) and some plastic surgery, maybe a nose transplant, he would be in the clear. Sheer unlikelihood that the real Voldemort would be able to cast a patronus let alone have it be a stag would be enough to prove Verresmort's claim, assuming he isn't killed on sight (not in character for canon Dumbledore, so unlikely)

Basically as soon as Verresmort sorts out the mess at his parents' house it wouldn't be too difficult to prove his case to Dumbledore, whose word is basically law, which clears him to the rest of the world. Patronus to get Dumbledore to listen, offer memories as more proof if needed (there's no way Voldemort would be able to forge an entire detailed backstory when Slughorn can barely forge a few minutes worth of conversation).
