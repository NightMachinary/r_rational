Riddle before becoming Voldemort probably would be able to cast a patronus, or at least know how. Rereading the lore about Raczidian, I'd say it's iffy regarding the "pure heart" requirement but I concur, Voldemort in his prime would not be able to nor have the need to cast a patronus. Which is probably better for Verres-mort when he needs to prove his case.
