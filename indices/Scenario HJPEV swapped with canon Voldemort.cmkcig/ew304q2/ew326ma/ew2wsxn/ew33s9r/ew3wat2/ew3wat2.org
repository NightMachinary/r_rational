Do Time Turners work like in canon? Like he doesn't have his old one, but they exist in the world, so if he can get his hands on one, can he just ... use it like a general time machine?

Create a James simulacrum and put that with Lilly and canon!Harry hours before Voldie arrives. How good would a simulacrum have to be to fool canon!Voldie long enough for him to do the thing that wipes his memory?

Might think about finding a willing sacrifice, e.g. someone who wants to die anyway, to /polyjuice/ into James. I think HJPEV would find it morally questionable to cause the death of even someone willing for what one might call 'his own ends' in a situation like that where he still might find other ways, but then it's not like he /never/ kills.

That could be a plot arc -- "ok, we've got the canon time-turner, how do we make a good enough simulacrum without polyjuice OR use the polyjuice trick in a way that it won't seem against the nature of our relationship with human death?"
