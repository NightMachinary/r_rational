I'm not sure what he would do long term, but I suspect his short term actions should be fairly simple:

1) Bug out of the Potter house. Given that Lily's plan at this point is "sacrifice her own life without giving any violence in order to power her spell" its unlikely that she would attack Voldemort even if he seems vulnerable for a few seconds, thus he should be fine.

2) Figure out that hes in the past in an alternate timeline where things are slightly different and a few people (eg. voldemort) are stupider.

3) Gather all the death eaters in a place warded against apparition together while pretending to be Voldemort and kill them all, either with some kind of spell/gas/massive muggle bomb.
