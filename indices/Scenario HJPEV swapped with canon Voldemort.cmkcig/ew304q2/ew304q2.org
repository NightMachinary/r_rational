I think the proper de-escalate is apparate away, taking James('s body?) with him to frigidero in a more secure location (e.g. Antarctica). If Verres-mort is unable to apparate then fly or run or literally anything to get away before Lily throws any of a number of deadly curses. You can always run your reveal later, provided that you are not immediately dead.

Step two is use the dark mark to bait the deatheaters into a non-lethal but incapacitating trap that they will definitely be caught by surprise given that canon Voldemort seems to have roughly zero security protocols.

Offer one of the deatheaters tied up and unconscious in front of the gates of Hogwarts to prove the incredibly fortunate situation you're in to Dumbledore and begin negotiating ASAP, you need to stop the carnage of the war and prevent more deaths as quickly as possible. (Ninja edit: spelling)
