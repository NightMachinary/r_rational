Time Turners work like canon: they conveniently all break if you think about using them for more than the most simple of plots. Regardless, Harry has no way to know that local time-turners have softer restrictions, so he will expect to still be restricted to a 6 hour window. If he can get his hands on a time turner in the first 6 hours, then your plot could work.
