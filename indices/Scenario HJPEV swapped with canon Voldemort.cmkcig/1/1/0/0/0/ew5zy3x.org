The way the Potters died was due to sheer incompetence:

- Why not have James or Lily be the secret keeper? Bill Weasley could be the secret keeper of Shell cottage in book 7 with 0 issues. Instead they trust a literal rat who sold out under pressure (and to be fair Sirius and Remus could have betrayed them too, easy for them to talk when they never got captured)

- Why didn't they have more protections to at least stall for time?

- As you said, no wands on them, or at least within convenient reach.

- James Potter could have turned into a stag and charged him down, but instead ran at him in human form.

- Dumbledore didn't have anyway to monitor them? Alert spells are a thing, he could have the entire Order teleport there in seconds if needed.

- Speaking of teleportation, Lily didn't even try escaping the house with Harry? No wand no apparation sure but no emergency portkeys or something?

It's almost criminal that the Order in the height of its power couldn't organise better defences than the scattered remnants in book 7 with mostly inexperienced members.
