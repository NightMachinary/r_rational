I was going to make a comparison to Smartphones, but then it turned into a "they were charging" joke, and now I'm not sure where to go with this.

I do remember that, when Voldemort was remembering the attack in DH, James had his wand on the couch beside him, but didn't pick it up before getting up, even though he had a few seconds in which to do so. Them not having their wands close at hand I can sorta-kinda believe, if with some SoD, but Rowling went out of her way to point out that James' wand was /right there/ and he got up to fight without equipping it. What was he going to do, tackle Voldy?
