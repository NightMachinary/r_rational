David, a great hero motivated by his devout love for his loyal pet snake, loyal pet hermit crab and loyal pet iguana (all sadly and tragically deceased) steps out into the world and onto the pages of history prepared to protect animalkind from the greatest threat they face: humans stealing their DNA to engage in shapeshifting.

I do like seeing these motivating scenes for the minor bad guys, even if David was a gigantic douchebag in canon and may still be in this story.
