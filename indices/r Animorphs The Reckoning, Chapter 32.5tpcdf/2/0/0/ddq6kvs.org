Aaaaaand trying to blackmail and murder the main characters. Personally, I remember the David arc because it was the first Animorphs book I read, and it was one of the only arcs in the series that spanned multiple books.

This chapter does not relate to canon, except for the mention that David has a pet who dies tragically.
