While it's perfectly understandable that he should react negatively to the situation, he went to the extreme. Tried to sell out to the invaders, and when that was thwarted he tracked down each of the animorphs and tried to kill them. He killed (or dumped the already dead body of) Jake and Rachel's comatose cousin and took his place. Brushed off the apparent deaths of Tobias and Jake, because after all he hadn't killed a /human/, but a bird and a cat. Dude was twisted in the head and utterly selfish, and not even in a smart self-serving way.
