Oh don't get me started on Fumbulwinter. It's just an unoriginal Isekai, harem anime. It is the epitome of everything I hate about male fantasies. Men shouldn't be able to just have power given to them. That's not how real life works and it devalues women. When men have these fantasies it strips them of their drive to treat women with respect and become better men as it is satisfied by their imagination. Men start believing these fantasies and treating everyone, especially women, around them exactly like they have power over them. It doesn't help that the video game industry feeds these monsters.
