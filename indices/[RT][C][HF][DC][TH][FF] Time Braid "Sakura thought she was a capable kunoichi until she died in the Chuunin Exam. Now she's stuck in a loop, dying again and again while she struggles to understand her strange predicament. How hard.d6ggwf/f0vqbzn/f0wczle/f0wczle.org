nowhere in the thread you linked does the author of Mother of Learning actually say that his story was inspired by Time Braid. Where are you getting this information? Is it so implausible that two different authors would independently think of an intelligent fantasy time loop story? Time Braid being the inspiration for Mother of Learning is *speculation*, so please don't just state it as a fact.
