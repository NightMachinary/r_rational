I don't think it's an especially egregious error, but Sailor_Vulcan is right - Share what you know for a fact and let the reader come to their own conclusions. If people typically get their information 2nd or 3rd or 4th hand and every person along the line adds in their conclusions without making it clear that it's just a conclusion, chances are someone says something misleading, which the next person turns into something that's wrong.
