I have profoundly mixed feelings on this story. On the plus side, it's completed, it hits a lot of my buttons (non naruto MC, timeloop, challenging plot, proactive protagonist), and it is a genuinely pretty good fusion of the settings.

On the other hand, the story (and the narration, too, it's not just unreliable narrator) is skeevy as hell, it is very much not rational, and it devolves into mindless power fantasy for quite frankly too long in between the good bits; I can appreciate some power fantasy, but it really ends up getting in the way of the story. There's also an annoying amount of bashing, but at least some of that /is/ unreliable narrator.

Overall, a decent enough story but not one I've ever been able to get myself to reread.
