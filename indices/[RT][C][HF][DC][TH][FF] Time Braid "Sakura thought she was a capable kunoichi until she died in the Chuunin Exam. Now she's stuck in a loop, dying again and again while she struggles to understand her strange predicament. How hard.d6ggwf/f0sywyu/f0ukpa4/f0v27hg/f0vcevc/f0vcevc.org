This gets reposted in [[/r/rational][r/rational]] a fair bit. There's a lot of discussion of some things that seem to make it one of the subs guilty pleasures, but can often be summed up as "I like this lots, and a stack of trigger warnings. ". A lot of the discussion beyond that about what's wrong with the story looks like outgroup vs outgroup discussions if you've seen it a few times.
