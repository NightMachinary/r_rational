Lol. Kind of funny how much of that you can find on FF.net, even though theoretically they have banned smut. I started reading "Winter Comes" the other day, a GoT self-insert in which a protagonist from our world gets isekai'd into the body of the Night King at the moment of his creation by the Children of the Forest. Interesting story, but then it randomly drops on you lots of random explicit sex scenes - and they're all pretty cringe XD.
