Yup. He also did the /Fimbulwinter/ series.

/Fimbulwinter/ has a lot more power-up munchkinry. It's not /actually/ litRPG but it's written like one. It's also an unabashed red-pill harem fantasy, which I found grating. I still enjoyed it enough to read the whole thing, but I suspect the average [[/r/rational]] reader wouldn't like it.

 

/Perilous Waif/ has some pretty good sci-fi worldbuilding. The premise is that AI only reaches human levels (+ there's some FTL stuff) but the rest of technology progresses at a good pace. So everything is made of 3D-printed nanomaterials and everyone can afford a half-dozen catgirl android slaves, but it's still a relatable pre-singularity society.

The story is essentially /Alita/, so if you liked that manga/movie and you're not bothered by some background sex slaves, I recommend it.
