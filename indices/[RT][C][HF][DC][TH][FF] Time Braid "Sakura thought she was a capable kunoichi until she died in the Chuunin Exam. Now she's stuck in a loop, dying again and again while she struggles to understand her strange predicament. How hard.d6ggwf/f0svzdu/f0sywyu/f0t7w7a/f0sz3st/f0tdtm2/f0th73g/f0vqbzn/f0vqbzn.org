Called [[https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/originality]["the greatest of all Naruto fanfictions"]] by Eliezer Yudkowsky, /Time Braid/ is the story of Sakura, an ordinary genin (novice ninja) who is killed partway through her promotion exam and wakes up in her bed the next morning. Now stuck in a time loop, Sakura must solve the mystery behind her situation and find a way to pass an exam she was barely prepared for, even if she has to die over and over again to do so.

/Time Braid's/ minimalist writing style is fascinating to study from a writer's perspective, and makes the story incredibly fast paced -- /Time Braid/ goes through more plot in four chapters than most book series do in forty. Part of this is that SharperV is writing fanfiction, so he can assume we are familiar with the story of Naruto and show us only the diffs between his novel and way things went in the original anime/manga -- but note that there are many, many fanfic authors who would make us sit through their tedious novelization of stuff we already saw in canon instead.

/Time Braid/ is also notable for [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2xapv9/d_so_im_up_to_ch27_of_mother_of_learning_spoilers/][being the inspiration]] for [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][/Mother of Learning/]] (along with maybe [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day][/Chuning Exam Day/]], but it's hard to tell because /Time Braid/ was itself inspired by /Chunin Exam Day/). Zorian is Sakura, Zach is Naruto with Sasuke's backstory, QI is Orochimaru, they're all stuck in a one-month loop that ends with an invasion, etc.
