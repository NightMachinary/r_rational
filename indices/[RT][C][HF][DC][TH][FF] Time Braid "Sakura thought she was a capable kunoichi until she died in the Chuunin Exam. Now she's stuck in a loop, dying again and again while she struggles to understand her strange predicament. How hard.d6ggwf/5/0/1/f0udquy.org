  all the sex in it is consensual
#+end_quote

Though note that it's only consensual as in "nobody said no". There are a number of occurrences of "sex magic" used as a weapon (where the victim would have refused consent if they had a clear enough head to do so), and a couple of instances of rape by false identity.

(Like [[/u/Putnam3145]], I found this very tolerable. It's all minor events in a kick-ass story of rival ninjas. It's just when checking for trigger warnings that I realise how much there is.)
