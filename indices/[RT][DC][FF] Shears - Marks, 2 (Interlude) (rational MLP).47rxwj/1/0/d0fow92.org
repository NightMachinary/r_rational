Looking forward to the next chapter, take your time sorting things out. I haven't seen much of MLP but I love this story. I really like your characterization of Twilight - the way she processes things, her interactions with everypony. Relating especially being an social anxiety prone person myself with a lot of avoidant tendencies.. It's also been great to see the consequences of an eternal night being handled realistically. Can't wait to see where this story goes.
