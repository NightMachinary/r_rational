I want to make one strong correction to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2862yb/how_far_does_my_hero_rational_man_with_shotgun/ci7y8eo][the following]]:

#+begin_quote
  i think rationality PRECLUDES having a screaming drill mech larger than creation itself
#+end_quote

This is completely wrong. Rationality means /winning/, particularly, /systematized/ winning, particularly, /maximizing expected winning/. Since a screaming drill mecha larger than creation itself is ABOUT AS FUCKING WIN AS I'VE EVER SEEN, having one is the maximally rational thing.
