It takes a very cynical view towards most universes, in that (vaguely) deconstructionist way that I don't really like. I mean, Batman is more mythological than anything, and taking the weakest version of the universe for the rational man to conquer doesn't inspire much amazement (or amusement) for me.

Like, I'm not even talking about giving Sauron a Death Star (or however it goes), just not assuming that there's a vast and pervasive incompetence in whatever fictional world you're looking at. But this is one of the big things that bothers me in general.
