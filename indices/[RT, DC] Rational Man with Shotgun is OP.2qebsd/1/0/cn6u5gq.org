That's what I respect about your writing. When critiquing a fictional universe, many others would simply take the time to point out a handful of failures of logic then think that there was no point to go any further. As much as people talk of rationality like it's nigh undefeatable and can do anything, but I'm not yet so convinced. Many fictional worlds are poorly designed enough as to be easily abuseable at a glance, but I think the truest test of critical thinking is deciding what to do once those simple exploits are taken away.
