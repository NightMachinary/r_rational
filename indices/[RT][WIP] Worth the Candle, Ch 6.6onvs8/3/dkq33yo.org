Mmm, nice.

I don't know how many other people there are like me but I skipped every single segment discussing your old life and your dnd group, and will probably continue to skip them. I hope they continue to be plot irrelevant.

Also, the coterie minions seem way too much like meaningless NPC goon automata. I'm guessing you didn't intend that, since you don't comment on it in-universe.

But really those are mostly nitpicks, everything else was pleasantly excellent and I'm really looking forward to reading more!
