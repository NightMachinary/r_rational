I hate everything about this, including the fact that I don't hate it as much as I want to.

Edit: about the chapter itself, it's been a long time since Catherine has received a reminder to get her shit together and a longer time yet she needed one. Her recent behaviour reminds me of the aftermath of the first battle with the lone swordman, when she acted completely out of character due to external causes. I think there's similar fuckery going on right now.
