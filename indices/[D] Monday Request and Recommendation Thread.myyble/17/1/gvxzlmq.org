en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First/Contact/(novelette) is a classic.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_of_Magic]] second of the Xanth novels, needs a fuckton of disclaimers about the author, game theory limited to a single (but important) scene near the end.

Eliezer has a written a couple of course.

Charles stross has some, A Colder War or Missile Gap.

Superscience and Fast Romance, game theory has a small but rather important role in the 2nd and 3rd book.

Does anyone know if there's a trope name for game theory? TVtrope pages can be a great source but I can't find a dedicated page.
