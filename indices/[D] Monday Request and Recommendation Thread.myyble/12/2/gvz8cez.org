Surprisingly a controversial pick every time I rec this one here, but I'd recommend the Japanese light novel series So I'm a Spider, So What? I'd even say it fits into both categories.

The MC is surprisingly competent, although she can be silly most of the times due to her personality. The fights are pretty interesting and well-thought out, relying on the specialties of spiders to overcome stronger opponents. Some people do complain that there are problems and she doesn't optimize everything to 200%, especially since she obtains and then relies on a skill that essentially gives her the best magic talent and abilities in the world, I don't find it too egregious, and even then I still consider it better than every single litrpg on RoyalRoad other than Delve in terms of System stuff.

And in terms of the actual isekai setting, plot, and System, it's my all time favorite, even if it's not as hardcore math-y as Delve.

What I really appreciate about it is that it takes the classical isekai story you see in anime and novels, and actually puts thought into it. There's a reason behind the System and it's particulars, why the reincarnation is a thing, even all the fantasy elements and typical plot moments.

There's a moment when the MC complains that she didn't get a title or improved skill after maxing out two particularly annoying skills, and a mysterious Administrator D creates a new skill and gives it to her. This freaks her out as she realizes that this means someone has been watching her this entire time and created a skill for her, which means they can basically govern the System that affects the entire world, and wouldn't that make them a God? She's been deluding herself the entire time too, thinking it's just like a game or like another typical isekai story, and realizes that stats and skills are unnatural.

Another group of reincarnations also find out that every skill, or at least every skill they know of, is explicitly used for combat, and ponder the sinister implications of that.

I really appreciate Spider for how it approaches the typical isekai story and how it interweaves the System into the overarching plot, by far my favorite isekai and litrpg just for that. It's not just a numbers go up story, and I felt that shift is a part of what makes it so good. The MC is your typical antisocial gamer, but she's actually well-written, competent, and fun to follow and watch. She fails at communicating and interacting with others, but it's actually fun and reasonable to see, instead of say, Rain spouting some Captain Planet references or meming. Her growth and drive is shown very well throughout the series, as she desperately fights for her life and kills and eats humans without remorse and essentially tortures herself to grind up skills and resistances to survive. This even plays into how she interacts, or fails to interact, with others and her views of normality.

Of course, don't go in expecting some crazy amounts of rationalism like in Worm or Worth the Candle, as it's a Japanese light novel series, but it is surprisingly well-written and competent, and does some very interesting things with isekai and litrpg that I don't see in any other series. And it's definitely THE best monster isekai or even just monster MC novel out there, given that it's closest competitors are like what, Chrysalis and ELLC and Slime?

As it's a light novel series, you'll have to purchase the volumes, and they can be quite pricey at around 10 dollars per volume, if you're not looking for “illegitimate” sources, which can be a turn off for some. I will say it's very worth it though, although my views might be different from others since I enjoy reading a lot of web novels, even if the quality or translation isn't the best. It also has a currently airing anime, even if the animation isn't the best and it cuts out a lot of the details and nuance that makes the series so special.
