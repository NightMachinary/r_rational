A bit out of left field, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13049548/1/Agents-of-Light][Agents of Light]] is a Yugioh GX fanfic where three people isekai'd into the anime world by the Big Bad of the series. Instead of being heroes, they were forced to accomplish a task which would ultimately cause the destruction of the universe so that they can return to their world, and each of the three have differing level of willingness which causes them into conflict with each other. The duels are great and despite the protagonists using a much more advanced deck, sometimes even the side characters can pose a credible threat, but it's also really fun to see our protagonists bamboozle the anime casts with modern summonings that doesn't exist yet.
