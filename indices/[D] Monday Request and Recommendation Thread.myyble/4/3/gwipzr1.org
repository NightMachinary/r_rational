I haven't finished it, and so far there aren't really any markers of being rationalist adjacent, but I'd recommend House of Leaves. It's a metatextual horror about a guy who finds a fictional critical analysis book about a movie, The Navidson Record, about a house. Most of the real-world narrative happens via footnotes, most short but some pages long. The layers of media are interesting, and it feels like a mystery.

Downside is you'll most likely need to buy the physical book to read it. It does some funky things with formatting not possible in ebook formats. Some of it might be immersion breaking - I've only read one portion with weird formatting so far and it wasn't, but I can imagine others might have higher standards than I do for that.
