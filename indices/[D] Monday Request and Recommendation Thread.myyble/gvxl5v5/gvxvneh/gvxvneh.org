/The Good Student/ - the author is still around, but has updated very sporadically since Covid started and is only doing one of his various serials at the moment. Might come back but it has been 18+ months

/Mud's Mission/ - the author just stopped 8 months ago and vanished. Apparently they were doing a rewrite of the early stuff but looks like they gave up.

/Arrogant Young Master Template Variation 4/ - Not really rational, but it was a great xianxia parody. Author either got disheartened by criticism, had covid issues, or his home country had some turmoil, no one really knows
