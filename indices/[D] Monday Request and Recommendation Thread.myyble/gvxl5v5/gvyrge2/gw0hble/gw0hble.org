Paragamer is complete. The author is not planning to continue it at the moment, however. It ends anticlimactically, which sucked.

I really enjoyed the banal reality aspect of it. The fact that the characters took up smoking to deal with stress, for example. The grinding being interrupted by the foster family's demands on the MC's time. Comparatively, the later arcs really needed a big payoff to be worth it, and they did not get that.
