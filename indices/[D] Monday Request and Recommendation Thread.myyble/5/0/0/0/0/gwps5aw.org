if it came out today I'd say it was some sort of a commentary on popularity and likes in social media? Or something? The MC could pose a great analogy for a social media influencer who suddenly sees the mob turn mean, for example.

But the story itself predates Facebook by like a year, and thus feels kinda unfocused and unsure about its premise to a modern reader. It was, in a sense, caught in the bow wave of future shock and is a rough read because of it.
