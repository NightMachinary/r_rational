Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow goes into some detail about its popularity based system of currency called Whuffie.

I don't know that I would really recommend the book as worth the time investment except as a proof of concept because while the book does spend a lot of time and exposition on it I think the exploration as a whole is still a bit shallow. It doesn't go into detail about how popularity is actually measured or how transfer of power is enforced, it just discusses some of the competitiveness and weird governing organizations and conflicts between them that form as a result of using the system.
