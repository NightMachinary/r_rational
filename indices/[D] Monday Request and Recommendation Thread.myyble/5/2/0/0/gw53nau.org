/Saturn's Children/ I don't think has alt-economics, the main economics is some robots are enslaved and space travel is expensive.

Its sequel, /Neptune's Brood/, has a lot of alt-economics (specifically the economics is most heavy in the last half of the book) (there aren't Saturn spoilers in Neptune since the solar system and characters are different).

Specifically, the premise is corporate space colonization. Different solar systems are run by different corporations, which don't trust each other, but still want to exchange intellectual property.

So while intrastellar trade is done using "fast money" (not specified if it's different from fiat), interstellar trade is done using "slow money", which is more complicated (specifically slow money is A) issued by each solar system and B) each uses third-party verification to try to avoid scams like double-spending and C) primarily to fund colonization but side benefit of reducing volatility, slow money is sovereign debt).

Since slow money travels at a third of the speed of light (third party verification), there are complications, such as people looking to do scams and others looking to avoid scams (plenty of light-years distance means time for scammers to run away from victims). If you move from one system to another, you should exchange your fast money to slow money first (in the years of travel, extreme economic changes could happen).

When you arrive in another solar system, others will be suspicious of you if you try to exchange a lot of slow money all at once: Are you running a scam?

This isn't all of the economics in the book, the other economics would be spoilers I prefer not to type.
