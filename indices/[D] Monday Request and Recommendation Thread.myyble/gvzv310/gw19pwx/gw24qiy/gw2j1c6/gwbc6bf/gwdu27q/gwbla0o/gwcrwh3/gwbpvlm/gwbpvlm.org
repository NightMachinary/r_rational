I mean, I can't comment on what the best term to characterize a character I haven't read. I also wasn't necessarily intending to say it was "wrong" per se, just unusual (in the American context anyways). Libertarians have a bunch of stuff that they agree and disagree on with both the left and the right (how much with either side depends on the individual Libertarian, in my experience), but in the US, libertarians are usually characterized as "right" wing. I personally think that's equally incorrect, mostly because a single axis (or even the two-axis version) is a really terrible way of characterizing any political ideology (which is on top of the idea that "political ideologies" more generally are, in specific terms, kind of incoherent things on their own. It's common, and a convenient shorthand usually, but also almost always incorrect in the details.

My comment was really just to point out an unusual (again, in the US) categorization, not to try and suggest you were wrong or that you should change it. It's entirely possible that the character has large overlap with both libertarians and leftist policies.
