I would say that in the context of the United States, what you describe as Libertarianism simply isn't recognizable when put side-by-side with the political movement holding the same name. On nearly every point you raise, your hypothetical Libertarian (who I understand to be yourself) is entirely out of sync with the political identity.

This leaves entirely aside my opinion on your personal political philosophy, your stated priors, or your conclusions; some of which I agree with and/or find rationally supportable, and others of which I don't agree with and/or don't find rationally supportable.
