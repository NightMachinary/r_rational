  On nearly every point you raise, your hypothetical Libertarian (who I understand to be yourself) is entirely out of sync with the political identity

I feel like that's you assuming a consensus where there really is none. It's like saying "You claim to be on the left, yet you are pro-gun. This is completely out of sync with the political identity." It is technically true, in that the stereotypical left-wing stance is against guns, but it also inherently dismisses all nuance and assumes that every single person that vaguely identifies with a political movement also strictly adheres to the characteristics of a strawman of that political movement.
