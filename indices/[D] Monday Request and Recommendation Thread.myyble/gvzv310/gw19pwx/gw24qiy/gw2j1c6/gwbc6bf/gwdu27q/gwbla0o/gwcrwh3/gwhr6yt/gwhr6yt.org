Legalization of marijuana is hardly the only distinction. Libertarianism is strictly for a reduced government; whereas the conservative right is likely to support military spending, and the liberal left is likely to support expanding welfare spending.

Libertarians are generally pro individual freedoms, and thus pro guns, but there is also overlap with pacifism, whereas the conservative right does not particularly share that overlap, and skews towards certain religious views on personal freedoms.

Libertarians are pro free-market capitalism, but some also want certain taxes and restrictions on corporations that would operate at expense to individuals, such as pollution or consuming limited resources.

Personally, I support taxes on fossil fuels which should support certain renewable energy sources. I also support coops, net neutrality (yes I do want common carries who cannot have a conflict of interest due to the physical constraints of running cables to houses or on telecom poles, etc), and the right to repair. These are not generally seen in the conservative right.

Although people like to consider Libertarians to be a joke, I consider my personal political views to be rather rational. I do not believe the government can operate efficiently or compete in the free market. Thus, the government should not be responsible for paying for these things. Thus, the government does not need such a large budget.

So the intent is to reduce government spending, reduce taxes, and deliver better results at a lower cost. If we reduce the government spending, and taxes, we also reduce the bureaucratic overheads. And if we have managed to reduce the operating budget to something we can afford with simpler taxes, those are further gains. For example, rather than sales tax and income tax, I prefer land value tax. Property tax is also good. These taxes have the advantage of being very difficult to avoid.

Edit: also, in a similarity with anarchists, Libertarians place more emphasis on local politics.
