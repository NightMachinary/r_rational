I mean the Stasi was doing a great job of imitating 1984 - it wasn't as blatant as having a camera in every political officer's house, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi#Infiltration][they put informants in /every/ apartment building. They had /over one hundred thousand informants/ scattered throughout every part of Eastern Germany:]]

  counting part-time informers, the Stasi had one agent per 6.5 people.

It's pretty difficult to understand the sheer scale of infiltration of every part of civilian life. If you want to get a feel for how /absolute/ the violation of privacy was, watch the movie [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others][The Lives of Others]].

No, Eastern Germany wasn't Airstrip One, but they got /damn/ close.
