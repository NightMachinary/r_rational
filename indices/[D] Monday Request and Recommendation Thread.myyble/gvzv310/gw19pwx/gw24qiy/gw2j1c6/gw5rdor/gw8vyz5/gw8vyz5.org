Not just that, he misses the point on nearly everything. He says the telescreens are implausible because it would take too much manpower to watch everyone all the time - but of course the point is that somebody /could/ be watching you at any time, not that they /are/. He says that the telescreens never seem to break down even though everything else is decaying, but that's to show how this society prioritizes repression above all else - the Party /could/ prevent everything from decaying, but they choose not to in order to grind their citizens down through artificial scarcity.

He says that Newspeak has always been with us, because languages change over time to suit their speakers - but of course the point of Newspeak is to drive a wedge between the Party and the proles, and to make it more difficult for its speakers to express themselves by cutting out shades of meaning. The contractions are meant to facilitate speech without thought, which is similar to but distinct from making it more convenient to speak. It gets changed artificially, not organically, and once it's finalized it will remain the way it is forever.

I think this man was looking at the book in entirely the wrong light to see its merits. Still, it's nice to hear about how the book was received back in the 20th century, and to hear Asimov's perspective on Orwell's life. I never realized he died in 1950. I wish he'd survived to see the 60s, 70s and 80s.
