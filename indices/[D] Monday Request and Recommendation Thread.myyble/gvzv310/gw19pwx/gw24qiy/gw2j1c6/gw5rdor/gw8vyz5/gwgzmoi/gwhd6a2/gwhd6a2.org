Yeah, I thought that was the "actual geopolitics" angle he was trying to use- that tons of people who hadn't actually read the book used 1984 as an example of what it would lead to if the socialists/communists/democrats/left got what they wanted, but that it wasn't any good from that angle because it didn't predict what actually ended up happening in authoritarian communist countries well at all.
