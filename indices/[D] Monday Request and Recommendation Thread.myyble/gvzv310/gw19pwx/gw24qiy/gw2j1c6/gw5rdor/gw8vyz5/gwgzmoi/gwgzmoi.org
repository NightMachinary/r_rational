Asimov is reading the book to learn about Orwell, which is one way to read the book, and I think some of his points are quite reasonable. Asimov does take a sort of broadside approach where a lot of the points he makes don't seem relevant, but a lot of them are worth reading.

I do wonder if he's responding to a part of the discussion we're missing where lots of people in Asimov's time insist on interpreting 1984 more literally as a prediction of the world's political future.
