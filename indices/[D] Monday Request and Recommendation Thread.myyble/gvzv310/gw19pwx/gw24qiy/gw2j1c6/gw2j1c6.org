Animal Farm is has one of the funniest fanbases around because 95% of it is diehard capitalist types talking about how it's a damning indictment of the horrors of socialism when the moral of the story is that "when authoritarian socialism goes bad it's no different than capitalism."You see some of this in 1984 too, although unlike animal farm it also has some other messages in it. I'm personally not really a fan of either book and think Eric Blair was kind of an idiot, but at least to his credit he had what it took to fight fascism even when his own country was not at risk, so that's soemthing. As for the literary merits, aside from my own criticism I do heavily reccomend Asimov's commentary on the book: [[http://www.newworker.org/ncptrory/1984.htm]] .
