I'm not sure if it completely fits the bill, but I really enjoy [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis][Katalepsis]].

It has body horror and lovecraftian elements involving worlds that mortals can't usually access inhabited by beings whose desires are incomprehensible but not usually good for anyone who wanders into them. It's also well-written and I like the characters.
