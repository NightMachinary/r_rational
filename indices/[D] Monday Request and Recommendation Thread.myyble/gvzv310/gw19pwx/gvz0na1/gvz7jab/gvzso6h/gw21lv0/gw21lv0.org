Short stories:

- [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub][/There Is No Antimemetics Division/]] (17k + 43k words) by Sam Hughes. You're probably already familiar with it, it's usually recommended in the same breath as /Cordyceps/. Strong recommendation.

  - The author also wrote [[https://qntm.org/person][/cripes does anybody remember Google People/]], which is a microfiction horror story done in an unusual format.

- [[https://zerohplovecraft.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/the-gig-economy-2/][/The Gig Economy/]] (17k words) by Zero HP Lovecraft. Near-future cyberpunk cosmic horror. A mix of a ton of interesting concepts. Very good.

- [[https://pseudopod.org/2020/05/02/pseudopod-701-technicolor/][/Technicolor/]] (13k words) by John Langan. Pretty similar to /Vampire Domestication/, I think: it's from the PoV of a student listening to a lecture on an... esoteric topic. To say more would be spoilers. Very good.

- [[https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/writings/coding-machines/][/Coding Machines/]] (9k words) by Lawrence Kesteloot. Hard sci-fi/programming horror. Fairly well-executed, though perhaps not as unique conceptually as the other entries.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hollow-hill-archives-teletubbies.69481/][/hollow hill archives/]] (18k words) by indefinite. It's a sci-fi existenital/cosmic horror /Teletubbies/ fanfiction. Yup. I wouldn't say it's particularly rational or hard, but it's weird, a horror, and generally groups well with the other entries on this list, I think.

- [[https://www.tor.com/2015/09/16/please-undo-this-hurt-seth-dickinson/][/Please Undo This Hurt/]] (7k words) by Seth Dickinson. Depression/cosmic horror.

+[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48484.Blindsight][/Blindsight/]] by Peter Watts arguably counts, as a hard sci-fi existential horror. That's a full-length book, 100k.+ *Edit:* What am I talking about, you've linked Watts' lecture on vampire biology, surely you've read this.

Regarding [[/u/Paran014][u/Paran014]]'s recommendation... [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis][/Katalepsis/]] /is/ a very well-written dark urban fantasy with elements of cosmic horror, but it's more character-focused than plot- or horror-focused, and it's not "true" cosmic horror. I do suggest you give it a try, though.

Movies:

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/][/The Cabin in the Woods/]]. Worm : Superhero fiction :: The Cabin in the Woods : Horror fiction.

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1977895/][/Resolution/]]. Better to go in blind. A supernatural entity is trying to orchestrate a horror story in reality.

- [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681/][/Pontypool/]]. A group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts. Features the best example of a memetic threat I've seen outside of text-based fiction.

I'll also mention [[https://rustyquill.com/the-magnus-archives/][/The Magnus Archives/]] (200 episodes, ~4500 minutes total), a horror podcast. It's centred around an institute researching supernatural activity. The protagonist is a newly-appointed archivist tasked with sorting out the poorly-structured mess of witness statements left behind by his predecessor. Starts as a collection of seemingly unrelated creepypastas which then connect into an overarching narrative. I'd argue it's rational-as-a-story, and there are rational side characters (including one character who is reminiscent of Marion from /the Antimemetics Division/, and if it were from her perspective it'd absolutely qualify for [[/r/rational][r/rational]]), but the leads aren't, really. The overarching plot is pretty good, though.
