If you're looking for something mildly entertaining to read, and can tolerate turning off 60% of your brain, people here might enjoy My House of Horrors. It's a Chinese translation in the emerging genre of "RPG system applied to thing you wouldn't anticipate. In this case, the main character is the proprietor of a down-and-out haunted house, and can improve it by completing missions that loosely fit in the horror genre.

What's interesting about this (enless, millions of words) translation is the sheer number of hooks and subplots that are deployed as the story goes on. I'd say, first, that the main story loop is this:

1. MC has a pressing issue, such as a powerful ghost is living in the mirrors in his house and trying to kill him / visitors / workers.\\
2. The MC feels like doing a tough horror mission will give him a power up to deal with the issue. The MC does the mission, which takes many chapters, and succeeds by the skin of his teeth.
3. The MC deals with the original issue, either as a corollary of the horror mission or by using whatever power-up he got. The MC unlocks a new scenario in his haunted house that matches the theme of the horror mission.\\
4. For some business-related reason, self-absorbed social media influencers / unscrupulous rivals / criminals visit his house with intent to discredit / copy / steal stuff. They get really, really scared. This takes a number of chapters.

The interesting part here is how much genre stuff gets balanced.

- RPG system. MC levels up his house and gets occasional personal skill boosts, plus haunted magic item type things.
- Relatedly, the MC collects ghosts, which are almost like Pokemon or something.
- The MC impresses people with creepy skills, like making mannequins or whatever.
- The MC manages his business, hiring rubes from the countryside, convincing the park to lease him their abandoned parking lot, or whatever. He makes and spends money.
- Horror missions. The MC goes into a traditional horror scenario, like ghost village or whatever, and has to survive. Maybe a civilian is drawn in and they get brought into the masquerade , for flavor. The MC hits ghosts with a magic hammer, or pokemons ghosts with ghosts, or whatever weird thing.
- Overarching mystery plot to find missing parents, the house missions are the only lead.
- Social media influencer drama. The MC livestreams horror missions (of course), collects followers. People can't believe how amazing the special effects are.
- The MC face slaps people who think his house isn't scary. The house has real ghosts, it's very scary. You shouldn't underestimate how scary this house is, random face-slapped NPC.
- The MC (kind of) parents an orphaned kid. Also a cat, which does not behave realistically.
- The MC solves murders and develops an (implausible) relationship with the police, who respect his hammer-toting ghost methods.
- The MC has a kind of love affair with a ghost.
- The MC confronts a secret occult society focused on ancient evil, a la Lovecraft.

Though the story is fundamentally pretty stupid, it's stupid in such a meta and genre-evolved way that I can't help but be engaged.

tl;dr If you want to read millions of words about a guy who levels up a haunted house and hits ghosts with a hammer, this is the story for you.
