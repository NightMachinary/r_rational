Not a rec, but a question. I see "So I'm a Spider, so what?" mentioned here surprisingly often. I read through the first two novels, and liked it. (Spoilers below.)

But it seems like the character is eventually going to be the new demon lord, and what I've read up so far, not particularly someone who's even mildly good on the good-evil spectrum. Does this get resolved in a satisfactory manner? is there a reason that MC has to do the things she does? or is it more grey and grey morality?
