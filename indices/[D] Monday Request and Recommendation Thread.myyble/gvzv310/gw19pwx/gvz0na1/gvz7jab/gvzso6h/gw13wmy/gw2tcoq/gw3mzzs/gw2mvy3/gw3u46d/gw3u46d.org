Graydon Saunders's Commonweal series is my always-go-to for a fantasy take on this. (Warning: is written in Engineer, which is almost but not entirely unlike English. Contains a lot of canal-building.)

Elizabeth Bear's White Space novels (Ancestral Night and Machine) have a quite divergent economic system which is pretty thoroughly explored.
