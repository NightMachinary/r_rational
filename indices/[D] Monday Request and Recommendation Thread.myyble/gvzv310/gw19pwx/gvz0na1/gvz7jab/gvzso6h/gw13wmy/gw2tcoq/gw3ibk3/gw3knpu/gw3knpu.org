The main character spends half the book talking about how ideal and perfect the system is then ends up broke and completely screwed over by the system and isn't even allowed to ride in an elevator and is treated like a pariah because he is unpopular so if that is what you were predicting then you guessed correctly. If it is a parody of someone else's system I didn't catch the reference.
