Hmm, I can't think of anything that's properly *hard-*econ. Rejected ideas:

- Ursula leGuin, /The Dispossessed/.\\
  Interesting premise and relationships follow from 'this society doesn't have a concept of property', but it's as soft-econ as it is alternative.
- Scott Westerfeld, /Extras/ (YA, 4th in trilogy).\\
  Japanese-ish city-state runs on a combination of "merits" awarded for productive work, and "face" (ordinal recognition/popularity). The reputation economy relies pretty heavily on being UBI-style post-scarcity for everyday life, not giving you huge resources beyond that, and out-of-frame nanotech run by the Very Serious People.
- Francis Spufford, /Red Plenty/.\\
  Lightly fictionalised account of economic planning in the USSR, and attempts to computerise it. The Chilean [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn][Project Cybersyn]] was another fascinating attempt to solve the "socialist calculation problem", unfortunately halted by a CIA-backed coup (literally because a working socialist economy would hurt anti-communist efforts). I wish I knew of good fiction set in this vein.
- Kedrann, [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28693/kedrann+Et+sidera+propagantur+ex+caldariam.htm][/Et sidera propagantur ex caldariam/]]\\
  Features the reincarnated Sailor Saturn slowly taking over the world economy with the power of better planning (cybersyn-style); fun but the economics aren't really a focus or described in detail beyond "yes, it's a cyberpunk megacorp run by a magical girl"
- Cyberpunk classics (or modern OSS) where the hackers have /sufficient/ (maybe not much) money to opt-out into a reputation economy - think Hiro in /Snow Crash/, the cast of Vinge's /True Names/, kernel maintainers, etc.
- Post-scarcity - the Culture, Valinor (per Silmaril & other glowfics), etc.

So I could summarise as "reputation economies, but the background is markets", "Socialist/cybernetic approaches, but markets still dominate", and/or "a wizard eliminated scarcity so it's not really hard-econ any more" :-(
