Becky Chambers's "Wayfarers" series is mostly set in a typical economic system, but one of the books is set in the Exodan Fleet, which has a highly alt economic system (and a great deal of social friction coming from the interface between that system and the monetarist/capitalist systems of the polities they're integrating into).
