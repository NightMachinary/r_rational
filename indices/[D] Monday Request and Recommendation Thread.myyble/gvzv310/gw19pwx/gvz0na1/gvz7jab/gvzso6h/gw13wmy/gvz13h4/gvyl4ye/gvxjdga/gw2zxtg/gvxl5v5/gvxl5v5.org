F in the comments for all the ratfics you liked that were dropped for various reasons.

Mine:

- How to survive a summoning 101 by Durrendal: author's mother had cancer several years ago. This was my favourite rational-ish fiction at the time, and stays one of my favs to this delay despite being 31 chaps/ dropped on a cliff. The author really put in the effort to have consistent world and characters despite dealing with some heavy and dark topics.

- Game of Champions by Lamora: from what I understand, the author werent happy with the quality of this work / didn't want to write pokemon fanfics any more. They're still active and healthy though, and they post plot dumps from time to time.
