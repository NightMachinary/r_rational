He's not trapped in the house, it's his business and he's the proprietor. Horror missions take place outside the house, mostly. His motivation for not getting a job doing fast food or whatever and skipping the plot, besides making pretty good money with a popular haunted house, is initially to find his parents. After a while, he's pretty deep in, since he has enemies, and the house is the major source of his power. It'd say that part of the plot is pretty solid, it's everything else that's way out there. The most irrational things are his interactions with police and his livestreaming of actual ghosts, though there's certainly plenty of other questionable plot points.
