I disliked Pedestal and Traveler. Haven't read Olivine Romance because it didn't look like something I'd be interested in, but skimming it it looks pretty well written.

I found Salvage pretty decent and it's actually still alive after 8 years, though unfortunately still incomplete. Definitely not a ratfic though. Tail of Redemption and Mew Like Me aren't bad either.

Edit: oh, and Clouded Sky was really good.
