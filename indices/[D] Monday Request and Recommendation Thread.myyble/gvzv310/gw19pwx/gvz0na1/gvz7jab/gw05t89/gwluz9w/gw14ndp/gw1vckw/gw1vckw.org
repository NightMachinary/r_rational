Thanks for the recommendation. I skimmed it and dropped it; I would not second the recommendation as the writing looks terrible. Verbatim:

  "Oy. Steven. I've got some things to talk to you about possibilities." My smile is broad and my voice overly friendly. I don't see it physically but aura-wise Steven is immediately on guard. Not in the hey this is gonna suck way but in oh no, someone I like is about to give me work and I won't know how to say no way. Wow. Both Lance and Steven are giving me so much delightful ways of teasing them later.

  "Would this happen to do with the Order you are forming?" While I told the Stones a bit about what I wanted of my life I don't think they quite believed me, scary pok√©mon or not. They saw me as a talented trainer but once I told my cousins and Steven about all the work I've already put into starting everything up? Steven took me a lot more seriously.
