Oh haha, you're ahead of me then.

Out of curiosity, are there any other fics in the fandom that you thought were really good? They don't have to be ratfics only, I've found the "top" ~5-10 fics in a fandom (depending on the size and prolific-ness of the writers in it) tend to be quite enjoyable.

Off the top of my head, I think Game of Champions was by far my favorite, followed by (in no particular order) Traveler, Olivine Romance, Pedestal, Sun Soul?
