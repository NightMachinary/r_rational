I just started reading Pillars of the Earth [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pillars_of_the_Earth][wikipedia]] and it fits the rational bill pretty well. It's not my usual genre, but so far I'm loving it. Exciting, intriguing, with smart, driven characters and I feel like I'm learning something.

It's an 800 page doorstop, and I'm less than a quarter of the way through but so far I'd give it a 10/10 do recommend.
