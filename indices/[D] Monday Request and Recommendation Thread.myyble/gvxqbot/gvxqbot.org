What are some ratfics for Elfen Lied?

I'm surprised I haven't seen more discussion about this franchise on [[/r/rational]]. It's relatively well-known, has all the elements of a world that could be reinterpreted rationally.

Despite the good things I heard about it, I was disappointed by the sheer amount of plot-induced stupidity and shallow explorations of its themes. I did think the premise was interesting, and I wasn't put off by the grimdark aspects, just that the grimdark was poorly executed.
