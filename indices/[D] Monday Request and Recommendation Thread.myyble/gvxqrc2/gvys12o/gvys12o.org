Have you tried World of Prime yet? Published novels, Sword of the Bright Lady is the first one. I thought the MC was quite rational, actually wants to reunite with wife and moves toward that goal instead of just dropping a line or two about wanting to go back every few dozen chapers as per usual. Thought the writing was good, too.
