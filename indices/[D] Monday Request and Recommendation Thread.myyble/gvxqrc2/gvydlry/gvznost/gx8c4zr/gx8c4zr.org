LoTM is really good. I know hearing you need to read a bajillion chapters before it gets good is annoying but this is one of the cases where I believe it's worth it. Volume 3 is what most people find to be the best volume but IMO the later chapters are even better.

If you find it really hard to read, just skim the first two volumes but read the weekly Tarot Club properly. It asks as a kind of in-world summary of the week. It's worth skimming rather than reading because the many foreshadowing and to understand character motivation.
