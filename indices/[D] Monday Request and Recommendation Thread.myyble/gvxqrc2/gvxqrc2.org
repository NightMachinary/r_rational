I am starved for 2 specific ploy archetypes and desperate for any obscure recommendations which fit I may have missed (assume I've read all the highly reced things + first 5 pages of score sorted on RR)

1. Any Isekai with an intelligent, in-control MC;

Other than all the standard good stories, I've found a lot of obscure ones which fit this criteria in all the worm crosses; anyone crossing with worm or with "My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected" where they get Taylor or the other MC to be Isekai'd fits this since the appeal of those characters is competence, and all crosses are usually them going somewhere and kicking ass. If you have any other recs like this, please share!

1. Any Isekai where the MC is isekaied into something which is normally not sentient/moral *and there is interaction with the native humans.*

It would have to be really obscure cos I've looked far and wide for any more of these and feel like I've read it all now. But also please do rec if you have any! Some of my fav obscure ones which fit this is the couple of Pok√©mon Isekais (which are not PMD) which fit this such as a backwards grin and "I thought this was a PMD Isekai".

Thanks in advance!
