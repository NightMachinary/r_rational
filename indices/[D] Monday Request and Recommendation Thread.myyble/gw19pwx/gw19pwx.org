I feel the need to preface this by saying that I am not a socialist. Up until around 30 years ago, half of my country was under the rule of a socialist dictatorship, and that was not at all a great time for anyone.\\
However, these last few days I more or less stumbled upon a succession of stories dealing with socialism from various angles, or at least giving perspectives on it, and I think some of those stories would be interesting to the people here on this server. I don't intend to discuss politics here beyond what is needed to talk about the books, but... yea.

First, I read Orwell's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(book)][*1984 - A Novel*]]. Everyone here should be familiar with it on principle, but I doubt most people have read more than the wikipedia summary. It's... yea. It's pretty fucking bleak, and not in the way Wildbow's stories are where the main character gets the occasional /fuck yea/ moment to compensate for the inherent hopelessness of the setting. I still think there's value in reading this story, beyond the more than decent prose. Because just as much as the story is about grinding, lethal inevitability, it's also about resilience and finding your small nieches of happiness in the face of already certain doom.

Afterwards I got my hands on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm][*Animal Farm*]], Orwell's other anti-totalitarian book, this one a rather funny satire. Worth reading just for the final sentence:

  No question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.

After these two, I found it hard to believe that Orwell was actually a Socialist himself, and wanted to get started on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia][Homage to Catalonia]], where he recounts his experiences as a volunteer for the Worker's Militia in the Spanish Civil War. However, while cleaning up my ebook library, I found a book called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_MacLeod#Series][*The Cassini Division*]] which I'd read as a child without understanding anything, and learned it was part three of a series. So I set to reading that series instead.

The article I linked above is for its author, Ken Macleod, instead of the book, because as it turns out, that series isn't all that well known. Which is a damn shame, because I thought it was a great read. Macleod's protagonists run the leftist gamut^{1} from communists, trotzkyists, libertarians, and socialists to anarchists. They are united in two things only - their faith in technological progress, and that they really /believe/ in their faction's creed, and will fight and kill for it.

^{1} : The only traditionally Leftist faction that is never shown anything but disdain are the Greens. In these stories they are either a nuisance, smelly barbarians who attack people from horseback, or dangerous maniacs who destroy research labs and rocket bases.

The first story, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Fraction][*The Star Fraction*]] takes place after a Socialist reformation in England which was stamped out in the aftermath of a hot nuclear war in Europe, and follows Moh, a Trotzkyist militia leader (and his gun) in the splintered small communities which were allowed self-government in the north of London. Supporting characters are a scientist in memory drugs, and an atheist youth who grew up in one of the Christian Fundamentalist enclaves. They are brought together by the plans of an advanced financial AI which was programmed by Moh's father with the covert goal of planning a new socialist revolution, but has attained sentience since then.

Book two, *The Stone Canal* (no wikipedia entry) is told non-linearly, and follows John Wilde through the confusing years of the socialist reform, the restauration, and the socialist revolution from book 1. In contrast to the first book's protagonists, he's a fanatical libertarian, who carries his convictions to the utmost limits; for example, he purchases the option for a retributive nuclear attack from one of the USSR's splinter states. In the second timeline, which is told interspersed between that one, John Wilde wakes up after his death on a foreign planet in the process of being terraformed by a libertarian capitalist anarchy. The book is about piecing together the events that led to this state of affairs, as well as an exploration of personhood and AI rights. It also captures the despair and disorientation that the fall of the Soviet Union must have caused in Leftist people during the late 80ies and 90ies.

The third book, *The Cassini Division* (no wikipedia link), is back in our solar system, after a general collapse of society first due to a series of pandemics which were either caused or left to run their course due to anti-science factions having taken over most of the world and a series of viruses which destroyed much of the remaining infrastructure, and the following reorganization of Earth as a unified socialist utopia. Those viruses were the work of a species of uploaded human consciousnesses, which built themselves a habitat out of intelligent matter in Jupiter over the course of book two, but degenerated into madness in their accelerated hardware. This book focuses on Ellen May Ngwethu, member of the Star Fraction from book one, a socialist and warrior to the core, who has made it her life's goal to eradicate the uploaded minds. Much of the book is spent exploring this new socialist society, and later on contrasting it to the equally utopical capitalist society on the planet from book two. What's fascinating is that their version of socialism seems to be founded upon a bastardized kind of Ayn Rand's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism][Objectivism]], which is just fucking wild. That tidbit aside, the story is mostly transhumanist hard sci-fi with a side order of deterrence mind games.

Then, finally, I back to Orwell's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_to_Catalonia][*Homage to Catalonia*]]. I'm not yet finished with this story, but I wanted to write this entry before I start forgetting details from the first books, and anyway we all know how the Spanish Civil War ended. So, this story is hard to classify; it's certainly not a war diary, it was edited /from/ Orwell's diaries but lacks the immediacy of those. It's also not an autobiography, covering only a short time span and not concerning itself with Orwell's person all that much. I'm almost tempted to call it a travel report, except the travelling was done mostly via trains full of soldiers, either towards or away from the front lines of the Spanish Civil War, where Orwell fought as part of the Worker's militia POUM. I really liked his writing style and occasional British humor. I mean, read what he had to say about being shot in the throat by a Fascist sniper:

#+begin_quote
  The wound was a curiosity in a small way and various doctors examined it with much clicking of tongues and /‘Qué suerte! Qué suerte!'/ One of them told me with an air of authority that the bullet had missed the artery by ‘about a millimetre'. I don't know how he knew. No one I met at this time---doctors, nurses,   practicantes , or fellow-patients---failed to assure me that a man who is hit through the neck and survives it is the luckiest creature alive. I could not help thinking that it would be even luckier not to be hit at all.

Also, I especiallly liked the experience of comparing and contrasting his account of the revolutionary anarchist and socialist society he found in Barcelona 1936 with the fictional societies that Macleod invented for his stories, and with the societies from Orwell's novels.
