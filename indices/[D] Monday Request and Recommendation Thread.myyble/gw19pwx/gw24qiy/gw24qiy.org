/Homage/ is a good read. I'd call it a memoir. Certainly has travelogue elements. The description of la Sagrada Família alone is worth the price of admission.

  For the first time since I had been in Barcelona I went to have a look at the cathedral--a modern cathedral, and one of the most hideous buildings in the world. It has four crenellated spires exactly the shape of hock bottles. Unlike most of the churches in Barcelona it was not damaged during the revolution--it was spared because of its ‘artistic value', people said. I think the Anarchists showed bad taste in not blowing it up when they had the chance, though they did hang a red and black banner between its spires.

Harsh. They never did finish that church, they're still working on it.

I feel like /1984/ and /Animal Farm/ are required reading, if only to understand that totalitarianism isn't a left or right phenomenon.

If you haven't already, read the short and worth it [[https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/][Politics and the English language]]. If you want to keep going down the socialist utopian rabbit hole a bit further, [[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3261][News from Nowhere]] is pretty interesting / entertaining.

Thanks for the post.
