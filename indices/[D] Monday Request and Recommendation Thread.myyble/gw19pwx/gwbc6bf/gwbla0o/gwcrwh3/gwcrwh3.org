In the context of US politics, "abolition of property and commerce" isn't even a political position, much less the definition of "traditionally left". Traditionally left positions would be, at this point, things like "we should have single-payer healthcare", "we should price externalities into the costs of doing business", and "the rich should actually pay taxes, rather than being permitted to evade them".

Libertarianism as a political philosophy is defined by property rights (they're for them). This is unrelated to Anarchism, which is defined by consensus-based structures of political power and an opposition to power hierarchies. I won't say they're inherently incompatible, but at least in the USA, Libertarians are distinguishable from Republicans only by their desire to legalize marijuana while Anarchists (what very, very few there are) are mostly associated with the kind of "way to the left of the Democratic Party" types who focus on local politics and do things like run free fix-your-broken-headlights clinics.
