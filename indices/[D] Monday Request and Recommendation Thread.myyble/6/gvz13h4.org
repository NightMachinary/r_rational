Someone recommended [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery][*A Practical Guide to Sorcery*]] last week. I started it yesterday and I'm hooked. I see that [[/u/AzaleaEllis]] sometimes also posts here and the story is definitely rational. It's also well edited and well written so I'd just suggest reading the first few chapters and seeing if you're hooked :)
