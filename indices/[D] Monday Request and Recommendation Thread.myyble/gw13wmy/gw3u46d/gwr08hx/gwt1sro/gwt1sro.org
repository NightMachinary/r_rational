The economic system isn't extricable from the sociopolitics, though. The casual use of attestation, the way the equivalents to townships/farms/companies interact, the way investment works and the way sometimes you have to deliberately take losing investments in order to not wind up "in court of a Thane's taxes", the economic disruptions from innovation, all of this stuff is pretty tied together and tied into the social/political systems.
