It was also his first novel and I think it shows. I agree it felt unfocused which is why I didn't really recommend it as worth the time. It tried to do a bunch of things like the consciousness backups and the currency thing and memory uploading as entertainment, yet none of it really clicked for me or had a lot of emotional impact. For example the part I spoilered could have been a great way to subvert the story and show the dark side of the system to add some realism, but instead it sort of gets brushed over in a few pages before the sort of happy ending.

I would say it could be a reference to the social credit system in China or something like that but it predated that too.
