[[https://www.patreon.com/posts/wizard-humans-40620112][The Wizard Tournament]] is spectacular:

- Some plot points and explanations are predictable before-hand, as opposed to ad-hoc.
- The characters went from 2D to deep, complex people. I noticed myself pattern matching who people were based off a few snippets in the story, but later developments added context which showed I was wrong.
- Several moments literally made me stop reading to laugh
- A person's unique magic specializations is employed in clever ways to win (though not all magic is pre-defined for us to predict it, though there is a lot of extra world-building material listed in the index)
- Clever social manipulation

There are a couple things that I was against, a Shrek reference and the protagonist is initially unlikable in a Zorian-esque way, but worse!, and it's only on Patreon as far as I can tell (though you can read up to Ch. 100 or so w/o paying atm)

Overall, still a top contender for my favorite stories.
