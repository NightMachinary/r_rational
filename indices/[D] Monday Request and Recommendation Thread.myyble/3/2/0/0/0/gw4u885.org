I'm not him, but at a guess:

  Not in the hey this is gonna suck way but in oh no, someone I like is about to give me work and I won't know how to say no way. Wow. Both Lance and Steven are giving me so much delightful ways of teasing them later.

This part is weird. It's overly descriptive, the POV character might be able to get that much info from aura, but if so, it probably would have been better if it were delivered with less fanfare. Doesn't help that it's also written in a way that sorta kinda seems like it's trying to be funny, even though it seemingly isn't a joke. The kind of overly-playful tone that suggests a certain... I'm not sure how to put it, exactly. All I can say is that I've read stories where characters think like this, and was able to deduce based off of that fact alone that this story was probably an isekai before I went and checked to confirm.

Not that I have a problem with isekai, but it has a feeling of derivativeness to it. I feel like I've seen this exact personality type in a ton of stories, and they don't tend to be good. That's probably unfair, given that I've not actually read the thing- but neither did the other guy, and I'm mostly trying to analyze why he thinks those quoted parts are bad, not whether the story is /actually/ good or bad in my own opinion.

  "Would this happen to do with the Order you are forming?" While I told the Stones a bit about what I wanted of my life I don't think they quite believed me, scary pok√©mon or not. They saw me as a talented trainer but once I told my cousins and Steven about all the work I've already put into starting everything up? Steven took me a lot more seriously.

This bit is is also really wordy, or at least feels that way out of context. Not to mention that- again out of context at least- it feels like a case of telling and not showing.

Really reminds me of light-novel style writing, or some of the really amateur stuff on royal road. It's not necessarily a deal breaker for me personally, but if the rest of the story is written like this, I can see why a person would get turned off.
