It is hardly my fault if other Libertarians mistake minimizing the national government to its essential functions, with some vague concept of free market capitalism as a panacea to all our country's ills.

Two liberal Democrats will not agree on everything (because a two party system does not reflect real people) and even on things they agree upon, they may have different reasons.

Take two self proclaimed anarchists; one might run a local makerspace and drink cold brew coffee bartered for over Tor, and the other might protest police violence and the patriarchy. Is one not an anarchist?

Edit: my point is, my view is not out of sync. My political views are fundamentally rooted in the same views as other Libertarians. I just strive to be rational and internally consistent in my policies, and some of my implementation details may be different.

I know a common joke is a video of a Libertarian conference, in which a speaker is booed for insisting he prefer a drivers license. Anyone operating such a vehicle is a threat to the livelyhood of those around them, so it is consistent with the Libertarian ideology to want a drivers license to operate a vehicle in public spaces. The audience booing is not reflecting the actual Libertarian ideology. At the same time, I see no need for laws that require adults to wear seatbelts.

Sorry, edit edit: my anarchist example isn't very useful as both can clearly be anarchists without conflicting. A conflict might be, is the makerspace actually anarchist? Because the owner has registered a company/org/etc, rather than set up in an abandoned parking lot. I think this makes more sense now? It both is and isn't anarchist.
