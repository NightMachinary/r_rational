There's been a group of particularly good fictions on RoyalRoad recently that I think people here will appreciate:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead][The Way Ahead]] - it's got those great early Delve vibes, but the MC doesn't have nearly as much plot armor as Rain. Note that there /is/ a "you ran your mouth off about advanced technology so now we're locking you in a room until you can give it to us" slavery arc, but it's quite short - it's already resolved on Patreon. This is also one of the few stories I've read that has /actual/ science in it, not just "whoa science is amazing" faffing around.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool-a-progression-fantasy][Mark of the Fool]] - not a LitRPG despite calling itself a "progression fantasy", this story is great if you're in to power munchkinry. The MC receives a "Mark" that makes him great at any task not involving combat or magic, but unable to fight or cast spells; the MC then has to figure out the mechanics of the mark (what does it /mean/ to be unable to fight? what does it /mean/ to be good at setting up a campsite?), and either leverage or work his way around them. It spends less time than I would like on the munchkinry, but it's still good.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41881/wizards-tower][Wizard's Tower]] - a ~200 year old incredibly powerful wizard in a LitRPG setting decides it's time to quit his job as Headmaster of the magical academy he founded and go build a tower in the middle of nowhere to do the sort of research people might object to happening in a city. I really like the characterization of the MC in this story; he's very clearly suppressing a lot of the emotions he's built up over the years. His rationality feels like a thin veneer and he's barely managing to hold it together, but he's really good at lying to himself.
- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41836/evil-eye][Evil Eye]] - Probably the least rational of the bunch as a story, but the main character is probably the most rational out of all the characters here. He's only about average when it comes to intellectual intelligence, but (aside from a glaring weakness in the first chapter) he's probably one of the more emotionally intelligent characters I've read recently. The story summary does make him sound kind of like an incel, but I promise that's not what's going on. You'd be better off just reading the first chapter to get a read on the character.
