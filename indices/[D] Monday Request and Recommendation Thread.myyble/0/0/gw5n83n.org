I second Wizard's Tower. For a "rough draft", it's already far better than most of the stuff on RoyalRoad.

Mark of the Fool was interesting enough for me to finish what's posted, but felt a bit tropey, and I'm not sure where it's going. Might pick it up again in the future once it's a bit longer. Titling it "A Progression Fantasy" was definitely a poor choice, because, first, putting the genre in the title is a bit weird? It works better on a physical book cover as a sort of subtitle, but even that I would raise my eyebrows at. In a web fiction format, it's just strange. Second, progression fantasies aren't necessarily powerwank murderhobo stories, but boasting about being a progression fantasy sure makes it sound like you are---which Mark of the Fool isn't. All in all, it was much better than I expected from the name. Once again, better than most of the stuff on RoyalRoad, but this time mostly because that's a pretty low bar to clear.

The Way Ahead was way too stream-or-consciousness for me to stand. It's a characteristic RR writing style. Not wrong, because language is arbitrary and "good" style is a matter of current convention, but I personally find it unbearable.

Haven't read Evil Eye.
