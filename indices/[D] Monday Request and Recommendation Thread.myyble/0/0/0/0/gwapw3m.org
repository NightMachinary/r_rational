Is Wizard's Tower the one with the tense errors? I remember a few of the ones in the list having occasional errors and comma splices. If it's that, I got the feeling that they were genuinely errors, and not that frequent, acceptable to overlook. With The Way Ahead, I just didn't like the way it was written. Too many ellipses, dashes and italics. Paragraphs upon paragraphs of chained rhetorical questions. Most of the first chapters were mental monologue or verbal monologue, with seemingly random alternation between in-narration thoughts and italicized "inner voice" thoughts. The story is in third person, but feels like the author is trying to emulate a telepathic link beaming every tiny flicker of thought in the protagonist's mind to the reader.

It reads like the author has good technical English skills but not much story writing experience and ended up taking most of their stylistic cues from really bad RR fiction. Or incredibly bad SIs on SB/SV.
