It wasn't so much tense errors in Wizard's tower as a similar complaint to the one you have with Way Ahead. I don't mind the 3rd person stream-of-thought style, at least not the way it's executed here. Here's some of Wizard's Tower:

#+begin_quote
  The third ring, or Midderring, is the ring we arrived at when we exited Chillrest Dungeon. Chillrest being one of the two public dungeons with entrances in this ring. The third having its entrance along the outer wall of the fourth ring. The Adventurers' Guildhall, the handful of academies, the merchant and trade guildhouses, the city hall, library, and administrative parts of the city all have a presence within this ring.
#+end_quote

Lots of short sentences. Interspersed by punctuation marks. Sometimes there's a single comma in the middle, splitting the sentence up. But each 'block' of text presents a single idea. Where blocks are stretches separated by commas or full stops. Add to that the dry way things are described. This is probably a symptom of it being written quickly, and might be improved on in a later pass to give the prose more life, but that seems harder to do without the prose turning purple than the other way round.

The later chapters aren't as bad, but I'm also just not as interested in this character as in the MC of The Way Ahead, generic physicist-isekai that it might be.

But as I said before, I attribute this to taste. I don't mind the shortcomings of Way Ahead's prose style, while they turn you off; vice-versa for Wizard's tower.
