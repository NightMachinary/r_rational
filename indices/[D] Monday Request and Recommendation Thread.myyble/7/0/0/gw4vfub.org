Thanks for reading. I plan on reworking the first few chapters when book 1 is done or potentially sooner depending on how much free time I have. Those chapters are around 3 years old and just touched up, while most of the other writing is a complete redo. Now that the story is picking up, I should probably get on that sooner rather than later. Glad you found the story improved over time.
