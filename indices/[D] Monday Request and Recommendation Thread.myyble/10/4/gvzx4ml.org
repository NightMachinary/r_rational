I rather enjoyed The Dao of Magic and The Oracle Paths. *The latter is not officially dead but the author was previously quite consistent for over a year iirc. *The former has had a year or since an update so my hope is he is happy and healthy, maybe working on other projects.

You did good work, guys; thanks for the diverting tales. [[/u/weirdwhirl]] and Arkinslize
