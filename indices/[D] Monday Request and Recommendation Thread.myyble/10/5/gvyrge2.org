Game of Champions is also a regret.

I don't know why, but The Paragamer really scratches an itch. It's not dead, but the updates are so glatial that I kind of feel it's dead-adjacent.

The writing is a little inconsistent, but the MC acts really intelligently in cases where most MCs would not, and I like the interactions of real life situations, like living in a shelter after a disaster, with the RPG system. I also like the interface munchkinry, like turning up the gamma to see in the dark and using free roam camera to scry.

I also quite enjoy Break Them All, which is not dead only in some notional sense. If the author updates at the current rate, the story will be done sometime around 2070.

I like the magic system, though making the MC a child is kind of weird and pointless.
