The Good Student was really powerful for me, how it mixes narrative and metanarrative to create a really cool dreamlike atmosphere. It feels like tapped into some primal storytelling instinct that made it feel more like a myth or legend than just a story. It's one of the first stories I think of when I try to make the argument that Web Fiction can stand up to the ephemeral 'literary merit' that published books have.

Book 2, seemed to comparatively drop off a cliff. Like somebody trying to make a sequel to an arthouse movie.\\
2002: Space Odyssey Harder.

I'll still wholly recommend the first book, but just suggest people stop there. The first book does wrap things up.
