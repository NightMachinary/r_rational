Science fiction has always run the gamut from hard to soft, and hard scifi doesn't show any signs of going away anytime soon. I could list off a half dozen hard scifi books of the past decade without even trying. Yes, science necessarily constrains what's considered "hard" scifi, and perhaps there will be a point where everything that's theoretically possible to do will be done, but come on, there are all sorts of things that are possible and haven't been done.

It's just that people /like/ fantasy, they like laser swords, reactionless drives, and space opera. And that stuff has always been there, it hasn't gotten any more or less popular that I can see.
