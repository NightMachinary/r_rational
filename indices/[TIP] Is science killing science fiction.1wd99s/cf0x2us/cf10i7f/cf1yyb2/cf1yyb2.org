Most of those are either going to go horribly, story-killingly /wrong/, or be a bunch more boring than scifi authors and fans like to believe, or turn out utopian.

Terraforming is brilliant, though. I always wanted to read something like /Dune/ that covered the planetology angle much more closely.

I think what might be killing science fiction is that by now, hard scifi tropes are /very high impact/ compared to the days of yore in space opera. Space opera just meant space was an ocean and ships sailed the ocean! It gets hard to write a scifi story about people whose basic version of /the human condition/ is just fundamentally different from ours.

EDIT: So the above poster was correct, yeah.
