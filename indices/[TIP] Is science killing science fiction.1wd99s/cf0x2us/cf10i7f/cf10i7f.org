You're missing a whole ton of "possible" sci-fi tropes:

- Human cloning
- Brian uploading
- Genetic engineering
- Spacestations
- Terraforming
- Nanotechnology
- Virtual reality
- Brain alterations (chemical or physical)
- Super-viruses
- Body backups
- Cloaking devices
- Asteroid collisions

And I didn't even mention aliens!
