Lets write a realistic space sci-fi real quick. Considering AI is the only not-impossible Sci-fi trope I can think of, we'll go with that.

Post-AI humans make a one-way cryo trip to a extra-solar planet that long range viewing says could support them. Upon arriving they find a alien race that does not yet have AI levels of tech. Now what? There's no trade between a post-AI society and a pre-AI society, the pre-AI society simply does not have anything to offer the post-AI one. A military conflict is similarly one-sided, the post-AI team wins.

Okay, story two. Post-AI humans arrive and find a post-AI alien race. Now the story is all about how two AIs compete to fill their utility functions. A story with two completely alien minds that are also alien to each other with no human mind to get in the middle is *VERY* hard to write, and to read.

Story 3 is Post-AI aliens show up at earth and you have the same problems as story 1, only this time the humans lose. Not exactly going to be popular fiction among a human audience.

Realistic Sci-Fi is hard. The easy stuff is impossible, and the possible stuff kills story options.
