  Now the story is all about how two AIs compete to fill their utility functions.

Assuming the two species are still around (ie: they got their AI /right/), you might imagine the AIs are hands-off, so you don't have to write a game theory textbook instead of a scifi novel.

  Now what? There's no trade between a post-AI society and a pre-AI society, the pre-AI society simply does not have anything to offer the post-AI one. A military conflict is similarly one-sided, the post-AI team wins.

Diplomancy? Does your future culture have a Prime Directive like Starfleet? Basically, are they forbidden from interfering to help out these poor backwards aliens somehow? Is it /right/ for them to help the poor backwards aliens? I mean, at the tech level you're talking about, if our post-whatever humans desire to just conjure the other species their own AI, overthrow the existing government, cure all the hospital patients, and have a new curriculum sent out to the local equivalent of schools, /they can./ So why is it going to come to a military conflict?
