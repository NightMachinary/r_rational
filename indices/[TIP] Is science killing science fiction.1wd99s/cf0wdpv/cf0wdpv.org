Bleh. I haven't been alive long enough to have experienced these distinct "eras" of sci-fi, so my perspective might just be moot, but I don't agree at all.

Things like /Worm/ show there's plenty of things to be imagined which fit just fine with modern science. I have an Arthur C. Clarke anthology with like 150 stories in it and all of them still make sense even with decades of technology past their writing.

This isn't a case of science killing sci-fi, it's just that the market got tired of the low-hanging fruit. Things like the Internet, with its TvTropes and its Wikipedia and so on and so forth put the pressure back on the authors to outdo their predecessors.

Personal anecdote: I'm working on a novel with a magic system based on manipulating higher-order dimensions. Writing a fight scene which takes place inside of a hypercube is /fun/, and it's something I probably couldn't pull off without the resources available to get the relevant knowledge without taking a degree in Math.

Edit: I [[http://www.reddit.com/r/YAwriters/comments/1wdc0h/xpost_from_rrational_is_science_killing_science/][x-posted this]] to [[/r/yawriters]]. Should get some good responses.
