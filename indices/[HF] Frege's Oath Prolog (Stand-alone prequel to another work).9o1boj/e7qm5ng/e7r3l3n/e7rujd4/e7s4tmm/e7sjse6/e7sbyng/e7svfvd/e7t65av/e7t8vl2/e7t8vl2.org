Right, this didn't make sense. There were two big explanations for why it didn't make sense.

- I was failing to understand some obscure/occult dialect, and it was an intelligible work.

- They were failing to make sense.

I've read a lot of academic and occult stuff that "didn't make sense" at first glance, but was domain specific, or art, or whatever. I looked into their references more in depth to see if they were referencing a large body of pre-existing work that I was unaware of, like is was James Joyce fanfiction or something. A lot of the prominent names/references didn't show up when I searched for them.

This meant that they were probably just not making sense. There was a slight possibility that they were a very... academic type of academic, and english was not their first language. They could have been trying to translate some cultural archetypes from their native tongue, and that's why I couldn't find it. But it was a pretty small possibility. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_salad][word salad]] was a big warning sign in general.

  e.g. the question "Why do people believe in God?" could elicit a response consisting of a series of words commonly associated with religion or prayer but strung together with no regard to language rules.

Schizophrenia and high-context art can look a lot alike from a distance, so the key was distinguishing between the academia/postmodernism/occultism/art cluster and actual schizophrenia.

If you're looking for specific warning size, well the big one was just that it didn't make sense. Generally with the non-schizophrenic academic/whatever stuff, well they want to make you work to understand it but there's a lot more of a common thread throughout. Whereas skimming through their stuff it was a lot more disconnected. It didn't seem like a story told out-of-order, it seemed like a bunch of disconnected scenes. Or scenes that you could only connect if you had hyper-active pattern matching, which is a symptom.

One warning sign was the imagery used.

  It was long ago said by Timaeus that geometry and the elements are connected. Fire, Yaltabaoth saw. He used it to make fiery pyramids. Earth, he used to make a cube.

Basically anything that reads like the revelations was probably written while either high or mentally unwell. When you start talking about eyes within eyes, or a 6 faced beast where each face is a different animal, that's a big warning sign of over-active pattern matching and/or visual hallucinations (did you know that visual hallucinations tend to follow similar patterns in humans?).

Finally, there was the poor ability to predict the future. The youtube-channel linked included a link to a (deleted) kickstarter for a game based on this work. It was clear that they had no objective measure of the how meaningful other people would find it, which implied they had a muddled understanding of what makes something meaningful.
