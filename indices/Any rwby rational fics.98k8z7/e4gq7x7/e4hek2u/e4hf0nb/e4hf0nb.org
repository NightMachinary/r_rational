You're considering the probabilities wrong. I'm saying P(rational|RWBY) is small, you're saying that P(RWBY|rational) is large. Whether or not you're right about people on [[/r/rational]] being RWBY fans, we still can't predict whether RWBY fans are prone to browsing [[/r/rational]]. (Which I have a strong prior against due to habit; not many people in /general/ are prone to browsing [[/r/rational]].)
