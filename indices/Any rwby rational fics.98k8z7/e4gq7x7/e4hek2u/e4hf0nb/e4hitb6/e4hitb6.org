P(rational|Any fandom whatsoever) is small. However, your original point was about probability of liking rwby given liking rational fic, not the other way around. The probability of any randomly selected rwby fan liking rational fic is entirely irrelevant. Rational fic probably has a smaller readership than the entire rwby fanbase. So liking rwby is not even weak evidence that one isn't into rational fic. You're doing the equivalent of saying "people who like apples are less likely to like microwavable sauerkraut." As far as I know almost no one likes microwavable sauerkraut, that's not something particular to apple eaters. The smell is repugnant. Better to get it fresh and cook it some other way.
