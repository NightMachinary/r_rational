Yea but my point was that the whole thing shouldn't have had luck from the beginning and it was introduced, used, and then just discarded without MC doing anything with it. Even if it has a good explanation.

Fanfic.org has a section for "video game plot": [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Video-Game-Plot/105176/]]
