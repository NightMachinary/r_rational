I like a lot the ongoing fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863738/1/Relic-of-the-Future][Relic of the Future]] by Coeur Al'Aran. It feels the most rational of all the fics he has written, and the plot is different from the show, as Jaune goes back in time and encounters younger versions of team RWBY and others.
