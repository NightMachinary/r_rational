Anti-recommendation as a rationalist fic - the main character doesn't pursue his goals so much as go with the flow and follow along with other peoples', the "munchinkry" is just him being given an obviously broken power and doing the bare minimum with it, the lack of enemies at his level that can give him a challenge leads to a constantly, absurdly increasing power level for enemies even past the usual for Gamer fics, and it kind of rambles on for a while before it gets to a point where the plot becomes interesting.

It's nice as a light-novel style power fantasy, and the worldbuilding is decent, but it's not great as a ratfic.
