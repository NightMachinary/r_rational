While it certainly contains rational overtones, it is not without flaws.

Main character sometimes does Sherlock Scans, for example.

Also, " it stirs pretty quickly away from canon" is an understatement. Winter Schnee is a younger sister, for example. There are hierarchies. It is basically an AU at this point. RWBY in name only.

​

I, for one, liked [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11826167/1/The-Name-of-the-Game][The Name of the Game]] by Literalsin much more. (Thanks to [[/u/Random_Cheerio]] for reminding me of it).

​

EDIT: I just reached chapter 36. Be advised, the author likes his unforeshadowed shocking swerves and goes deep into AU territory. I stand by my classification: it is RWBY in name only.
