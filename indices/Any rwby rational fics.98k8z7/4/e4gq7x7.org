RWBY has a bit of a cult following, and a decent sized fanfiction community, but I don't think the type of people who like it are the type to like rational fiction. Add to that the difficulty of figuring out how to mesh whatever ends up being canon in the future into it, when the whole story hasn't been released, means that the process is much harder. Sure, you could make it up yourself, but that would destroy some of the point of writing a fan work, wouldn't it? It's different from Harry Potter or Naruto, while also being different from the other fandoms we have works for here in that it's not quite obscure enough that writing fanfiction for it alone is unique.

So no.
