That makes sense to me, because in a lot of stories, it can be very difficult to explain what's going on to the reader without having the characters talk about incredibly obvious things. To get around this problem, authors use a character who know nothing as an audience surrogate which is Emma in this case. So by explaining things to Emma, the audience can understand what's happening.

An example of a badly done version is in science fiction stories where someone talks about widely known futuristic technology which is odd, because everyone in the setting should already know about it.
