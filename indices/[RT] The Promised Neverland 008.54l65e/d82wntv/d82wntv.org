It's starting to really creep me out the way they do such unsympathetic drawings of Mama's black helper. It's not necessarily a racist thing, but it seems likely given how comparatively flattering the drawings of Mama herself are (unless, as some have speculated, they're setting Mama up to be an unexpected heroine).

Look at [[http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/008/3701/4][page 4]] for example. [[http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/008/3701/19][Page 19]] is also quite extreme, but there she's at least doing something sinister.

They have previously drawn her in a more natural way, but she's the only character that's had these strangely dehumanising moments when she's being villainous. Strange as it sounds, even the demons are drawn with traditional, flattering pespective.
