  even the demons are drawn with traditional, flattering pespective.

I think you're judging the whole thing a bit prematurely. I think the reason she looks unflatteringly is more because of her intentions and motivations. The demons want food, the kids are just a farm to them. The woman is trying to not only kill the children by sending them off to the demons, but also upend mama at the same time. It may not be just because of Japanese perceptions of Black people, but also to show that the helper is evil in more ways than either mama or the demons. It may even be in the way

That said, manga and anime in general haven't done flattering representations of black people for a long time (ever?), so you may be accurate in your perceptions.
