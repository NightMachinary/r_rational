Honestly, even with the AssClass training montage, I seriously doubt that more than a dozen kids will escape, Trio included.

Art took a dip, which is understandable, not every week is a good week. Emma continues to be 'the heart' (and that's being generous, she's slowly becoming just a mhm machine while Norman and Ray get to have chessmaster moments) which is jarring, since the first chapter showed us she's consistently top scoring, just as the guys.

Crone is still creepy and has a punchable face.

Also.. did Mama just casually bug Emma? Fixing her collar my ass.

I do wonder how this will play out. The chances are ridiculously stacked against the kids. Unless Mama makes a heel face turn, I don't know how believable the escape seems.

Side note, TPN is fourth in this weeks Jump, so we're not in danger of losing this gem. It's nice to see some compelling plots in Jumps again.
