Slowdown. If communication between nodes isn't speed-of-light (and that's is a lot to ask of biology, nerve impulses only do about 400m/s), it may take hours or days for a thought to travel across the mind and propagate to every node.

Even if it is speed-of-light, there needs to be some infrastructure or organisation to make sure that information goes where it needs to. The Internet struggles enough with routing, and at least its data packets have a uniquely identified destination. Imagine if a thought had to be addressed to "anyone who knows computational geometry" - how do you organize it so that nodes don't spend most of their time reading and rejecting messages that aren't meant for them?
