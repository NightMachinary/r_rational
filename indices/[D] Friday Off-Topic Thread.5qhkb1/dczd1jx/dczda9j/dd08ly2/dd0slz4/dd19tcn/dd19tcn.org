  If you lose all of your personality, values, and morals and gain theirs, how is that different than you dying and your body being used as a robot?

The whole /point/ of the hive mind is that you /don't/ lose all of that stuff. Instead, the entire mind is a weighted average of all the people comprising it. Of course, if most of those people hold preferences different from your own, you probably don't want to join them in the hive mind. (Of course, then you're probably screwed either way, because there's no real way a single person can compete with something like a hive mind--unless there are multiple competing hive minds? Hmm... now /there/ might be a premise for a story...)
