Well, if in some hypothetical situation I had an opportunity to join hivemind for few years, I would have almost certainly done so. (However, the hivemind of biased humans might coalesce into something truly broken and crazy!)

In my opinion, joining hivemind means that you come into position where you are able to make the most of your abilities. It makes me sad that hivemind in popular culture is usually shown as some sort of absolute evil.
