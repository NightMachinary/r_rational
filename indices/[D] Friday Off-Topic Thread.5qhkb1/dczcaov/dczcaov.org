If you found yourself in an SI story or another universe in which souls exist, what tests\experiments would you try to do to determine how their existense is possible at all and which parts of your worldview need to be changed?

Additionally, since “souls” are given a rather wide variety of meanings by different people, which phenomena behind that word would you think to be logically impossible to exist even if you were directly facing a world where they seemingly did exist? And in this case also, what experiments would you try to do to point out the logical contradictions and find out what is really happening in that universe?
