Conversely, if you were writing such a setting, and you had an audience grounded in materialist thought, how would you hint to the audience the nature of the soul without going on any drawn out expository descriptions. Hints can take the form of events, superpowers, cryptic comments by an unreliable narrator, etc, just so long as you don't outright tell the audience everything.

  which phenomena behind that word would you think to be logically impossible to exist even if you were directly facing a world where they seemingly did exist?

"Epiphenomena". If you have a belief about an epiphenomena it is meaningless or else it is not really an epiphenomena in the first place.

  what tests\experiments would you try to do to determine how their existense is possible at all and which parts of your worldview need to be changed?

To play devils advocate... I don't think we've really absolutely ruled out souls in the real world in the first place. Sure we can say they are highly unlikely given materialist priors and our current scientific knowledge but outright impossible? I don't think, for example, that we have simulated neurons at the molecular level well enough to absolutely rule out that there isn't anything special going on at that level, much less the entire brain. So if the souls connection to the brain is sufficiently subtle under most circumstances, your SI will need better resources and tools than science currently has, or else a way of reliably inducing circumstances were it isn't subtle. And creating those circumstances might start to require actions that would be fitting for a mad scientist, or at the very least exceptionally weird from an outside perspective*.

*IRL I heard a seminar lecture about epigenetics where the researcher had a depression model in mice and to test if it was from nurture or other factors (the mice were inbred to be genetically identical, but DNA methylation is apparently inheritable) that the mice passed on the depression vulnerability/resistance, ended up artificially inseminating the female mice and then having them have sex with a sterilized male mice to isolate the variables properly.
