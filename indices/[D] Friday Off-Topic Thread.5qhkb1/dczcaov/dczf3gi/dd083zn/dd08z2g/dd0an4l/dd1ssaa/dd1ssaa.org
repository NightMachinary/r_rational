  If this seems impossible... well, that's because it is: no such command exists and no such command ever could.

Your argument isn't as strong as you suppose it. The mathematical model of a computer built on logic gates is defined in terms of small fundamental units, such as bits and gates, but we know that to be so because that is how we formally defined it to be.

This analogy is known to break down in at least two ways. The first is that mathematical models do not correspond to physical reality; the actions a computer can execute are distinct from its mathematical model by the vagaries of its implementation. This reduces it to a physical model which is, as far as we can observe, far more complicated than basic logic gates.

Secondly, there is no rule against having mathematical models which include complex fundamental actions. Oracle machines are one good example. These can implement arbitrarily complex, uncomputable actions that are explicitly not decomposable.

One flaw in your thinking largely arises from the confusion of fundamental behaviours with simple behaviours, which turns the argument into a thinly veiled circular one. In essence you seem to suppose that because each fundamental truth is self-descriptive, they must all be equally self descriptive. This need not be true, as an oracle machine demonstrates.

That said, I highly doubt we are in a world where a process as complex as conscious thought is fundamental; the possibility seems ruled out by sheer statistical implausibility.
