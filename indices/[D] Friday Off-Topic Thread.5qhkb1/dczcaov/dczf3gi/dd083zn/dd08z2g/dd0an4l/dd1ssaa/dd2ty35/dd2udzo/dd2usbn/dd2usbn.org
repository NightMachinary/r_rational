    There is no such thing as an object that both (a) exhibits highly complicated behavior, and (b) is not "made of" simpler components.
  #+end_quote

  This is not true. For example, chaotic systems exhibit highly complex behaviour yet are descriptively simple.

I think you're misinterpreting my original statement (which is understandable, since I wasn't very clear when making that statement). Basically, what I was trying to say is that there is no such thing as a complicated object whose behavior cannot be described /in terms/ of simpler components. This statement (which is what I was originally intending) /does/ in fact apply to chaotic systems.

  Similarly, there is no intrinsic reason I know of that consciousness couldn't be /descriptively simple/, yet directly produce complex behaviours.
#+end_quote

Well, I mean, if we had a simple description of consciousness, the Hard Problem of Consciousness would already be solved. (Actually, I'm beginning to suspect that you and I have no real disagreement here, and that any appearance of disagreement is simply a difference in terminology.)
