  You've already jumped the gun :P. Komolgorov complexity isn't a well-defined property on its own, since it depends on the choice of a language.

  So, then, what language are you using? How are you mapping from computations in that language to statements about or descriptions of your mathematical objects? I feel this step is one of the most important ones you need to make, yet you've skipped it entirely.
#+end_quote

Any universal language will do. Because the overhead caused by using one language versus another is a fixed constant, this means that as you go down the list the effect of this overhead will be dominated by the increasing complexity of the objects you're describing. In other words, your choice of language will only ever affect the ordering of your list slightly, and even then only near the beginning of the list. The overall thrust of the argument, however, remains intact no matter what language you choose.

  I'm fairly sure this isn't a well defined thing. First of all, there are (far) more mathematical objects than there are programs (the later is a countable set, after all).
#+end_quote

Now, this, on the other hand, is a legitimate problem you caught, mainly due to imprecise wording on my part. So, in the spirit of my earlier reply to you, let me amend my statement from "the set of all possible mathematical objects" to "the set of all /describable/ mathematical objects" (where "describable" simply means "capable of being uniquely specified by a finite string of characters in a language with a finite number of symbols").

#+begin_quote
  Even if ignoring these problems, that doesn't immediately help with your argument because it makes no claim on how large the finite set of universal objects can be. Unless you consider consciousness to be unboundedly complex, and it seems you do not, consciousness could still be in the set of universal objects without violating any of your assumptions.
#+end_quote

Well, no. Consciousness, as always, is capable of making any argument murky--and this one is no exception. Of course I have no formal proof that consciousness is a "non-universal" object. (If I did, I'm pretty sure I'd have solved the Hard Problem of Consciousness already. :P) However, intuitively speaking, I'd be extremely shocked if it turned out that it's impossible to express consciousness in terms of simpler processes; it just doesn't /feel/ to me like something that could be universal--not in the same way that logic gates feel universal.

(Great discussion, by the way; I'm having a lot of fun with this.)
