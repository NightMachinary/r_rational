  Any universal language will do.

I'm not so much interested in the choice of computational model as I'm interested in how you're using said computational model to describe mathematical objects. The language in the translation, in effect. This model hides a lot about what complexity /is/.

The same question follows on to your comment on "the set of all describable mathematical objects", which is a meaningless set until you give me a language that can describe mathematical objects.

  Of course I have no formal proof that consciousness is a "non-universal" object.

If anything this is the distinction I was trying to make when I said it was ruled out by statistical implausibility rather than strict logical deduction. The most obvious one is that there needs to be evolutionary pressure to evolve conscious thought, and evolution works on gradients.

(I'll retort your parenthetical with a +1 of my own. Apologies that I seem to be making you do the legwork of the conversation :P.)
