Right, I was replying to the part asking what would be meaningless or absurd even given the existence of souls when I mentioned epiphenomena. I agree that it could be "true" but even if it was, by its very definition, it wouldn't be relevant, as you mentioned by its failure to solve the problem of consciousness.

That said:

  There is no such thing as an object that both (a) exhibits highly complicated behavior, and (b) is not "made of" simpler components. As such, even if it turned out that non-physical souls /did/ exist and had some sort of measurable impact on the real world, those souls would /by necessity/ have to consist of smaller, non-conscious components.

It is true that every phenomena observed by science has so far been, in principle reducible to smaller, non-conscious components. That said, is there really any fundamental rule of logic that says this has to be true? It is incredibly unlikely, given everything mankind has observed and experienced, but is it impossible? And even if they "soul" was reducible to non-conscious simpler components, if those component, were say, an order of magnitude or two more complicated than the current known laws of physics, it would still be effectively the same situation to modern science. Figuring out the brain and mind in the real world is already hard enough, and the brain runs on physics and chemistry that we in principle understand.

Thanks for this conversation, it has given me some good ideas for a CYOA adventure series I am working on.
