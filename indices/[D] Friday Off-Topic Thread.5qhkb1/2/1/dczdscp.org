Depending on how the hive mind is distributed and how much it subsumes people, Homogenization of ideas leads to less creativity. At one possible extreme, the hive mind is no more creative than a single individual person. More moderately, perhaps the hive mind society has a tendency to fall into group think easily. To avoid this maybe individuals have the capacity to temporarily reduce their connection strength so they can think of new ideas.

A more interesting idea, particularly if the hive mind is organized to catch creative thoughts and maximize them: a single insane component of the hive mind have the potential to pollute the rest of the hive mind. Like imagine if everyone could share the perspective of a paranoid schizophrenic. Sure everyone else should know better, but the insane perspective is absolutely convincing.
