That approach or something like it is the most sensible. However, it also creates single points of failure, which mitigates some of the advantages of a hivemind. If too many supernodes die at once, the rest of the hivemind is left in disarray until it can make or train some new ones.

Having backups will help. But against an intelligent enemy, who can spot nodes that are sending and receiving a lot of data and knows to target them, it won't do much good.
