I think you found the clearest disadvantage of the hive mind. It seems that upon expanding, hive mind will either process things slower or split into multiple separate hive minds.

Both outcomes bear severe negative consequences and thus hive mind will most likely concentrate its members on the smallest possible territory to reduce communication problems. (At least, this seems like a reasonable course of action. I am not a hive mind to know for sure!)

  Imagine if a thought had to be addressed to "anyone who knows computational geometry" - how do you organize it so that nodes don't spend most of their time reading and rejecting messages that aren't meant for them?

Maybe keep 'supernodes' that have vast amounts of relevant information about all the other nodes? Since there is no privacy in the hive mind, such tables may be very detailed. When the hive mind grows, 'metanodes' are introduced. Metanodes keep statistical information about groups observed by each supernode. I guess this scheme still creates a lot of unnecessary data packages.
