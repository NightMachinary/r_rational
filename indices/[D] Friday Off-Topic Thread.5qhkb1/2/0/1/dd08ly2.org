I'm not completely convinced that a hive mind isn't just a really huge single mind. Once you become a cog in a larger cognitive entity, I feel that you (and everyone else comprising that entity) just /are/ that entity, as if your mind was simply merged with everyone else's. Given this, I'm not sure if "you" and "the rest of the hive mind" is a distinction worth making, any more than "your frontal cortex" is worth distinguishing from the rest of your brain.
