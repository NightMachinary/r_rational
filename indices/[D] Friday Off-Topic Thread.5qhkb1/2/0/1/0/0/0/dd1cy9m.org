I can see it going one of two ways, partly depending on the actual mechanics of how the hive-mind operates. Either its values and decisions are based on an average of every single mind contained in it, or whenever it acquires a new mind it decides if that mind aligns with its own values enough to keep or is too different and unnecessary so it only uses it for processing power and menial labor.

If there's a hivemind that believes in living peacefully and coexisting with non-hiveminders and it gets a willing recruit who wants to conquer the world and force everyone to join, does it average its values with his? Does it take over 0.1% of the world because of his desires? Does it take a vote and decide not to conquer the world because he's outnumbered? If there are 49 conquerers and 50 peace-wanters and then 2 more conquerers join does it suddenly switch tracks and start trying to take over the world?

Does a peaceloving hivemind willing accept conquerers knowing that this will cause it to change its entire goal structure? Does a conquering hivemind willingly accept peacelovers?

I find it quite likely that a hivemind wouldn't want to integrate the minds of every single human it encounters. I find it also likely that rather than refuse to let them join, it would simply pretend it wanted them and then mindwipe them or alter them in some way such that they agree with whatever the hivemind wants them to (assuming such an action were possible)
