In [[http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Origin][Origin]], the jointly managed roleplay setting within a setting that my EVE corporation has created in our home solar system, they have a group of people called [[http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=People_of_Origin#The_Posthumans][Networkers]] who have plugged their minds into each other. The story limit for the number of humans that can join one of these Networks is equal to Dunbar's Number, so there are lots of different Networks of varying sizes in competition with each other, and if you want to join a Network, you'd shop around and pick one that lies the closest to your set of values to join, or even create your own and try to get people to join it who are similar to you in thinking.
