Once you join a hivemind, in a sense you no longer even exist. At the very least your identity has been swamped by the horde of minds, no more than a drop in the ocean.

It's basically death, unless there's a way to extract the information that constitutes "you". That would be non-trivial, like trying to recover a single fragment of the initial state out of billions, after that state has been iterated countless times. The best you're likely to get is "save a copy of me before I join the hivemind, return that copy when I am ejected".

As for deciding when to leave, you don't meaningfully have any free will as part of the hive mind, since "you" no longer exists as a distinct entity. If a hivemind wanted to permit people to leave at will, the best method would be similar to the above; save a copy, periodically query it to see whether it would leave given the current situation".

If you can't save copies of identities, or can't simulate them, or can't return them to their bodies, then a hivemind has no exit plan that I can see.
