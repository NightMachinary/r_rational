Well, I imagined it as an offer that has been already going for several decades and we have people that returned from the experience and function normally outside of hive mind.

But the problem still stays, it seems. The hive mind overwrites the personality of 'trial user', afterwards they seemingly function as a normal individual, while recommending the 'hive mind experience' to their relatives and friends.
