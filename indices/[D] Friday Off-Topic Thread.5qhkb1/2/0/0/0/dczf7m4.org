The thing is, once you're in, how do you get out? You'll be bound to the hive mind, and the hive mind wouldn't willingly give up a part of itself for no good reason. It's like the logical extreme of a cult, except you can't even /think/ you want to leave. One decision or event, and you're stuck until your body breaks down--your mind, after all, will have been overwritten long before.
