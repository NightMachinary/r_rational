I think it becomes just a problem of definitions by that point. If the individuality of the members isn't being suppressed, then the hivemind and the telepathic individuals are not mutually exclusive any more. People could be calling groups of people connected through telepathy (or some other means) a hivemind as they are calling a group of crows a murder, or a neighbouring group of cells an organism.

Or, for that matter, as they are calling a group of people a nation\country\etc. In fact, the existence of such hiveminds would likely introduce a new dimension to the political landscape: many people would be both citizens of some countries and members of some hiveminds.

Of course in-universe, if the word “hivemind” had some negative connotations then I can see members of a “free-hivemind”, if you will, trying to distinguish their structure by avoiding calling themselves that.
