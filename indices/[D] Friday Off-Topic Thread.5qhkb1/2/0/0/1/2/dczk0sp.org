Thank you for your recommendations. Good science fiction is always welcome in my worldview.

As for multiple personalities, I guess it still would be necessary to merge them somehow, otherwise the decision making process would be very slow (Probably. Might still be faster than some of committees on our planet!). With your ideas, now I see hivemind as much more complex hierarchical structure, where hivemind is divided into several personalities that divide into subpersonalities, sub-subpersonalities and so on.
