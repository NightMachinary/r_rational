Yes, there aren't many stories with well thought-out hiveminds that aren't evil, sadly.

All I can recommend is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Lya][/A Song for Lya/,]] [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963-the-ender-quintet][/the Ender's Saga,/]] and the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future][/Doc Future trilogy/]] --- and even then only the first one has hiveminds in the centre of the story. Both Wikipedia and TVTropes have lists collecting such stories ([[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/HiveMind/PlayedStraight][1,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalFusion][2,]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_mind_(science_fiction)][3),]] but in the overwhelming majority of such stories the hive mind is just used as a plot device, and often depicted in a ridiculously lazy and flanderized fashion even then.

Regarding the original question, I think it would depend on the exact nature of hiveminds in the given universe. We're thinking about them from a human's perspective, so we are projecting the human assumptions about psychology onto something that is inherently not a regular human mind.

For instance, while multiple personalities are regarded as a disorder by human psychology, they shouldn't necessarily be seen as something bad by a hivemind as well.

So depending on the hivemind, when a new brain is joining them the individuality inside it can be wiped out to just leave the brain as an additional part of the mega-brain network, or that individuality can be preserved and cherished as something giving a valuable new perspective to the group-mind as a whole.
