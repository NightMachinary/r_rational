I respect EY and his opinions on certain things, but I think the political season has broken him, like it broke Scott Aaronson.

The biggest thing you need to take out of this first week is that he is in fact working off of precedent. If it's not an atrocity for President Obama to abuse the executive order, I see no reason to be suddenly alarmed that President Trump is doing it as well. And every president since FDR has had an active first hundred days. The fact that Trump is trying his damnedest to /actually/ build a wall and make the Mexicans pay for it at least tells me he's more honest about his campaign promises than the last couple of Presidents. Whether any of it actually pans out is not up to us to tell.

I'm not so sure that his election is the end of the world. At worst, it might have sped up our path towards tyranny, but the result of another Clinton presidency would have been a guaranteed slow trot to the same place. This way, at least I get to criticize the President without getting compared to the Birthers.
