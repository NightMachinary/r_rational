As it stands, it's one of the few things I very blatantly disagree with Trump on, policy wise. Everything else has been pretty mild. (I'm enthusiastic about the TPP, though) While the immigration ban was a poorly thought out [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states][disaster of an order]], it was at least a /cheap/ disaster of an order. And the Wall is looking to be less expensive than the ACA in my area, so who knows.

Things I learned today that are more in favor of your side of the debate: apparently Obama's [[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1712.pdf][first executive]] order in office was an order that restricted the capabilities of the executive orders, or at least introduced more safeguards. And his [[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-27/pdf/E9-1893.pdf][fourth]] was one in relation to Guantanamo, which I find amusing because it starts out by defining the Geneva Convention.

Counterpoint: while Trump has nothing on Guantanamo, he appeared to [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/28/executive-order-ethics-commitments-executive-branch-appointees][one-up]] Obama's [[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2009-01-26/pdf/E9-1719.pdf][executive order]] concerning the ethics of the executive branch. Counter-counterpoint: He's issued some /interesting/ orders like [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/24/executive-order-expediting-environmental-reviews-and-approvals-high][this one]] on environmental review of government projects, which initially feels to me like it's about the DAPL, but I /remember/ that being resolved sometime before Trump took office. It could just be my memory weirding out on me.

EDIT: Also, thank you for pointing out that there are statistics on executive orders instead of just letting me spit on myself for a while longer. This is good ammunition for both sides, and makes for an interesting metric of Presidential interference vs. notoriety. Did you know how many executive orders Calvin Cooldige signed? I wasn't even sure he was a President until today...
