  The fact that Trump is trying his damnedest to actually build a wall and make the Mexicans pay for it at least tells me he's more honest about his campaign promises than the last couple of Presidents.

No, it doesn't? Most politicians do try to address issues their campaign agenda was based on; Trump's claim that everyone else is as much of a liar and demagogue as he is ridiculous. It's just that most of those issues are not as obviously ridiculous as the wall, and so them falling through seems like the politician not trying, rather than the task being hard.
