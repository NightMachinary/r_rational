The attempt to create a fascist dictatorship out of the US presidential system.

  what kinds of things should I actually be worried about from the Trump administration?
#+end_quote

Dictatorship, civil war, world war, ethnic cleansing, and quite possibly (if they actually let Trump use nukes) the end of the world. The saying that's been going around is, "When someone shows you who they are, believe them." This applies to Trump, but it applies doubly to Stephen Bannon, who is trying to create a clash of civilizations between Christian-dominionist capitalism and the entire Muslim world.
