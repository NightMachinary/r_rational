  So now I have to ask, what kinds of things are people actually expecting from the Trump administration and are they actually reasonable?

The main worry is that no one knows what to expect. That hasn't really changed. You now have a president that [[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/25/donald-trump-is-making-major-policy-pronouncements-based-on-what-he-sees-on-tv/?utm_term=.a17c91f98cf6][sources his information from Fox News]], who has no experience making important decisions or working within a bureaucracy, and is making really scary noises regarding foreign relations and journalism in public.

It's still unlikely that he will have life-changing impact; but there are more paths to America becoming a heavily policed autocracy today than there were a year ago. The mexico wall thing not going through might give him enough support for heavy identity policing, for example. Gotta get those 'illegals' out and stop them from voting, right?
