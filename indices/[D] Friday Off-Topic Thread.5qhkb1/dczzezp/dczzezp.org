[[https://twitter.com/Stl_Manifest][Stl_Manifest]] is tweeting very short obituaries of Jews who were [[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267][denied entry to the US in 1939]] and, after being sent back to Europe, eventually died in german extermination camps.

Short of the visits I've made to the camps themselves, this is probably the most striking reminder of the Holocaust I've seen. Actually knowing their names makes a huge difference to the emotional impact; each tweet feels important, and the seemingly unending stream overwhelms.

Just... don't look at replies to their tweets.
