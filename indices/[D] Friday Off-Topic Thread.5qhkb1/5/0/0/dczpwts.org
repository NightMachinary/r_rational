One plausible benefit that I think most people don't mention:

Trying to abstain is an excellent way to see /just how quickly/ your mind starts to create rationalizations for certain behavior.

You get a really quick crash course into what it feels like to precommit, decision instability, and time-inconsistent preferences.

Because of trying this out several times, I think it's given me a lot of personal insight into how my brain tries to rationalize things, as well as what credible commitments might require.

EX: I'm now much more skeptical of willpower and believe that "shaping the path" and things of that nature are far more effective for combating temptations.
