I tried it a while ago and enjoyed the results---even now I tend to avoid "it." I definitely avoid the sub though, since their claims range from "plausible" to "optimistic" to "wishful thinking" to "cultish attribution of holy power to semen."

That being said, I can't imagine that exercising one's discipline and practicing delayed gratification would have /negative/ effects. So I don't think there's any downside to trying it. I might do it again.
