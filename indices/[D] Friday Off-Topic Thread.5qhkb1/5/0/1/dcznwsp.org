I've seen a number of studies over the years that correlate beneficial health effects with, ah, periodically cleaning the piping, so to speak. One where I'm fairly confident of the recollection was a 40% reduced rate of prostate cancer among men who purged the plumbing 5+ times per week, though I can't remember if that was just in comparison to 4-, or some lower bound.
