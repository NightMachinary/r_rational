People self-report a lot of things on the subreddit. I'm fairly skeptical of those, though.

My general goal is to decouple associations my brain has with online stimuli. I've also had a mental "ugh" to this sort of thing, and I suspect my preference preferences have something for this.

So it also just feels good to finally act on those.
