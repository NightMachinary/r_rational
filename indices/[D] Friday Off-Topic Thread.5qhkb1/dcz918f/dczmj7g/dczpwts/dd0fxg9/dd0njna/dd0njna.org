Yeah, sure.

I actually thought I had a write-up done somewhere because this is comes up in lots of places.

But the quickest approximation is probably Malcolm Ocean's post [[http://malcolmocean.com/2016/06/you-flow-downhill/][here]].

In short, I don't think of myself as a disembodied soul with free will settled inside of a human body. Rather, I think of myself as a scattered collection of wants that are loosely held together.

This also means that when I want to precommit to something, I act /very cautiously/. If my goal is avoid eating chips, I will go out of my way to remove any chance of my meeting chips at the /earliest point of intervention/.

That is, it makes no sense to buy chips and tell myself that I'll just "use willpower and avoid eating them" when they're lying on my kitchen table.

It makes far more sense to avoid certain grocery aisles entirely (or just order groceries online) so I don't need to even be tempted by buying chips.

Related to this, I guess, is my lack of faith in my "internal ability" to remember stuff or do just about anything.

Instead, I obsessively write things down, email myself reminders, etc. My general heuristic here is "act like you would if you were highly fallible to bias and had the memory span of a goldfish."

And humans are generally quite susceptible to bias, so I think it's silly to pretend otherwise by believing in our own power. We're not that great...yet.

So in the meantime, I'm focused on figuring out how to remove hard decisions before I need to face them (that's "shaping the path") as well as just generally reminding (and acting!) like I'm a fallacy-ridden sack of flesh.
