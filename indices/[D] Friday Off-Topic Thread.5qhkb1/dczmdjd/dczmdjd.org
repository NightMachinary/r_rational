I have been watching A Series of Unfortunate Events despite not being a fan of the books and also having major plot points spoiled for me. I'm not sure how I feel about it. I didn't like the stupid story at first, then the offbeat humor kind of grew on me, then I started getting annoyed by the child acting and subpar production values.

I probably shouldn't like it since the comedic moments don't always make me laugh while I'm not very invested in the serious moments, but for some reason I keep watching even though I'm not even sure whether the story's claim to be dark and depressing is ironic or not. What do you think?
