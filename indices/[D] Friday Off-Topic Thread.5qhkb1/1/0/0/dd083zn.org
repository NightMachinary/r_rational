  "Epiphenomena". If you have a belief about an epiphenomena it is meaningless or else it is not really an epiphenomena in the first place.

Despite being almost certainly false, epiphenomenalism as an idea is in fact logically consistent (e.g. it's possible to write a computer simulation of a universe in which there's a secondary "layer" of reality that can be affected by the primary layer while being unable to affect it in return). What /is/ logically impossible is the idea that "qualia" (or whatever you want to call those sensations that we as conscious beings experience) are ontologically fundamental. This is logically impossible because sensations are /complex/, and for an ontologically fundamental object to be complex is a contradiction in terms. There is no such thing as an object that both (a) exhibits highly complicated behavior, and (b) is not "made of" simpler components. As such, even if it turned out that non-physical souls /did/ exist and had some sort of measurable impact on the real world, those souls would /by necessity/ have to consist of smaller, non-conscious components.

*P.S.* This, incidentally, is why epiphenomenal theories of consciousness (apart from being extremely implausible on priors) /don't actually solve the Hard Problem of Consciousness/--all they do is kick the problem a level back, onto a layer of reality that is inaccessible via any physical means. The actual /workings/ of consciousness, however--how and why we experience sensation, what sort of processes might result in such a thing--[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/][are left completely untouched by such "explanations"]].
