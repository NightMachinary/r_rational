  Complicated objects /cannot/ be fundamental, because it is always possible to represent the behavior of such an object using a simpler description.

Good point! Of course there is no rule saying the mathematically "simpler" description has to be the most intuitive for humans to think of. Indeed, I think physics has already gotten past that point. For the purposes of world building the mathematical description may be entirely unreachable to the characters in-universe.

And actually.., thinking about your point some more. "Complicated" is a relative term. Are quantum mechanics and relativity more or less clear complicated than maxwells equations and Newtonian mechanics? Even the most fundamental rules can still be messy and complicated relative to human understanding.
