Remember what you said at first.

#+begin_quote
  There is no such thing as an object that both (a) exhibits highly complicated behavior, and (b) is not "made of" simpler components.
#+end_quote

This is not true. For example, chaotic systems exhibit highly complex behaviour yet are descriptively simple. Similarly, there is no intrinsic reason I know of that consciousness couldn't be /descriptively/ simple, yet directly produce complex behaviours.

That said, I also disagree with your assertion that fundamental laws must be descriptively simple. Your analogy of me going to you and saying

#+begin_quote
  "Let's talk about this arbitrary mathematical object that does a bunch of things in an extremely complicated manner which I can't describe to you because there's no computable description,"
#+end_quote

is painfully reminiscent of trying to talk about qualia, where the overriding concern is that nobody really knows what it is or how to describe it.
