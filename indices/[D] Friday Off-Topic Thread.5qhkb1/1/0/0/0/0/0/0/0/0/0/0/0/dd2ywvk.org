  Suppose we order the set in terms of Komolgorov complexity
#+end_quote

You've already jumped the gun :P. Komolgorov complexity isn't a well-defined property on its own, since it depends on the choice of a language.

So, then, what language are you using? How are you mapping from computations in that language to statements about or descriptions of your mathematical objects? I feel this step is one of the most important ones you need to make, yet you've skipped it entirely.

#+begin_quote
  Okay, so, let's consider the set of all possible mathematical objects.
#+end_quote

I'm fairly sure this isn't a well defined thing. First of all, there are (far) more mathematical objects than there are programs (the later is a countable set, after all). Second, this doesn't jive with #2, since there are unboundedly many fundamental axioms that one could posit, given the lack of restrictions on axioms.

Even if ignoring these problems, that doesn't immediately help with your argument because it makes no claim on how large the finite set of universal objects can be. Unless you consider consciousness to be unboundedly complex, and it seems you do not, consciousness could still be in the set of universal objects without violating any of your assumptions.
