I was about to do that myself, haha. Okay, so, let's consider the set of all possible mathematical objects. Suppose we order the set in terms of Komolgorov complexity, so that objects with lower complexity appear closer to the beginning. In that case, I make two claims about this set:

1. There exist certain objects that are "universal", in the sense that for any non-universal object there exists a configuration of universal objects which behaves identically to that object.
2. There are only finitely many universal objects.

This second claim is the most important. What it implies is that somewhere in our list of mathematical objects ordered by complexity, there is a /last/ universal object, past which everything is non-universal. This in turn means there is something of a "complexity threshold" in our list. There might be non-universal objects /before/ this threshold, but if an object falls /past/ the threshold you can instantly say--without even looking at it--that it's non-universal.

Okay, those are my claims. Here's how they connect to my previous statements:

I consider universal objects to be "ontologically fundamental", and non-universal objects to be... well, not. Whenever I talked about something being "fundamental" in my previous comments, this is the property I actually had in mind. Moreover, any objects that fall past the complexity threshold defined by the last universal object in the list are "complicated", and therefore automatically non-fundamental.

At this point I should note that when I was first typing up my original comments, none of this was explicit in my mind; I came up with this just now in an attempt to capture the (vague) intuition that was originally powering my argument. However, I do feel that the explanation given here is an accurate representation of what I was thinking at the time. Hope this helps.
