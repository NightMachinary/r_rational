I like that interpretation, but if that's the case then the writing is weirdly meta about it. Snicket's presentation of the story has the same odd quirks as the story, as if the fact the joke is being told is part of the joke. I don't know if that makes it better is just an excuse for when the writing is genuinely unsatisfying. Anyway, I'm having some fun.
