Pretty sure it's intentionally ironic. The narrator is somewhat unreliable, being a Noir Detective parody himself, and the story is one where most of the adults are too stupid to breathe because that's the genre (or perhaps the genre being parodied). The story isn't meant to actually depress the listener, being too wacky and full of problem solving for that to be the case.

Much of the material about grammar, the correct definitions of words, and so on fits my idea of rationalist fiction as "intelligent person wish fulfillment", in that we get to see cool authority figures go on and on about pet peeves like "it's/its" or "figuratively/literally" like they are actually important.
