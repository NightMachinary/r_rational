I don't think it's that the kids are bad characters, it's that the actors playing them aren't very good. The way the deliver their lines makes them come across as more bland than they should, so I don't really care about what happens to them when it's supposed to taken seriously. Except for the baby, though. Her facial expressions have been on point in every scene and her snarky commentary has consistently made me chuckle.
