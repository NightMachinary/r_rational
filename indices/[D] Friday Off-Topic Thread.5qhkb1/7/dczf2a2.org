An infernal nuisance:\\
- A person greets you while walking past you on the sidewalk (or past your cubicle or desk).\\
- The person didn't stop walking, and now has passed you, so you must awkwardly turn around (or talk to the wall of your cubicle) in order to reciprocate (which you /already/ didn't want to do).

The "Your Memories" feature is very nice for rediscovering cool things that you said in the distant past.
