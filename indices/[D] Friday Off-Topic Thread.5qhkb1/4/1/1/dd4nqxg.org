  If it's not an atrocity for President Obama to abuse the executive order

People need to stop repeating conservative +propaganda+ talking points without doing their own research.

I personally don't think people can objectively look at Trump's campaign and first weeks of presidency as anything remotely like those in recent history. Sure, if you look at all of American history, there's some other crazy stuff, but if you have to go back to the pre-radio days to find this much craziness in a presidential election, that probably says something in itself.

Overall I'd say that normalizing him is far more dangerous than all but the most extreme alternatives (I don't think he's going to start WW3: I do think he's going to weaken a number of important geopolitical ties that will make WW3 more likely).
