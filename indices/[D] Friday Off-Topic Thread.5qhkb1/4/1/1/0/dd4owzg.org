I will agree with you that it does not bode well when Trump signs [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/executive-orders][/seven/ in his first week.]] But Obama went for 39 in his first year, and the number of executive orders per year seem to decline steadily afterwards. If he exceeds that number I won't be shocked, but I would be surprised if he exceeds Clinton or Bush's first years.

Also: Trump signed seven executive orders by January 30th. Obama signed [[https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/2009-obama.html][eight]].
