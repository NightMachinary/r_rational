  I think Trump is going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it. Whether that payment is direct or indirect seems up in the air right now.

I'm pretty sure the American taxpayer will pay for it.

Trump is asking Congress for the money, so in the immediate future we /are/, without a doubt, going to pay for it.

Mexico is not going to cough up a giant tribute so Trump will place a massive tariff on goods coming from / manufactured in Mexico. Companies that were buying from / manufacturing in Mexico were doing it because it was the best balance of efficient/inexpensive for them. When that changes they'll move to other sources which will, by definition, increase their costs. The companies will pass these new costs on to us in the form of raised prices.

Mexican manufacturers will no longer be making as much by selling to us, so they'll start selling to others as much as possible. This will reduce the income from those massive tariffs, and lower supply of those goods in the American market will drive up prices.

It's coming from us in the short term and it will come from us in the long term as well.
