So EY recently posted the following:

"What non-US bank is most likely to refuse to give your money to a US authority trying to seize it, if something goes very wrong under Trump and you have to become a refuge? Besides Bitcoin. We are not concerned with tax evasion; we're fine with this bank honestly reporting everything to the IRS. It's likewise good if this is a reputable bank that doesn't raise eyebrows when you properly file the IRS form to report a foreign account. We just want this bank to not give the IRS or Justice Department all your money without you having authorized the transfer; likewise not freezing it because a US authority claims you're a "terrorist". (The bank also needs to be able to authenticate your identity even if your passport has been revoked.)"

So now I have to ask, what kinds of things are people actually expecting from the Trump administration and are they actually reasonable? This particular post seems to be at odds with slatestarcodex's post in which he admonished people for worrying about Trump for the wrong reasons:

What's actually going on here and what kinds of things should I actually be worried about from the Trump administration?
