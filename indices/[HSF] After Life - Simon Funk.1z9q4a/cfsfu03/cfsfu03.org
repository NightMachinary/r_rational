Reading now.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 1
#+end_quote

That prank would not have worked if you'd just chosen a "trust me" password in advance. Stupid.

-Man, this really wants to be a movie.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 2
#+end_quote

Wait, apparently this is our setting now? Okay? Okay.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 3
#+end_quote

They didn't. They did not. Oh come on. (I might be slightly skipping through this.)

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 5
#+end_quote

They realize this is rape, right. They do, right.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 6
#+end_quote

No wonder he doesn't realize the answer. The answer is insane. (Or practical, depending on how it works.) But he should have at least thought of it.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 7
#+end_quote

OH NOW he thinks of it. Late, champ.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 9
#+end_quote

Promising title, at least. Maybe we can get some sense back into this story.

Why would you use /physics/ for that?!

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 10
#+end_quote

Finally some answers here.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 11
#+end_quote

Where the fuck is /here/?! Please tell me this is not the afterlife bugging out. (The name of the story worries me in that regard.)

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 12
#+end_quote

A house. Okay.

Oooohoo. Clever monkey.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 13
#+end_quote

It's somehow adorably catlike.

[note] I still have absolutely no idea where this is going.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 14
#+end_quote

I'm way more comfortable with this setting. At least I understand what's going on.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 15
#+end_quote

And I'm confused again.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 16
#+end_quote

Name-drop Alcor. Nice.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 17
#+end_quote

Oh What. What. Also Catlike Robothing is just the dorbest.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 18
#+end_quote

This is the most clear description of Patternism that I have ever seen.

-God module. Snort.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 19
#+end_quote

This is the first chapter that I have to scientifically disagree with. There's a bit more variation to it than that, you know. (Lord, deliver us from the Evopsych just-so stories...)

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 20
#+end_quote

Well, this seems unfriendly. They're surprisingly hands-off, considering.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 21
#+end_quote

This is the most utilitarian definition of love I have ever seen.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 22
#+end_quote

This really reminds me of Bioshock Infinite.

Up to

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 24
#+end_quote

and you still haven't explained what that place is. Better hurry up.

.... Okay. Okay, what.

WHY WOULD YOU NOT USE A SIMULATION.

#+begin_quote
  Chapter 25. "Closure"
#+end_quote

WELL NAMED YOU FUCKS. Man, what a hook. Can't fault you though.

Okay.

In summary.

/Nice/.

Niiiice.

Kind of a UFAI story, of course. Not very ethical. Not very CEV. Kind of genocide. I can't fault th-- wait, yes, they're humans, I can totally fault them. Can't fault the realism of it though. I like to tell myself I wouldn't do this, but we all know how malleable humans are under power.

So.

Cool future. Let's hope it never comes to pass.
