True statement, but the problem is that I simply don't have any significant degree of belief that video games, cute babies, candy bars, or anything else will wipe out the human race by being /too fun to handle/. Hell, the vast majority of video games, babies, and candy bars don't even damage the lives of their "users", and addictive "superstimuli" often affect only people with some predisposed vulnerability to addiction.

And I hate to say this, but the very fact that those with a predisposition to life-crippling addictions wipe themselves out before reproducing... yeah. It's a selection pressure. Over time, the human species is probably getting less vulnerable to addiction precisely because addiction sufferers reproduce at significantly lower rates. Cold but true.

So, uh, yeah. If someone wants me to believe in the genocidal dangers of "superstimulus" (a term which could use a more precise scientific definition, since I tend to regard evo-psych as a suspicious semi-science), they're going to need to show me a significant amount of /very good/ evidence that I have yet to see.

Until then, I will continue enjoying fun and exercising moderation just like most of the rest of the species.
