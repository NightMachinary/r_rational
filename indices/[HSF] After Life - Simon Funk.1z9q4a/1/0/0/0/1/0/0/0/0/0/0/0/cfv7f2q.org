  I think it's pretty normal for humans to value humans

Sure but I'm also a guy that doesn't mean I value guys more than girls.

There's no reason I should value humans over other sentient beings.

You're not exactly rationally explaining this either.

Depends on your definition of monstrous, considering most of the humans switched to avatar bodies and also took the upgrades can't be that bad. Seems to me that the world was better there was way more life on it.
