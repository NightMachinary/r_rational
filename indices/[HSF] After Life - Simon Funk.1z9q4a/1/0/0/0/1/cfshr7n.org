Okay, I read it and I can confirm that, as much as I'd question the plausibility of some of the decisions, it's 100% materialistic. No consciousness shenanigans going on, no mysticism behind the mystery. Not sure if I /enjoyed/ it; it's an interesting glimpse into a honestly p terrifying future, in a sort of Lovecraftian way, and it doesn't really say anything /novel/ to people in this subreddit. Made me smile though. Well-executed at the least.

It's about the slowest-ever human-bootstrapped non-friendly GAI singularity.
