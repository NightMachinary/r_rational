Ok, I now /need/ to say: [[/u/Yvain]], I freaking love you and want to grow up to be like you.

Mind, I think the "standard dystopias" are more of a problem in reality than in fiction (let's face it: North Korea /is a problem/), but in fiction they're just such a /cheap/ way of creating conflict.

That, or Agent Smith was partially right, and some large subset of the human race really do define their existence by pain, suffering, and general horribleness. I'm not sure what we're going to have to do with such people.
