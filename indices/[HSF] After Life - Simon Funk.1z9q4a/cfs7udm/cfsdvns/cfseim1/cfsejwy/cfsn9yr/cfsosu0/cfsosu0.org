Oh Lord. Is there some mood people get in where they start looking for all the possible ways that things we like can destroy us? Seriously: I don't even have good genetics; my ancestors are inbred as fuck and my fiancee is a wonderful person but /also/ a carrier for several heritable illnesses. I'd pay money just to be able to have a /normal, healthy/ child at all, let alone a superhumanly loveable child!

God fucking dammit people. How likely is it that fun will actually kill you versus that some scifi author will think it a /really intriguing premise/ (read: a "subversion" of your usual expectations, except that most societies are so anti-fun that it's actually a /repetition/ of usual social expectations) to write a story about how fun kills you?

EDIT: my conscious mind just noticed to whom I was replying. This comment just got 20% more applicable... you evil person.
