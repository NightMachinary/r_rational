Those are good questions. I want to add another to the pile

What factors affect the usefulness of a body? Like, is it just raw strength? Toughness? Flexibility? As we've seen, projectors seem to be less constrained by the characteristics of their body than would appear on first glance. Either they can project their body through a Joining vocation, or they can use a different type of vocation to prevent getting hit and to do damage in return. Plus, ABDs are a thing. Even if bullets are a concern, I'm not sure that "Muscles and skin woven from spider silk." would help much with the sort of weaponry that is brought into most fights. It's possible that familiarity might be a factor that trumps all others.
