This chapter was really hard to read. The sheer level of callous cruelty Paragon showed, Max's helplessness in the face of it all... it kind of turned my stomach. This one hit me a lot harder than Grace's interlude despite the similar content, and I think it's because Max's torture was so much more... impersonal? Dehumanizing? Objectifying? I'm not sure what the right word is, but it's the way that Grace was still fundamentally a living being whereas Max was basically a piece of furniture. Grace's captors hated her, they viewed her as an animal, as vermin, as a parasite. Max's captors didn't really think about her at all. Grace, despite the torture, is still capable of making her own decisions, her thoughts are her own, she still has meaningful interactions with people, and she's ultimately responsible for her own escape. Max loses all volition, is denied the ability to speak, is never spoken to, loses her mind, loses her /name/, escapes because of someone else's actions, and still isn't even sure she's made it out.

To try and lighten the mood a little bit, I want to focus on something else in the chapter that caught my attention.

  “I dreamed,” said Max, leaning forward. “That you fiddled with the wrong things, and woke up something more intelligent and cruel than you ever could have imagined.” She lowered her voice to just above a whisper. “I fled. And I watched the void swallow all of you.” Max clenched a fist.

I want to know what the hell this is about. There have been occasional hints of some weird shit happening in the background (the lack of stars, Tasia's sister's ill-fated expedition, everything about the ocean, etc.) but this feels a lot more pointed and more immediately relevant. Is this talking about what happened at Buttercup Lodge after Max was freed of the compulsions? If so, it might have something to do with the freaky pit that they use to execute people, since that seems the most obvious culprit. If it /is/ related to the pit, that could signal some much bigger issues. Compare the description of the pit:

#+begin_quote
  The nurse led her up a stone staircase, and over a bridge spanning a river. Beneath the bridge, the river became a rushing waterfall, pouring into the massive pit at the center of the island, thousands of feet deep and hundreds of feet wide.

  A pitch-black pool sat at the bottom, and despite all the crashing water, none of it made a sound. The river, the waterfall, the pool at the bottom, all dead silent, an oppressive stillness that engulfed it in a cloud.

To this bit from chapter 5-C:

#+begin_quote
  My eyes stared at the silhouette of the fountain. I leaned to the side, looking at it from another angle. /It's not a silhouette./ It was a real fountain, but the water trickling through it was so black, so dark that it looked two-dimensional. The liquid devoured every speck of light that touched it.

  It was like a hole cut out of reality.

  “That water,” said Kahlin. “Was taken from twenty-one thousand feet below sea level. Far below the maximum legal depth.”

If there's something in the water at Buttercup Lodge, it's probably in the whole goddamn ocean, and that's terrifying. Granted, that's a lot of speculation on my part, but I still want to keep my eye on this.
