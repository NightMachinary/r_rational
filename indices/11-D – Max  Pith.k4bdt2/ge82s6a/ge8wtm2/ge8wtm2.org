The notion of the two separate realities reminds me strongly of Isaac Brin's false memories, supposedly implanted within him - was that just another symptom of some broader phenomenon? Are people occasionally switching between/getting shunted across two parallel worlds? Or maybe there's some pith-created sub-reality that people subconsciously access?

Regardless, absolutely chilling stuff. Brilliant work. One of the moments that made me most kind of horrified/disturbed is when Max chooses to braid buttercups into her hair.

Also, there was a whale named Clement in her room and in the therapy room? Was that intentional/a clue?
