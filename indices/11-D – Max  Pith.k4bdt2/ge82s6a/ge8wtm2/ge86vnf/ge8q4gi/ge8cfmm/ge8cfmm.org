Best chapter so far. Stomach-turning indeed. Gripping. The name â€˜Buttercup Lodge' will forever be chilling to me. I think this had a similar feel to something like Antichrist if not quite the same level of trauma.

Mysterious points of note:

- two realities?
- orange glowing eyes?
- what/who helped her escape?
- how much was hallucinated at buttercup lodge vs how much was some reality bending shit?
- green circle on the back of her letter?
