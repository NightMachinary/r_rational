The body/mind horror of this chapter was excellently done.

I'm still a little confused about the economics and status of swappable bodies. It seems odd that hers should be the first, but also the "best" or highest cachet. We know there are non Maxwell Clive bodies that episotocrats like to show off, are they all made by the same process? It just strikes me as odd that her model should still be in esteem/demand, either its fundamentally superior to the other bodies, in ways we haven't seen and don't have textual support for, or they used the tech breakthrough of making her to create variant bodies, either with or without the soulfuckery. If they have been able to make other variants of equivalent, if not superior quality, it seems like her body would be out of fashion by now, by virtue of it being old and somewhat ubiquitous at the outset before there were variants available.
