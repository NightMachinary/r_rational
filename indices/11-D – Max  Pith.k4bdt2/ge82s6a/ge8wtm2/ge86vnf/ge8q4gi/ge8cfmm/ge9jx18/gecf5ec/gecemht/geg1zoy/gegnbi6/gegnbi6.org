Some quotes that lead to my impression:

        "It’s an Elizabeth Cranbrook.  A new design. Not as classic or popular as the Maxine Clive line, but it’s all the rage with the young Epistocrats these days.  Muscles and skin woven from spider silk. Pink Ivory bones. And over three hundred billion neurons of spare space. You could fit three different people’s worth of Pith inside this brain"

        "As usual, the Admiral was inhabiting a Maxine Clive, clothed in the dark blue uniform of the Principality Navy.  An old classic: the same model as the very first fabricated body, all sweeping blonde hair and milky-white skin."

        " A lovely Maxine Clive.” I snorted. “She could work for a century, and she wouldn't have enough for that brand.”"

        "If you do really well, I'll loan you a Maxine Clive. I look after my own.” "

        "Lorne's maybe, with that vintage Maxine Clive chassis Ana told us about. Ana could swap, and we could run before they catch us.”"

        "Rowyna shouted some inspirational speech from her blonde Maxine Clive chassis, another decadent symbol of wealth. "

My point was, the chasis and the underlying tech and the social ramifications can sensibly relate to the story in a number of ways but its not clear (to me at least) which way they puzzle fits together.

The first quote is from the first chapter and possibly been slightly retconned, but my point is that its seems like there's fundamentally better bodies, its odd to me at least the Clive body would have maintained its cachet unless it had some fundamental advantages, in either use or production, or it was rare enough to be a status symbol, but none of those seem true. Like a 40 year old Ferrari is cool, but that's because there's a limited number of them and they can't make more of that kind, there's been no note of distinction for Maxine Cline model years.

Are Maxine Cline bodies more expensive, because they're still the best, they could increase the material science but they never found another soul as simpatico with the transfer process? And all others are lesser knockoffs? Can they fold the material science advances into the Maxine Clive line?
