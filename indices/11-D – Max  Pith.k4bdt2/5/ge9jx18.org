I have a theory about the seeming two reality thing, based on the description of the Conduit in this chapter and on the green circle at the end:

#+begin_quote
  A conduit is when two souls bond close to each other, and merge, partially.  They form a link, that can stretch any distance.  With it, they can share thoughts...
#+end_quote

The two "realities" are two separate souls in different bodies, both of which think they're Max. When they each dream, they exchange information subconsciously. Someone (Paragon?) has Free Max feeding information back to them via Buttercup Max so they can remain informed about the revolution.

In this theory, Max would be being released for a purpose, which would neatly explain why the boy in the cell opposite could free her - he was in on Paragon(?)'s plan.

In general I think we're leading up to a Bioshock style "Would you kindly" reveal.
