Yah I'd second Game of Champions; I also vaguely remember enjoying [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/][The Line]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5367085/1/The_Sun_Soul][The Sun Soul]] but iirc both were pretty edgy. OoS was ok but I wasn't really feeling it and stopped reading after a couple dozen chapters, though, so insofar as that's what you're after we might differ in taste.

You might also have some luck looking through [here](tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/PokemonGeneral) or [[https://m.fanfiction.net/game/Pok%C3%A9mon/?srt=4&t=0&g1=0&g2=0&r=103&lan=0&len=0&s=0&v1=0&c1=0&c2=0&c3=0&c4=0&_g1=0&_c1=0&_c2=0&_v1=0][here]] and seeing if anything strikes your fancy.
