Anyone got any good pokemon fanfiction recommendations? (Aside from OoS, of course, which I'm already reading.) It seems like if I try to browse the ff.net section, all I find are stories written by twelve year olds, for twelve year olds, with appropriate levels of edgyness and/or wish fulfilment.

I'm kind of an anti-fan of the anime nowadays, so if ash ketchum is the main character, and acts like ash ketchum, I'm probably not going to enjoy it. Red is cool though, since he's basically just a thin skin for an OC.

I also pretty much exclusively read stories with an adventure component; SOL or romance doesn't typically do it for me.

And to contradict that previous paragraph, I would like to recommend [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://archiveofourown.org/works/1609088/chapters/3425729&ved=2ahUKEwj_uf2Cje_aAhXJ3YMKHa23DbkQFjAAegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw1RhUiAqKfjeHDQF-54bKZ5][Olivine Romance]] which is a bildungsroman focused on effectively-OCs that wear the skins of various Johto gym leaders. It has excellent tactical pokemon battles, a diverse cast of characters, and stakes high enough to care about, but not so high as to be unbelievable.
