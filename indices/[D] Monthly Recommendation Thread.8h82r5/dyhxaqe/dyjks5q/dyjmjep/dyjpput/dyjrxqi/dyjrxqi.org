I already posted the best ones in another comment in this thread, but there's some more that I would recommend. Just remember that I'm not as willing to guarantee the quality. They're either not as good, but still worth reading or I haven't read past the first few chapters yet.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13091760/chapters/29950974][Blood Sex Sugar Magic]] - Izuku decides to try being a hero...with Himiko Toga's help.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13705821/chapters/31483173][If I Only Had a Heart]] - Izuku decides he will be a hero despite being quirkless. Similar to Erased Potential in concept, except Izuku is a genius like Tony Stark.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13803339/chapters/31736502][With What Was Left Behind]] - Similar to 'If I Only Had a Heart' above, except Izuku while attempting to be a quirkless super-hero, doesn't attend UA.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12897003/chapters/29463207][Something Like a Star]] - Izuku struggles through life with an empathy quirk.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13918209/chapters/32032938][Something Borrowed]] - Izuku has a quirk where he can borrow other people's quirk like All for One can.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10801047/chapters/23962797][How Shinsou Hitoshi Became The Greatest Hero Ever (Or Something)]] - Shinsou asks Aizawa to train him into someone who can be a hero despite a mind-control quirk.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14053671/chapters/32372736][We All Can Be Heroes]] - Izuku doesn't meet All Might or go to UA. He becomes a paramedic to be a hero.
