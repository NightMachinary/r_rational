Asking for something similar quality is a little vague since I don't know what you look for in a good story, but I can share the best ones.

- Anything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/simkjrs/pseuds/simkjrs][simkjrs]] because the guy is the best at writing stories with the perfect blend of sarcastic and touching.

- Anything by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/PitViperOfDoom/pseuds/PitViperOfDoom][PitViperOfDoom]] becasue the guy is a fantastic writer who writes really good world-building or 'For Want of a Nail' fics. My faves are 'Yesterday Upon the Stair', 'break your bones but not your promises', and 'Divenire'.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12185283/chapters/27663255][Coloured Bricks, Pick-Up Sticks]] is about Izuku with a quirk to be warm and performing reckless and life-endangering scientific experimentation to be a hero.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13253055][UA Unsolved]] - Spin-off of 'Yesterday Upon the Stair where the UA dorms are haunted and the Class 1A go ghost-hunting like Ghost Busters.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11339718/chapters/25378848][For Want of a Toe Joint]] - Where Izuku has a quirk and it goes unnoticed until months after he's gotten into UA. It's great because the story investigates deeply into the mechanics of how quirks work.

- If you want more fanfics, try Ao3's collections such as [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/TheGreatOnes][The Great Ones]] or [[https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Awesome_BnHA_MultiChapter_Fics][Awesome BnHa Multi-Chapter Fics]]
