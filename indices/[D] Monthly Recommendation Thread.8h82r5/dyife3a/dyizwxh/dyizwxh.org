Jo Waltons Thessaly series is a strong recommend. Three books in which a bunch of classics scholars attempt to build The Just City, and the many and varied obstacles on that path.

Weirs The Martian, also, in the unlikely case you have not heard or read it already .

Ken Macleod, the corporation wars, in which the background setting is that reactionaries and social justice warriors eventually escalated from flame wars to /actual/ war until the world got really sick of their shit and put them all on ice, and the actual story is set 3000 years later during the attempt to rehabilitate the frozen dead via community service. At which point the shooting starts again. Way more entertaining than it sounds
