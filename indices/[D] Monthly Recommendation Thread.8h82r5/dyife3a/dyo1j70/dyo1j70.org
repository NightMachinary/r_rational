Schooled in Magic by Nuttall is rational-adjacent. It's a girl from the modern world transported to a fantasy setting, and who is horrified by the serfdom and slavery. She is truly limited by how much she remembers, for example she regrets that she doesn't remember programming. It's quite a fun story - like most of Nuttall's writing. It's not finished yet but there are around 12 books so far and Nuttall writes at a mad speed.

Is Ascend online rational-adjacent (I haven't read it)? If your just looking for fun lit-rpg, with rationality, [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/106563.LitRPG_audiobooks][this list of audiobooks is decent]].
