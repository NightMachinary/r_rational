Fair warning, though, Girl Genius relies very heavily on Plotdemandium. Like "protagonist happens to go to a place for no particular reason, finds out that's exactly where they needed to go, and more", e.g. "go looking in the sewers for a contact, stumble upon the 'King in the mountain'". That's just one example, especially in the second super-arc (but also present before that) it seems the protagonist is just carried through the plot by convenient coincidences. Other flavors of Plotdemandium are also present, like power levels fluctuating according to the needs of the plot.
