[[http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20021104][Girl Genius]] - A webcomic set in a steampunk-esque world with Mad! Scientists (and Mad! Science!). About as consistent as a world with Hollywood mad science can be. The artwork is beautiful and absurdly detailed, as is the worldbuilding, and they have been publishing reasonably consistently since 2000. Deals with human augmentation and AI person-hood (albeit several books in). Was my introduction to the wonderful corollary of Clark's 3rd Law: /"Any sufficiently analysed magic is indistinguishable from science"/

[[https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2000-06-12][Schlock Mercenary]] - It's been mentioned here before, but its a web comic strip set following the adventures of a space-borne mercenary crew. Despite its comedic form, it deals with some heavy transhumanist topics and is consistent with the disruption each new development brings. When the Scotty-type improves interstellar travel, the whole world reacts; when the team come up with new weapons, their enemies learn and work out ways to counter etc. *And* it's often hilarious.
