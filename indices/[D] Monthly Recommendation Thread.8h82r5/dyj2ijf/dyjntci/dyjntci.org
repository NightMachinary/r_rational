Wuxia-level writing quality, but you might try Warlock of the Magus World. A scientist is reborn into a Western fantasy world and brings along an AI chip that gives him an unfair advantage. Not rational, some genre savviness and subversion, writing quality below, say, Worm but relatively high for Eastern translations.
