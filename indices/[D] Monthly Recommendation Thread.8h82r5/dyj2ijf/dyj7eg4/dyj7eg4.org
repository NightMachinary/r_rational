That's pretty broad.

- [[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Q1bVpZxBmTQJ:squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk][/The Girl Who Poked God With A Stick/]] (3k words): the protagonist is competent, immoral, and [[#s][slight spoiler]].

- [[http://www.davidbrin.com/fiction/givingplague.html][/The Giving Plague/]] (7k) and [[http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/antihypoxiant.html][/Antihypoxiant/]] (1k) --- short stories featuring sociopathic/megalomaniacal biologists/medicians.

- [[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/][/The Things/]] (7k) --- a fanfiction of John Carpenter's /The Thing/, written from the perspective of the monster.

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7234685-understand][/Understand/]] (14k) by Ted Chiang; the protagonist undergone an experimental procedure that made him superintelligent, then escaped from the researchers. Passably competent, and cares about certain abstract concepts much more than about humans.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11239837/1/Timelooping-Tinker][/Timelooping Tinker/]] (21k), a /Worm/ fanfiction. Bakuda in a time loop. Probably closest to /Blood and Chaos/ in atmosphere.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][/The Metropolitan Man/]] (81k) --- rational villainous protagonist Lex Luthor vs. rational Superman.

- [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/][/A Prison of Glass/]] (100k), a /Worm/ fanfiction. Very unique, as self-inserts go: the self-insert character acts very callously to everyone except canon /Worm/ characters she got a liking to; the story is told through perspectives of other people, but never hers. Also fairly close to /Blood and Chaos/.

- [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/][/Crystal Trilogy/]], sort of. The protagonist is an artificial intelligence with an utility function orthogonal to human morality. AIs are written competently, i. e. they're sufficiently inhuman. There's three books in the series, the first one is [[http://crystal.raelifin.com/society/][free]] (200k words).

- [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][/Twig/]] (1600k words) by Wildbow --- the protagonist is a social manipulator, part of a spy/problem-solving group of augmented children in service of a biotechnological Academy. He loves his companions, and tends to disregard lives of everyone else. At least at the beginning.
