[[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional Brain Chip]]! If you /really/ dislike dumb characters, bad art, and stories written in English by ESL people then this definitely isn't the story for you.

However, I found it really funny and it approaches a lot of rational themes in a way that was really enjoyable, to me at least. Think SMBC more than Time Braid. Also, it's pretty short, so you won't lose more than a couple hours.
