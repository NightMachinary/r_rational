If you can get past that art, would you be willing to give [[http://dragondoctors.dhscomix.com/archives/comic/ch-7-page-1-last-victim][The Dragon Doctors]] a chance? It's my favorite webcomic and I want more people to check it out since it's completely rational, but the artwork is a turn off for a lot of people. The premise is basically Scrubs meets Doctor Who.

The link is to a prequel arc that takes place before the first chapter. It's more self-contained than any other chapter, introduces the world in a more natural way than the first chapter, and the even author considers it to be the point where they got good at writing the characters.
