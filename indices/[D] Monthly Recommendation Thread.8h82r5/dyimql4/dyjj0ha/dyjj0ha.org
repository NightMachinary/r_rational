Everybody loves large chests is a great sort of popcorn fic. It doesn't take itself seriously, features smut a few times to varying degrees of intensity (with warning, don't worry), but has a richness of character and world building that's hard to put down.

Lots of chapters, but they're fairly short and go quite quickly. Would hesitate to call it +rationalist+ rational as well, but it is very much self consistent and features some basic inhuman motivational patterns that, while simple, still surprised and entertained quite often.

Prose quality is definitely one of it's weaknesses, but this is one of the rare cases where I can say that it doesn't significantly detract from my enjoyment of the story.
