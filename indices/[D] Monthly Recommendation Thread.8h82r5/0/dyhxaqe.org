[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break Them All]] - it's just a story about a guy learning about and playing around with a computer program-like magic system without much of a plot. Still surprisingly good with a very slow updating rate. About one chapter every 4 to 6 months, but it just updated last week which is why I'm posting about it here.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13617231][El Manisero]] - A BnHa fanfic where Sero runs a peanut cartel at UA. Despite the utterly ridiculous premise, every event has a logical outcome and is one of the best blends of rational and comedy I have ever seen. If this is a movie, I would buy it to watch over and over.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7725915/Vronsurd][Vronsurd]] - I needed my RWBY fanfic fix to feed my RWBY addiction and this guy is writing some amazing RWBY stories. I stumbled on him yesterday and sped-read through 'The Shield of Vale', 'The Navigator', and 'Guitar Huntsman', and all of them were really good reads even though they are just in the starting chapters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7958343/1/][Ricochet]] - It's a hysterical Naruto fanfic and I couldn't stop laughing while reading how the characters all verbally abuse each other in the name of Friendship^{TM.} The first chapter looks like it's a high-school AU of Naruto, but it really, really is not and is perfectly in line with canon. So I recommend giving it a try.

If anyone wants more RWBY or Boku no Hero Academia fanfic recs, I would be happy to oblige. Just let me know if you want anything in particular or if I should just throw out my favorites.
