So I have recently decided to compile a list of all of my favorite pieces of fanfiction and try to reread pretty much all of them, especially the ones I haven't read in a while. I mainly talk about them in the TTS server, but I will be keeping a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJr3NA92ZTYBmJZSkx45_mBLfmSw0fJQ3Ny3kDxq1Dc/edit?usp=drivesdk][Google Drive doc]] going and keep it updated with the reviews I write out every time I finish a fic. Only have gone through two so far, but this list will only grow. Anything on that list to begin with was good enough for me to remember it fondly, so people are free to look for recs there.

One of those fics is a very recent find, *[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9131719/chapters/20750566][Love Novels]]*. This is a Love Live sequel romance fic, set two years after the conclusion of the original Love Live anime, starting right as Maki graduates from high school and enters University with the goal of fulfilling her parent's wishes and becoming a doctor. The main narrative thread revolves around Maki's overachieving academic standards and stubborn sense of pride starting to slowly grind her down as stresses pile up higher and higher, while her best friend Nico does everything in her power to stop Maki from reaching her breaking point.

This is also, without exaggeration, the best romance fic I have ever read. I read the whole thing essentially in one sitting, spellbound the whole way through, and it just *melted* me. You'd expect the fic's emotional focus on Maki's struggles and stresses to make it really depressing, but Nico's constant emotional support stops it from ever overwhelming. I would recommend this to pretty much anyone, though it is obviously better to have watched the original show for context.

I have also recently finished the internet-famous Balance Arc (aka Season One) of the actual play DnD podcast, *[[http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone][The Adventure Zone]]* ooooh boy this one blew me away and is pretty much the perfect storm. Firstly, it is hosted and run by the McElroy brothers and their former radio host father, some of the funniest people on the internet. Other well-known projects of theirs are the Polygon YouTube series "Monster Factory" and the comedy advice podcast "My Brother, My Brother, and Me". These guys' style of improv and conversational comedy is just exceptional, and they adapt to the new area of tabletop gaming very very well. Griffin is a stellar DM with great skill in foreshadowing and long-term plot construction, who can also improv voices and conversations and characters on a dime, and also tie a hundred narrative threads up to create heartwarming moments that actually drove me to tears. And while the players take a while to find their footing, all three of the player characters flesh out into fully realized people who I find uniquely compelling. The story definitely isn't rational fiction, Griffin often let's them get away with stuff if it's sufficiently funny or cool, but it's great regardless. Find it in podcast form somewhere, and be careful to start at the actual beginning at "Here They Be Gerblins" and not the recently begun second season. It takes a little bit to get rolling, but when it does they knock it out of the park.
