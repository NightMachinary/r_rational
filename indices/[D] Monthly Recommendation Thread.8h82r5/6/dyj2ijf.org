has anyone read any good story with a competent amoral/evil protagonist? I just read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/blood-and-chaos-the-story-of-a-btvs-si-turned-vampire.354777/][Blood and Chaos]] and look for something with a main character like Jack(preferably less crazy) who uses science and munchkins everything mainly for his own gain and doesn't really value human life beyond the people he actually cares about.
