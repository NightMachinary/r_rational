Yeah, misspoke. And I'm referring to the author. Murdering people that are Christian so that they go to heaven is extremely utilitarian and extremely at odds with the commandment "thou shalt not kill". It is so far outside of Christian moral reasoning, and most natural human moral reasoning, that even ascribing the belief to a cult is absurd. He's basically just setting up those damn theists as the insane and unreasonable bad guys.
