[[/u/yagsuomynona]] misspoke. It's not intellectual Turing test, but rather [[https://praxtime.com/2014/05/27/ideological-turing-test/][Ideological Turing Test]]. It's a test where any ideologist or politician writes two essays, one essay arguing for their side and another essay for the opponent's side. If a neutral judge can't identify which essay the test-taker supports, then it's a pass.

Saying someone fails to pass the test for something like Christianity or Buddhism implies that they don't understand the religion or simply opposes the religion without knowing anything about it.

However, the part I don't understand is who is [[/u/yagsuomynona]] referring to? The author or the main character? Because one can argue that they both failed the test.
