I'm not sure what a rational game looks like, except in a story sense. I'm playing Slay the Spire a lot recently, it's a roguelike card-based strategy/RPG. You're fighting your way up through three worlds and after every fight, you add a card to your deck. If you die, you start again from the beginning.

If you don't mind playing a classic, Planescape: Torment would probably appeal to many in this sub. Themes of immortality, memory, and transhumanism.
