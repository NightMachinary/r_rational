I'll second Slay the Spire; it's got some great devs working on it, and updates with content/balance on a regular basis (it's in early access). For me it sort of scratches the same itch that Dominion does, though it's (mercifully) single player, which allows a lot of freedom of design that I feel like you don't get as much in multiplayer games.

The dailies runs are also really great, one of the best in roguelikes that I've played, mostly because of how distinctive the different combinations can feel.
