Yes, and that's leverage. Restoration is a longevity treatment- it prevents most of the wear and tear we associate with aging, so it is a life extension that way too. If used optimally, it can add one human's lifespan in peak health to your lifespan

I would expect in serious war, bringing them near one another so they know how to retrieve others is useful, but outside of that, there's not a lot of value.

the master can summon the youkai into all kinds of dangerous situations, so the youkai has that to worry about- especially if, either out of malice or misdeeds, someone convinces them the youkai needs to be put down, and the master summons it to a deathtrap. Lots of youkai that part on neutral terms later turn around and kill their summoners later because of this.

This incentivizes masters to keep it near them, so they can be prepared and so it doesn't expect betrayal, or decide to kill you in a fit of paranoia.

Later on, there will be chemical weapons that, if neccessary, and if successfully used in an ambush, will kill almost any youkai. they also have been documented to burn down cities and set sand, water, and ash on fire. But at this point, they aren't known.
