Do the youkai get their own personalities generated out of the aether somehow, or are they just you +/-5% ? If the first one, then what sort of innate personalities do they have?

If I generated a being with 95% of my memories, that had nothing else to go on, it would end up resembling me pretty heavily. Or by 95% do you mean specifically like, abstract technical knowledge and not specifically memories? (though one might argue the distinction is less clear from inside one's head).

Youkai seem cool, If I summoned one I'd try to befriend it and have it come on my adventures with me. Two heads are better then one and all that.
