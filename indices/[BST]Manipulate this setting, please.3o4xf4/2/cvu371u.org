As for how to break this, can the supernatural secondary abilities generate energy? You mentioned blizzards, and freezing food is awesome. Starting with primitive tech though, heat is probably more useful. From heating a large house to forging and cooking.

Stack abilities and you can go even further. Heat generation plus telekinetic powers allows you to melt and shape tools of metal with high melting points. Even with modern technology melting tungsten is a real headache, since only a precious few alloys have a higher melting point, and they themselves are a lot of work to make, what with, you know, the high melting point.
