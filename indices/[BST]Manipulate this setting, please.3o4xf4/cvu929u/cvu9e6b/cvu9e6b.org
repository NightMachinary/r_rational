Youkai get some fragment of your personality, but it's smaller then the rest, which seems to come from the aether. youkai act like humans, only not. more extreme, frequently, but not exclusively. there are moments it's like talking to your reflection, but then they say something and you fall out of sync and realize how different you are. they're probably ~10-20% you. Youkai are inconsistent, but they're generally more cautious and paranoid than humans.

abstract knowledge, facts, memories. they know it's not them though, there's something about them that rings false. memories feel less like something that happened to them, and more like a passage they read once in a book.

they know they're not you, their personality can be different... the nurture may be the same, perhaps, but the nature is unavoidably divergent, and the nurture is likely as well. the personality might be sampled from other, extant humans, or it might be created on it's own, or might might be how your nature and nurture change with the new body.
