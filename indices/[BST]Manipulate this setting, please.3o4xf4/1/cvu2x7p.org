Tech/magic level? Do humans have anything more effective than spears and crossbows, do they have fireball mages?

#+begin_quote
  They demonstrate impossible strength, speed and durability, and energy projectiles refered to as magic. In addition, you can kill one solely by attacking a hand, or fail to kill one by a blow that should chop off their head.

I'm assuming the second one describes them functioning on an HP system? Anyway, this list is quite sufficient to overcome essentially arbitrary numbers of normal humans.

#+begin_quote
  There is a liquid they are especially vulnerable to, so humans might be able to beat them in a fight, with an ambush or sufficient numbers.
#+end_quote

Unless this liquid is ubiquitous on the level of /water/, it seems like it would be absurdly costly to stop the youkai from doing whatever they want. If one in twenty-five people can summon a superbeing that requires a specialized military response to stop, all small villages are ruled by youkai.

Probably this means that all familiar-summonings are conducted under a vat of anti-youkai liquid, and the unlucky people just go without a familiar from then on.

#+begin_quote
  Of course, humanity does have one real point of leverage against them. Either type of familiar can be [...] relocated to the ritual's location. [...] These rituals do require materials (common gemstones [quartz and other minor gems] or certain plants, traditionally, though other sustitutes do exist.
#+end_quote

Is there any way for the youkai to prevent that one? Does it need material components of their body, or the presence/participation of their summoner? What happens to a youkai when their summoner dies?
