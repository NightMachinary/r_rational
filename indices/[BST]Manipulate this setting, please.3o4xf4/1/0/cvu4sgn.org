They have no mages of their own. they do have the occasional elephant or similarly powerful animal, and there are ways to aquire power, but all power comes from familiars, in one way or another.

yes, basically a HP system.

The liquid has a long-lasting effect on objects it's dipped in, or a prolonged temporary one, and while not as common as water, it is naturally found in a few non-youkai species. pegasi, for instance, have it in their blood, while gryphons have it in their spit. If i finished the obvious fluids list, unicorns have it in their [[#s][slightly gross]] Additionally, a freshly summoned youkai is more like a peak level human. a little faster, a little more durable, able to use magic where humans would use crossbows, and with similar effectiveness. The problem is, they get stronger, but initially, a few properly equipped people with crossbows, like, thirty, would do the job.

The thing is, every youkai wants to live. I assumed that this initially gave humans enough leverage to get some to work with them, (since whether humans are a threat or not, youkai are, and free revivals are a valuable bargaining chip) and then used those to control others. Youkai aren't actively malicious either. There have been times in history when Youkai ruled, and many of them, though.
