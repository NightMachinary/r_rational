The mindless, obedient familiars are much better. I could improve my efficiency a fair bit with an obedient animal that can understand me, fit into small places/carry things, fire/trigger weapons ... I probably won't be taking over the world with this, but it's nice.

The others are just meh, unreliable living weapons that aren't linked to you in any meaningful sense (except that if you die they can't be rezzed anymore I guess.) They're just other, slightly more capable citizens (they're not psychopaths? You mention that they form social attachments to people) and the guy who summoned them is outta luck.

Oh, the weather-control thing is neat, it'd be in high demand for .. everything really. Crops, social events ...

  In addition, you can kill one solely by attacking a hand, or fail to kill one by a blow that should chop off their head. For some, the blow just stops, and for others the head reattaches itself, or regrows, or the blade passes through but the head stays put.

The way this is written, I'm not sure whether this is supposed to be a universal ability of these creatures, or an example. Also, is there supposed to be something special about the hand, as a weak point?
