The mindless familiar is generally useful, hence why it's there. the living weapons are too unreliable to be used without a bonus. They may not be a catch, but they'd only be called on because others did it first, otherwise. It'd be a military exclusive tradition, i'd think.

They can form social attachments to other people. can doesn't mean will, and their personality is not neccessarily a perfect match-up, but they can develop attachments.

Basically, familiars can be killed by sufficient damage anywhere. if you tried hard enough to kill their hand, or repeated the action enough... you could kill them. if you beheaded them incompetently enough, or they were strong enough, they could survive. of course, this is assuming they didn't let the damage go through, but instinctively, instinctively, the familiar will use up energy holding together a limb, and once it's all gone they're gone too.
