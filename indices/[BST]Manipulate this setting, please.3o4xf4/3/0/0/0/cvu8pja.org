yes, and whatever the material is, using it all up is lethal even for non-lethal wounds.

It's random. It's not single use, but the result is consistently the same after the first use (and you cannot have multiple familiars). I already expected some people would have the attitude you listed, that getting a youkai is unlucky.

I meant that if the ritual only spat out a youkai 4% of the time, and did nothing otherwise, few would use it. Others would think they could tame it, and might even be right. They might also not.
