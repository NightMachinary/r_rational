  It's not single use, but the result is consistently the same after the first use (and you cannot have multiple familiars).

So what happens if you have a youkai and then try to summon a new familiar? Do you teleport and heal your original youkai back to you? I ask because you mentioned 3 distinct rituals for teleporting, healing and rezzing.

Isn't taming a youkai like taming a human superhero? Seems pretty damn hard.
