One of three outcomes, depending... either your youkai is dead, and the ritual fails, your youkai is alive, and it calls it to your position (but this is generally less than inefficient.), or it works- but the only documented cases of that involved severe personality alteration.

Taming a youkai is like convincing a human superhero it's in their best interests to work with you, or, conversely, to hire you. hard for an individual, but possible for any sufficiently powerful society. It requires convincing them that a slice of pie on a regular basis is better than a whole pie with a dagger in it, so to speak- that dagger will probably take the form of the next youkai, or the current ruler. Once society gets big enough, youkai will still generally be better off than humans, but the advantage will be less individually great. there may even be a human royal family, though like as not, they're puppet rulers, or only there through a perilous pile of deals, debts, and untold assumptions.

But people are idiots, and if cultists can plausibly think they can get a demon to serve their aims, without idiot ball being called, a mere youkai isn't that implausible.
