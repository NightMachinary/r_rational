Ok. Gems are going to be highly restricted by the various organizations around, perhaps certain metals and flowers to minimize the number of random summonings.

What's the probability that a random youkai will have a compliant or semi obedient personality? Let that number equal n. How many youkai+ human support would be required to reliably take down a top tier youkai? Let that number equal m.

(25/n)*m is the number an organization needs to be viable as a power.

For example, suppose 1/4 youkai are reasonably compliant. 3 average youkai along with human support can normally take down even a quite strong new youkai. 300 humans are needed to form an organization that can effectively vet new summoners and remain safe and stable. Perhaps 600 would be safer.

Any private group that tries to maintain itself independently will be viewed with suspicion if they lack the numbers, unless they can meet these requirements- if they have a particularly strong youkai or especially good abilities to use humans to take youkai out or some way of better instilling loyalty in youkai perhaps they can survive. Those that fail will be releasing dangerous supernatural monsters into the wild and will be taken over and used by more powerful groups as a matter of public safety.
