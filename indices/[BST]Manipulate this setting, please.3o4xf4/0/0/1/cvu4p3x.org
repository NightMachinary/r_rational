If the person is mentally ill enough to attack a group of humans and youkai then they could be taken out, but the main purpose is to catch Youkai in a place where there are potent defences, mechanical and human, and if they prove disobedient or violent slaughter them and their summoner. Or imprison the summoner so they can't summon anything.
