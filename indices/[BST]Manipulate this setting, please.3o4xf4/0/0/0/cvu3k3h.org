Both, i presume. I assumed the setting's people were stupid enough to make a cermony of it, and do it as a group, 1 at a time, but if a bad enough catastrophe occurs, they'd step in. I also assumed they had at least three kill-switches, but only one of them is actually going to save the summoner, and even that one only sometimes. (guards, drop the platform into an aether tank, poison gas the room, maybe?) the familiar would know about number one, but not the others.
