I imagine there would be a mix of national and guild set ups. Per the maths, a group could reasonably deal with rogue youkai and do spot checks on everyone with a size of a few hundred to a thousand, which is certainly within the realm of a guild.

Getting a central government is tricky though. Youkai could be very effective assassins and be very disruptive to a stable organization. An organization would need to reach a critical mass to be stable- let o be the percentage of youkai that have effective anti assassin abilities. Let p be the number of youkai that are needed to defend a central government building.

25* 1/n *m *1/o *p.

Suppose 10% are really good at stopping assassins, due to speed or illusion piercing abilities or whatever. Suppose 20 are needed to defend a central government building. Perhaps then 120k humans would be needed to have a stable central government, or double that for a reliably stable government. Lower than that and you're vulnerable- your youkai will be poorly suited to the task and be steadily depleted, more youkai will rebel causing more problems, your royalty or government will be deposed more easily.

As such, youkai would be natural leaders. A youkai is harder to assassinate and could maintain a stable government much easier.

New techniques to counteract youkai assassins and beserkers might lessen the need for such a large population, especially stable times or unstable might alter the numbers.
