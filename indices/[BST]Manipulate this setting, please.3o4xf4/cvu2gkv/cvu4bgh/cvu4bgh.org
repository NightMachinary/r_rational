Not in any ways except killing them, or leaving the circle while summoning- but that's a tiny window of oppurtunity.

You create a symbol on the ground. the best known one is a pentagram-like symbol, with a variety of lines (made of melted metal into wood), made of common minerals. There are enough variants that you need one gem or arguably-a-gem (placed in the center. there is no noticable difference between a single gem and a lot of gems placed close together, but there is a size requirement.), one metal that can be melted, and one platform of some sort of wood, in addition to ash from flowers or bushes. You need a specific combination, and some won't work at all, but this is good for between thirty and one-hundred initial summonings, depending on the circle's radius.

The rituals for calling, reviving and restoring are arguably easier- you use ink on paper with either metal, gem dust, or certain flower's ashes mixed in, or place one of the above on top of the ink. generally these are set up on paper for more portable ones, and for stationary ones they make them similarly to the original summoning circle. summoning to location takes roughtly 15 minutes, and the summoner must be in the circle in some slight way. reviving takes 15 minutes, does not do anything alone (you must use both restoring and reviving afterwards), the summoner must be in the circle in some slight way, and heavily damages the circle- destroying a paper scroll on the first use, and getting 10-25 uses out of a stone or wood one. restoring takes fifteen minutes, the summoner must make contact with the circle to start the ritual, and the familiar must be in contact with the circle for the entire time. if any of the symbols are incorrectly done, the ritual takes longer, and if it's done incorrectly enough, the time to perform the ritual approaches infinity. on the flipside, a perfectly created symbol can work in 10 minutes, or at least so scholars claim, but the record is around twelve minutes, and that took weeks!

you can only summon a familiar to your location. you could theoretically make gold weave summoning symbols on your clothes, so you can summon them any time or place, but that's expensive... still viable, though you would go through clothes quickly. you can summon it once ever fifteen minutes as your budget allows.

theoretically, combining symbols is possible. it just never has worked out yet. either one effect works, or neither does.

papers work for about 5-10 uses, more if you use more expensive components, though, as stated, revival pretty consistently destroys that paper. bigger papers also last longer, but it may defeat the point of putting it on paper.
