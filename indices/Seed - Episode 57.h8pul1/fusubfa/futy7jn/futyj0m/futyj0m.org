We didn't see anybody get shot, which means two things:

1) Karasu was shot, and it happened off-screen because that would be more dramatic.

2) Karasu wasn't shot and the "thud" came from something else, but it happened off-screen to make a cliffhanger.

In either case, I think that Turry is trying to get Samwise and the police to cooperate, either in knowingly helping Turry (Sam just said that he'd do whatever Turry wants, which is nice for Turry) or in fighting Turry, which, if they're not fully aware of Turry's current capabilities, may leave them open to manipulation (I can easily see them being tricked into making a move against Whatstheirname Incorporated under the assumption that they think the company is still tied to Turry in some way, for example).

Ultimately, though, we don't know what Turry wants, and that means that we don't know Turry's /timetable/ (though there's little foreshadowing for any kind of major threat like "another, more generally malevolent AI which Turry has to stay ahead of by taking specifically malevolent actions," which is evidence against that).
