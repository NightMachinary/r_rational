I think if you're wondering whether or not Turry made a mistake, you're thinking about this story in the wrong way.

Turry does not make mistakes. Turry gets what he wants. He is so much smarter than any human or group of humans that he can model and predict their every action. These are central premises of the story, things that have been hammered home both by the characters in the story and the events of the story itself. Turry is a super-intelligence. When he does something, it is objectively the correct move for him to make in order to get what he wants. The key, and the greatest source of tension in the story, is that /we don't know what he wants/.

If you think that what Turry just did was dumb, then you're missing something. Either you're wrong about what he wants, or you're wrong about what he did and the effects it'll have. That's okay, hell, it's /expected/, the tension in the story comes from our uncertainty about Turry's goals, so there are going to be times where what you see doesn't make sense in the context of what you think you know. The important thing to remember when that happens, though, is that it means /you/ were wrong, because Turry can't be wrong.
