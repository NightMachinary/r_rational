This seems like a really dumb move. Maybe there's some magical 4d chess manipulation that's going to retroactively make it smart but this doesn't seem like a plan a super AI would come up with.

If it had the capability for this much foresight and power, then it's using it in a really limited and short sighted way that is likely to have dire repercussions. Unless Turrys goal from the outset is to make this guy a terrified fugitive that hates him I'm not sure what he's doing.

The most interesting plot twist I can come up with off the top of my head would be that there are actually two AIs, the other one is kind of dumb and murderous but growing as a threat, and turry can't say that for some reason.
