Making the hiatus more bearable. A bit of a slow chapter, but it certainly set up a lot for the next one. It also reminded me a bit of a feast from a Brian Jacques novel, which is both a good and bad thing (good more than bad, I think).

My only real worry is that you haven't really had a villain yet. There's been some emotional conflict, and that's all well and good, but I think the lack of any real antagonist is starting to make the story feel like it isn't headed anywhere.

Still, I'm enjoying this a great deal. You write the characters well using the rational style, and manage to capture their canon counterparts well enough that it feels like the show.
