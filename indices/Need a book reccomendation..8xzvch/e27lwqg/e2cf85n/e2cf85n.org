Ooh I missed Machineries of Empire book 3 being published?

I wish there was a better way to follow series continuations publishing... Like, I'm on fictfact but keeping both that and goodreads up to date is more work than I'm willing to put into it. Why doesn't kindle notify me when they get book 3 of a series where I read books 1 and 2... /rant

Thanks for making me realise!

(also, Bujold is indeed great)
