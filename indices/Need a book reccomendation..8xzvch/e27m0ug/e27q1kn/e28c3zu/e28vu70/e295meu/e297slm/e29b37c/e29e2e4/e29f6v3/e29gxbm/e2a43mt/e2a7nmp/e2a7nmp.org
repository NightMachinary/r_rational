I'd assumed Tinkers already weren't resource limited. My point wasn't really about that and I'm going to skip the point about the effectiveness of the average Tinker here for brevity.

The incentive problem is much more where I was pointing. My "7+ digit salaries" comment was for those who are relevant in significant events like Endbringer attacks. Their jobs would be more specialized towards those things that law enforcement with guns would be unable to do, especially for the non-bulletproof ones, and their level of income would be conditional on showing up.

My impression so far is that a very significant fraction of the villains would be swayed by resources including reasonable pay, support for their particular circumstances, or being better treated by the law. You'd see a lot more dead Wards if most supervillains really were so irredeemable that a good legal path wouldn't interest them. 7 figures may sound like a huge amount, but it's really not that large; it's not uncommon for Google to give total compensation for new graduates in the ~$170k range, and they neither have superpowers nor do they fight the Endbringers.
