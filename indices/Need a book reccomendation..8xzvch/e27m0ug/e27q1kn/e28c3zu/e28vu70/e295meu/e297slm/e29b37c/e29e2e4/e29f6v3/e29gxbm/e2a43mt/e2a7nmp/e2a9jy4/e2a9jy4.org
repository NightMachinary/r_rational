You have a good point about villains getting paid enough to prevent them from becoming criminals. Wildbow hasn't really addressed this anywhere, AFAIK, and even though there are quite a lot of capes who wouldn't care about the money (the Fallen, Butcher, probably Bakuda, Kaiser, etc.), higher salaries would probably help to an extent.

The tricky thing is that incentivizing new recruits to do something /useful/--i.e. volunteering against class-S threats--is significantly more difficult. If a quarter of the defenders die in each Endbringer fight, their odds of survival aren't great if they attend them regularly and don't have Triumvirate-tier powers. The average cape knows this, and even though the Protectorate does pay people extra if they help against the class-S threats, it still wouldn't be enough to substantially increase Endbringer fight attendance, especially since someone willing to consider becoming a villain isn't going to feel morally obligated to help.
