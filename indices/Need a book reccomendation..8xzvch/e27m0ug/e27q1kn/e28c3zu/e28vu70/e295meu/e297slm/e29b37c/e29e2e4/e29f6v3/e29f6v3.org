I'm wondering what your specific criticism of that fight is, because I thought it made a hell of a lot of sense considering the forces involved and the opponent they were up against. As far as the Wards go, I can point to a whole host of situations where people get paid FAR less than what their actually contribution to society represents, despite everyone agreeing it's wrong. Teachers, people in the military, etc etc etc. Add to that the fact that they are kids, and the significant societal inertia that entails. I can easily imagine a town meeting/ballot question/etc where the salary is getting set, and people arguing "what could they possibly need the money for, they're in high school." And if you want to use your powers non-illegally and you disagree with the pay, it's not like you can just go somewhere else. Your options are "suck it up," "become a criminal," or "attempt to use your powers for financial gain in a purely non-violent manner" which has the side effect of being deemed suspicious by society, as well as other problems for spoilery reasons.
