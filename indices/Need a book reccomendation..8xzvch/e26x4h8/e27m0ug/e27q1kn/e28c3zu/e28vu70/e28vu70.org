Well let's run with the example of power munckinism. If a story doesn't even try to do coherent things there, as with most casual things in this genre, I don't particularly care how good they are at it: it's not the point of the story, so I'm not going to dwell on it. But Worm is putting nominal effort in, which makes me feel it's legitimate to think about these thingsâ”€and that goes horribly wrong because Worm is really bad at using powers remotely intelligently. You can't have a story /about/ creative uses of abilities without it feeling like a problem when people miss extremely obvious things.
