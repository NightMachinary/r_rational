Given in A level my secondary school paid /me/ competitively with the Wards, and the only thing I contributed was improved numbers of low-income students, and then university /far/ outdid them in terms of free money for the same reason as before (but this time they cared more), I really have no illusion that the same government that today happily spends a hundred million on an aircraft has so little ability to fund /literal superheroes defending against city-destroying apocalypses/ that do a hundred billion dollars of damage every strike, a significant fraction of whom─as you say─would otherwise become criminals because they happen to want nonzero compensation.
