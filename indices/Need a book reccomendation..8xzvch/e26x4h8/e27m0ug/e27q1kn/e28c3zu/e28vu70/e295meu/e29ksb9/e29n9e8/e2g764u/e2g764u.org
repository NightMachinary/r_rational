Sorry you've been getting downvoted for stating your opinions. I know it's because Worm is very popular but it's not a good show for this sub.

I applaud you for sticking to it even though you don't like it. Once you've finished the story I'd be curious to hear if it solved any of the issues you've brought up. Please give us an update post if and when you're done!
