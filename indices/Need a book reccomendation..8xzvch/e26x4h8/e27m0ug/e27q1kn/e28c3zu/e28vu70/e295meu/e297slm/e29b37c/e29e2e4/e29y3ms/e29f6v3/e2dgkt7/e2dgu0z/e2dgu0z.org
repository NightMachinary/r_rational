The combination of the obviousness of there being a lot of such reasons with the fact that people on this subreddit aren't amazing at not spoiling things is why I've been avoiding listing ways to munchkin thingsâ”€I don't want people to say "ah, but..." My only such example I made explicit (monetary incentives) was one I expected would be spoiler-free.

I don't think it's likely any objections would satisfy me given the huge array of things they just didn't try, but I'm patient enough to wait until I've finished the story. I believe EY has given his own criticism on these lines, which I haven't read but should be easy to find.
