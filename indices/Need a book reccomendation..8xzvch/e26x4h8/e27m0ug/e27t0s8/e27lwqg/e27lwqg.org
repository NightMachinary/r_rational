Since you asked for books, rather than web serials, I'd like to suggest the following:

- Yoon Ha Lee's "Machineries of Empire" series, with its Sufficiently Advanced [Technology/Magic] in the Calendrical exotics
- Lois McMaster Bujold, and in particular "Falling Free", with its heroic engineers working together to build themselves a future
- Graydon Saunders's "Commonweal" series, beginning with the military fantasy The March North and continuing with the sorcery school A Succession Of Bad Days; this is either a civil engineering manual lost in a fantasy or the other way around, not sure which.
- Rick Cook's "The Wiz Biz" series is trashy pulp, but it's delicious trashy pulp with computer engineers figuring out a magic system. Well, I thought it was delicious. Note that I'm not saying it was /good/.

In terms of web serials, not many people seem to recommend Scott Alexander's "Unsong", but there is no better repository of whale puns and bad Kabbalah in the entirety of fiction.
