[Not the poster] I also found all the books he mentioned except Sufficiently Advanced Magic before I found this subreddit.

Skullduggery Pleasant: Browsing through the YA section of a local library when I was younger. Pretty cover, Fantasy? I read. I used to get lots of books from browsing the library.

Then I got absorbed into webnovels + lightnovels

Mother of learning: recommended from a friend -> most likely from [[/r/webnovels]] or similar

Gam3: found on RRL (RoyalRoadl)

HPMOR: Funniest one this. Someone made a review on a story on RRL and mentioned HPMOR as a an example of "well written antagonists". Now, I think that example was overkill. I found [[/r/rational]] from HPMOR.
