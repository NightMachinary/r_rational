I just found skullduggery pleasant at a local library. HPMOR was from a reccomendation, and it got me hooked. I was googling stories similar to hpmor and mother of learning was mentioned so i gave it a go. From there, somebody reccomended both sufficiently advanced magic and the gam3, which i both liked. Ive kinda hit a dead end though. I have also tried pokemon origin of the species (which was decent), and im currently checking out animorphs: the reckoning (which looks to be good so far).
