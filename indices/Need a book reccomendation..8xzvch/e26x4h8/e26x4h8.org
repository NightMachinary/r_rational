This is so on topic here you can basically just look at our Wiki:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_where_to_find_more_rational_works]]

We also had [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6zr43u/monthly_book_club_perpetual_book_suggestion/][book suggestion threads]] for our "Monthly" Book Club.

Though mind the sidebar:
