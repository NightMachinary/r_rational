The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks. (Maybe the whole culture series)

Ender's Game (mentioned in HPMOR)

Prophet's for the End of Time by Marcos Donnelly (conflict between faith and rationality)

Armor by John Steakley (Ender's game adjacent)

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead by Tom Stoppard (also a movie starring Gary Oldman and Tim Roth)

Those are all the books that have stopped my life for a moment and made me never want to read again. The one on your list that made the cut is HPMOR. Read it once then listened to the Audi version twice all in the span of a year.

Enchanter by Robin W. Bailey has a similar feel to Mother of Learning. Also similar is Riftwar Saga by Raymond Feist. Slightly more serious but not entirely serious.
