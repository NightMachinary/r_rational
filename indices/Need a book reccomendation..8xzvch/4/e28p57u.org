Lots of good recommendations here, so I'll add a couple of easy reading fantasy options. Both got references from HPMOR, either in-story or in an author's note.

Lawrence Watt-Evans' /Legends of Ethshar/ series dips in and out of rational fantasy territory, and they're quite good. None of the characters are hyper-rational, but their behavior is believably within the spectrum of normal humans, irrespective of their role in the plot. Narrative is unpredictable; sometimes there's a hint of deus ex machina but just as often the plots go off the rails in unexpected directions. As with Watt-Evans' other series, the world-building is excellent with well-defined political and magic systems.

Patricia C. Wrede's /Enchanted Forest Chronicles/ are not so much rational as comic fantasy deconstruction. Set in a standard high fantasy universe, with witches, wizards, dragons, magic swords, et c., but similar in tone to Discworld. Main characters tend to be normal-ish people in a world populated largely by overblown caricatures of standard fantasy archetypes.
