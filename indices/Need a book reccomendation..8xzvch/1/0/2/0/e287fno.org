Alexander Wales is the most comparable author, imo, when it comes to having in-character, reasoned decisions that are made within a world that is thought through well enough that there are no obvious paths to victory that are ignored. His Worth the Candle series has already been recommended to you before and I think you'd get a lot of enjoyment out of it.
