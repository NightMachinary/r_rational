Plenty of characters are munchkining. Accord, coil, tattletale, lung. It's just yay in worm there is a very wide spectrum of intelligence and the author keeps creativity blind tightly to intelligence. Lung does his best with what he's got but man is he fucking stupid. It's mostly the thinkers that out think situations.
