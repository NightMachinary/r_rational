The government certainly funds the Protectorate where it matters. Dragon, for instance, receives loads of money to build her suits, and Armsmaster gets enough that he's never been seen worrying about it.

A big chunk of the problem is that giving Ward Tinkers more funding wouldn't substantially improve the outcome of Endbringer fights. As you've seen, most capes aren't powerful enough to do anything but land a few hits that do barely any damage before getting taken out. The same applies to most Tinkers. Armsmaster and Dragon, the only Tinkers we saw who did something useful against Leviathan, are two of the best heroic Tinkers in the world. Dragon is /the/ best. Armsmaster has been working on his prediction algorithm and nanothorns for years, and that's with him being a workaholic with a strong power on top of that. What they can accomplish is not representative of what the average Ward can accomplish; look at Kid Win for a better example of that. (Did insignificant damage with his Alternator Canon and then got KOed.)

Furthermore, there aren't very many Ward Tinkers showing up to Endbringer fights. Out of maybe 250 capes in total, maybe 20 of them are Tinkers, of whom most are adults. I don't have any hard numbers, but I'd guess that maybe five (at most 10) of the defending capes were underage Tinkers. Not enough to really affect the outcome, even with funding.

Now, your point that the government should just pay villains not to be evil is a fair one. There's a couple of problems, though. One is that good, well-balanced people in general are not the sort of people who tend to undergo trigger events. Money is far from the only reason capes go villain. Another is that crime /does/ pay, really well if you're a powerful cape that can interfere with an Endbringer. It would be hard for the Protectorate to justify handing out seven-figure salaries right and left, especially when most of the recipients of said salaries woudnt actually show up to the fights. That brings us to another problem. Attendance at Endbringer fights is voluntary; someone who only joins the Protectorate for the money isn't going to want to stick their neck out against a city-destroying monster that kills at least a quarter of the defenders on average.
