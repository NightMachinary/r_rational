It seemed like a significant number of villains are willing to fight them. At minimum putting them on the good guys' team means you need to throw fewer of them in jail, and what I've read so far is that a lot of them are in jail. Even just getting some of the others off the streets or doing lesser hero work frees up time for the major capes to focus on their class-S hero work; [[#s][minor spoiler]].
