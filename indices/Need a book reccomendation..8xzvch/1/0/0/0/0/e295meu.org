That's kind of missing the whole point of Worm though; its characters put thought into how they use their powers, but they're irrational in the same way people are irrational- not in the "hurr durr not everything has to be rational it's a story guyz" way, but like, in real life people make sub-optimal decisions all the time, but not necessarily arbitrary ones.

To use an example, if a character withholds information from someone who could help them, for no reason other than to drive the plot, that's bad writing. If a character withholds information from someone who could help, because they are mistrustful of authority figures, and they're mistrustful of authority figures because they've been frequently mistreated and ignored by people in power in the past, and those people in power weren't comic book villans, but realistic depictions of people with human biases goals, and flaws... then yes, it's probably irrational for a character to be cagey to a character wanting to help, but it's irrational in a way that is realistic. That's what worm is, the characters aren't always rational, but it's never arbitrary.
