Wow, first time I've ever seen Skullduggery Pleasant outside my bookshelf!

[[/u/Veedrac]] is right, you'll like most anything that this sub likes. I feel obligated to recommend Worm, as it's one of my favorite books of all time, even though it's not thematically related to the other ones you posted. [[http://www.parahumans.net][www.parahumans.net]]

Also, if you don't know about China Mieville, check him out. He writes excellent urban fantasy. Kraken specifically is really really good.
