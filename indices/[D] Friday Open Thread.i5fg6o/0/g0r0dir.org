I hate When Authors take the possibility of the MC losing out of the equation for a situation.

I.e. "your team must win, or YOU AND EVERYONE DIES!"

I immediately roll my eyes, since the author here went for cheap suspense, meaning he won't actually kill off the main character or else. . .story over. and any loss won't really be too substantial or . . story over. The author won't try to subvert it either as they'd have to get people used to other characters enough that there is no real main character(Game of Thrones before season 6) so that characters CAN die and DO die from making bad choices. Subverting this would make readers stop reading. It would be better to just "strongly imply" that the MC would die if he loses, but not outright say it, so that the reader actually has some suspense. Too many times Authors tend to spoil their own story arcs (or even stories) when they don't need to.
