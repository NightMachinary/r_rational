I wrote The Fifth Defiance, which is a web serial that posits that superhumans reduced the world to post apoc status in short order, so obviously my thoughts are that the # is very very low.

Essentially every one which is stronger than the military, you roll a dice for their particular reaction to the Ring of Gygax test, let your particular assumptions re: human nature fill in the values on the table you are rolling on.

Once you hit one of those bad values, that's pretty much it for your society, unless one of the other super powerful people rolled that they want to stop them.
