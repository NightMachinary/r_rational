Depends entirely on the powers in question, and who gets them. A whole bunch of people having the equivalent of a firearm is probably not that big of a deal. A handful of people having the Death Note ... that might be enough to bring low human civilization.

Generally speaking though, I think society could handle almost any number of "street level" powers, if not entirely cleanly. The biggest change would be that the monopoly on violence that the state enjoys would be challenged, but that's nothing that states haven't had to deal with in the past. People with powers would be inducted into the police and military, or licensed, or imprisoned, and the only way that would seriously upset the status quo is if sufficient power ended up in the hands of those who were opposed to the state in one way or another, or if it led to serious escalation of conflict between state and non-state actors. (Note: I am not talking specifically about the United States here, but rather, the relationship between the state, violence, and the citizenry.)

Most people don't have a propensity for violence, and don't want to use violence, and are perfectly content to go their whole lives without throwing a punch except in a moment of passion. Those moments of passion would probably be more deadly if more people had street-level superpowers, but that's not catastrophic to society. Even among criminals, the vast majority of them don't particularly want to hurt anyone, they want to take stuff and then get away without being caught. Robbery (defined as the use of physical force or threat of force in the commission of a theft) /typically/ doesn't have a desire for violence as a motivating factor, though it sometimes occurs as a matter of escalation, self-defense, etc. Most violent crimes are between two people who have a prior relationship (same goes for most sexual crimes). Given that, I think even with powers, you probably wouldn't see that much change?

It gets more complicated if we're talking about powers that aren't street-level, especially if they're exotic, and have no known analog in modern society. Automatic truth detection, being able to pull memories, mind control, body control, future sight, past sight, teleportation, portals, all those kinds of things ... it's harder to say, and an analysis of how society might break down depends on how many of those types of powers exist, and what their distribution is.

(One of the things that irks me about a lot of superpower stories is that people instantly change when they gain power, which is interesting, and generates conflict, but which I'm not confident is actually how the world (or the people in it) works. I think a lot of people, if they had the equivalent of a firearm with them all the time, simply wouldn't ever use it, or would otherwise be responsible and conscientious citizens. It's certainly more interesting to have a story about someone who gains the power of invisibility and then does a bunch of terrible things, but realistic in the average case? Citation needed.)
