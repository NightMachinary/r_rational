It depends what you mean by "breaking down". Also it depends a lot on the specific powers people get.

If you assume a basically Worm-ish setup where people who are generally unstable get powers that are mostly good for crime, but not massively powerful, I'd expect that society would generally continue, I'd just be worse. There'd be more murders, robberies, rapes, and other crimes, and the police would be less able to stop them, but not at the kind of rate that would collapse human civilization.

That is, as long as powers don't give individual people the power to challenge world governments (e.g. the higher end of power levels for Superman). At that point, every single superhero is an existential threat to human civilization. It just takes one guy with the power of "supervolcano control" deciding that the universe is better off without humanity to cause a global extinction event. Even if there are other heroes who support the continued existence of civilization, the collateral damage from taking down rogues would be immense.

But it also depends on the kind of power, not just the strength. Worm-style Tinkers wouldn't collapse civilization in the same way that serial killer Superman would, but they could probably cause something like the Singularity, which probably counts as "society breaking down". Someone with mental powers that aren't all that impressive on their own could also destroy society by mind-controlling people with access to nukes.
