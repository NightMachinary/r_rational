  But I think a lot of people fantasize about getting to right great injustices.

I think you are on to an interesting line of thought. Locating crimes as a super powered vigilante would be hard because of the logistics of finding crime, but going after the people in power that perpetuate systemic injustices is straightforward and easy to target.

  Wouldn't you be at least a /little/ tempted to fly over to your head of government, bounce some bullets off your chest, and demand that your grievances be addressed?

It wouldn't even take that much...

To imagine an even more banal scenario, with even more law abiding and reasonable citizens, think of the current protests in the US, how the cops would overreact to a protestor with invulnerability sufficient to make them immune to rubber bullets and tear gas standing out in the middle of retreating crowd. The cops react by escalating further... maybe empty a few clips into the invulnerable with many shots missing and striking the crowd. Now imagine a person with a reflective shield power instinctively activates it, reflecting the bullets back at the cops that escalate further and fire more shots now that they are taking "return fire". By the end of the day, the police would label every super powered person involved a super powered terrorist, and even a "reasonable" (given the Overton window of the US) president might concur, never mind our current president who would probably call for the deaths of the superpowereds involved.

In other words, a reasonably peaceful group of protestors could get radicalized overnight just with the current way US law enforcement tends to escalate situations. Of course, the US government doesn't always escalate... see for example the Bundy Standoff, but if the superpowers went to historically marginalized groups, and the government kept its current way of responding to them, vigilantes and supers opposed to the government would be an almost inevitable outcome.
