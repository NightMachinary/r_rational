  I think a lot of people, if they had the equivalent of a firearm with them all the time, simply wouldn't ever use it, or would otherwise be responsible and conscientious citizens.

I think it depends on the strength of the powers. If you give someone a gun-tier energy blast, sure, they'll probably treat it basically like a gun. Maybe a little more costumed vigilantism, because that's what they've been acculturated to see as appropriate for people with energy blasts.

But I think a lot of people fantasize about getting to right great injustices. To fight global warming, or famine, or genocide, or any number of other things. And I think if you gave people the kind of power that would let them do that, I think a lot of them would. And, yeah, probably not by just running down a list of political opponents and punching them to death, but probably with at least the /threat/ of force.

Imagine that you were a gay man in the 1980s, or a black man in the 1950s, or a political prisoner in a Soviet Gulag in the 1930s, and you suddenly gained the powers of Superman. Wouldn't you be at least a /little/ tempted to fly over to your head of government, bounce some bullets off your chest, and demand that your grievances be addressed?
