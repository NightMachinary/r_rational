What percentage of the population do you think could get superpowers without society breaking down, particularly worm style powers where every power is useful for combat at least? I feel like it has to be limited to a few thousand people for stuff to not change too much, and under 1% if we don't want a complete change to everything. I guess at near 100% it would become normal but society would have major upheaval before the world settled down.
