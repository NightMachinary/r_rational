  With Rey, what's keeping her out the dating scene, other than that she's poor? OK, sure, living on a desert planet, with no apparent access to a shower means she likely smells worse than a bantha's hindquarters... that might not be too bad if you always stay upwind of Rey while outside, but inside a spaceship... ugh. Anyway, aside from that, there's not much to turn a prospective date off.

Family issues /should be/ a big one, but it doesn't get enough focus/realism in the trilogy (despite it ostensibly being one of the major throughlines). Abandonment issues, fear of commitment, etc. /should/ all have been defining character traits/flaws. But it's not even that the execution didn't work, it's that they didn't even really try.
