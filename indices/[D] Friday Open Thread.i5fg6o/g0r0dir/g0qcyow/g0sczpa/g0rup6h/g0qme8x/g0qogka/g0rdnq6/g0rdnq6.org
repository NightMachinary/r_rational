this seems like a really bizarre criterion and almost opposite of the one I would use. Mary Sue doesn't mean "likable". Most Mary Sue characters are, frankly, annoying, the sorts of people I wouldn't want to date. And conversely, there are plenty of well-written, immediately-likable, non-Mary-Sue characters where I'd probably go "sure, I'd date them" at the beginning.
