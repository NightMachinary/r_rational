So I was watching [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5BL6d7MOMY][The Critical Drinker Fixes... Rey]] earlier this week. (warning: he lays on the Scottish accent quite heavily, it is annoying to some people).

In the video, he's talking about the "what" and the "why" of how to make an interesting character that can realistically see some growth through the events of the story.

And for whatever reason, I was thinking of a quick litmus test for aspiring writers to judge whether or not one of their main characters is a Mary Sue or not. The test is: Would you date this person or not if you met them at the start of their journey? If the answer is an unhesitating "yes", then you might have a problem.

With Rey, what's keeping her out the dating scene, other than that she's poor? OK, sure, living on a desert planet, with no apparent access to a shower means she likely smells worse than a bantha's hindquarters... that might not be too bad if you always stay upwind of Rey while outside, but inside a spaceship... ugh. Anyway, aside from that, there's not much to turn a prospective date off.

Compare that to Luke or Han at the start of Ep4. Han's kind of roguishly charming sure, but also... not a thug per se, but not someone you'd be glad to bring home to meet the folks either. Luke is kind of a dork or an eager puppy, which he grows /way/ out of by the end of Ep6.
