So Im reading Children of Dune and Im a bit confused about what is going on.

My understanding is that because Alia has access to all past lives of her genetic history that a personality from the past has taken control and become the one in charge, so to speak. This is because she used it ever since birth and had no core of self to protect her mind. That comes from an overdependence on the spice to gain prophetic visions and is why they call her an Abomination.

She is trying to get the twins to use the spice in the hopes of them being overwhelmed by a past personality, possibly the one controlling her now, in some kind of prophetic singularity?

Am I right or did I miss it completely? Im only 30 or so pages in and I dont want to go any farther if Im misinterpreting the entire premise of the book.
