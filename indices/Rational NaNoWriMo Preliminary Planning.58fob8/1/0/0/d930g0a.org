The plot pretty much writes itself: Rational protagonist experiences trauma, awakens superpower, is thrown into a world gone crazy where superpowered gangs fight eachother for domination, joins up with other superpower users and tries to stop everything from going to hell...

Actually that sounds a /lot/ like worm now that I think about it. More focus on the mystical aspects of the magic and its effect on society though, and less about giant monsters destroying everything. Still... hm.
