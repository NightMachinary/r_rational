Arrggh, I only just started posting my giant Naruto fanfic and then you mentioned this, and now I have a great new idea for a totally different story that I can't get out of my head:

It's a Worm-esque setting where young people across the world suddenly develop powers, only instead of the powers being super useful and convenient they're terrifying because A) the users get no feedback whatsoever and so they don't know what they're doing (teleportation without knowing where you will teleport to, let's say) and B) you only gets powers if you have a certain extreme personality type, and the crazier you are the more powerful you get. So the whole world quickly goes to hell as a result, and our (slightly less crazy) protagonists have to (maybe?) save the day.

The powers I have in mind, depending on craziness:\\
1. Asperger/introverted: Telekinesis, mental type power\\
2. sociopathy/dissociative disorder: Bending space/time/reality\\
3. chaotic/manic/borderline types: Energy manipulation, i.e. nuke everything\\
4. Some sort of life/mind/body manipulation power?

What do you guys think? Sound interesting or not? I'll probably finish NTBS first before I write any of it regardless, just to be on the safe side...
