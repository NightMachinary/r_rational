I want to write the schlockiest schlock that ever schlocked that's a sort of mix between XCOM and the X-Files, where the villain is a eldritch cult transplanting humans to other planets and dimensions for...reasons.

One of the two viewpoint characters is going to have been a baby sacrifice meant for an interrupted ritual twenty years ago, and work as both a stand in to get the audience up to speed and as a McGuffin for the rest of the cast. He'll get thrown into generic fantasy world and be seperate from the rest of events as he figures out the mechanics of some of the paranormal stuff mostly for the readers benefit.

The other viewpoint character is a new member of the XCOM wannabees, recruited for his natural resistance against the sanity warping effects of the cult and other supernatural stuff.

How do I write schlock that's fun to read, without being too eye rolling? How do I make it sound intentionally over the top and not just bad?
