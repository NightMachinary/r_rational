I see some common themes in our two stories :-)

I'm curious to know how your protagonist discovers they have this power, since so little information is carried back, but once they're learnt to iterate it can be seriously useful.

I love mostly world building stories myself, almost to the point of finding plot a nuisance sometimes, but I think you do need a conflict to hang your first scenario on. Maybe you have this in hand already.

For me if I can learn to get things right by iteration I could certainly win at life FSVO, but there is a downside, or at least a cost.

Do I age as I do multiple time loops, or is it mental time travel only? I won't get Groundhog style bored if you don't remember the loops, but I will get bored of sticking to my planning and pre-commitment routine, so I'd need a good reason to go to the trouble, which will be more gripping if it's not just getting rich and winning the partner of my choice or whatever.

And at what point do I give up. I mean if I've worked out that I reset this loop eleventy times and it still goes wrong, do I accept that?
