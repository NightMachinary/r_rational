  I'm curious to know how your protagonist discovers they have this power, since so little information is carried back, but once they're learnt to iterate it can be seriously useful.

In both cases, they are genius physicists who managed to invent their respective machines. It's the main reason for them meeting up in the first scenario, because they know each other vaguely as respected names in the required background fields to invent their technology. Also it's strikingly common to have multiple people invent/discover scientific devices/principles simultaneously throughout history, so this is another instance. I might even sneak in foreknowledge warnings to force a meeting as well.

  I love mostly world building stories myself, almost to the point of finding plot a nuisance sometimes, but I think you do need a conflict to hang your first scenario on. Maybe you have this in hand already.

I don't really, which is why I'm having so much trouble with the first scenario. What's a Good vs Good conflict I can involve the two in which doesn't lead to them cooperating once they meet or have one of them be a psychopath? They need to be intelligent and emotionally competent individuals. I'm actually hoping for a moral conflict like in Three Worlds Collide between the SuperHappy Aliens and Fun Humans. A future disaster where they think the other person is the initiating cause? Their devices both operate off of (seemingly) incompatible theories and they argue over it? I like the last one, but I have no idea how to resolve the conflict since the two time-travel abilities *are* incompatible, and have bizarre interactions.

  Do I age as I do multiple time loops, or is it mental time travel only? I won't get Groundhog style bored if you don't remember the loops, but I will get bored of sticking to my planning and pre-commitment routine, so I'd need a good reason to go to the trouble, which will be more gripping if it's not just getting rich and winning the partner of my choice or whatever.

For the reset power, it's only receiving a single bit of information from the future to indicate a reset with no memories attached. Planning and precommitments are /mandatory/, for the optimal use of it. I'll be focusing on multiple users with the power interacting once I finish going through all of the exploits with a single user and the hilarious failures when you don't precommit. Situations where you need multiple uses with very little time to plan things out would also be interesting. For the stable time loop power, only messages are passed back with no memories sent back and are self-consistent.

#+begin_quote
  And at what point do I give up. I mean if I've worked out that I reset this loop eleventy times and it still goes wrong, do I accept that?
#+end_quote

There's a small time delay from loop to loop. If you reset once, you need to wait a few seconds before you can get a signal from the future to indicate a second reset (remember you don't keep your memories so you can't know how many times you have reset if you don't precommit to only reset once per savepoint). So given enough loops, you'll run out of time before you face the dangerous situation.
