I'm flip flopping between a story where two people with different time-travel abilities are in conflict like I [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53ns0s/rational_nanowrimo/d7uo6pm][mentioned]] before or to just write a story about the RPG-style scientific experiments of someone investigating the self-consistent time-travel power with no antagonists interfering.

The first one is more material I can write and is easier to structure a plot around, but there's a lot of work and world-building I still have to do ahead of time. The second one is better and might help me plan the first story as a 'sequel' of sorts. It's also easier to write with minimal preplanning. I only need the rules for one power and don't even need any world-building (it'll be something I can write as part of the story as I progress rather than something I do in the background). It'd be an extensive manual or guide to explain how Stable Time Loops works under many scenarios. I might even write about multiple Stable Time Loops with varying algorithms selecting from several potential stable loops.

I'll probably do the second story and use it as a 'manual' where I act as a GM after NaNoWriMo for the folks here investigating a strange time travel device. It'll be fun to do. I did something [[https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/32m6di/experimenting_with_time_travel/][similar]] a year ago and botched that one, so I'd like to try it again with better planning and a weekly hypothesis testing.

Eh, I'll just write about both and count the two of them towards my total word count.
