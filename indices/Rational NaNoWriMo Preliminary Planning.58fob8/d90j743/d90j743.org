3.  Does it have a will of its own?

4.  Is it restricted in space and time?

5.  What does available magic do?

6.  How does it relate to the character, plot and theme of the book?

7.  What is the cost of magic?

8.  What can it not do?

9.  How long does it last?

10. Who can use it?

11. How do others react to it?

If you want a more in-depth discussion on magic, I highly recommend Brandon Sanderson's 3 laws of magic. He discusses how limiting magic can increase the way it can be used by the characters instead of having them wave their hand and solve all their problems without effort.
