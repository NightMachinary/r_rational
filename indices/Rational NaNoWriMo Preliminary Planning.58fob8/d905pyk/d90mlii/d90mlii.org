  A handwavy 'invisible hand' that keeps history almost exactly the same - which is probably the least rational bit that I can't easily fix.

You could use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)][Isaac Asimov's Psychohistory]] as an explanation. If you limit the number of people that are reborn, then in the greater scheme of things, events are usually bound to happen. For instance, there is a real list of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries][multiple independent discoveries]] that you can lean on.

For example, even if someone goes back and kills Hitler, the German people still had at least a civil war coming due to the socio-economic pressures after World War 1. Events and inventions rarely happen in isolation.
