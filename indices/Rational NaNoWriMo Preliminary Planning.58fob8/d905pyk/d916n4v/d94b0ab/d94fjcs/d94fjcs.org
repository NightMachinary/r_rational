That's the one I probably take the most issue with. There doesn't seem to be any real reason for that to exist, especially assuming battery tech doesn't get a lot better and AR exists.

I'd expect that to be a gimmick that generally doesn't do too well. For people who want always-on computing, carrying AR specs will work better. For people who don't, are they going to accept the battery trade-off implied by a flexible screen?
