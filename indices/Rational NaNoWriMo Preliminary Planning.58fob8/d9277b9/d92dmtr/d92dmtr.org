What do you want to describe the magic energy as? As a liquid roiling through the body? As a tank of energy/MP bar? As solid particles instead of liquids or more of a fluid-like description? Go for /how/ you plan on describing the magic energy and how it will be used. Knowing the desired wording which will be associated with it can help to influence a name. You can decide on harsh /k/ syllables, smoother /m/ syllables, long and grandiose names, short and catchy name, and other qualities of the word you want before coming up with examples.

  I'm also trying to come up with a name for mages who are able to get into physical combat a la Naruto's ninjas.

One name I've seen used once in a story (Savage Divinity) as a joke was muscle wizard.
