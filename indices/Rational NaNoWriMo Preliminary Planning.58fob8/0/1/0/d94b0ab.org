Yes. Some of my obvious extrapolations will be:-

Foldable/rollable phones and tablets, chemputer drug machines (with associated licensing expenses), smartspecs for partially sighted people, AR, spiralling financial breakdown in some parts of the world and global warming :-(

I am going to assume room temp fusion is a no go, so there will be a belated push for cutting energy use, plus renewables and a subculture of some people wanting to go back to the land.
