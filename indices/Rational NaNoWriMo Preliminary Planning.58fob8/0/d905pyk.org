I finished nano last year but the plot was kind of full of holes, so this year I'm doing actual planning. So far I have:

- A world which is like our own with one difference, a very few people get reborn as their younger selves (mental time travel) - so you are five years old but with all the memories you had when you 'died'

- A semi-plausible but untestable explanation of why that might be - so it's not just done by magic or gods, at least.

- A handwavy 'invisible hand' that keeps history almost exactly the same - which is probably the least rational bit that I can't easily fix.

- A protagonist who is born in 1955 and lives into the near future. No, I haven't fixed what the near future is going to be like yet, and yes, that makes the story easily outdated. That's kind of a problem, but I need to do it cos I DON'T want to write anyone older who lives through WWII (too many terrible tropes)

- An antagonist mentor, sort of. I have been interrogating them in the bath (when I'm in the bath, I mean, I talk to my characters when I'm bathing for some reason) so I know their aims and why they think they are a good person trying to do the right thing. Some terrible tropes averted - I hope.

- A character and family background for my protagonist (working on antagonist.)

- Not enough other characters - how many is enough? I know my last book had too many, so maybe starting with too few is good?

- Zero love interest (don't know if I want one, probably not.)

- More subplots than I have room for, in terms of ways to munchkin your foreknowledge, ways to survive doing childhood AGAIN etc.

- A couple of bits of actually worked out foreshadowing.

- Not enough of an idea on what order I will show things to the reader

- Unanswered questions: like how many reborn are there? What do they have in common? And any other unanswered questions I get from here

- I'm still a bit fuzzy on the ending, but I do have a couple of ideas, either of which could lead into a sequel, but hopefully not in an obviously unfinished looking way...

And I only have ten days before it starts - no idea if I can finish planning by then. /is scared/
