Following your reasoning and using the in story arguments:

How is what Mary is doing to herself any different than what Joon is doing with his level up?

You can argue that Joon's desire for leveling up is a core part of who he is but he views it as a negative utility and so he chooses to lower its value. Mary does not like that she has feelings for Joon and sees it as negative utility. By changing her romantic values towards Joon she is resolving the problem.

In terms of abortion, if Mary was carrying hers and Joon's child, she reserves the right to terminate that pregnancy because its her body. She reserves the right to terminate any feelings she has for Joon because its her soul. She thinks that Joon should do the same but she is letting him make that decision for himself.

Yes, it will make her a different person, but so does anything that anybody does. Carrying baby Solace is altering both her body and soul too but it doesn't seem like you're arguing against that choice.

Yes, one could argue about the negative slippery slope but that's all hypothetical and the same could be said for it in the positive.
