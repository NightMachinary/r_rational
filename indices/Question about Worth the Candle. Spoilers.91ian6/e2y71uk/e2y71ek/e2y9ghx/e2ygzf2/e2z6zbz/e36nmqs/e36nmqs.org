I think the abortion example is ill chosen, since the soul alteration is changing something that is exclusively and irrevocably her and hers, while a child is the result and property of a joint effort, and a husband would have equal claim to an unborn child or newly born child.

A better example would be her removing a part of her own body, like a toe or finger. You may not like it, but it's not your body.
