The most recent chapter is 112 and so far it's at the point of "agree to disagree" but it's sounding like a setup for a subplot sooner rather than later.

Then again, June is doing the same thing. He's just being a hypocrite about it and since the story is from his perspective, his pov is all we get.

- both are arguably dm meddling but just as likely the person's natural feelings of the subject

- Both characters have been bothered by their affliction since the first few chapters and neither of them has mentioned their concerns to the other

One is presented in a way that makes it make sense while the other is presented in a way that makes the reader uncomfortable, but they are both the same action taken for the same reasons.

Don't worry though, in the chapters that follow the speaker glosses over the issue like he glosses over his powergaming mindset and the way Mary treated him just slightly differently than others, so you don't have to think about the implications until you want to or the story gets back around to the resolution of those behaviors / events.
