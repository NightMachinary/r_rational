I see self as core part of mind. Its a loose definition, but I don't try to enforce it.

Violation vs alteration as wording doesn't matter much to me. Violation better reflect how I feel here, but you can change it to alteration and my point doesn't really change.

Your addiction example is not very comparable as force of will, self-reflection, and pharmaceutical therapy is 'natural' progression, development vs alteration if you like. That would be another question if you asked about removing it from soul. I personally see it as less core part, but it's just my view.

And I'm not persuading anyone, just stating my view on the problem.
