Your point in general is well-stated and I think I get where you're coming from. The points I don't address here (eg. around her childhood) are skipped mostly because I think they're solid, not because I'm dismissing them.

  a weird soul-patch is very different from a delayed archery competition

This is the same DM that presumably made Juniper trigger an infohazard which then didn't kill him to warn him off downtime. He's subtle about it, but hardly indirect. As you say, he's primarily about plausible deniability, so as long as there aren't numbers or soul mages involved he has pretty free reign. /Click/, he goes, and Amaryllis has an unexplainable attraction to Juniper. No observable manipulation required.

  What does core character mean here? Because it looks a whole lot like "the person Amarilys is supposed to be" but then who is that and why doesn't she have confusing feelings during puberty?

Ultimately my view is that the goal should be to be the healthy, happy and productive individual you wish yourself to be. The reason I worry about self modification in the general case is because it substitutes heavy-handed and dangerous bandaids for healthy development and skill acquisition, not because I'm against it prima facie.

I don't think Amaryllis is getting that kind of positive return on this; even if she would later end up in a romantic relationship, I don't see it being of the same sort, with the same difficulties and strengths. Maybe I'm suffering the mind-projection fallacy here, but she really does strike me as someone who would like others for different reasons than she does Juniper.
