  I'm still not sure how this all relates to the claims you were replying to.

Maybe we're veering off topic?

You say Amarylis attraction is the result of direct mind alteration because it's very peculiar to which I respond with the idea that it would be more likely that Amarylis be indirectly condition to have this peculiar trait or that she's simply been prevented from meeting other people than Joon who trigger it by DM conspiracy.

The reason I support this idea is that while the alternative interpretation could also be true this would imply that the DM is constrained by factors other than the rules he sets for himself. The DM would obviously like for his world to have people in it that act like he wants them to naturally so the fact that he needs to intercede directly to get the romance going means that everything else that's happened needs to be suspected of at least that much tampering. We know there is some tampering involved already but the previous baseline was that which a single person with nearly perfect foresight could accomplish with a week worth of preparation. Directly altering peoples personalities sets the benchmark so hight that we no longer have any reason to believe people exist before Joon meets them or after he leaves the room.
