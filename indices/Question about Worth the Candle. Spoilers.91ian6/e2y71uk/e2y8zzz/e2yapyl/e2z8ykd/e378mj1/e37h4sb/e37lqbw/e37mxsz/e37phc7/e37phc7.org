  Click, he goes, and Amaryllis has an unexplainable attraction to Juniper.

Again Amarilys believes this as well in her notes it's classified as the bullshit theory but it amounts to the same as "Amarylis is an NPC who lacks consciousness" as situations where the DM can escape observation is equal to all situations ever.

I don't think I know Amarilys well enough to say anything about her love life. Perhaps she would be both happiest and closest to her perfect self by playing host to an alien parasite or turning into an amorphous self-replicating ooze. But whether or not what she's doing is fine in principal the concern for people in universe is radical self-experimentation while under the influence of the same juvenile irrationality inducing hormones she's so eager to get rid of. Something that closely pattern matches poor decision making in fiction if nothing else. There is little reason to believe she knows what she's doing or that it will turn out like she's expecting so all those concerns about self-modifcation definitely apply here.
