I don't see any evidence that Amaryllis has lived a life that would make her specifically attracted to Juniper. She also said "I'm fairly sure that it's confined just to you", so there's nothing it seems to be an extension of, and most worrisomely she said

  And if you weren't able to fix me, if my flesh was still unwilling, I'm pretty sure that I can reach into my soul and fix myself that way, until I wanted it as much as you did.

That all screams much more that her attraction to is an ad-hoc patch, rather than a core part of her being.

I don't think the DM has said anything implying otherwise, and he's done a lot to show how directly he meddles with things. Heck, given how much deception there is in WtC, even if the DM /had/ directly said otherwise I wouldn't consider that particularly irrefutable: he clearly has a biasing motive to convince Juniper to Take Things Seriously.

As to "an axe to grind"... well I'll admit I'm fairly aromantic, so what matters to me is less the signalling and more the constructive dynamic, eg. [[#s][Marked for Death]]. So "I'm dating you because I'm randomly attracted to you" would grate at me, but if Amaryllis de-romanced herself and /then/ decided that a relationship with Juniper would be a good idea before re-romancing herself, I'd be all for it. (Which is not to say that Fenn needs to do this dance, since her situation doesn't seem similarly contrived. To put it another way, if after you turn down your sexual attraction and a relationship looks "like idiocy or lunacy or both", it's probably not a relationship you should be in. This is not a fact particular to fiction.)
