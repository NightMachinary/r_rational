Think of the DM as an illusion mage from the recent chapters and how many layers of paranoia things went into with the tacit understanding that there was a limit to how deeply and how many people could be deceived.

The DM's gentleman's agreement that he isn't doing what you've just described and that things are meant to look as though they could plausibly be true in a universe without the DM in it (aside from the game layer) are the only reasons to think anything is happening or that Juniper actually exists and isn't just a brain in a jar. It could be bullshit and we'd never know but there is no reason to believe both that mind control is happening and that everything isn't just a dream. If the DM is limited in capacity then he would be more limited by other things than this.
