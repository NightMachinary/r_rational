I'm still not sure how this all relates to the claims you were replying to.

  The category of the thing being altered - romantic and sexual attraction is a central personality trait. It's what makes people make decisions about who they are and what their goals are.

I agree for most people, but it's worth noting they aren't nearly the totality of it.

  It means that anything else such as filial piety, aggressiveness, ego etc. could simply have been added and subtracted when the plot demanded.

I don't think this is what happened; I think the DM is being honest when he said his character meddling was ahead of time. In many ways I view the DM as an author proxy: you set your characters up to do make the decisions you want them to ahead of time, but once they're out in the wild you let them develop naturally. As to the infohazard event, there are ways to guide actions without meddling with core personalities, as today's experts would attest.
