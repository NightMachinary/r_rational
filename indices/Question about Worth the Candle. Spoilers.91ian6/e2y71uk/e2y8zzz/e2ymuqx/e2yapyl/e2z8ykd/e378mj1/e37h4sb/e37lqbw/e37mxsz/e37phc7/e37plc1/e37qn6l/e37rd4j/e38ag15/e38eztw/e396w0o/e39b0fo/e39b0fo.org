  The DM would obviously like for his world to have people in it that act like he wants them to naturally so the fact that he needs to intercede directly to get the romance going means that everything else that's happened needs to be suspected of at least that much tampering.

I don't think "naturally" is a useful word here. I agree that the DM seems to want the story being told to be largely a product of the characters' agency in response to the situation they are in. I believe this because agentful characters make for a better story.

I don't particularly think he's equally concerned about the naturalness of how those characters became who they are, in the sense that "Amaryllis just happens to have this subset of genes that make her attractive to Juniper" is /less/ Watsonian than "Amaryllis is attractive to Juniper because the DM wanted it". Where a truly Watsonian explanation makes sense, like how Grak's backstory affects his character, I expect the DM values that, but when it comes to aspects that are intrinsically Doyolist (oh look, you're all princesses) it only takes away impact to attribute it to chance. It is better in this sense to give the agency to the DM than to give it to nobody.

Does that make my stance a bit clearer?
