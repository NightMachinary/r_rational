I think everything being /fake/ is inarguably true since everything is artificial. The only question is the how much effort is going into the deception. If Amarylis who is a major focus hasn't been fleshed out to the extent of being a plausibly organic development of the world she exists within then nobody who Joon interacts with will likely be anything more than superficially human like.

The category of the thing being altered - romantic and sexual attraction is a central personality trait. It's what makes people make decisions about who they are and what their goals are. It means that anything else such as filial piety, aggressiveness, ego etc. could simply have been added and subtracted when the plot demanded. NPCs like this will react to socializing in the way that's expected but if they're being altered by the DM then stuff like Nellan being invented in the moment drama was needed for Fenn and Joons relationship becomes a possibility as well.
