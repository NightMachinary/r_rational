If she just got over it as DM said - it would not be what I hoped, but that's fine with me.

My problem is how it is done. Violation of self is good wording of how I feel about it. At this point I'm pretty invested with characters and can't just ignore it and read for the general plot.

Since it is not addressed in remaining 17 chapters I guess I'll wait it out and return with this question in half a year or something.
