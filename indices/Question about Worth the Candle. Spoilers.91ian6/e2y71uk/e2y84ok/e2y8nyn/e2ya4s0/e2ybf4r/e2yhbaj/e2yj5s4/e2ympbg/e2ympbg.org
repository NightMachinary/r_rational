If I copy whole mind of what I consider perfect person into my mind, but retain my memories - I will be another person with same memories. I don't think that's okay. Of course that's extreme case, we are not static beings so some change should be okay. But there should be cut of somewhere.

I personally find removing desire for heroin or level up before cut of, making yourself unlove someone - after cutoff.
