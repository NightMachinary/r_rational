I don't think tattoo is alteration of self. It more like (semi)permanent clothes, a layer after 'self' that we present to the world.

I understand that she chose to do it herself, so violation is weird word here, but I don't think changing our core self at will is good thing.

There is obvious question of what is core here. If she just turned down here sexual desires, a may have being okay with this. But if I read this right she removed(turned down) all what made her love/like him despite everything. I see it as too deep into 'self' to be okay with it.
