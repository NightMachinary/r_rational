    “It took a deep dive into the social aspect of the soul, but I was eventually able to find the lever for romantic and sexual attraction. All I did was reduce them both down to nothing. I'm fairly sure that it's confined just to you, and it's entirely reversible.” She gave me a gentle smile. “Joon, you don't have any idea how good it feels. It's like a pressure that's been lifted off me.” She hesitated slightly. “I know that to some extent you reciprocated. I think I can help show you where to make the change, if you -- if this doesn't help alleviate things on your end.”

If I read this correctly, Amaryllis only removed her romantic and sexual attraction to Joon. She still likes him, and it doesn't look like she changed anything regarding Joon in particular, just a general change to asexuality.

Which I guess merely means there's just no longer the... I guess pain of being attracted to someone knowing there's no real hope of ending up with them? I think that more or less describes the reason she did it; I personally don't really understand the issue with it.
