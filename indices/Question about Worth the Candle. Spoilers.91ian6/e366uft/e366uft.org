If you had the ability to change yourself (whether by magic, technology, medicine, or mundane means like simply getting some accountability, doing some practice, and changing a habit), would you? Excise something purely negative, like procrastination, gluttony, or laziness? Increase something positive, like intelligence, memory, or patience?

Obviously, changing something like Mary does would be more controversial, and if this sort of deeper change were easily available I am sure some people would mess themselves up.

But people mess themselves up and improve themselves all the time, being natural doesn't automatically make it OK and being artificial doesn't make it bad...
