It's "addressed" in the sense that the narration makes it clear that it really does not sit right with Joon either, and he and Amy fight about it.

Ultimately, Joon has to ask Amy and Fenn to forcibly pin him down and alter the value of "Level Up" in his own soul (and the need for this gets increasingly severe, because his desire to level up to the exclusion of all else gets more intense every time he levels up and the higher his level is) although he justifies this by reasoning that the DM is messing with his mind in the first place. For Amy's part, the DM arguably molded her mind for the purpose of crushing on Joon from the very start.

I wouldn't say it's /resolved/ but it is addressed. It's clear that the fiction isn't taking soul changes lightly, at least. That said, if you're not satisfied a few more chapters in, you probably won't be satisfied for the remainder unless it's revisited.
