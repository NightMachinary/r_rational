I'm noticing a weird side effect to doing something like that, I think?

Like, I play too many games, for too long. So I keep reinforcing the part of my brain that make distractions not feel good.

So now when I need to be distracted, or otherwise not do The Most Important Thing, I feel like shit.

So now I'm repeating to myself: Get out of the car. There's no combination of buttons (aka, self-alterations to do) to do it; you just Get Out Of The Car. [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/]]
