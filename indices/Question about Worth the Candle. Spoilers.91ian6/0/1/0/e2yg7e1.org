I understand your issues--it's a serious and problematic thing to do--but don't you think it's in character for Amaryllis? She's ruthlessly pragmatic in every facet of her life. She saw a problem, assessed her options, and took the one that made the mosy sense to her.

And to be fair, Juniper was quite upset when she did it, and they had a big discussion about it that ended (IIRC) with him saying "I still don't like it, but I respect your autonomy and reserve the right to bring this up again if I think of a better argument."

Do you have a problem with Juniper dialing down his level-up addiction? I'd say that's just as natural a part of his soul as Mary's crush was of hers.

Also, I feel I should mention that I disagree with your disapproval of self-alteration in general. If I had soul magic you can bet your ass I'd dial up the importance of fitness and accomplishment.
