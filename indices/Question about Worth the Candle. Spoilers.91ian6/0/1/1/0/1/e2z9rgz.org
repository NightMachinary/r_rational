I was rather uncomfortable with the whole situation as I read it too, though that whole arc (the pregnancy and the time chamber) had my stomach in knots with anxiety. When she did it I felt off, but as she explained her Decision to Joon I felt like she was at least partially in the right, it is /her/ soul and if anyone has the agency to change it, it's her, and that this is little different from taking emotionally altering drugs from earth like Prozac (a drug I have first hand experience with).

Joon's objection was less than solid, and I do feel like he could have come at it from a better angle, mostly that the emotions she was feeling were natural (despite what some may say, I think that the emotions and actions of the crew aren't under any coercion from the DM) and that the most healthy way to deal with them was naturally, doing it this way she doesn't get to learn how to deal with such emotion in the future, she is handicapping her future ability to deal with rejection and desire.

I am VERY curious how this is going to effect her in the long run, she is a strong individual and I feel like this will come up again whether she wishes to alter her soul in some other way in the future or otherwise. That whole arc has to be some of the best character writing I have ever read, keep going, as it only gets better as it goes on.
