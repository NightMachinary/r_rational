So we have to issues of definition here; what is 'self' (as you do not consider one's body to be a portion of it), and what is 'violation v alteration'.

What if I have a heroin addiction? It drives my actions, desires, and life-path for years; it is a core part of my person, self, and identity. Then, through force of will, self-reflection, and pharmaceutical therapy, I remove this addiction from myself. I have changed my core personage. Is this not okay?
