She was kidnapped by a horrifically rapey unicorn when young and then surrounded by abusive people with manipulative agendas until ~30 minutes prior to meeting the protagonist. It's weird to single out a teenage girl who was exposed to a situation conductive romance for the very first time gradually developing romantic feelings as being a more direct manipulation than Fenn spending a long time in prison prior to meeting Joon for example.

As for deception trusting her own self-report isn't exactly any more reliable than believing the DM. Apart from generally being someone known for tactful omissions when they serve her interests she previously confessed that Joon was the only /man/ she was ever attracted to but then when she was removing that part insisted that there would never have been anybody she would have been naturally attracted to at all. This coming from someone who spends longer gushing about how good Fenn looks than the guy whose dating her.

The DM has mostly done the opposite of showing himself /directly/ meddling in things a weird soul-patch is very different from a delayed archery competition. Plausible deniability is his MO. The way it's possible for her attraction to be unnatural is that someone in the past had a reason to covertly organized a soul mage to mess with her but then the DM would have wanted that to be case for a plot twist. Or else you might believe the DM isn't telling the truth but then there is no reason to believe Amarilys exists at all. Overall does setting it up so that she might fall for Joon on her own seem like something a powerful devil with access to her and everything around her for her entire life couldn't do without it looking suspicious?

The thing that sticks out to me is the word contrived. We know for a fact that everything else is contrived as well. Fenn is character who was meant to look more down to earth but has had every bit as much time spent engineering her for her role. What does core character mean here? Because it looks a whole lot like "the person Amarilys is supposed to be" but then who is that and why doesn't she have confusing feelings during puberty?

Evidently Amarilys agrees with your reasoning about romance and Joon does not but that seems like a separate discussion from the ontology of said romance or the general ethics of voluntary self-castration.
