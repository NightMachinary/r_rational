It's fine that you don't agree with Mary's decision, but I find it a little odd that you can't continue the story because you disagree with one character's decision. Real people make mistakes, so even if you see self-modification as horrible, it shouldn't ruin the story for you.

Personally, I see nothing wrong with it. To my knowledge, most of us here are transhumanists, and more often than not transhumanists believe in the right to self-modify. I don't see what she's doing as any different from using antidepressants for depression or anxiolytics for anxiety, just far more controlled. A better solution. How is altering the mind somehow worse when you can do it in a controlled, specific way? I see the right to modify your own mind, be it through drugs or soul magic, as one of the most fundamental rights there is.
