i dont think thats necessarily true. forget about what the author thinks (he hasnt said his thoughts on it and its not super relevant anyways), i think the /story/ sees it as kind of an open question. the protagonist is clearly against it, and i did not feel anything approaching closure on the issue. its not even closed for mary, since she wants joon to reciprocate. this is clearly going to come back up
