  If you don't mind me asking, why doesn't alteration of one's own soul sit right with you?

To start with more emotional than rational view. And as I said In another comment, I'm pretty invested into characters at this point.

So here I agree with June, that she is altering core part of herself. She says her feeling does not define here, but while they are obviously not all of here, they are important part. To just switch it off does not makes here another person, it makes her different enough for me to see it as being wrong. And this also opens gates to potential further changes, even if they are never used.

And this is compounded with June being somewhat interested party, so he cant come hard on this issue without looking selfish. This is what probably grates me the most here - not only I don't agree with alterations, but it also can't be properly debated in-world because if conflict of interests.
