Juniper questions her over it briefly whilst in the chamber, but I imagine you realized that already.

Whilst it hasn't necessarily been addressed in the chapters since, I imagine this is one of the things that becomes a slow-burn issue, something that seems immaterial at first but eventually is granted greater importance to the story, before coming to a resolution in some future plotline. Whether the resolution satisfies you or not is another question.

To answer yours, however, it hasn't yet been seriously addressed, but that doesn't mean it won't be. It's only been 10 or so chapters since the issue came up.

If you don't mind me asking, why doesn't alteration of one's own soul sit right with you?
