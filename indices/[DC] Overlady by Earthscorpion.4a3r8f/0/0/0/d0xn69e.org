Mmm...I wouldn't call it Rational per se, since so much of Louise's trouble stems from her inability to communicate with other people like a normal human being. Her ingrained response to stress is "EXPLOSION!".

Also, I was kind of not super thrilled that this story fails the M!Bechdel Test. I enjoy balanced casts, and insist on a damn good reason to be present if you're monogendereing the cast. It just feels like so many excellent opportunities for interaction are lost when you strip out the silly stuff men and women do together, as opposed to the shit men do with only men around and women do with only women around.

That said, the writing is excellent. EarthScorpion is very adept at the humour technique of unexpected reversals, like that scene with Cattleya and the maid. The blend of ZnT locations and the depravity of Overlord's setting results in some excellent "wtf is this how do you people live here?!?", and things are often followed through to their logical conclusion, rather then left to dangle in the plotbreeze.

I do think the story is only Excellent on the first read-through, though. Since so much of the humour is designed around surprise, you lose a good amount of impact when you know the upcoming punchline. Also, a lot of the character interactions are fueled almost entirely by chaos and inefficiency, and it can get a little tedious to read without the lubricant of constant surprise funnies.

But overall I recommend it.
