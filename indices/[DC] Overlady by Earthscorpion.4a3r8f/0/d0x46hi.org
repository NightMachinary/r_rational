[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8753582/1/Overlady][Also available on Fanfiction.net]], but not updated as promptly with new chapters.

This is extremely an well written and amazingly funny story that deconstructs to some extent the traditional fantasy tropes. It is totally readable without knowing the Zero no Tsukaima (Familiar of Zero) or Overlord source material, but if you do know that material there's a few bonuses. It totally blows away either of it's source material. It's super well written and amazingly funny, and I love it a lot. It updated twice relatively recently, and both updates were amazing.

Ironically, much of Overlord was written by Terry Pratchett's daughter Rhianna, but Overlady is very close to Pratchett stylistically at times and has a very similar sense of humour, while the Overlord source material by-and-large does not.
