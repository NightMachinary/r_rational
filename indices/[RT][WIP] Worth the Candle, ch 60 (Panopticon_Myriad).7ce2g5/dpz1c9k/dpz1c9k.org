Okay, I just spent basically 2 entire days binging on this story. No regrets! This is the meta, world-building and character-driven role-playing tale I didn't know I needed in my life. I especially find everything related to the world-building to be incredible, I am not sure whether it's actually based on tabletop campaigns but it certainly feels that way. In fact, the campaign flashbacks and how they are inserted in the narrative are among my favorite aspects of the story, which also manages to be emotional and rational at the same time. It's been a wild ride so far and I can't wait to find out how it goes on, although I'll certainly miss the binge!
