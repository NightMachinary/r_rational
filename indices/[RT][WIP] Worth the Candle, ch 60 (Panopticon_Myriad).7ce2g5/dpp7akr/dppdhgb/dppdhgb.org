Huh, that rule is kinda annoying for me in this instance since there's not a central comment chain for typos that automatically notifies the author. I suppose I can just type the user name to notify [[/u/cthulhuraejepsen]] of the following typo:

#+begin_quote
  If we'd been in a normal building, we might have had an easier time finding out way to the gymnasium
#+end_quote

out way -> out the way [or] our way
