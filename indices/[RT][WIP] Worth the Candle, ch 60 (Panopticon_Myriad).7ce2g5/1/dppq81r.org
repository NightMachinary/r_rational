Fellis gave themselves a portmanteau. I squee from cute.

Also, they are working the unspoken plan guarantee. Did Arthur recap tvtropes, or did they just deduce it from first principles?

Lets see, what else might be in motion our protagonist is blissfully unaware of? Well, Fenn talked to the prison. She might have ratted out the soul-mage just to escalate that side of things into overt hostilities? After all, the copies are /not/ who the prison thinks they are..

Hm. Most Plausible backfire: The prison decides the overwritten are neither the soul-mage nor the criminals they once were, and lets them go. That.. is not the very worst outcome tough, since it saves them from having to fight the lot of them.
