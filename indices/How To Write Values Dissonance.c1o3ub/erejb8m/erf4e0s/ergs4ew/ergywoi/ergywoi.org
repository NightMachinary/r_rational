If you want to demonstrate something is really far beyond the range of acceptability, then just show where current acceptability is, and make it clear that its a spectrum.

<-----A------B-----C--|--D---->

A = thing you want to demonstrate is super unacceptable.

C and D = "reasonable" position on either side of the issue (reasonable according to the society you are exploring)

B = position that D claims holders of position C espouse, in order to smear position C.

You could probably just change out the words on some of the culture war posts from TheMotte in order to get this exact scenario. If you write it well enough using social ques, most readers will wholeheartedly accept these positions as dogma within the story, and they have no trouble understanding that A is just not what reasonable people believe.

If you watch game of thrones (I dont watch it, so maybe i got this wrong), there is a scene I heard about at the end of the series where someone basically proposes democracy as a form of government and he gets laughed at. As far as I can tell, most viewers understood why he was laughed at. There were different shades of monarchists representing C and D, and this guy proposes viewpoint A/B.
