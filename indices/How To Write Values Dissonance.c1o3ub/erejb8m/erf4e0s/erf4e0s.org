  Often it works by emphasizing what it is that the characters do care about.

Yeah I think this is one of the easiest ways for a reader to grok the value dissonances. Humans are social creatures, and they pick up on what matters in a social context. Show an example of a moral decision, then show people's reaction to that moral decision. Basically show a culture war item in context of the current culture. If such an item would not be fought over, then you'll have to do a ton of exposition to cover the ground that social context would provide.

I think rape is a bad example for the story to get into, because it seems mostly like a dead item to the relevant participants.

I think EY might have been able to make a more interesting example from abortion and reproductive rights. Especially since it would have been far more relevant to the alien baby-eating happening in the story.

Some scenarios off the top of my head:

1. Someone gets a hold of the DNA of the [British Royal Family/Famous celebrity/or just plain old ex lover]. They proceed to create stem cells from the DNA, and then egg/sperm cells from the stem cells. Then they mix their own egg/sperm cells to create viable embryos. Original DNA holder doesn't want lots of their offsping coming from rando person. Debate happens while the offspring is [embryo/fetus/baby/child].
2. Someone uplifts lions to an intelligent species. Lions have painful sex. Should they correct for the painful sex? They want to make further genetic edits to correct for the painful sex, but the already uplifted lions don't want them to.
3. Someone starts vat growing a bunch of clones of them-self in a haphazard way. Causing some clones to die painful deaths. Technically they are just inflicting harm on alternate versions of themselves. All surviving clones don't care about the practice.

Take that scenario and have the different characters have a sort of culture war fight over the appropriate response. If you are dead set on having a fictional world with legalized rape, then have one of the characters casually drop it as an argument. Like in the first scenario "Yeah the royal prince even tried to have the DNA thief tried under the ancient rape laws. Which caused them to get rid of the laws altogether since they were so antiquated." The rape laws are clearly gone because actual rape is just no longer a crime. Which I think conveys the whole point EY was trying to make.
