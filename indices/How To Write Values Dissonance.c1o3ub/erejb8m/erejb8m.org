Often it works by emphasising what it is that the characters do care about. To take a TV example, the central characters of HBO's Rome are all slave owners and rapists. But what is emphasised is their own values around honor and duty. E.g. There's a major conflict where someone kills a slave, because he didn't ask the owners permission, and its made very clear how big a deal this kind of violating of the property of another citizen is. A character in that setting might agree in some abstract way that the death of a slave is morally bad, but it doesn't compare to more important things.
