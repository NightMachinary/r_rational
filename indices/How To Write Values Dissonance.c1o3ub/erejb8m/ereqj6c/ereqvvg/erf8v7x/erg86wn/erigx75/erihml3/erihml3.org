Different strokes for different folks. My mind rails against the idea of spending even a million dollars on any work of art whose cost in materials is not significantly great, but if I had $100 million that I could only spend on high-priced art, I would sooner buy /Onement/ or /Black Fire 1/ than the /Mona Lisa/.
