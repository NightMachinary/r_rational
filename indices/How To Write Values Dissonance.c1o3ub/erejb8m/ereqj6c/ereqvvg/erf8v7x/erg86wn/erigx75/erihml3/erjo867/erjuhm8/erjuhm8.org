...Possibly. I think I might have misunderstood the point that you were making.

What I thought you were intending was to refute my “art is meant to be consumed” position, because the links you provided were very “lol why is this stuff so valuable, it doesn't mean anything, abstract art isn't valid.”

In response, I was saying, “No, actually, some of those pieces are quite aesthetically pleasing and I enjoy them very much, so while we may not be able to read minds and truly know for certain the intent behind their creation, we can at least say that they /can/ be consumed.”

If I misunderstood you, though, then I apologize for the apparent non sequitur.
