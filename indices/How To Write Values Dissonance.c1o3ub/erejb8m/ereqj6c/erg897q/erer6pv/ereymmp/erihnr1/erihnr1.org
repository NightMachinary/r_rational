Honestly though, if violence, traumas and mental damage are impossible, what makes rape worse than, say, getting hit by a snowball? The only thing I can think of is that rape takes time and you might have had other priorities. That said, when I first read the relevant section in 3WC I assumed that assault, battery and unlawful imprisonment were all still illegal, so the only legal rape would be that where no one actively tries to escape and does so unsuccessfully for more than a few seconds.
