  They didn't legalize rape, they abolished it so thoroughly that they didn't see any reason to have a law against nonconsensual sex!

They might not be exposed to suffering or trauma, as you say, but that does not mean that abolished rape laws because rape never happened.

  I can't imagine how boring your sex lives must have been up until then - flirting with a woman, teasing her, leading her on, knowing the whole time that you were perfectly safe because she couldn't take matters into her own hands if you went a little too far

It's explicitly in the text that if you lead someone on for too long, they might decide to have sex with you whether you want it or not, and it's justly comeuppance for a social gaffe
