Honestly while I understand why it puts people off, I rather think the /point/ of the passage in 3WC was to be unappealing. We are after all in that generation that, in the book, "thought the future had gone wrong". That's us. We think it's insane, and that's the goddamn point. The choices of the future generations are as mystifying to us as they are to those of our fictional counterparts.

Making it appealing or understandable would just turn it into another sci-fi Hope For The Future, which as the OP notes is not the intent. Justifying it would demystify it, and would make the decisions of the future generations Reasonable And Understandable, instead of Horrifying And Unfathomable.

The past is a foreign country, and we are the barbarians who can't grok the future world.
