My reaction to the specific example had a couple levels to it.

1: Wait, what? Those people are evil.

2: Ugh. EY fell into the trope of using "rape" as a genetic evil. Lazy.

3: EY should have used something less cheap & shocking. Like them being ultra-pro-gay rights.

4: Wait. Ultra gay rights isn't actually repugnant to me. It's just "my tribe, but more!" That's shocking to my out group

5: thinking about it, I can't come up with any good things that (1) fictional people could be for (2) would be more repugnant to me than my outgroup and (3) don't come off as cheap.

And that's kind of where I left off. And it annoys me, because now that I'm looking for it, I can't help notice how edgy characters have the same few "Morally Acceptable Vices"

Like, Gregory House is a misanthrope. And that OK because he hates everyone. But if the writers made him racist towards some specific group, he'd be stop being an antihero and just comd off as bad.

And now that I've noticed this, it has really undermined certain classes of fiction. Now if feels like authors are trying to create the impression of iconoclasm, while walking very very carefully past the things that my tribe actually holds sacred
