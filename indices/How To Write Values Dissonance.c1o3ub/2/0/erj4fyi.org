  Wait. Ultra gay rights isn't actually repugnant to me. It's just "my tribe, but more!" That's shocking to my out group

Well SOMEONE got the point.

> thinking about it, I can't come up with any good things that (1) fictional people could be for (2) would be more repugnant to me than my outgroup and (3) don't come off as cheap.

And someone USED the point.

> And it annoys me, because now that I'm looking for it, I can't help notice how edgy characters have the same few "Morally Acceptable Vices"... Now it feels like authors are trying to create the impression of iconoclasm, while walking very very carefully past the things that my tribe actually holds sacred

And someone RETAINED the point.
