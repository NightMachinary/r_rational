Values Dissonance is hard to write. The writer may want this group to push the Overton Window for plot reasons but going too far would make them too detestable in the eyes of most viewers and beyond their ability to stomach (and continue reading). A book that nobody reads is worthless.

Rape is one of them extremely sensitive tropes that is almost impossible to rationalise at all, in modern society it's often judged to be worse than murder. I mean, a society of murderous cannibals (e.g. Orks from 40k) would look better to most readers. Worth the Candle has corpse fuckers and that turns people off less than rape in that story. It's a subject even "edgy" stand-up artists (e.g. George Carlin) avoids for the most part, and Carlin is famous for his opposition to obscenity laws.

Hell, for [[/r/rimworld]] where people joke about turning prisoners into leather hats and unwilling organ donors, a subreddit that is loudly proud to be banned alongside the Crusader Kings series and Dwarf Fortress in [[/r/nocontext]] for being "too easy", the subject of rape is still somewhat sensitive.
