I guess that's probably giving /way/ too much credit to "most people."

I still hold that the fact that it's been socially acceptable in a great many cultures over the millennia is in the back of [[https://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/2902][at least enough people's minds]] to have made it likely that people who voiced objections to its inclusion in TWC would have been met with replies explaining its cultural historicity, which might've kept the backlash from spreading the way it did.

Also, that's kind of what members of one of the two major political parties in [/a certain country that I can't name because of the rules of this sub/] already believes, that it's been a slippery slope from interracial rights to homosexual rights to transgender rights and it's going to eventually slide down into pedophilic rights. That's what "Pizzagate" was about, kind of. Many people can /clearly/ imagine the path of history taking that trajectory. There's no trajectory we can imagine to get from "here" to "legalized rape," so there really wasn't anything else that could have made the point you were trying to make about blue and orange morality, unless I've seriously misunderstood your intentions in including that in the story.
