Ozy criticizes the values dissonance in Three Worlds Collide because she feels it doesn't adequately explore how the different values work. She then undermines this by asking a bunch of questions that are, in fact, answered by the text.

Here is one of her questions:

#+begin_quote
  Am I at risk of rape when I'm walking down the street?
#+end_quote

She follows this up with two possible answers, and follow-up questions based on each.

#+begin_quote
  Yes.

  What if I have an important appointment, or I'm giving birth?

  Is ‘I was busy getting raped' an acceptable reason to delay something or are you supposed to build in time for that?
#+end_quote

​

#+begin_quote
  No, because everyone carries pepper spray at all times.

  Is it legal, or will you be arrested for assault?

  How does that affect relationships with strangers? Do you have to be continually on your guard that someone might attack you?
#+end_quote

Now consider this passage from the text of Three Worlds Collide, in which the Confessor reveals himself to be an "honourable ancestor":

#+begin_quote
  "And there are /no/ words that I can speak to make you understand.  It is beyond your imagining.  But you should not imagine that a violent thief whose closest approach to industry was selling uncertified hard drugs - you should not imagine, my lord, my honorable descendant, that I was ever asked to /take sides/."

  Akon's eyes slid away from the hot gaze of the unmixed man; there was something /wrong/ about the thread of anger still there in the memory after five hundred years.

  "But time passed," the Confessor said, "time moved forward, and things changed."  The eyes were no longer focused on Akon, looking now at something far away.  "There was an old saying, to the effect that while someone with a /single/ bee sting will pay much for a remedy, to someone with /five/ bee stings, removing just one sting seems less attractive.  That was humanity in the ancient days.  There was so much wrong with the world that the small resources of altruism were splintered among ten thousand urgent charities, and none of it ever seemed to go anywhere.  And yet... and yet..."

  "There was a threshold crossed somewhere," said the Confessor, "without a single apocalypse to mark it.  Fewer wars.  Less starvation.  Better technology.  The economy kept growing.  People had more resource to spare for charity, and the altruists had fewer and fewer causes to choose from.  *They came even to me, in my time, and rescued me.*  Earth cleaned itself up, and whenever something threatened to go drastically wrong again, the whole attention of the planet turned in that direction and took care of it.  Humanity finally got its act together."
#+end_quote

​

Emphasis mine. It is here established that the Confessor, an ex-thief, thug, and drug dealer, was "rescued" by some unknown technology. That is to say, Earth, in its advanced sociological and educational sciences (see their assertion that it takes a hundred years to become a real expert) has devised a way to convert violent crooks into honourable, trustworthy Confessors.

Furthermore, because humanity has got rid of its bee stings, we can infer that they've done this with everyone, and there are no more crooks, thugs, or career criminals on the entire planet Earth. Everyone has received all the treatments and lessons and therapies they need to be their best self. In a way, they're much more akin to the Superhappies than they are to us.

There are many other quotes I could pull. Akon says they can only learn about war from books because holos are "too horrible to watch":

#+begin_quote
  "No," Akon said.  "Not /that/ much stronger."  He looked around, in the silence.  "The Babyeater society has been at peace for centuries.  So too with human society.  Do you want to fire the opening shot that brings war back into the universe?  Send us back to the darkness-before-dawn that we only know from reading history books, because the holos are too horrible to watch?  Are you really going to press the button, knowing that?"
#+end_quote

​

This sensitivity is so extreme that even a dry, matter-of-fact description of a horrible thing is enough to induce three people to vomit on the spot:

​

#+begin_quote
  "The children don't die right away," said the Engineer.  "The brain is this nugget of hard crystal, that's really resistant to, um, the digestive mechanisms, much more so than the rest of the body.  So the child's brain is in, um, probably quite a lot of pain, since the whole body has been amputated, and in a state of sensory deprivation, and then the processing slowly gets degraded, and I think the whole process gets completed about a month after -"

  The Lady Sensory threw up.  A few seconds later, so did the Xenopsychologist and the Master.
#+end_quote

​

From this we can infer that everyone on Earth is too sensitive to intentionally hurt another human being. The quote Ozy herself includes in her essay shows Akon failing to imagine how nonconsensual sex could be a bad thing - in the exact same way as he assumes that everyone on Earth was consulted about whether to go the Superhappy route. He can't imagine the evils of the past because they're totally beyond his frame of reference, and they're beyond his frame of reference because technology has abolished evil.

In other words, Ozy has completely misunderstood the values dissonance in Three Worlds Collide. They aren't okay with rape - they're the opposite. They can't even imagine it. They didn't legalize rape, they abolished it so thoroughly that they didn't see any reason to have a law against nonconsensual sex!

To answer Ozy's question, no, you do not have to be afraid of rape when walking down the street. You don't have to be afraid of anything. No one on the planet could bear the thought of inflicting pain on another person.
