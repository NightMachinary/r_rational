Art is made with the intention that it will be consumed. If this is not universally the case then it is at least the case for art which has been posted on a public website with a comments section.

Some works of art, though they may not be "incomprehensible to the human mind" levels of /alien/, are still strange enough that they give me a sense of alienness without being apparently orderless and baseless. If the art is meant to give me a sense of the alien, then these cases are superior to works which may be objectively more alien but are also so incomprehensible that they cannot be grasped at all.

(And this is assuming that "alien" really does, in this context, mean "fundamentally incomprehensible" rather than "/presently/ incomprehensible". Given that these are biological humans whose /culture/ is the primary source of difference from us, it can't be anything but a failure that EY was able to make the doctrine of the superhappies, and even the doctrine of the baby-eaters, more understandable to me than the mindset behind "Rape is legal now").
