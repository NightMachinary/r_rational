I know the Horned Lord probably looks like a giant antlered kobold, but I keep picturing an enormous jackalope in my mind. I'm wondering how he became one of TDK's Revenants... did the Chain of Hunger get so hungry one time they decided to invade Keter for food? You'd think that a Named with augury would have seen what a dumb idea that would be. If he's a relatively new addition to TDK's retinue, I'd expect that his Name was bestowed as a counter to Procer's own seer. After all, the ratlings don't culturally strike me as very forward-thinking, being mostly mindless consumers unless they get through their two stages of metamorphosis. But it's still odd that he's in Keter and not, y'know, striking Procer while the country is weakened by in-fighting or their armies are invading Callow/Praes.

Echoing some of the other comments here, I also don't understand the "accidental pun." Closest I can get would be that they're definitely getting somewhere, just not where they want to go. But I'd have expected Masego to comment on it by correcting Cat, not by her catching herself.
