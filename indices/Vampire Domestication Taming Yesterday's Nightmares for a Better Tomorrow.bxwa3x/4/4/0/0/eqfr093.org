Point is there's plenty of "aren't liberals awful," "aren't doctors awful," "aren't regulatory committees awful," "aren't corporations awful," etc, etc, ETC, that you didn't seem to catch or have a problem with, so it's not likely to be about the type of attempted humor.

And if it's not that, it's pretty freaking annoying that you're going to whine about the political implications of the part that doesn't match your opinions.
