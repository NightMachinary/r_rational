Seriously, you're making wild assumptions about the thoughts behind my post, and it's kind of insulting.

Yes, I noticed the all the other jokes about evil doctors and creationism and Texas as a nazi-like state supplying prisoners as test subjects. Because I didn't make a list of every single awkward joke in the story doesn't mean I didn't take issue with these awkward jokes, it means I wanted to keep my post concise.
