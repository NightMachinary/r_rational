Heh, old timey Marxists used to rant about media being an opiate to distract from material circumstances. (Most of it is, let's be honest - functionally escapist fantasy. Family Matters and CSI Miami do not reflect reality.)

Lead might be in the water, you might be one broken bone away from being homeless, you might not even get the $300 in blood money (that's the standard cut as established by Iraq) from the next war of capital acquisition, slavery is literally still legal, but... there are sexy people on tv. Or cute goofy animals. So it's all okay.

Literally everything is political - even trying to escape from it is itself ceding power to someone else.

This is outrageous enough that most people aren't aware of it, and is therefore always worthy of a tangent.

Go read the 13th amendment if you don't believe me. Go watch "Slavery By Another Name" to see how it's enacted in the real world.

It's a bit more gentle now than it was in the 1940's. But still goes on behind closed doors and out of sight.

You all remember the "Hillary had slaves" meme that talked about how they use slaves in Arkansas to clean the governor's mansion. Instead of giving someone a job and, you know, /paying them money/ to do it.

I personally think a rational thing to do would be to support the creation of a society without slavery, and not pretend I'm powerless to do anything. But if I am powerless, it is a lot of free time wasted that could have gone to being wasted in other equally useless ways.

... did I just use a Pascal's Mugging there? ...sorry.
