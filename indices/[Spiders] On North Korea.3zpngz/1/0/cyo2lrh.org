Ah, I am of course not suggesting individuals take any action on their own. Only governments are equipped to influence something like this unless you happen to have exactly the right job/skills/resources/opportunity.

I don't think there is a high risk of a nuclear war, certainly not one that escalates to global. But nuclear weapons last a long time (if you have the technology to build/maintain them), and compared to how stern the international community has been with making sure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, I think it's odd that the most powerful states haven't agreed to decapitate NK. Even completely ignoring the quality of life of most North Koreans, surely an oligarchy like China must have some people among its leaders who think having North Korea as an 'ally' does not outweigh having North Korea as a neighbour.
