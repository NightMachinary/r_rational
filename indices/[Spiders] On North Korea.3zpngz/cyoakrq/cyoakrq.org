Yea, that's... pretty worrisome. I think that people are not taking this stuff nearly seriously enough. It's a case of risk * potential damage = bad, even if the risk is small. And people tend to overestimate human rationality in these cases, I think. There have been so many cases in history where people do things that are batshit crazy, and it's not at all hard for a leader (who is seen as basically a god) to get the rest of the country's leadership to go along with it. I agree that this is the sort of situation for which "the end justifies the means" reasoning is very much justified.

And as for the spiders thing... if anything here gets mindkilled by the notion that North Korea having superweapons is a bad thing, then I just don't know anymore. (Though now that I think about it, I have actually heard people argue that it's only 'fair' that if the US gets to have nukes, then countries like Iran should be able to as well. Argh.)
