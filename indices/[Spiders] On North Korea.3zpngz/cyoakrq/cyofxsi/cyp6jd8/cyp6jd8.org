Yes, of course, I agree. That's totally reasonable.

But you can see why the argument "if we can destroy the world it's only fair if they can, too" is insane, even if it's technically true.

In fact, I think that discussions of politics would go much better if all value laden terms like "fairness" or "freedom" were just banned entirely. Man, I wish we had a subreddit for rational!politics with precisely that rule in place.
