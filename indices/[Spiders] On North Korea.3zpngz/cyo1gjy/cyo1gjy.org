Presumably, because if they do nuke another country they'll be nuked back. That's a strong incentive for someone to not use their own nukes. At least it would be for someone who was remotely intelligent or sane. I don't know how many dumb lunatics would have to be in office in North Korea to set off a nuke on someone, since I'm not familiar with how their government works. Fortunately, oppressive dictator does not necessarily equal dumb lunatic. And even if it does, they could still be smart/sane enough when it comes to their own self-preservation to NOT launch a nuke.

I agree that it is very dangerous though. But I'm not sure it's really quite as urgent as you seem to think it is. I would need to know a little more about North Korea and how its government works before I could even guess whether it puts the world in immediate danger of nuclear war or not. Of course, since it's nukes we're talking about it's still pretty urgent, of course. Scary stuff.

That being said, even if it were an immediate danger to the world, what could you do about it? Do you have military training? Any experience with politics or government? Being rational isn't always enough. Sometimes you need to actually have expertise in the specific relevant fields.
