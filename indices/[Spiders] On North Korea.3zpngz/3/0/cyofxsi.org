  Though now that I think about it, I have actually heard people argue that it's only 'fair' that if the US gets to have nukes, then countries like Iran should be able to as well. Argh.

If one country has nukes and the other does not, then the nuclear country is free to attack the non-nuclear country through conventional means, while the non-nuclear country is not free to attack the nuclear country. This influences everything about their relations with one another. The non-nuclear country's only recourse for any chicanery is politics, which they'll be in a poor position on. It's really hard for me to see this as fair.

Now, I don't particularly care about fairness and I would rather keep the nuclear club as small as possible and heavily stacked with allies. But I can totally see where Iran is coming from.
