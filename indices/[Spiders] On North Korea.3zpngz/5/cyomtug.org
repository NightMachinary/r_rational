I wonder how long North Korea will last. I did a quick internet search, and a defecting official is claiming that within 3 years Kim Jong Un's government will collapse [1]. Now, that doesn't seem very plausible, and even if it was, NK would stay.

Any of you have any idea and could make an educated guess?
