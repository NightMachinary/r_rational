  Isn't this exactly the kind of threat where we expect rational characters to take unpleasant, expensive actions to prevent a magnitudes greater threat later down the road?

What are the values of the rational actors?

I mean, let's say that I'm a senator in the United States. The thing I care most about is *getting re-elected*, partly because I enjoy holding power and partly because I like being important. So North Korea (maybe) developed a hydrogen bomb. My question as a senator is, "How does this affect *getting re-elected*?"

Well, first off, I can't *get re-elected* if I'm dead, or if the United States ceases to exist as a functional nation. Can North Korea accomplish any of those things? Are they likely to? No. Their delivery systems aren't that good, and they only have a limited supply of bombs. So I'm probably safe. In fact, if North Korea were to launch an attack on American soil, it would probably be good for me, since re-election rates skyrocket during times of external threat. (I'm not a sociopath, so obviously I still don't want that to happen. This thought stays at the back of my mind instead of coming to the forefront.)

So assuming that North Korea doesn't actually attack, what's the best course of action for my goal of *getting re-elected*? If North Korea nukes Seoul, I might get called to task for not doing more. So I will say some things about sanctions and tough measures, or I might saber-rattle a bit. I might even mean what I say. But if the United States were to go to /war/ with North Korea, that would shake things up. Maybe I could sit in the corner and twiddle my thumbs, prevaricating at every opportunity. At worst, I back the war and am then responsible for the inevitable quagmire.

/Or/ I could be against the war from the outset. This only really hurts my chances of *getting re-elected* if North Korea launches some unconscionable attack. So I can take a weak position and say that the situation is complicated, which it is, and I can be pretty sure that this will remain true even if they attack or even if they push for war. My weak position will include sanctions against North Korea, humanitarian aid, and deniable spies (plus other intelligence gathering).

My plan doesn't involve paying extremely heavy costs to take care of the situation once and for all, because that's unlikely to *get me re-elected*.

(You might think that this is an overly cynical way of looking at politics, but people who don't make getting re-elected a priority don't tend to get re-elected, which means that by survival of the fittest, most congresscritters have a focus on re-election over good policy.)
