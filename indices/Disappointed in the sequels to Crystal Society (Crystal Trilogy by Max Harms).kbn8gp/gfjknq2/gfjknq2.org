I did like a number of (what seem to be) controversial choices the author made. I liked the dog chapters. I think they played into what the author was trying to go for, these discontinuities in consciousness different levels of intelligence allow. The discontinuity between dogs, humans, Face, and Growth.

But yeah, Ro was annoying. That bit where Vision flips a coin, promising to eliminate all humanity if it comes up heads or tails, so it lands on its side, which is labeled "deus ex machina"? Such an odd decision.

I'll admit I am not sure how you could have landed the series without just killing everyone but Growth or Vision, and I'm not sure I wouldve been more satisfied by that. However, the surprisingly OP Growth was perfectly in line with the author's motif, if I am reading these books correctly, so I probably would've been fine with it.

Anyways, I am happy to have paid Max Harms. He earned my money and more. I know that he has received criticism directly, and I hope he knows how good of a series he has written.
