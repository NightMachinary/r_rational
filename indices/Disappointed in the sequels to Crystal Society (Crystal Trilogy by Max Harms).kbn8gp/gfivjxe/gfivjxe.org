Similar experience here. The first book was one of the best I've ever read. The interactions between the cores was so interesting.

I immediately bought the second book, got a few chapters in.. and the pacing is just so terrible. I've picked it up several times but never make progress and have to drop it again. It's an absolute chore to read. I don't understand why the author thought such a big shift in tone and focus was a good idea. Book 1 was working, why change the formula?
