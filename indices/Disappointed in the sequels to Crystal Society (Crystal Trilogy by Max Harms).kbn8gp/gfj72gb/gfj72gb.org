Sorry to not fully engage with your post here, but I think the truth of "Ro" is meant to be left somewhat ambiguous. That is, it may be a trick played on Vision. This reading was a bit more satisfying for me.

I wish we had spent less time in human PoVs (or with humans that better held my interest), but I'm sure it was hard to believably write the AIs as they increased in power.

Also, having some small acquaintanceship with the author, I wanted to note the following in case he's reading this: I really enjoyed the first book. I didn't like the next two as much, but I hope he writes more fiction in the future. I imagine it's painful for him to see all of the negative feedback the sequels have received. I don't intend to censure anyone for tone, but I thought seeing my paragraph here might make it easier for him not to take things too personally, or feel too bad.
