I've heard of the theory of Ro as a trick. Here's a relevant comment from the author:

He says it was heavily foreshadowed, but I'm not sure he really knows what foreshadowing is. He seems to have little concept of communication in storytelling.

Overall as the story goes on it gets less and less focused and becomes less and less of a story. It's somehow not "tight" at all- there are many elements that could just as well have been removed in editing or simplified, to the betterment of the story's integrity- while simultaneously leaving out crucial information, and leaving many of its most interesting threads unexplored. I also feel that the first book is one of the best I've ever read, though. Dream, Wiki, and Growth remain some of my favorite characters in all fiction.
