The whole Ro concept was very disappointing.

My most generous take on it is that Ro is an in-universe explanation/discovery by the super intelligences for the pressure placed on authors to give a story a “happy ending” where not everyone dies. Basically if you were very smart and lived inside a fictional universe, you might be able to deduce some things about it that you wouldn't if you lived in our universe.

Not saying that makes it any good, it's just the only explanation I could come up with for why the trilogy took that turn
