My confusion is: a mind hack of Ro neatly explains the coin landing on its edge and such without violating the "no miracles" rule. But the bomb on the nameless ship at the end of book 1 malfunctioning was a miracle that was explained by Ro, and none of the society could possibly have caused that from afar. How, then, does this not violate "no miracles"?
