So the creator of this game got sick of waiting for Miegakure to be released and decided to make his own 4D game.

It's much shorter and simpler in scope than Miegakure will be, but it's still amazing as a working 4D environment. One of the most noticeable 'limitations' is that pretty much all of the 4D objects one interacts with are basically some variation on a hypercube (or at least in the first few levels I finished so far). But it's really, really, really cool to play this game.

Please donate something when you buy this game instead of just taking it for free!

Go to [[/r/Brane]] if you want to ask the creator anything about the game.
