Totally agree about Pilgrim, but 'hypocrite' isn't quite the right word. It's not that his actions conflict with /his/ stated beliefs and goals, it's just that they're at such conflict with the way the Dominion folks fall all over themselves about how he's a living saint and the most decent and good person ever to exist.
