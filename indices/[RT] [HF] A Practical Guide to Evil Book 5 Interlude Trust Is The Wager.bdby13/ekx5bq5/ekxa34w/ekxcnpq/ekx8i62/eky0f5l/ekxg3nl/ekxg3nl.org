My prediction is that night will continue until Grey Popcorn is forced to intervene. At that point, he had shown his hand and is no longer able to counter Cat.

Though I think there is something even more glorious in the works that will give the readers a much needed relief from all of Grey Porridge's self righteous bullshit.

He's a well written unlikable character, in my opinion. Super hypocrite.
