I love that about Cat and Black, everytime I hear in this sub about how PGTE isn't actually rational and that the characters act completely irrationally is kind of odd to me, because I think it's kinda obvious that /rational/ in our world is not equivalent to rational in theirs, in the guideverse, Narrative is rationality, and Black and Cat's understanding and manipulation of the Narrative is their rationality, they even go about it in very different ways, with Black's mechanistic understanding, and well thought out planning and Cat's off the cuff and out of the box thinking and ability to fuck everyone over if she is losing. It's all just delightful.
