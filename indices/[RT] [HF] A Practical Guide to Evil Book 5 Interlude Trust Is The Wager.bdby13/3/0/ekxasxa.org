The Choir can normally flip though peoples' minds like you would a book, picking out the vital bits of info and finding out what their plans are.

Now, two evil crow-like gods are punishing them for doing so, and they find that without that ability, there's not much they can do. Normally, the Grey Pilgrim must rely upon them for wisdom. Now /they/ must rely upon /him/ for wisdom.

So, yeah... they're a /bit/ worried. And they should be.

And yes, while Tariq might be good at predicting and defeating your standard villain, genre-savvy villains like Black and Cat are on a whole other level.
