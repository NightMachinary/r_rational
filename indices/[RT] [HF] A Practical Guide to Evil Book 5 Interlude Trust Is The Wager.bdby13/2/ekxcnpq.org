The Proceran prince said the battle would be decided at dawn but two hours before dawn seems way too early to kick off the battle if they're counting on dawn. They seem to know about the Drow weakness since the Drow "are accounted for" so it's very likely that dawn is their big play. The coalition would have to assume that Callow has planned how to manage half their army being incapacitated at a set time.

Could Pilgrim be planning to bring the dawn early to negate Callow's strategy to cope with dawn? It would fit with Cat's well being about blocking the sun. A tug of war over the sun has narrative appeal.
