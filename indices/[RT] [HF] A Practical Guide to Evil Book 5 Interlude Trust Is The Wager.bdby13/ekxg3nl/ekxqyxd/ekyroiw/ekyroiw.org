Yep. Like Cat never engages on the battlefield between the armies. At all. I think she's off doing something entirely different with the Wild Hunt -- whether it's kidnapping Proceran Princes to use as hostages or nabbing the Rogue Sorcerer to get Black's soul or something to deal with the League army.

The Dominion commander called for the retreat on the first day because Grey Pilgrim's foresight told him Cat wasn't going to fight. It really seems like he's just going to sit there and do nothing unless Cat engages.
