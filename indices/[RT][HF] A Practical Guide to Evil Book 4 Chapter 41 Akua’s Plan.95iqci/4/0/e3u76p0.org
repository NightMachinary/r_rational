  Needless to say the last thing Cat wants right now is drifting even farther from humanity.

Sounds like Catherine needs to get laid pretty bad. Seriously, she hasn't had a relationship in forever. It'd be a frankly horrible idea with any of Akua (is she even corporeal enough for that?), Thief, or Archer, but I'm still kind of astonished that no one's brought this up as a potential salve for her withering humanity. A monster saving or regaining their humanity by falling in love with a human is definitely a powerful story trope.

I could see Hakram pointing this out in his blunt, matter of fact way or Archer pointing it out while being playfully flirtatious and then having one of her moments of sincerity when Cat doesn't take her seriously. Cat's certainly still horny enough, ogling literally every female she comes across.

(Also, Cat is getting more comfortable with shape-shifting her body, so that opens up some, uh, interesting possibilities. Even with Thief. I suppose that would run counter to the goal of staying in touch with her humanity though.)
