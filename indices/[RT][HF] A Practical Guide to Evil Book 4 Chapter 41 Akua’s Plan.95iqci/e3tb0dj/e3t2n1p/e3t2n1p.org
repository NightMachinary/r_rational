Oh, it's /good/ to see another fight scene. Cat finally coming to terms with her lack of humanity is a joy to see, also, this fight really puts into perspective how scary the bard is.

Cat is about as strong as a lowercase god right now, assuming she doesn't sandbag, right? One undead (and thus not at peak performance) elf can cheat enough to fight her off. The bard easily scared off two hale elves. Fuck.
