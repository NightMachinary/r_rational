I think The Pilgrim would see right through that honestly with help from Above. And with Procer pulling their shenanigans to move around the peace agreements between Cat and Rozalla(sp), it won't really what happens because The Pilgrim and Saint of Swords will now full swing at Cat to take her down.

Just my opinion on how those "negotiations" would go.
