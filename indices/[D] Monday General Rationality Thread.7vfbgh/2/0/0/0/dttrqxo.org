Nooooooo, just deriving the MLE for linear regression, when you treat X samples as a matrix of column vectors and Y samples as a single column vector. Doing the derivative requires some vector-matrix calculus that doesn't /quite/ work according to the rules of unidimensional calculus.

Besides, don't be silly, deep learning won't produce AGI. Unless you're Ilya Sutskever. Then it totally will, but you're wrong and a horrible person.
