Paging [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] and [[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]. The sleeplessness is back even worse than before, but I don't feel anxious this time. Two weeks ago it wasn't getting enough, for the past three nights I've stopped sleeping altogether and I have no idea why.

I lay in my bed all night feeling relaxed like I'm about to fall asleep, but never do. I scheduled a therapy appointment with my healthcare provider, but the earliest they're available is next month. I'm starting to consider just going to the hospital.

The supplements I've taken for months to help me sleep have stopped working and meditation isn't helping either. My mind isn't stuck dwelling on stressful topics, I'm too tired to even think, if anything I'm just bored. Not even taking melatonin helps.

I called in sick to work yesterday and probably will today since I don't have enough energy to focus or do manual labor, though today they actually want to have a meeting about putting me back on my old schedule. However, I went to bed at my old time last night and still didn't sleep.
