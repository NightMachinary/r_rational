Update for you and [[/u/Frommerman][u/Frommerman]]. I managed to get some sleep last night and come into work without feeling tired. The main thing I did was read my go-to relaxing and life-affirming book for the first time in a while, though I also avoided any stimuli that might get me too excited or nervous.
