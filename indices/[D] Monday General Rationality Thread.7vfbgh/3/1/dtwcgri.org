Nothing to add on top of Frommerman's comment unfortunately. My list of insomnia solutions mostly includes things you've already mentioned: meditation, sleep inducing sounds (raindrops, babbling brook, ocean waves, white noise), melatonin, non-fiction reading. If none of those things help, then I'd advise seeking medical help, and hope that some stronger form of sleeping aid is useful without side effects.
