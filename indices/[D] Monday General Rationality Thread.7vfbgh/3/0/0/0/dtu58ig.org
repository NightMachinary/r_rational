I use Trazodone, and it doesn't do that to me at all. Obviously all medications work differently on different people, but you don't have much of a choice here. Not sleeping can literally kill you. You have around a week before it does, as the record longest time without sleep is ten days. Though I doubt that will happen, as you are likely getting short periods of sleep you just don't notice, this is still potentially life-threatening and definitely causes long-term damage which may shorten your life span.

Deal with it. You can't afford not to.
