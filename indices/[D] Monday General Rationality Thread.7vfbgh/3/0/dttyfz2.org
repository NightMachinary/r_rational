I have actual medication to let me sleep on anything approximating a schedule, as Melatonin stopped working for me a while ago. Other than that, I have no advice other than to say that not sleeping is a serious condition and that if it continues you definitely need to do something. You could probably go to a quick clinic rather than a hospital to save on money, they'd be able to prescribe you something without an insane bill.
