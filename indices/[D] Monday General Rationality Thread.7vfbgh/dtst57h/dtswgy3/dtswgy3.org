That's a rather large field. Can you describe a bit of what your mathematical background is, and where you want to go with this?

Are you interested in studying the proofs of the theorems of vector calculus? Or are you more interested in learning physics that uses the language of vector calculus (such as Maxwell's Equations)? Or is it a stepping stone to learning differential geometry?
