I think there is a tendency for people to isolate "emotions" and "rationality" as these separate domains that never intersect. Taken to an extreme, you have people who argue that "emotions/feelings don't matter," which seems to fundamentally deny the biological reality of what emotions are. Emotions are real, insofar as they're caused by chemicals in your brain (which is part of your body), and they have real consequences. Nobody would deny that parts of your metabolism like blood pressure, breathing, and so on are a real and manifest thing that affect your overall health, and your emotional state affects all of these.

One of the reasons that this should matter to you as a rationalist is that it means that things that people think of as intangible (like "fulfillment" and "happiness") are real things, and you can take an approach that treats your life as an optimization problem where you can take concrete steps toward the goal of maximizing your long-term happiness and fulfillment. That is a whole topic all on its own, but if you have a few hours to spend on the subject, I'd recommend listening to the podcast interviews that Naval Ravikant has done with [[https://tim.blog/2015/08/18/the-evolutionary-angel-naval-ravikant/][Tim Ferriss]] and [[https://www.fs.blog/2017/02/naval-ravikant-reading-decision-making/][Shane Parrish]]
