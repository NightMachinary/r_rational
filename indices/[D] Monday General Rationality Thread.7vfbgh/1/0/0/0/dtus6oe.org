Intellectual honesty compels not to try not to sound like a cult. Other communities do not have to pass this test, because they can just not say such things. Whether this community is a cult can be evaluated seperately of what the philosophy sounds like, and the philosophy awards bonus points for developing the philosophy before one tries to make sure that it doesn't bring about a cult.
