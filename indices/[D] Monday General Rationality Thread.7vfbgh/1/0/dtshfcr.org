I'm not 100% sure about this but if I had to give a simple definition of rationality it would be the realization that you are one of the problems that must be solved and the art of solving it. This would imply the most important techniques is how to apply evaluations to yourself and the things you care about consistently. If you learn how to flawlessly identify problems but you only identify them in the beliefs you dislike and other people then you are now worse off. Please be aware I am not very good at this sort of thing and I might be wrong.
