I think it's interesting to ask about the difference between an ontically and epistemically reducible universe. For example, we know damn well that chemistry is ontically (territory) reducible to the quantum physics of atomic interactions, but it's not really very epistemically (map) reducible: when you try, a particular spot on the "chemistry" map turns into a patchy, intractable fuzz of a heat-map of states on an overly-zoomed-in "quantum physics" map in all but very, very simple cases.

  What would be the implications for mathematics and philosophy?

I think that in philosophy, foundationalism would have to be chucked out of epistemology, but there are already fairly good reasons for doing that. At any given time, we have some set of "overhypotheses" (meta-level principles we try to derive more specific statements from), but we only have an informal sense of which of those principles is the truest, the most precise, or the most expressive in terms of capturing lower-level principles. So sometimes we learn more about the world and realize that we need to "switch" foundations by moving an overhypothesis "up" or "down" the hierarchy.
