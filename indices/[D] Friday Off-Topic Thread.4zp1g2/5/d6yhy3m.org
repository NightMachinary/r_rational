Listened to a Radiolab where they talked about triage. In it they talk about a woman dying because she could not afford health care in the US, and had to be sent back to her home country.

 

I hear an old woman's voice

She is dying

Gasping for breath

They say that they are powerless

That they had no choice

They could have saved her

I could have saved her

I should have saved her.

I hear the death of the thousands

Crashing like an ocean against indifference

The untold pain and suffering

the gasping and crying

the pain.

I could help

I could do something

But I do nothing

I feel the pain and the sadness

And do nothing,

And so nothing ever changes.
