I watched /Justice League: Gods and Monsters/ a few days ago, and holy shit this is awesome, Bruce Timm is awesome, and he needs to start his own franchise now with more of this stuff.

The movie is about some an alternate DC Comics universe, with heavy emphasis on the "alternate" part. Every DC characters who appears has been heavily re-imagined in one way or another. Amanda Waller is the USA president, Lex Luthor is an eminent scientist, Steve Trevor is an US Army general, and last but not least, Superman is the son of General Zod and was raised by Mexican immigrants. Along with New-God!Wonder-Woman and Vampire!Not-Bruce-Wayne!Batman they form the super-murderous-but-well-intentioned Justice League!

I can't say much more without spoiling the plot, but if you liked the Justice League episode /A better world/, /Gods and Monsters/ is basically the same except more gritty, more mature, and Superman is allowed to kill people. The story is well written with many clever twists (Wonder Woman's backstory in particular is fantastic), the dialogues all hit the right notes ("The new world order will have to wait" is probably my favourite line), and the characters are all mostly rational and multi-dimensional.

Superman in particular is much more complex than he seems at first, especially for a "the ends justify the means" character. He cares about other people, and human life in general, yet he's ruthless when he needs to be. He's perfectly fine killing evil NPCs, but he never hits someone out of anger.

So if you liked /B:TAS/, and /Justice League/, and you feel DC movies have been disappointing lately, /Gods and Monsters/ is a must see.
