Hey folks another odd question. How do you battle depression? It's something I've dealt with off and on for a long time. Sometimes positive news will come along and make me feel better, but then the negative will rush in to meet it. This is especially relevant right now because I just I think pretty much bombed the first stage of Google's interview process (mostly I at least want to tell myself due to stress. I literately as I write this realized how I should have done the first problem for example).
