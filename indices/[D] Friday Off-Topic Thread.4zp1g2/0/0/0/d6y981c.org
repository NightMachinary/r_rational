I used to wonder why I didn't get annoyed at Dr. Who for this. If time travel works this way one week, and a different way another week, why don't I care about the inconsistency? Then I realized that, like the real world, the rules are there and are just really complicated with lots of exceptions. If I want to travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles, I could drive, fly, bike, walk, take a train, take a bus, sailboat, motorboat, ride a zeppelin, get shot out of a cannon, fired from a slingshot, mail myself, whatever. And each option has its own weird quirks to how it works. People assume time travel will just have one way to travel from later to then, but in Dr who, it's a different method every week, so the rules are different each week. The same applies to spaceship propulsion, forcefields, teleporters, computers, etc. The Doctor is just crazy smart enough to know all those little quirks and use them.
