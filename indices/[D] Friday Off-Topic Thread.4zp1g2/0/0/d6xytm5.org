Oculus drove me absolutely nuts with this. It established rules for interacting with the evil mirror - excellent, /interesting/ rules - and then it broke them and things happened for any reason or no reason... which didn't matter because the characters acted like they didn't know the rules they'd told us anyway.

I don't mind so much when it's Doctor Who and the universe is wibbly wobbly and changes every episode... but if a story goes to trouble to create a set of laws by which its cosmology operates, it had better /actually operate by those rules/. Otherwise, explaining them was just a giant waste of time.
