The rock salt shotgun shells are a good start, but:\\
* Filling hula hoops with salt.\\
* Squirt guns filled with holy water.\\
* Cold Iron rings/"brass" knuckles so they can punch ghosts.\\
* Rugs with demon traps on them.\\
* or graffiti stencils.\\
* Ghosts show up on cameras but not the naked eye right? They could keep Google glass in business with that alone.
