In a previous Friday Off-Topic Thread, I was looking for advice on stemware. I recall someone asking for me to report back when I bought something, so here's the report. I am still shopping around for some casual with-stem wine glasses, but I finally got some casual stemless wine glasses that have worked out quite well. They are Riedel stemless Riesling/Zinfandel glasses [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01D4U7MQ2/][(amazon link)]] and they pretty much meet my needs. They're a bit expensive ($8 per glass) but so far seem to be doing well.

They are fine in the dishwasher if you put them somewhere nothing will bump them on the top rack, and they are basically wine-glass shaped. They seem to have a normal wine glass level of fragility, and although their shape isn't perfect for a red wine, the experience is fine and you're probably not going all-out with expensive wine if you're drinking from a stemless glass.

When I ordered them, I had to return my order to Amazon twice due to the glasses arriving with some of them broken, so make sure to check the box carefully to see if any of the glasses are broken. Amazon handles this sort of return for free (including giving you a shipping label) but it's kind of a pain. In the future, I'll see if I can buy these in a store near me instead to avoid that hassle.

Overall, I recommend them if you can find them in a store near you, or are fine dealing with Amazon returns.
