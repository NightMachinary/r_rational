I am visiting a friend in the UK at the moment, and I took a side trip on the way here and spent a day in Amsterdam. I've never tried any drug but alcohol before, and decided Amsterdam should be safe. I've been curious for a long time, but I don't have the kind of connections that would allow me to get my hands on anything, plus there's always the chance there's something wrong with what you get. Hence, Amsterdam, where weed is legal and safe and I won't get stabbed.

It was weird. I probably recommend it, but maybe don't do it alone. Be with a friend if possible. One muffin is quite enough.

My 'space cake' muffin hit me after two and a half hours, and it happened very quickly. I was out in the sunny street when I started feeling like my legs were growing longer and harder, and there was a weird sense that some alien being was doing the reshaping. Then the sensation moved to thighs, then arms, then neck then mouth. It's really good that I had time to dive into a KFC and get food and a seat, because I spent the next three hours writing very slowly about how it was really difficult to think about more than one thing at a time, or finish a thought, or get myself to actually write down what I was thinking I should write down. It also really messed with my perception of time and made the movie Clue (1985) seem like the crown jewel of Tim Curry's acting career. Unfortunately, I also had several good ideas for my book I'm writing. I would have preferred to come away with the sense that it was an interesting and unique experience that I never wanted to try again, but instead I found it very helpful for my writing. Which is a bit of a bummer, because I have no intention of visiting Amsterdam often, nor do I want to get anything illegally back home in Sweden.

I'm very glad I tried it, but also a bit annoyed and frustrated that it turned out to be useful. Obviously there is the chance that the random sparks of creativity would become rarer or disappear with repeat exposure, but if so I probably won't find out for a few years until I drop by Amsterdam again.
