That particular kind of inspiration was caused by a brainstate. A brainstate reachable using drugs is usually something you can access /without/ drugs given sufficient guidance, training, and time. (For example, if you shut a person in a dark room for a week, they start hallucinating. In this case it's because the brain ends up trying to read meaning into static in the visual field, rather than because the higher parts of the visual cortex are being weirdly activated, but the effect of a dark room is not dependent on drugs.) Therefore, I would see such an experience as a glimpse of what could be possible, and try to figure out less supply-limited ways to achieve that kind of inspirational state.
