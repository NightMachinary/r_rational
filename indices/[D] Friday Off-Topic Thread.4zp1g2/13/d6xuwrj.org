<span class="only_half_joking">Either [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318171][Perfect Lionheart]] has been keeping an alt-account in reserve since 2013, or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5362799][tkepner]] is his long-lost twin.</span> /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447][Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly]]/ (115k words, in progress) seems *eerily* similar to the infamous /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ in its tone of "simultaneously crack-fic and deconstruction"--check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/9][Chapter 9]] for a shining example.

Edit: In later chapters, the similarities begin to become even more blatant.\\
- In Chapter 15, [[#s][spoiler]], and also [[#s][spoiler]]. This instantly calls to mind the harem shenanigans for which Perfect Lionheart's stories are infamous.\\
- In Chapter 16, [[#s][spoiler]]. In Chapter 30 of /Partially Kissed Hero/, [[#s][spoiler]].\\
If this writer isn't Perfect Lionheart, he's treading dangerously close to plagiarism with the second example, I think--especially since he hasn't mentioned any inspiration from /Partially Kissed Hero/.
