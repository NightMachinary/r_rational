I don't know that I explicitly disagree with anything from the talk, but the tone felt like a bit of a guilt-trip at times. I'm generally uncomfortable with that style of motivation. It has a tendency to condition people the wrong way - make them associate the thing they want to do with the guilt they feel whenever they remember how much they failed to do it last time. And it creates a bad feedback loop where people try to increase their feelings of guilt in hopes it will incentivize them do the right thing this time, but of course this only strengthens the association.

I'm also a bit wary of taking advice from this sort of speaker on principle. As best as I can tell, she has no more expertise in this subject than anyone who's read a self-help book. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Robbins][Wikipedia]], she has a law degree. She's not a psychologist. She's a "life coach." You could be a life coach - you just need clients and/or public speaking engagements. Maybe she did a lot of independent research, but a lot of her talk merely appealed to intuition rather than studies. She occasionally made some vague claims about "science" and used science-sounding words sometimes but all self-help gurus talk like this and a lot of them contradict each other.

Again, she might be correct about nearly everything she stated - this isn't really my domain of expertise. I just think that if you really want to dive into instrumental rationality, there are probably some better places to look.
