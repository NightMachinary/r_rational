Yes in some ways I can see how it might seem a bit patronizing. But this wasn't just a "try harder speech". The advice given in this Ted Talk is actually useful advice as far as I can tell. Unless there is something specific that she recommends that actually isn't a good idea to put into practice? I suspect that what she is saying are the very very basics, and they just seem so obvious to you that you feel like she is telling everybody things they already know and being congratulated for it. However, a lot of people probably struggle with the basics, and people aren't always entirely aware that being an adult means becoming your own parent rather than no longer needing parenting, nor of the amount of activation energy needed to change their behavior, nor about the five second rule. Also feeling a momentary urge to do something is not the same as feeling like doing it. Sometimes I have felt the urge to do my homework when I am completely exhausted and just want to get it out of the way, but I didn't really feel like doing it so I ignored the urge and put off my homework for later. Also how do you know that the advice in that Ted talk is aimed specifically at young adults who have had no self-discipline growing up? Not everyone who has yet to learn all of the most basic prerequisite skills of instrumental rationality is necessarily college-age or below.
