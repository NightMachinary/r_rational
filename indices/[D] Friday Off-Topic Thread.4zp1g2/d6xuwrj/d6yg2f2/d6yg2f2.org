Perfect Lionheart has maintained multiple accounts in the past (SkySaber, White Phoenix, Polychrome Knight, see [[http://jusenkyo.wikia.com/wiki/Jared_Ornstead]], [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PartiallyKissedHero]], [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=830988]]) so another one wouldn't be surprising.

EDIT: I've conferred with a fanfiction email group I'm part of and responses are generally negative: someone who considers Perfect Lionheart as a friend doesn't believe that tkepner is Lionheart, and it's been pointed out that there's just so many HP fanfics out there that a similar one is unsurprising.
