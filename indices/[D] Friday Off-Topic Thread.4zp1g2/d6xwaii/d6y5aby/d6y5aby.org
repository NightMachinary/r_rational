I don't like videos like this. For one, it feels a bit like a toned down Shia Labeouf's "Just Do It" speech tailored to a presumably more educated audience. It has minimal actual content and it's kind of patronizing. The speaker appears to be assuming that her audience consists entirely of young adults who never had any self-discipline growing up - who always had to be nagged into doing things by their parents. She essentially just berates her audience for their weak-will, tells them they'll /never/ feel like doing the things they know they ought but that they should somehow do them anyways - namely by leveraging the five second window they /do/ feel an impulse to do them (even though they'll /never/ feel such a thing).

I think of speeches like these as "Try Harder" speeches. At best, they get you psyched up for a minute when you're feeling down, but you haven't really been given much of a strategy to work with. You're just supposed to try harder this time - make sure you actually do the thing you know you ought to. Make sure you don't just say, "It's fine," or wait until you feel like doing it. If this works for someone, that's cool I guess. It just doesn't really make any sense to me.

It's worth noting that while the main sequences on Less Wrong don't have a lot on instrumental rationality, there are sections that do. Luke Muelhauser's [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Science_of_Winning_at_Life][The Science of Winning at Life]] sequence, for example.
