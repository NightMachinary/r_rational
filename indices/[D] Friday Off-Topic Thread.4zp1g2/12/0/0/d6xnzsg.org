I think the reason I don't like this brand of cosmic horror is that it doesn't relate to real world fears. Early chapters did a good job with humanity losing control over nature and having to deal with an uncaring and bizarre universe, but when Uriel explains that he turned northeast Africans into p-zombies because of a divine light shortage...I just don't get it. I don't find that funny, scary, or surreal. If anything, it seemed mean-spirited for no reason.
