Where does he say or imply that brutality and pain are unchangeable cosmic facts? It's a lot harder if not impossible to change in the kind of world depicted in Unsong as opposed to real life, but that could easily be something specific to the setting. Also what do you mean by casually appalls you on a moral level? Do you mean that you think it's unethical for him to write what he writes the way he writes it? Or that he depicts unethical situations? Or his opinions are somehow unethical?

I don't think it was a joke I think it was simply a conceit of the setting. In the story people who don't have minds/souls and who operate purely on physics are p-zombies, because in the setting of Unsong consciousness is caused by souls. If it helps you suspend your disbelief, imagine that the reason that pure physics can't cause consciousness in Unsong is the same reason that many modern technologies stopped working in the story early on.
