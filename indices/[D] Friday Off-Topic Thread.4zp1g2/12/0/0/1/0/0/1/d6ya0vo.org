I still don't get the joke. What's so funny about Uriel turning people into p-zombies? Uriel arbitrarily did something horrible to a large group of people who were already marginalized, didn't tell anyone, and was surprised that people were upset when he casually brought it up.

It's horrifying, but not in a way I enjoy. I'm not unsettled by the reveal, just depressed that it happened and disgusted that no one is able or willing to improve the situation, which is how I've felt about this story for a while now.
