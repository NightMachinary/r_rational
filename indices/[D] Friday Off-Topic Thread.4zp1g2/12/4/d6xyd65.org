I managed the first 13 chapters and thought it was kinda funny throughout but basically completely americocentric, as an European the idea that any government could actually enforce law against people just speaking stuff even with new magic powers across the whole world is absurd to me. Considering that people do commit suicide with the intent to kill others for (at least stated) religious ideals the wrathful name would be the end of mankind in my opinion.
