You mean the conversation between Ana and the CEO? That didn't explain anything. It said that governments enforce the patents on the names and punish pirates with jail time, but it didn't explain why. It is in a nation's rational self interest to have access to as many names as possible, and the specific example given would've lead to economic growth in that country. What motivation do countries have to enforce the patent?
