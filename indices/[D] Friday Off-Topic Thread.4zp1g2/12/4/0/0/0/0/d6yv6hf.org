You must not have read the whole chapter. It totally /did/ explain why.

  “Ever hear of Chesterton's fence?” asked Simeon.

  “Yeah. The story of a guy who sees a fence in a field, gets angry that it's blocking his movement, and tears it down. Then he gets gored by a bull that the fence was protecting him from. It's supposed to mean that you shouldn't get rid of a system until you're sure you know why it's there.”

  “Ever think of applying Chesterton's fence to the theonomics? Or UNSONG?”

  “‘Rich people want more money' seems like sufficient explanation for a system dedicated to giving rich people money.”

  “You know the Comet King helped found UNSONG?”

  “Even the Comet King makes mistakes.”

  “Really?”

  “You're going to say the same thing you people always say. If we didn't make sure that the people who discovered Names got obscene profits, there'd be no incentive to discover Names, all the sweatshops would close, and then we wouldn't have the magic we need to treat diseases or run the railroads. But people have done plenty of basic science research for centuries without those incentives, and I would rather get Names a little bit slower but have them available to everyone than -- ”

  “Forget curing diseases. That's a red herring. You want to know why we need UNSONG and the theonomics? Look around.”

  *“Uriel's machine is deteriorating,” Simeon told Ana. “When it finally falls apart, it's going to loose a lot of things that look at humans as the bottom of the food chain. The Drug Lord. Thamiel. Other things. Older things. Technology won't save us then. The only thing that can save us is Names. Lots and lots of Names. We beat the Drug Lord back with Names, but not well, and now we don't have the Comet King on our side. When the last screw falls out of that machine, I want us armed with as many Names as we can get. Cate Ilyov buys private jets because Cate Ilyov is an idiot. Me, I'm sinking all Countenance's profits back into Countenance. And a few other projects besides. Not because I'm not selfish. I am. I'm selfish enough to be scared. For me. For my family.”*
