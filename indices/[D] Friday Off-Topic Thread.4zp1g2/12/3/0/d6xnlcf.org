I haven't seen DBZ, I'll watch Kai someday, but I'm under the impression that no matter how much filler there was the plot still had a clear direction. As much as the characters meandered about, there was always a clear goal for them to achieve. Even if they aren't searching for dragonballs, competing in tournaments, or saving the world you know they'll get back to that eventually.

UNSONG has no such direction. Chapters that are supposed to provide additional background information and worldbuilding are rendered pointless when we have no idea what they're building up to or why it's important. Even the main story arc has completely abandoned its original focus, instead having the lead characters get roped into completely unrelated journeys that are taking FOREVER.
