Yep. There's some replacement music they use in Kai that's almost universally terrible and disjointed, with nowhere near a cohesive aesthetic.

To be fair, some scenes really are cut down. I believe that clip above is a minute shorter, despite starting and ending at about the same place, and there are some episodes that are totally skipped or merged in Kai due to how much time is spent on the occasional slice of life episode and blond men screaming.

(It's hard to convey how exciting blond men screaming can be when watching the show as a kid, because you just knew it was a build up of suspense to something awesome, but as an adult with things to do, it's definitely a bit much)

In any case, you'll find a lot of clips on youtube overlaying DBZ music over Kai for the best of both worlds, but I don't know if there's a way to watch the whole show like that.

To be honest though, I don't know if I'd even recommend DBZ to an adult. DBZ abridged is hilarious and pretty much the strongest argument I can make for watching the original, just to better understand the refernces and whatnot.
