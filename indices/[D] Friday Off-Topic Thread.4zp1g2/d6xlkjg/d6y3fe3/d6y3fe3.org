I was going to post something defending Unsong... then I realized that I really only enjoy the worldbuilding and Uriel/Sohu chapters. The Ana chapters are okay, but the Aaron chapters have totally lost my interest. I think I realized this story was losing me was the Broadcast chapter. At the point, I felt like I could no longer laugh at the jokes because they might turn out to have some secret dark meaning or reference something horrific. The introduction of Placebomancy also screwed around with things because it meant I could no longer trust plot points to have coherent reasons as opposed to being driven by the in-universe narrative power.

So the idea of a world that runs on Kabalah and placebomancy still continues to interest me, and as Alexanderwales said, many of the individual stories of Unsong interest me but the overall story has problems.

  How come so many people find recent chapters hilarious while I think they're boring and stupid?

Does anyone still find it funny? I stopped laughing at the jokes because I can never tell when they are going to end horribly or have some secret meaning (i.e. the end of the latest chapter and Uriel's knock-knock joke). I also don't like Pun humor, so there is that also... I guess I really only liked the weirdness and Uriel's perspective is the only part that I still really like.
