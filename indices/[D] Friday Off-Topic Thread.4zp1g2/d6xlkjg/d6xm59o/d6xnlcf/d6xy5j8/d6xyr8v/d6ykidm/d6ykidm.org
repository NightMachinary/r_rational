My personal recommendation against Kai is, good god the music is horrible.

Maybe it only seems horrible because the amazing, genius soundtrack by Bruce Faulconer in the original series is so iconic to people who grew up on it.

But I'll put forth that this:

Beats this:

By a longshot. IIRC, they didn't want to pay Faulconer when wanting to re-use his music, so they decided against it. To me, one of the worst cases of penny-pinching ruining a show's potential I've ever seen/heard.

Because normally, yeah, there's a ton of filler in DBZ. But I'd rather just skip those episodes or fastforward through those parts and watch the original than watch it without music like this:
