If you haven't watched DBZ I would personally advise [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nYozPLpJRE&list=PL6EC7B047181AD013][Dragon Ball Z Abridged]] over Kai, it's funnier faster paced and still contains most of the plot and character development from the original series unless you don't find it funny or would prefer a more serious show even with it being slower.
