I feel much the same. The only remaining interest is in the bizarre puzzle aspect, but that's not enough to sustain the story.

What really did it for me was the abundance of tiny chapters which don't add anything. The story lost all of its forward momentum, and whenever it returned to a "main" character very little had progressed since we last saw them. I hadn't thought of this till now, but it almost seems a little like watching Dragonball Z.
