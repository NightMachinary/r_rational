I like the whole meme-plexe it makes references to, which is thelesswrong memesphere to be exact.

I am fine with slow chapters, since its a weekly(?) web serial - of course the suspense is different as if it were finished.

Existential dread is fine by me too: real world existential dread is still ever present, disregarding fictional ED and is humour a fine way to deal with it. I also actually expect a good ending from Scott- I cant imagine him writing a tragedy.
