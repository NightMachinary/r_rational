Eh. I've taken philosophy courses where Chalmers lectured, but didn't find anything particularly convincing.

- Imagine that I may be a P-Zombie.
- By hypothesis, there is /in principle/ no way to detect whether or not I am a P-Zombie. In other words, physical effects may not have (dualistic) mental causes.
- If 'my mind' is affected by physical causes, I consider it to be a physical effect. Hard or impossible to measure, but it's not unique there.
- If it is /not/, how can 'my mind' be related to 'my body'?

So the most-coherent proposition I could work out is that there is a dual world of conscious entities, utterly unable to interact with our own.

If they have read-only access, so what? If the body does exactly what a non-physical mind desires for coincidental physical reasons alone, that's (a) suspiciously implausible and (b) who cares?

If they have write access, it's not a P-Zombie.

If they don't, how is this not a P-Zombie plus unrelated mind?
