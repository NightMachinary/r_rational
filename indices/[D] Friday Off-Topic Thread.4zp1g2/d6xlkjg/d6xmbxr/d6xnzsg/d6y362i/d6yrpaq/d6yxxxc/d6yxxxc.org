I mean, yeah. And I always wonder why a p-zombie would speculate about consciousness.

I totally get that our current neurosci and cogsci don't seem to clearly /entail/ qualia/experiences, but they fo seem to be wearing down a lot of it by Groenthendieck's method (crack a nut by soaking it in the rising tide until its shell softens). The more we understand about the mind, the more we do see that functional cognition's structure is isomorphic to that of conscious experience.
