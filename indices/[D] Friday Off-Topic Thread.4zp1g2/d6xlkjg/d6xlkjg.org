I don't like UNSONG anymore. What started off as a showpiece of hilariously weird ideas has become an unfocused narrative with uninteresting characters and an unwelcome shift in tone from dark silliness to deadly serious. I love cosmic horror stories, but UNSONG's existential dread isn't fun anymore.

What is it that people still like about it? How come so many people find recent chapters hilarious while I think they're boring and stupid? Am I in the minority on this?
