I don't buy that. Patents make sense in other industries because innovation requires creativity and insight, but theonomics are just brute-force hacking with Hebrew. Publicly-funded sweatshops could achieve the exact same thing at the same cost while also providing increased economic growth by releasing useful names to the public, who then pay more taxes.

All the patent system does is restrict the use of names for the sake of a profit incentive, but all your rewarding is either luck or the best secret algorithm. This is a very inefficient system that hemorrhages money due to rampant piracy and the cost of enforcing unnecessary laws. There is no reason for megacorporations to be the sole source of innovation.
