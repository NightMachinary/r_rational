For me it was the lack of what I call "plot". Truths, lies, and falsehoods need to be revealed at a particular rate in order to keep the narrative advancing. No matter how fascinating the world is, if I'm not getting meaty answers to well-established questions (especially the ones related to a story's main characters) then I get tired of slogging through excess exposition.

As Parker and Stone say, everything on screen has to matter. Each new plot point must be tied to the previous ones with a "therefore" or a "but"... otherwise it's just one damn thing after another.

A narrative always contains an implicit promise that there's a good reason we're being told all this stuff. Not keeping that in sight breaks that promise. When the dog gets sufficiently shaggy, I lose interest fast.
