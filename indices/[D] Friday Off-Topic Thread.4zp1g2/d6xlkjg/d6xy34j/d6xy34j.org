I've found myself really unenthusiastic about it as of late. I think that part of my problem with the current section is that it barely adds anything. I always made peace with Unsong's lack of direction and narrative focus by interpreting it as a series of loosely related short stories set in the same world, but now ... those individual stories aren't all that compelling.

The BOOJUM chapter was a full, complete story, and while it wasn't connected to practically anything else, /as a chapter/ it still had a complete beginning, middle, and end. Many of the most recent chapters just don't do that, or do it poorly, which makes the fact that they're not part of a proper narrative structure all the more frustrating.

At least, that's my thinking.
