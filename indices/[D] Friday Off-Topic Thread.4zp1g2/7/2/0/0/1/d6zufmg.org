I'm glad you found something that works for you!

It's worth mentioning that vigor and health in the short term can trade off against longevity and health in the long-term. In short, testosterone is sort of a real life version of the pepper-up potion, albeit on a longer timescale.

My personal opinion is that estrogen is like a weaker version of the "testosterone pepper up potion", which trades some medium term protection from e.g. osteoporosis for minuscule increases in life expectancy and middling increases in lifespan.

The literature isn't quite as supportive of me on this claim about estrogen as it is of my above claim about testosterone.

(If you want to reply, feel free to have the last word on this, since I'm not at all in the mood for a debate) :)
