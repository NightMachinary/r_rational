Please don't beat yourself up about having an average interview! If you would be comfortable with elaborating on the frequency and duration of the periods of depression you've gone through, maybe it would be possible for us to give more specific advice?

Specifically, if you're not clinically depressed and are just looking to be a bit happier, I could recommend things like Sparkwitch's suggestions to be active, find hobbies, and so on. If you feel that you might be clinically depressed, though, maybe reading [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/16/things-that-sometimes-help-if-youre-depressed/][Scott's SSC post]] on depression and talking with your family doctor (if feasible) are good ideas.
