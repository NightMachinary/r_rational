In my case I realized how much more energy it took to be depressed than not to be depressed, and got frustrated that I was putting all that effort into feeling miserable when I could be directing it somewhere else.

So, even when it felt impossible or meaningless or counter-productive, I made myself do /something/ active or creative. Even just taking a walk or making a sandwich or writing a poem.

If, at that point, I felt frustrated that I was doing something silly or pointless, then I'd take the opportunity to remind myself that I could do something I had been putting off or avoiding.

Turned my life around. Also I got back into playing classical piano (after avoiding it for almost a decade) and I learned how to draw well enough that I'm happy with what I produce. Not to mention the whole no longer spending hours every evening contemplating the grim pointless slog of the workaday world.

This hasn't been helpful to anybody else I've told, but surely there's somebody else out there like me.
