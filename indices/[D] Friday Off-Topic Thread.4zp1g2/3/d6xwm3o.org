How do you cope with never being completely satisfied with yourself? I have this constant feeling that I should be doing more, or strive for greater accomplishments, or don't risk to waste my potential.

This is exacerbated because I am not satisfied with my current situation and I want to get over it as soon as possible, so I postpone social or pleasurable activities to after I'll have a job and independence secured. One reasoning is: I don't really want to feel well now, because I don't deserve it yet, and want to use my present unhappiness to fuel me forward. On the other hand, there will be always a main objective to accomplish, and this state of mind leads to apathy\frenzies cycles, isolation and a general inability to enjoy the present moment.

So, is this only me or do you ever felt this way? Thanks to you all by the way, this is my first post after years of lurking and I enjoy this community immensely.
