Seconding this very strongly.

Also have been in that state of mind, and am just now coming back from the resulting fallout. (wasted a year or so, failed several courses, lost motivation to do research and learn things for several months) It was because I was never satisfied with what I had accomplished, always wanted to get more done in the day and so on. (had some anxiety issues that were intertwined with this stuff too)

My recommendation is to set (achievable) goals for how you want to spend your time and allow yourself to feel satisfied if you meet them. These goals should only be on things you control though, i.e. completing a job application, studying for an interview, getting feedback from a friend on a cover letter and improving it, etc. as opposed to "getting hired in interview" which is not something that's in your hands (directly). It helps to think about relaxing, socializing (after you've done the planned amount of work or what not for the day) as an objective that's important to your goals rather than a unnecessary distraction.

Does that make sense? (or not?)
