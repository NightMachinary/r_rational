So I've been watching Supernatural every now and again recently---ironically, I despise the overarching plot line and skip it whenever I can, just so I can watch the "filler" episodes. All I want is for two brothers to bust ghosts without whining about how they're dysfunctionally dealing with issues and each other, is that too much to ask?

But more to the point, there are demons in this setting, and said demons can be expelled by chanting or reciting an exorcism. Once I saw that, my first thought was, "Why are they reading it out of a book? They should just memorise it. In fact, why don't you just record your voice saying an exorcism and play it whenever you fight a demon?" But I thought, whatever, maybe there's some handwaving going on about how it needs to be direct from the mouth of a believer or something. But no. Later on, they do just that: they play a recording of an exorcism---over a loudspeaker, what's more---and use it to incapacitate a building full of demons.

/And then they never do this again./

What? If you had just made up some rule of magic that explained why they couldn't record themselves and have it work, I'd go along with it. But if you've proven it works, /why not use itâ€½/ Or even go further: record your voice, speed it up 10x, and perform tests on a demon once you capture it (since they capture these things every other episode without difficulty). If that works, just open every engagement by pressing "play" on an MP3 of you reciting an exorcism sped up by a factor of 100---in half a second of seeming white noise, the demon is gone before it can even execute a hostage or react.

I know it makes little sense to rail about how irrational a non-Rational work of fiction is, and this show has plenty more to complain about, but that particular bit stuck in my craw something awful.
