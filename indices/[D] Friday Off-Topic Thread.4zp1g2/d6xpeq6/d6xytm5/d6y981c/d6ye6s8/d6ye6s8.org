I would like to believe this, but I don't.

The reason people don't get annoyed by Dr. Who is because they like the show, and shows that we like get a lot more leeway than shows we don't.

If you accept the "it's a different method every week" claim, or the "The Doctor is just crazy smart enough to know all those little quirks and use them" as legitimate excuses, then /no show should ever annoy you/. Why? Because that claim is essentially [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt][a TimeLord did it]].

Doctor Who is a fantasy show in a scifi setting, and I'm fine with that. Fixing all of the plot-holes in Doctor Who would probably be harder than [[http://squid314.livejournal.com/327646.html][steel-manning the Time Cube]], but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy watching it. We don't have to make excuses for why Doctor Who is actually rational any more than we have to make excuses for Phineas and Ferb. Some shows are irrational, enjoy them.
