  Transcendent knowledge seems to be the easiest to deal with: Simply share it with as many (willing) people as possible, so that you can investigate it together without having to fight against being perceived as insane all the time. Which, now that I think about it, might just be the rationale behind every single crazy, isolationist cult there is. How do you prove to others, and yourself, that your cult is the one that is actually correct? Assuming that your special insight doesn't give you equally special powers. If it does, then demonstrating them might lend credence to your claims. Or not.
