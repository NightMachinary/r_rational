  Are there more kinds of TMWNMTK that I didn't consider?

There probably are more kinds of insanity-inducing knowledge if you set aside the question of whether the knowledge actually has to be /true/. There's propaganda or indoctrination that induces shared hallucination or mass hysteria, for example, or acculturation or medical misinformation encouraging lifestyles where nutritional deficiencies/supplements contribute to psychiatric disorders directly. Or for a concrete example, the meme that one must maintain an ideal body may be associated with the development of eating disorders.

(These may or may not correspond to variations of your original categories. They are probably closest to the category you've defined as 'eldritch' though they are not particularly eldritch at all. Perhaps "welcome knowledge"---if unwelcome knowledge insanity results from a /conflict/ between what you have learned and what you desire to be true, then this would be from a /cooperation/ between them---a sort of being confirmation-biased into insanity.)

... I also got to thinking about other possible/fictitious kinds of exotic knowledge that can't propagate by normal means. At the very least there would be

1. /inconceivable/ knowledge (knowledge that refuses to register in the human mind, even when directly exposed to the experience it refers to)
2. /ineffable/ knowledge (knowledge that resists being formulated or even approximated by any means of human communication---it can enter a mind, but not leave it)
3. /unstable/ knowledge (knowledge that cannot be recorded or communicated without errors)
4. /mysterious/ knowledge (knowledge that can enter a mind but only with a sense that the thing isn't /really/ known or understood)

I suppose these can all be observed in the real world when understanding of difficult knowledge is attempted by insufficiently-strengthened minds. Whether they can exist in the absolute might depend on whether knowledge can be an "immovable object" or understanding can be an "unstoppable force".
