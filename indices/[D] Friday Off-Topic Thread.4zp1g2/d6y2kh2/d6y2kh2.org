How would you go about investigating/researching/exploiting Things Man(kind) Was Not Meant To Know, i.e. stuff that drives you insane just by knowing about it?

The way I see it there are a couple of categories of TMWNMTK:

First there is forbidden knowledge, meaning that there is some agent/entity/process which checks whether someone is in possession of it and, if that is the case, inflicts madness upon the offender.

Second there is eldritch knowledge, meaning that the concepts involved induce insanity because grasping/internalizing them leads to some kind of mental degenerative positive feedback-loop or brain damage.

Third there is unwelcome knowledge, meaning that there is some conflict between what you have learned of the world and what you desire to hold true that leads to some kind of mental breakdown. This differs from eldritch knowledge in that it is your personal psyche and not the general structure of the human mind that leads to your vulnerability.

Fourth, and last, there is transcendent knowledge. This is some kind of insight into the true nature of reality that causes you to act like a crazy person, even though you are perfectly sane.

Transcendent knowledge seems to be the easiest to deal with: Simply share it with as many (willing) people as possible, so that you can investigate it together without having to fight against being perceived as insane all the time. Which, now that I think about it, might just be the rationale behind every single crazy, isolationist cult there is. How do you prove to others, and yourself, that your cult is the one that is actually correct? Assuming that your special insight doesn't give you equally special powers. If it does, then demonstrating them might lend credence to your claims. Or not.

Next, it seems to me that there are two ways to deal with unwelcome knowledge: either keep such a closed mind that nothing you learn can shake the foundations of your beliefs, or be a rationalist. Though the former makes the investigation part of my question rather difficult.

Eldritch knowledge would be the most interesting, I think, since research would involve creating minds alien enough to safely comprehend and/or use the eldritch knowledge while still being close enough to human to communicate and/or cooperate.

Though researching forbidden knowledge would be an interesting exercise in crafting theories that are close enough to the truth to be useful, but far enough away to not trigger the interdiction effect. Am I wrong or would this result in the only reliable users being those that work by memorization instead of comprehension?

For the purposes of this question I assume that there is some value in investigating these memetic hazards apart from the realization that there is some kind of brain-melting trivia loose in the universe.

Are there more kinds of TMWNMTK that I didn't consider?

Are there actual terms for these categories that are widely used but unknown to me?

Would you be interested in risking your precious brain-meats for the betterment of humankind?
