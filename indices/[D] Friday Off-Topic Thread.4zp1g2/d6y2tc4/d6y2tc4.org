Recently I've been going through Catharine Asaro's Skolian Empire books. I've got mixed feelings, that can be summed up as '8/10'. These books are not rational in any way or fashion.

The books are predominantly romances. I think the genre it falls into is probably closest to Romantic Fantasy as defined in [[http://prokopetz.tumblr.com/post/148985837272/ive-mentioned-romantic-fantasy-in-a-few-recent][this Tumblr post]]. It feels like an evolution of the sort of things that Mercedes Lackey or especially Anne McCaffrey were doing. It's much better than McCaffrey's stuff... but that's sort of damning with faint praise. There's a bunch of reversing gender roles stuff in her work in various ways, but it's mostly not done in a particularly interesting/clever/plausible/unique way - Ancillary Justice, for example, was way better for this kind of thing, and many other authors have done gender role reversal stuff in better ways than Asaro.

The Skolian Empire books were advertised as a hard sci fi setting in the place I originally saw the recommendation for them, and also are so advertised on Wikipedia in a few places, but I feel like that's /mostly/ a lie. It feels like the majority of it is just using some trappings and names of science-y things without really thinking about them or considering them in much or any detail. It's full of soft sci-fi conventions and devices, and the occasional hard sci-fi detail doesn't really make it feel super plausible. I like hard sci-fi, and I like soft sci-fi, but this mixture of the two is less appealing in some respects. Looking at the author's background, I would have thought that most of the issues I had with the books' science background stuff would be things she would specifically have a ton of background and experience, so I just don't even know. In a few of the books, there is actually quite interesting and cool science fiction stuff at least loosely based on actual science that is unique and interesting, but in a ton of it there's just a lot of space magic with the occasional science-y sounding word. I feel like Asaro underuses a few of her space magic plot devices really poorly, too, in ways that would take a really long essay to go into; for example, she completely failed to sell me on the vital utility of the telepath-powered instantaneous FTL comms communication system that so much of her worldbuilding and society was pinned on.

Relatedly, there are a number of really weird retcons and totally unnecessary plot holes that happen in the books that overall annoy me. I think the books were probably not written with the expectation that someone would marathon them in a row sequentially and read more than a dozen of them in a week. For one example that won't spoil much, in one of the novels a big deal is repeatedly made of how for a barbarian society from a world devolved to primitism that has no axial tilt and a very regular orbit, they had lost all notion of 'years' and didn't use them at all to gauge maturity and in spite of the main character coming from a society which retained them, they were never able to think in 'years' or really understand the point of 'years'. Then a couple books later still on this yearless world, the same barbarian character and everyone else in their barbarian society is constantly using years and thinking/talking in years when justifying that another character is too young to leave home and attend a military academy, or old enough to wed someone, or whatever. It's not rare for details to feel majorly inconsistent between books.

A more vital irritation with the books is that they were written with a non-chronological order in such a way that reading in publication order you get spoiled for the ending and conclusion of one book by the other books fairly often. You'll read a page summary of how X met Y and fell in love or whatever in book Z, and then have an entire book of it happening later on as book Z+n. This is less a concern in the romance genre than in many other genres, but it feels like a really odd decision - a couple of these 'review history of some side character' books are sort of OK in their own right but add basically nothing to the overall plot, and I spent much of them less interested - they were just filling in the details when other books already let the reader know how everything came out in the end, which feels sort of pointless.

A huge amount of the books' backstory and background make very little sense to me, and it feels like the social history, the economic history, and the political history of the various polities in the books make very little sense. It feels like the author did a very half-assed job of the background history in these books.
