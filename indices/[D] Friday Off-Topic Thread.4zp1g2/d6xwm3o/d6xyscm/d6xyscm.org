Obviously I have nowhere near enough information to make any kind of accurate argument, but, that said:

  I don't really want to feel well now, because I don't deserve it yet, and want to use my present unhappiness to fuel me forward

This is a really terrible method, and I mean in a "been there, done that" kind of way. This is the stuff downward spirals are made of. You're trying to punish yourself to motivate towards a nebulous future reward, but a stick with no carrot is just abuse.

I don't know how productive your current phase is. Going out with friends to a bar or movie kinda is a waste of time most often. But those are far from the only options, and I would ask you step back and look at the past period and examine the things which took up the most time you would have otherwise spent being social, and ask yourself if they really paid off in the end. I never watch the news because 99.97% literally does not turn into significant information which is actually worth my time. I'm not trying to bash you or anything, just don't let your productivity become another form of procrastination (I've seen it happen).

Here's what I think: no one /deserves/ happiness. No one /deserves/ suffering, or apathy either. Those feelings are hard-wired in your brain, but there's no moral construct attached to them. "Deserving" never comes into it. There will never be a time when you can say "Now I am allowed to be happy," that's just a fallacy. Happiness isn't bestowed upon you by friends, or society, or God, or whatever. You find it for yourself according to your values, and if you're lonely or something and you can't find happiness then you go out and /make it/.

Happiness isn't a finite resource, it's renewable. Even better, it's abundant, and the better you get at being happy (creating and consuming what you enjoy, whether that includes/requires other people or not) the more happiness you can get out those of activities.

Just a thought. Quite possibly wrong for your situation, but then again, maybe not.
