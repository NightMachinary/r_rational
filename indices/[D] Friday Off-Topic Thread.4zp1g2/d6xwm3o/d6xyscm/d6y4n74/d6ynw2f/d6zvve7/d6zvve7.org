Thank you for making an account and posting about such an important question! That was both a brave and a commendable thing to do.

  How do you cope with never being completely satisfied with yourself?

I've heard lots of people talk about ways to have high self-esteem "from the inside/without external validation", but things still tend to work out even when you can't turn yourself into a person who magically generates their own self-esteem. Actually, IMHO, it's pretty typical to feel depressed for a few months after graduating if you don't have a job, before the hedonic treadmill effect kicks in and re-normalizes your happiness and self-esteem levels.

One resource that you probably have is flexibility, which means that you have more freedom to form whatever habits you want to form. So, if you want to (say) go jogging at 3pm each day and only be productive in the late afternoon and evening, try modifying your routine (or lack thereof) by one habit at a time until you practice a set of habits you're content with.

Good luck, and best wishes to you. Please do post again after a while if you have progress to report, or would like additional advice and encouragement once you have tried a couple more tactics.
