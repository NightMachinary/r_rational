Thanks to all of you. This is great advice. I'm reading and rereading your posts to transform them in a practical system update.

  This is a really terrible method, and I mean in a "been there, done that" kind of way. This is the stuff downward spirals are made of. You're trying to punish yourself to motivate towards a nebulous future reward, but a stick with no carrot is just abuse.

Looking in retrospect I think this started with a disdain for the culture of appearance (think Instagramers, ecc.), that backfired with a resolution to not appear happy without first having done something that matters. As you said, this is bad and draining and difficult to get rid of as it is masked by a prideful self-sacrifice sentiment.

  I'm not trying to bash you or anything, just don't let your productivity become another form of procrastination (I've seen it happen).

This resonates a lot. I start with sacrificing a lot of activities, suddenly have lots of time, and then waate it to feel more miserable in the end. Treating time as a scarce resourse and periodically check the results from every activity is both very necessary and very difficult (nobody wants to feel wrong and there are lots of excuses that comes up). I have to work on this and prepare some red flags.

One things that helped me is precommitment: staying at home have certain benefits, while the benefits of going out can't be anticipated with precision; there is the serendipity, and new encounters, and the friend of a friend that was passing in town that night and ends to be the love of your life. So it's useful to just precommit to do several things that don't appear so great at the start knowing that the best things comes from the unexpected.

  Happiness isn't bestowed upon you by friends, or society, or God, or whatever. You find it for yourself according to your values, and if you're lonely or something and you can't find happiness then you go out and make it.
#+end_quote

Never thought about it in this way, and it's great. This reminds me of the philosophical concept that an imprisoned man can be free, as your mind state can be loosened from the external condition. Being an happiness generator seems a really good life mission.

  Also have been in that state of mind, and am just now coming back from the resulting fallout. (wasted a year or so, failed several courses, lost motivation to do research and learn things for several months)
#+end_quote

I am happy that you are getting out of that. I too experienced a fallout a few years ago and I can assure you things gets better. The thing that caused it for me was subconsciously feeling "trapped", the sensation that you have to drive in a tunnel and read from a script for the next years. All changed when I realized it and that I had the wheel to make all the choices.

  My recommendation is to set (achievable) goals for how you want to spend your time and allow yourself to feel satisfied if you meet them.
#+end_quote

That's awesome. It's worth also saying that almost always it's most efficient to just beginning to do the thing than overthinking the more efficient way to do it, as we learn and improve by doing.

In short, this is life-changing advice that I'm implementing right now, and I'm really grateful to both of you. I would be happy to discuss it further in private, if you feel such inclination.
