  Never thought about it in this way, and it's great. This reminds me of the philosophical concept that an imprisoned man can be free, as your mind state can bee loosed from the external condition. Being an happiness generator seems a really good life mission.

This is how I remain happy, personally. I look for people who's day I can make better, even in small ways -- finding someone who's art I like and complimenting them on it, encouraging writers, etc. It's very rewarding to see someone happy for what you've done.
