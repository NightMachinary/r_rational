So I have something of a hard on for reductionism. Really, I think many, if not most of us here do-- it's appealing, philosophically and practically, to reduce systems to a few fundamental parts that interact to bring about everything else.

So of course, it's interesting to think of the implications of the Universe /not/ being neatly reductible. What if we can keep looking down, so to speak? What if things just get smaller and smaller infinitely? What would be the implications for mathematics and philosophy?
