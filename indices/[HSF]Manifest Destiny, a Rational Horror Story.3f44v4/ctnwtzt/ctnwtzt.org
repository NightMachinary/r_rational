No, this is a good thing! It's /localized/ - we can get away from it. Plus, new and exciting physics! If space-time itself can support predators, it can support colonists. We need to play for time - small colony ships, seed populations, spreading FTL hundreds at a time in all directions.

We know we can outrun it. The rest is exponentials.
