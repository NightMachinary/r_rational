In a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/SF_Book_Club/comments/2hzpmt/echopraxia_qa_questions_fended_off_by_peter_watts/][reddit AMA]], Peter Watts is shown a glaring piece of continuity error that neither he nor his editor had noticed, and elsewhere he mixes up the names of two of his characters, and in a third place mentions that a tiny but crucial detail to a different book of his is missing because, on the fifteenth or so editing pass, he'd forgotten why he had put it there. This makes me feel less inadequate about my own writing, insofar as it reminds me that nobody is perfect. Peter Watts shouldn't feel like the World's Worst Author for these mistakes, I shouldn't feel the same when I make them, and (this is why I'm bringing it up, for my fellow authors) neither should you.

Keep your eyes peeled for a cameo by [[/u/eaturbrainz]] in there!
