Even though it seemed off genre, I don't think it was a gimmick. They play a role in the world and story that helps further the ideas being explored so I didn't mind it in that sense. I wasn't going in for a robust and consistent universe, it was a thought experiment about the nature of consciousness and the mind for me.
