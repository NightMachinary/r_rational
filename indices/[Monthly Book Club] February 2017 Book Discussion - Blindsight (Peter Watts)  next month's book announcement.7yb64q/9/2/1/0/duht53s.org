I definitely would have preferred that instead of creating an alternate history where evolution somehow speedily whipped up a twig of the human branch that has a suite of abilities and a special weakness, they had just made the vamps through genetic engineering or something.

I think the "ooh, vampires are real and they're /our monster/ because we brought them back and they're super smart and they have spooky eyeballs /and they're in space now/" was a gimmick.
