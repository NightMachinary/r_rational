Exactly. No matter how smart it is, it's a biological entity that shares the overwhelming majority of its genes with humans, they're even capable of cross-breeding with us. Baseline humans already developed GAI, and we've got multicore multibrain hive minds in the next novel. I don't care how good the pattern matching on them is, there's no way that without some serious augmentation and tweaking that would also be applicable to other human offshoots, that they'd be able to just take over without some bigger post-biological brainchild of humanity giving them the finger. Especially take over the planet as the Blindsight's ending implies.

Now, it's a great book, and vampires are an interesting /concept/, just one that isn't really water tight once you look at it closely.
