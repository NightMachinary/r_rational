The vampires were absolutely necessary as a conceptual bridge between humanity and the Chinese rooms. By demonstrating that just removing our capacity for empathy would create something entirely inhuman and arguably nonsapient, it gets far easier to understand what I view as the main points of the novel: that our assumptions about sapience may be entirely wrong, that the universe as a whole does not know the difference between sapience and nonsapience, and that coming at problems from familiar points of view has a reasonable chance of backfiring horribly if you don't understand all the moving parts first. It becomes far harder to see those things if there isn't something human-shaped to build bridges between our own existence and what is being said.
