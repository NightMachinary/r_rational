I don't know, Sarasti didn't form that function for me: when I read it, I didn't see him as having anything in common with the aliens, though now you explain it I do. I thought it was more a commentary on psychopathy and Siri possibly being a psychopath (but maybe that's what I brought into the book; I'm always feeling terrified I'm a psychopath, which I know is not how a psychopath would feel).
