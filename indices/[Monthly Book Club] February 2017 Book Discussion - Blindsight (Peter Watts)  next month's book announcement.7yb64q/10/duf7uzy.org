[META THREAD]

  Next month's discussion will be posted by the superb [[/u/magicweasel]] on March 14th, or a few days later if we're a little behind in our reading.

Also March 14th happens to be my birthday, so it might be a little after that just because I'll be too busy ~PARTYING~ (ha!).

In more housekeeping news, next month the book suggestion thread is going to become archived. With the rotating "hosts" each month, and the work that goes into "hosting" and reading a book, we might become more insular in the choices we make as choosing the book is the privilege of the book club czar: so if you want to guarantee the book you're itching to talk about is chosen, well, volunteer to host one month!

Also, if people are interested in accountability, me and [[/u/callmesalticidae]] have a "book club email thread" that we use to prod each other into meeting our reading deadlines (and that contains at least one image of the lovely spot by the river I stop on my way home from work to squeeze some reading in if the weather's pleasant). So feel free to PM either of us to get in on that.
