I read an article a while ago about how The Singularity has already happened with the huge technological advances in the 1900s. I wonder if future historians would look on the period between 1900-2100 as a kind of "industrial revolution 2.0"? Probably not - there seems to be some natural divides with the advent of electricity and then also the advent of computers, so probably thinking too hard.
