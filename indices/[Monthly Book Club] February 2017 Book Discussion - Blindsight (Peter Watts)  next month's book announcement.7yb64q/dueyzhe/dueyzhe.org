  Maybe the Singularity happened years ago. We just don't want to admit we were left behind.

I think that Blindsight is a great example of a [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][weirdtopia]]--not a weird utopia, but a weird dystopia. The book doesn't dwell on this overly much, but it was interesting to read the book through the lens that we're sort of looking at the edges of something greater and that, for all that they think they're part of the bleeding-edge, our characters are sort of cast-offs, the bits and bobs that didn't get pulled along by the Singularity.

On a related note, do you think it's plausible for something that we would retroactively call “the Singularity” to occur without us realizing its significance as such till some time afterwards?
