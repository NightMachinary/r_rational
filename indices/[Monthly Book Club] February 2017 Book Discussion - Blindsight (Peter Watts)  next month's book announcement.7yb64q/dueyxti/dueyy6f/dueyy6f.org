I'm utterly entranced by these human-shaped nonhumans. I am /all about/ alien psychologies and this book is happy to supply, but I think that the most interesting of all is this being that appears human but is fundamentally, genetically, wired differently to us, rather than the rest of /Theseus/' crew, who were all modified.
