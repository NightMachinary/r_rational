I don't think I've enjoyed a story less while still ultimately being glad I read it. It's very bleak and despairing. I also found my suspension of disbelief constantly being broken while reading it. Even so, the ideas are very interesting and in the last third of the novel most of my complaints seemed to be addressed by the author... so I ended up liking it after all.

Also I feel like I should say the gambit pileup at the end was overwhelming, but it still served to explain some things, so that's alright I suppose.
