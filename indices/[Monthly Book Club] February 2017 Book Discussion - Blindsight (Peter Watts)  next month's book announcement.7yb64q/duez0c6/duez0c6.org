My favorite worldbuilding line that wasn't related to anything else in the story: “third-world medical missionary work [...] in Texas.”

Another thing that I love about Watts' work: the abbreviations (we've got “TwenCen” and “WestHem” here, and off the top of my head “innersys” for /inner system/ and “N'Am” for /North America/ in other books of his). It feels very Philip K. Dick somehow, even if the rest of Watts' work doesn't really match up.
