The biggie: did you enjoy this? I did, obviously, but I'm not the only reader.

There's another novel set in the same universe, during part of Blindsight (specifically, after "Theseus" and "Rorschach" but before Siri receives that message from his father in "Charybdis"). Would anyone be interested (or actively disinterested, for that matter) in reading that in a year or so? If you liked some aspects of Blindsight but thought that it was too slow or too light on the action, then you may like Echopraxia.
