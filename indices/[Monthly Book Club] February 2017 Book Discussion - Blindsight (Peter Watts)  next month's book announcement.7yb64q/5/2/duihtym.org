I did. The first paragraphs of description in the style I have now seen in Watts' other books clearly said "slow down or this could become word salad". World-specific contractions, staccato abstract and allusive descriptions, and lots of camera-eye views. So I kept track of everything as the perspective jumped around by reading a little slower.

Actually it was the "weird" characters not seeming weird that threatened my immersion the most. Watts had to provide scientific background for the readers, and he gave it through the characters; structurally I think he did it very well, but it means they often seem to be lacking high-school knowledge. So I was creating my own scenes to hide that a lot. And, they're not very rational. Their thoughts are guided towards the book's main ideas so that the readers can follow along, but too slowly for smart people in such a situation. Therefore ironically, my immersion hurt my immersion. I think this is the main reason I find Echopraxia much easier to reread.
