There's a subtext plot point in William Gibson's The Peripheral that touches on that. The book revolves around a piece of tech that was stolen from China, but is basically future tech to even the very advanced post-scarcity main characters. China basically turned into "unknowable intelligence", extremely advanced but insular. No one knows what's going on in China, and no one knows what will come out of China. I've made parallels of it before to something like Her, where the Singularity happens but the AIs just...leave us behind.

Blindsight also has a bit of this in another flavor, where there are the hyper advanced AIs that can solve physics but can't tell us /how/. Hyperion Cantos and I, Robot have the same problem, where there is the extemely advanced AI and you can't be sure what they're doing is what they say, because they're incomprehensible, and may be just stringing you along while they do their own thing.
