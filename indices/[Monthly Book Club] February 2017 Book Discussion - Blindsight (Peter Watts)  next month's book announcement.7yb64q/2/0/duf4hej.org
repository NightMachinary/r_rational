Blindsight focuses heavily on the idea of Transhumanism and the idea that humanity will eventually create their replacements. In that context, the characters who upload their consciousness to "Heaven" are perceived as copouts because they choose not to participate in that progress. It's definitely a very bleak view of that future, but something I could imagine happening in our own. I'm reminded of the [[http://dresdencodak.com/2008/06/07/eloi/][Hob storyline]] from Dresden Codak: /"I can give you anything you want, save relevance."/

In the story going to "Heaven" is indistinguishable from death because those who do so stop progressing as individuals. Siri's mother, and a different character seen in Peter Watts' /Echopraxia/, each wrap themselves in self-fulfilling fantasies where no real personal growth is possible.
