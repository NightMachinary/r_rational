Fun and depressing, though it's kind of hilarious how Canada (where Watts lives) is always doing much better than the US, even when Canada is /also/ an authoritarian nightmare.

It's weird, though, how it's so easy to feel like you've stepped into an entirely different country just by going to another state. The gulf between, say, California and Alabama ([[http://www.newsweek.com/alabama-poverty-infant-mortality-rate-745512][which has a higher child mortality rate than some developing countries]]) is incredible.
