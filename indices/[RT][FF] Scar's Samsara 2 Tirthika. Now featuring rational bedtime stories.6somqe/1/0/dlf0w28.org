I'm glad you like it. That was my answer to one of my long-time quibbles with the Lion King: why on earth does everyone act like it's Scar's fault that there's a drought? I was going to just treat it like one of those classical political scenario's, where a good leader has a crisis during his reign and everyone blames him for it.

But then I realized it really works as a way to keep the conflict going, when you rememeber that scene where Mufasa's face appears in a storm and he seems able to influence the weather. Also, the part where lightning suddenly strikes everywhere during the final fight. Seems like some divine interference was going on there...
