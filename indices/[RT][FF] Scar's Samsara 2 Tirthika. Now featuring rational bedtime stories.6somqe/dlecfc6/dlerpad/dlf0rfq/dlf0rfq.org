Haha, I know, he's just too nice to seem evil! But remember that even though he is telling bedtime stories to his favourite nephew in this chapter, the reason said nephew has nightmares is because Scar murdered his father one chapter ago.

One of the running ideas in my stories is that people are defined by their actions, not how they look or sound in front of others. So at the end of the last chapter I guess I saw Scar as kind of an anti-hero since he gave everyone immortality for free, but now I see him as kind of an anti-villain again since he took it all away just for a PR boost.

Also, I just wrote a chapter where Scar did something super evil/hilarious, so that might have primed me a bit.
