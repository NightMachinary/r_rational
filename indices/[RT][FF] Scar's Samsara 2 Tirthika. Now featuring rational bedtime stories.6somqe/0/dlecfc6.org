  *A/N*: As the first chapter turned out to be quite popular, I have decided to continue where we left off and make this a full story! You can expect about 6 emotional and fast-paced chapters in total, with a (hopefully) satisfying climax in the end.

  Tirthika is the Buddhist concept known as the 'Outer Path': Basically, it refers to someone trying to take the easy way out to escape the cycle of pain known as Samsara, and contrasts with the correct 'Inner Path'.

So, I'll be honest: My main reason for continuing this story is that writing it is just too much fun! Gosh, Scar is just so enjoyable to write as a character.

(The rational bedtime stories thing is a joke, but this chapter does in fact have a rational villain protagonist telling bedtime stories to a lion cub, and darn it I'm going to advertise the fact)
