Yeh, I was a bit leery about expanding the story since I didn't want to take away from the original OneShot, which I was quite pleased with. But I kinda figured that if I wanted to write more chapters anyway, I might as well just post them and let those who want to read them read them.

Of course, I'm still hoping that I'll manage to make the full story sufficiently awesome that it'll eclipse even the original. :)
