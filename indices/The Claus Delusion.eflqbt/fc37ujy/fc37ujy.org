So is it the parents or the children who are deluded? I think both readings can be supported, since the perspective is from that of the children. Maybe the whole story takes place in their overactive imaginings, playing secret agent? Otherwise, I'm not sure children /could/ coordinate to the extent seen here, if surrounding adults were convinced they're engaging in harmful delusion. And the majority, I'm sure, would just not care.

I'd also wonder if Santa alters external reality or just adult perception. Do adults find money missing in their accounts, or think they earned more than they did? Do stores believe they've sold additional products? What happens if they try to use that "extra" money for renovations? Do adults do /no/ Christmas shopping whatsoever? What if work or chores were done last Tuesday -- are they undone, or else how are they explained? Are all records falsified?

And to provide some meta-commentary :]

I'd say the potential for offense lies in how the story seems to have subsumed transgender experience into the service of some fictional cause, which seems a bit like trivializing trans-suffering due to gender dysphoria or transphobia. To invoke the usual example, it's as if a story where the victims of the holocaust colluded with Nazis to fuel a blood sacrifice that banished Cthulhu or something. It makes it less a tragedy and more a justifiable means to an end. You could also read some trans-erasure into this, if transgender individuals here are just "faking" it to experiment with puberty blockers or something.

It's odd that [[/u/aponty]] was downvoted for pointing out selection effects in the transgender population comprising your personal friends (as they might wish to not offend you with a public callout, of maybe you've intentionally befriend those harder to offend, or if you've driven off all the ones who'd be offended etc. etc.). As for the math problem, it sounds like P(offense|offensive) = 0.15 = P(offense|not_offensive), so it's unclear how any observation is meant to shift P(offensive|offense).

This seems like an interesting example to choose, because refusing to leave your (say, <5yo) children in a car even under ostensibly safe conditions seems like a pretty useful habit. I'm sure a pretty sizable fraction of negligent parents thought they'd be just stepping out for a second, their kids are fine, etc. etc. And in those years I'd expect harried parents to be much more prone to forgetfulness or distraction (due to e.g. sleep deprivation), and normalizing innocuous behaviors that may slide into more dangerous ones seems unwise. The analogy to standards of written etiquette seems straightforward, in the same way that prejudicial jokes normalize and destigmatize prejudice. Even if an author is not especially transphobic, their audience might be.

I definitely didn't get the "death metaphor", since not every time-pressure is symbolic. Even within the "rationalist" community it could mean, idk, the race to proper GAI specification or something. It could also be a metaphor for forgetting highschool math without practice, or for having children before infertility, or for winning the big sports competition before you graduate or overuse injuries accumulate, or for taking the roast out of the oven before it burns. In retrospect, I guess "I'm going to lose my entire mind, forget /everything/" read weird to me, because it seemed like they'd only forget their memories of Santa Claus. But I guess if these kids have devoted their entire lives to the pursuit, maybe everything is tinged green and red? (I'm definitely not a /rationalist/, but find the group amusing enough to have familiarized myself with their memes over the last ~10+ y)

It's also quite impressive the whole thing was conceived, written, and posted in 9 minutes flat. With 758 words, that's 84 wpm -- I can barely type that fast without mistakes!
