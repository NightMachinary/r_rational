  It's odd that [[/u/aponty]] was downvoted for pointing out selection effects in the transgender population comprising your personal friends (as they might wish to not offend you with a public callout, of maybe you've intentionally befriend those harder to offend, or if you've driven off all the ones who'd be offended etc. etc.). As for the math problem, it sounds like P(offense|offensive) = 0.15 = P(offense|not_offensive), so it's unclear how any observation is meant to shift P(offensive|offense).

More thoughts on the other stuff in a bit, but:

- both my objection and, I presume, the downvotes, were not for the statement itself but for its likely /intended effect,/ in context; it comes across as probably an attempt to criticize/insinuate/undermine without actually just coming out and fighting its own fight. "I summon the shadows of others" instead of "hey, I don't like this, please stop."
- I'm looking to shift the probability that the story is offensive from a prior of 50%, on observations of five people who were 15% likely to object, if it was indeed inoffensive. You could do the symmetrical problem of people who were 85% likely to object if it were offensive. Am I missing something? Does that not shift the posterior?
