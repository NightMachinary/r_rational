In the world of the story, Santa is real, but once you reach a certain age you're afflicted by the delusion that he isn't. Adult brains invent complex false memories to rationalize the delusion. The child protagonists (along with, presumably, a larger network of children) are trying to find a way to prevent the delusion. Their most recent experiment was seeing if trans kids on puberty blockers would be able to remember Santa after the cutoff age, but that failed.
