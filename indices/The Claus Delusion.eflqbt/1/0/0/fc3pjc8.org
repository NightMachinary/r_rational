eh, I get the "authors are not their characters, nor do they necessarily endorse their views" point, but authors still instantiate universes where certain premises hold, and do not do so from some background distribution of possible universes. Like, to use an example from the worm fandom, there's a popular and prolific author that apparently contrives scenarios with lots of child molestation (as I understand it, having never ventured to those parts of his work). One can claim that's just what happens in those stories, with no relation to the author's opinions... but their repeat occurrence is nevertheless telling. And I think it's especially hard to make nuanced points in short-form work.

  I didn't spell that out, just as I didn't spell out that it's about Santa, just as I didn't spell out that it's about death, but I'm willing to bet that a good chunk of the people who didn't get mad at me implicitly understood it.

  I strongly disagree that an interpretation like "the transgender individuals are just 'faking it' to run the larger psychological experiment" is justified by the text, though.

I think it's one of several interpretations, and not an especially charitable one, either. But where the facebook audience and here differ is that they know you and we don't (though, incidentally, we have a fairly large number of mutuals lol). They might see your story and use outside information (TK17 is not transphobic, TK17's really into gerontology, etc.) to arrive more easily at your intended interpretation where a more generic audience would not.
