does "all for nothing" not imply that there are no other benefits to puberty blockers besides the scheme to catch Santa Claus? No gender dysphoria relieved, no undesirable body parts failing to develop, etc.? They failed to delay the amnestic effects, but presumably experienced some benefits beyond mere /nothing/? This early in the story it's unclear if that passage is from an omniscient narrator's perspective or from the boy's. That's not how it reads to me, but I can see it reading that way to others.

And I guess my earlier point could use the addendum that you should keep in mind not just plausible interpretations of your work, but guard against plausible misinterpretations, as well, especially when some might have high prior expectation of unsavory thought ¯\/(ツ)//¯
