I stand by all of my arguments. (At least, all of the ones I've /actually made,/ as opposed to the ones people are rounding me off to or projecting onto my words or whatever.)

At no point did I claim or imply that the agreement of some trans folk would mean the agreement of all trans folk, or gave me license to speak on behalf of all of them; literally in the same comment you're referencing I talked about the possibility that others might disagree.

(It's also worth noting that you have no evidence whether I'm a part of that group or not, except the very weak evidence of my lack of stating membership within it explicitly. I say this not as a cheap distraction, but as a deadly serious point---/you actually don't know./ You're running a policy which can /easily/ have the effect of you hurting members of the exact group you're interested in defending, via oversensitive zeal.)

As for pattern matching, [[https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/its-not-what-it-looks-like-cde2c6104455][I'll just keep linking this over and over I guess.]]
