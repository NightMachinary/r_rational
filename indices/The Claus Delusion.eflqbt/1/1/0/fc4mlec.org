I was just trying to be concise. My objection has been to your arguments, not to their conclusion. I was typing on my phone, else I would have said more, however, I suspect I would have been downvoted no matter how much more I said.

If you're just going to pull numbers out of nowhere, your statistics calculations are dubious at best, and I feel the point I made was the most salient one.

The first thing that rubbed me wrong was actually when you said "I have a lot of trans friends", which is valid I guess, but just pattern-matching to history it feels way too similar to when racists are like "my black friend doesn't think X" and thereby commandeer the conversation for an entire marginalized group that they're not a part of.
