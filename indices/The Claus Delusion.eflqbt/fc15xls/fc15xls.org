The entire story, for people who don't want to click through to Facebook:

The boy sighed, closing the laptop gently, too disappointed to even slam it shut. "So that's it, then," he said quietly.

The girl shrugged. "I mean, there's still replication. Something might've gone wrong; we're going to be thorough."

The boy shot her a look, and she gave her own sigh. "Yeah, that's it."

The boy slumped, resting his head in his hands. The puberty blocker had been their most ambitious plan yet, their most promising hope---begun years earlier, long before he'd joined the Project. It had taken generations to shift the public narrative to a place where the adults would even /consider/ it, not to mention the valiant efforts of the trans children themselves, breaking ground, acting as lightning rods, airing their private suffering in public where millions of people would mock and scorn them. What they'd gone through, what their parents had gone through, and in the end, all for nothing...

"He really forgot?" the boy asked, knowing as he did so that he was pushing it, himself, coming right up to the edge of what was allowed. Beliefs were for true things, not for comfort or shelter.

Her face twisted in pity, but she said nothing of it. "He thinks they went Christmas shopping at the mall last Tuesday," she said. "The details start on page six, I think. The delusion is insanely complex. If I hadn't been watching him myself..."

She trailed off. "I know you two were close," she began.

"Don't," he said. "Just---don't."

She nodded, her lips a grim line.

For a moment, there was silence.

James, the boy thought. James, how could you?

And then---as always---the wash of shame, of self-recrimination, because of course it wasn't James's fault. It wasn't /anybody's/ fault, as near as they could tell. It had happened to Ellen, and to Alex before that, and to Cameron and Jordan and Finley and Riley---to dozens of others, hundreds of others, in the history of the Project---it happened to /everyone,/ eventually---

Two years, the boy thought. Two more years, and it will happen to me.

"We're not crazy, right?" he asked.

Her head tilted, her eyes sympathetic. "We've got the footage," she said. "James didn't go anywhere Tuesday. His /parents/ didn't go anywhere Tuesday. The closets were empty, no sign of wrapping paper anywhere in the house, nothing under the tree."

"But they're all so /sure,/" the boy whispered. "Even when we play the tapes back for them---"

"They're sure," she agreed. "But we've got the /evidence./ The footage, the scales in the floorboards, the detectors in the chimneys---"

"I just wish he'd tell us /why./ I wish he'd /explain./ It'd be easier, if I---if we---if we understood---"

"Did you talk to him?"

"Yeah. I snuck out. Waited for him at the fireplace."

"You know it's not good to talk to him."

The boy snapped. "I don't CARE, okay? I don't CARE what's good for me, what's bad for me---what does it MATTER when I've got two years left, two years if I'm /lucky/---who /cares/ about the recommendations when I'm going to lose my entire mind, forget /everything/---"

"There's still hope."

"What hope? Where? What are we going to try /now,/ Susan? If even puberty blockers don't have any effect---"

"Calm down, okay? I get it. I understand. But the rest of them---look, they don't need to hear you melting down, okay? The news is bad enough as it is."

The boy sagged like a puppet with cut strings. "'For the future,'" he muttered.

"'For the future,'" she echoed. "'For those who come after.' Maybe we're screwed, maybe it's hopeless, maybe we're not going to get there in time. But we're making progress, okay? And someday---"

"Someday," he agreed.

"Anyway, my parents are throwing a New Year's party, and Quinn and Morgan were going to come over early, fly the new drones around the backyard. You want to come?"

The boy's lip twisted.

"They're really cool," she pressed.

"I know," he sighed. "I just---it gets harder every year, you know? To play along. Mom thinks she put off getting the new washing machine to buy mine---"

"Yeah," she said. "But if we don't enjoy them now, then what even was the point?"

The boy sighed again. "Yeah. Okay. I'll be there."

"Take a break, okay?" she said. "Just a few days. We'll start fresh in the new year."

The boy said nothing.

"We're worried about you."

"Don't worry about me," he said. "I'm on the good list, remember?"
