I just want to toss in that I'm not sure what you want here.

Should we never speak of non-cis people unless we have the space to spend hundreds of words assuring the audience that we mean no harm? I don't think we want that, as it both sets apart people who just want to live their lives on their own terms, and cuts them out of a not insignificant fraction of media entirely. If we want trans people to feel welcome in society, we have to be willing to talk about them like we would any other minority rather than shutting them out unless we're writing a novella.

Should we only ever talk about trans folks in media specifically about them and their issues? This also has the effect of segregating media, this time into pro-trans and trans-neutral, which we also don't want. Trans folks exist in the real world, which is a complicated, messy place, and their issues are tied up with a variety of others in ways which will cause them to come up unexpectedly. For instance, we know puberty blockers are safe only because they were developed to delay precocious puberty in cis girls. Surgical techniques for GCS have been developed for and used in more standard reconstructive surgeries, and vice versa. We can't talk about a lot of real-world issues in a complete and accurate way without bringing trans people in, because they're just as wound up in the rest of the world's issues as everyone else.

Do you want to avoid offending people at all costs? That is both impossible and counterproductive. Someone will always be offended by something because everyone is different. Further, there are people on all sides of every issue who are hypersensitive to offense, and others who are not. I know of a lot of trans, gay, etc folks who use slurs referring to themselves in humorous situations, and I would absolutely be among them if I were in their communities. I also know of a lot of people in marginalized communities who are deeply offended or even measurably hurt by such talk, and the thing is /both groups are right to act as they do./ People who are legitimately hurt by being reminded of the hatred of others and people who attempt to reclaim that hatred through humor are both people, who deserve to have their rights protected and boundaries respected.

If you want to avoid hurting people, I can understand that, but I am unsure how this would hurt anyone. Pointing out that trans children suffer isn't an assault on their rights, it's a fact we ought to mitigate. A fact which, in the world of the story, appears to no longer be true, as enough puberty blockers exist and they are given out freely enough for a conspiracy composed of children to get them for reasons unrelated to being trans. If anything, the world presented in the story is a significantly better one for trans kids than our own.

What do you want? Your complaint doesn't fit into any model I have. Which one are you using?
