Yeah, sorry if I sound defensive---I /am/ feeling defensive, a little, and your clarification helps, and I agree that if someone read that tone into what I wrote, it would make sense for them to feel grumpy about it.

I do like to think that, at least on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], people will respond to /what you actually said,/ and not to random projections or whatever, and it's ... not great, when that proves false.

The hypothetical person you're positing who encounters the words

#+begin_quote
  Which I'm hoping everyone will see is the actual theme of the story. Like, I made the veil as thin as I could.
#+end_quote

and /hears/

#+begin_quote
  "What, you didn't pick up that X was a metaphor for Y? I made it /so obvious/..."
#+end_quote

has a problem that's not anyone else's fault. Like, it's not someone else's fault if they accidentally trigger that neurosis, and it's not anyone else's responsibility to unruffle that person's feathers.
