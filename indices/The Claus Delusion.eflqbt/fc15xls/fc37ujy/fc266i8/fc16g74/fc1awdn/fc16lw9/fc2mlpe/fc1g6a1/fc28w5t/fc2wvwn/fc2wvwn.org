  I'm sadly used to out-of-context references to trans people online being pretty negative, so I felt pretty pessimistic about an ambiguous out-of-context reference.

This makes perfect sense to me, and I appreciate you giving me a better model, here.

FWIW, I /do/ think the /character/ was being pretty selfish/insensitive in the moment, and it's sometimes hard to strike the right balance of signaling "what this character thinks isn't the actual truth, or what the author thinks."

Thank you for the comment.
