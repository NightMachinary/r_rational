(I note that CouteauBleu withdrew the objection and stated it was just a knee-jerk thought, and that the original comment had positive intent. For further context, CouteauBleu provides me with lots of critique, at my personal request, which may have made him feel freer to make an offhand critical comment; that's a relationship others on the sub might not know we have. I think these are still *excellent* questions to ask, but I think that it's better to see this comment as asking them of *all* of us, rather than of CouteauBleu in particular. It seems reasonable for people to feel gun-shy around charged topics /in general,/ even if they don't have a specific model of what they want as an alternative, and even if that's a little sad.)
