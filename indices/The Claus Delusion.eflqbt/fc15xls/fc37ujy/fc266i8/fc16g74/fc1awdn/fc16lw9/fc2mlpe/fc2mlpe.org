For what it's worth I am trans and the moment you mentioned trans people together with a delusion I was set on edge and sure the piece was going to be a rational flavoured version of "there's just no evidence to support our existence as anything but a delusion"

I'm glad it wasn't in the end though but was pretty worried at the start! Confused me even more when we weren't involved later so I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop.

If others have had a similar issue perhaps there is a way to cut that part of the story thread and make it clearly distinct from the rest? I'm not a very good writer so I'm not sure if that's even possible.

It's also possible I'm weighting it too heavily on the trans stuff since I am trans and I read some pretty fucked up shit online so am always on guard.
