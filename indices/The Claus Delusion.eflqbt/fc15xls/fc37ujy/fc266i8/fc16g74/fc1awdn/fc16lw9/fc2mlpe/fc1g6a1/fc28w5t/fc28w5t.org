The line saying "[it] was all for nothing" after the line about trans kids having puberty blockers made me think it was saying that the puberty blockers were good for nothing, as in weren't good for anyone including trans kids. I had to re-read it to be kinda sure that was probably not what it meant (it doesn't help that the answer to "what was for nothing?" isn't explained yet at this point in the story; not that it needs to be, but maybe the wording could be tightened up to make it more obvious that it's this unexplained effort that was for nothing, not puberty blockers in general), and I immediately went to the comments here to see if there was a discussion about it just to be sure. I'm sadly used to out-of-context references to trans people online being pretty negative, so I felt pretty pessimistic about an ambiguous out-of-context reference.
