Interesting. When you say "in that subculture," do you mean something like "working in an org focused on this stuff day to day" or more like "yeah, I've read LW and HPMOR"? Asking for calibration purposes, because a bunch of the people I work with got it /immediately./ But that's, like, because the characters ARE them, maybe?

Edit: Also, I personally prefer assertions like "It seems to me that you're typical minding pretty hard" (because they're unambiguously true) over assertions like "You're typical minding pretty hard" (because you don't actually know and are guessing, possibly via typical minding yourself). =P
