  Should we never speak of non-cis people unless we have the space to spend hundreds of words assuring the audience that we mean no harm? I don't think we want that, as it both sets apart people who just want to live their lives on their own terms, and cuts them out of a not insignificant fraction of media entirely. If we want trans people to feel welcome in society, we have to be willing to talk about them like we would any other minority rather than shutting them out unless we're writing a novella.

Okay, so I clearly gave this way less thought than you did, but I don't think that's fair.

I'm not saying "talking about trans kids is bad" or "having a trans character is bad". I'm commenting about the use of puberty blockers as a part of the story's "magic system"; which is a lot more involved and touches on a delicate topic much more directly than just having trans characters.
