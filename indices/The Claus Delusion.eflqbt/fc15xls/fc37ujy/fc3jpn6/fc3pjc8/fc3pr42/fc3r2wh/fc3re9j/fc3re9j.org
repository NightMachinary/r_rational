They wouldn't have "private suffering" if they were just faking; they wouldn't be referred to as valiant trans kids if they were just pretending to be trans.

I think if you polled 100 readers on whether that paragraph was meant to represent the absolute truth as perceived by an omniscient narrator, versus a third-person perspective of the boy's personal thoughts and beliefs, a supermajority would say the latter. I'd be willing to bet small amounts of money on that, if you want to run the experiment.

It's true that the boy is thinking (selfishly, narrow-mindedly) that the fight over puberty blockers was "for nothing" in a way that dismisses the actual progress made for actual trans kids, and that this shows he's not a very empathetic character. But /even if you pretend that it's an omniscient narrator stating that increased access to puberty blockers did nothing for anybody,/ that /still/ in no way implies that the trans kids are "faking it."

Like, we could turn each line of the text into a set of concrete, symbolic logic assertions, and I claim you would not be able to derive "the trans kids are faking it" from any combination of what's present in the story.
