Well I guess at this point I just have to accept your refusal to have any kind of self awareness, now don't I?

You're also massively overblowing the degree to which I'm directing negativity towards you.

To be very clear I liked your story and at most I would very slightly reframe the line in question here -- I'd like it to maybe have more of a collaborative feel to it, rather than these fictional characters claiming full credit for a major piece of activism, though I would accept it as-is as just the main character being a bit emotional about the piece of it that was most important to them; narrators don't have to be totally reliable about why or how people worked together.
