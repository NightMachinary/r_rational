  This seems like an interesting example to choose, because refusing to leave your (say, <5yo) children in a car even under ostensibly safe conditions seems like a pretty useful habit. I'm sure a pretty sizable fraction of negligent parents thought they'd be just stepping out for a second, their kids are fine, etc. etc. And in those years I'd expect harried parents to be much more prone to forgetfulness or distraction (due to e.g. sleep deprivation), and normalizing innocuous behaviors that may slide into more dangerous ones seems unwise. The analogy to standards of written etiquette seems straightforward, in the same way that prejudicial jokes normalize and destigmatize prejudice. Even if an author is not especially transphobic, their audience might be.

  So is it the parents or the children who are deluded? ... I'd also wonder if Santa alters external reality or just adult perception.

This is what makes it a horror story, imo.

  I'd say the potential for offense lies in how the story seems to have subsumed transgender experience into the service of some fictional cause, which seems a bit like trivializing trans-suffering due to gender dysphoria or transphobia. To invoke the usual example, it's as if a story where the victims of the holocaust colluded with Nazis to fuel a blood sacrifice that banished Cthulhu or something. It makes it less a tragedy and more a justifiable means to an end. You could also read some trans-erasure into this, if transgender individuals here are just "faking" it to experiment with puberty blockers or something.

You always gotta expect that some percentage of readers will forget that authors are not their characters, or that stories don't necessarily endorse the viewpoints of their characters (they may, for instance, be presenting those viewpoints specifically to highlight them for disagreement, as in many many films starring Nazis). imo, the viewpoint boy character /is/ subsuming transgender experience into what he thinks is a larger/more pressing cause, and this is a point against him, as a person---when he thinks "all for nothing," he's doing so from a very selfish perspective where all that matters is the fight /he/ thinks is important, and ignoring the fact that part of /why/ those kids would have agreed to sign on to the Project was a /mutually/ beneficial trade---greater support for a thing they urgently need, in exchange for helping possibly solve the Santa problem, too.

I didn't spell that out, just as I didn't spell out that it's about Santa, just as I didn't spell out that it's about death, but I'm willing to bet that a good chunk of the people who /didn't/ get mad at me implicitly understood it.

I strongly disagree that an interpretation like "the transgender individuals are just 'faking it' to run the larger psychological experiment" is justified by the text, though.
