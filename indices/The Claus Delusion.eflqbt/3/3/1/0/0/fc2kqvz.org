It's worth noting that puberty blockers have been used to treat precocious puberty in cisgender children for decades. Indeed, most transition-related medications were used for cisgender patients long before their use in transitioning (e.g. treating endocrine disorders or hormone-responsive cancers, ameliorating menopause symptoms, facilitating puberty).

That fact takes a lot of wind out of the sails of people who oppose the use of these medications. They are far from untested; trans people are usually the last to benefit from their use. People may still oppose them on the grounds of potential desistance or detransition (the incidence of which is greatly overblown), but most of the scaremongering is simply baseless.

As it relates to the story, the only issue is the implication that those seeking increased availability of puberty blockers had an ulterior motive. Given the setting it makes sense that they'd try anything, but I can see how people might dislike that implication.

Personally I thought this part of the story was well-handled, and its inclusion makes a lot of sense (narrative-wise, the pre-teens would have had to have tried /something/ like that). I'm usually wary of potential "hot takes" any time trans people (especially trans children) are mentioned, but this was good.
