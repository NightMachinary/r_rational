Look, /I don't care/ about vague suppositions of hypothetical people who /might/ be offended (by a positive reference to a group they're a part of, no less). I've written tens of thousands of words on this subject; another post beside the one linked above is [[https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/in-defense-of-punch-bug-68fcec56cd6b#a548][here]].

I think that these vague miasmatic "eh i dunno people might whatever" kinds of comments are /actively antisocial,/ in that they drive dynamics like e.g. mothers being unable to leave their kids in their cars for two minutes in completely safe environments, by fostering a general culture of fear and paralysis. Not to mention the entirely separate (but equally toxic) dynamic of dumping disproportionate frustration and corrective energy on one's imperfect allies rather than on one's actual opponents; if you're trying to do something about the plight of trans people, this reddit thread is not an effective place to spend your resources.

If /you/ have a problem, say so. If someone you know has a problem and can't or won't speak up for themselves, advocate on their behalf, directly.

But if you want people to preemptively bend over backwards based on the possibility that anybody in the general population might predict that maybe some /other/ person out there might experience some negative feeling upon encountering a thing that they wrote ...

Nope.
