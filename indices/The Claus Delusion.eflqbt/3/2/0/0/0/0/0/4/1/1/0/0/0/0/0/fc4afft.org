I think I endorse this as some combination of better strategy/correction to what I actually meant. In particular:

#+begin_quote
  When things come across as you saying "I made it so obvious", what I don't do is assume that my intuition is correct. I give you an inch less benefit of the doubt - which I return to you intact when you explicitly say that's not in fact what you meant.
#+end_quote

... seems to be something like the most anyone ought to ask of people.

In my culture, general readership /isn't/ a euphemism for dumb people, nor at risk of being understood as such, so that's useful data too.
