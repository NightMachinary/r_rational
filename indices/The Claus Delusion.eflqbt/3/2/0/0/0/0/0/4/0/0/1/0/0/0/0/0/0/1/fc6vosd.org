Anonymity is, in fact, good, and indeed vital to the pursuit of rationality. And resorting to doxing demonstrates you are /far worse than a coward/; you are someone who chooses to bludgeon anyone who insults you on the internet with the largest stick you can find.

Incidentally, I did have a high opinion of you, years ago. Then you lost it, largely through being a manipulative asshole and enabler of manipulative assholes. Like you are doing right now.
