Does it?

Puberty blockers are an important topic in trans circles, but they're only useful if a kid realizes what's wrong early enough. The majority of transitioned people alive today were never on them. It's definitely arguable that this is due to transphobia and trans-ignorance on the part of society, parents, physicians, and until recently just about everyone, but we're trying to fix that now. Condemning ourselves for honest mistakes made in the past (as I do believe a lot of this was, given that being trans is inherently unintuitive to cis people who have never once questioned their AGAB) will only prevent us from moving forward.

Should more people be on them? Almost certainly. But puberty blockers are some of the more invasive medications intended to be given to children. They deliberately disrupt normal development rather than try to maintain it. It is morally and ethically correct to do that for someone who will otherwise wind up trapped in a body which does not match their self-image, but people's concerns about such treatment are not totally unfounded. When you consider how little the average person actually knows about trans people and what they go through, it becomes even more understandable why such resistance exists.

This ignorance is a big part of why I think the mention here is a good thing: people just don't know about puberty blockers! They don't know the difference between puberty blockers and HRT. A lot of seemingly transphobic people just have the incorrect belief that doctors are giving twelve year olds estrogen. If more people understood that the medications given to trans children and those given to trans teenagers are entirely different things with completely unrelated effects, it would be harder for the real bigots out there to influence the concerned citizens who genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We're still very much in the education phase here, so pointing out that these medications exist by using them in a magic system is only a good thing. People just genuinely don't know.
