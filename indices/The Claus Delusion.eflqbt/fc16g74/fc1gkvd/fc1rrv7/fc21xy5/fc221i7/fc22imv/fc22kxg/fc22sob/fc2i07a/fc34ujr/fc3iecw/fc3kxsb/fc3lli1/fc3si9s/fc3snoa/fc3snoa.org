Okay, this seems to be a claim that we know each other in real life, or are at least living in the same city, so I'd like to know who you are in meatspace so I can avoid you forever, and warn other good people about you.

(I note that even if we're in the same city, the claim to have met "most of the same ones as me" is another wildly overconfident projection; VorpalAuroch has no idea which specific people I was referring to or whether they also live in that city.)
