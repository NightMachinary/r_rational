Less of this, please. Whatever your personal feelings about the OP or his style of communication, there are better ways to conduct conversation with him, or with others in this thread, if that's what you want to do. My best guess based on your other comments is that you're bringing in ideas and opinions that are outside the context of this thread, which is probably where a lot of that emotional loading should stay.
