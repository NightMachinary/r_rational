EDIT: The below objection is still true, but an even more central and crucial one is "*you just did, last night,* but you jumped to conclusions and wrote me off, so that raises my confidence that you've met some /before,/ too, and just didn't notice it because you were too busy being exactly what you were ostensibly criticizing."

I have met literally dozens. Your assertion that [someone who does this without being an asshole] is a *black swan* is absurdly overconfident.

Note that I went out of my way in /my/ comment to validate that your local experiences might justify you having this as your local prior (separate from whether that's a reasonable prediction out in the broader world). You (in line with your other commentary and what, I'm gathering, is your general online persona) did not do the same.
