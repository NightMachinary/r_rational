I'll leave it up to the judgment of the crowd which of us is being an asshole in this exchange, if either. I notice that you were kicked (or at least had your comment deleted) from a different sub just a couple days ago for calling someone /else/ an asshole when they weren't being one, which reminds me of that thing about how "if you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole."
