For calibration purposes, I'm in the "yeah, I've read LW and HPMOR" crowd, and I got it pretty much immediately. The quoted line makes it almost painfully obvious.

This is a story that's been posted to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. /Obviously/ that's what it's about. It's practically a meme, and it's even in HPMOR in chapter 76 with the Rianne Felthorne character thinking about Obliviation being like death, y'know, "when she looked ahead in the future, there was nobody to complete the thoughts she wasn't finished thinking" and whatnot.
