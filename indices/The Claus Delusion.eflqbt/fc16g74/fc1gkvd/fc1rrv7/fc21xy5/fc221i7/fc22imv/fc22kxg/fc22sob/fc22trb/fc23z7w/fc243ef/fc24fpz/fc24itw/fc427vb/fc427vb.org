  Okay, fair, it's a thick veil for general readership.

FYI, this bit /also/ came across as saying "I made it /so obvious/". 'General readership' sounds like a euphemism for 'dumb people'.

  I do like to think that, at least on [[/r/rational][r/rational]], people will respond to /what you actually said/, and not to random projections or whatever, and it's ... not great, when that proves false.
#+end_quote

It seems un-Bayesian to respond to /what you actually said/ rather than to pick up on sub-textual cues as to your emotional state and intentions. My intuition has had a long time to train on this (by talking to people every day) and I use it a lot in order to navigate conversations, by making predictions about what filters other people are passing their thoughts through before they release them into the world as sentences, so I can try to model them better.

When things come across as you saying "I made it /so obvious/", what I don't do is assume that my intuition is correct. I give you an inch less benefit of the doubt - which I return to you intact when you explicitly say that's not in fact what you meant.
