Actually, this is now a fun math problem that I don't immediately know how to solve.

Let's say that a story that's insensitive or offensive to trans folk will get a positive reaction from 15% of them, just based off rates of contrarianism and countersignalling and different tastes and so forth.

(Gross oversimplification; trans folk are a hugely diverse group, but idk how to do an estimate WITHOUT gross oversimplification. #fermi)

Assume also that a story that's NOT insensitive or offensive has a 15% chance of evoking a negative reaction, for symmetrical reasons. Let's further imagine that a story written by someone who knows trans people, with the intent of not being offensive, has a coin flip over whether they'll succeed (50% chance).

Given that rough prior, how do we update on +four+ +edit: five+ edit: six instances of like/thumbs-up/expressed approval? (with no concrete disapproval that I've yet seen)

I'm walking down a highway, so I don't have the paper I need, but this seems like a neat Bayes 101 question.
