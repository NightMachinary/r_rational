I have zero interest in your opinions on what etiquette is, at this point.

You have, in separate threads, strongly implied "people shouldn't touch these issues if they're not part of the group" and also "hey, back off, people might be part of the group but not wanting to be out about it." If you don't see the contradiction there, then I refer you to phylogenik's excellent comments on gatekeeping and so forth elsewhere in this post.
