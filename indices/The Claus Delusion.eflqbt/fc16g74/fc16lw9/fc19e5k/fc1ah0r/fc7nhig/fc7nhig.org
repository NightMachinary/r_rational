  Are you a trans person
#+end_quote

Final note from me, it's really bad etiquette to ask this question in this context and I've seen it go a long way to making hostile environments worse.

It's frankly none of your business whether someone is trans or why they seem to take trans issues seriously or personally. Not everyone wants to out themselves, even (or sometimes especially) psuedoanonymously on the internet .
