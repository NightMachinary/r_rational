Typo has been fixed. In other news, I'm changing the site theme because the "previous chapter" and "next chapter" buttons are below the comments and I can't fix this.

[[http://imgur.com/a/Bz5E1][Here are the four themes that I'm considering.]] Please let me know which ones you like. If you dislike all of them and want me to keep looking, then let me know that, too!

(I'm partial to "Hero" myself)

Also, I accidentally broke the sidebar, but I'm going to wait to fix it until the new theme is up.
