Look at it this way: even if you really actually do suck at writing characters, Isaac Asimov had terrible, wooden characters and he's considered one of the sci-fi greats of all time.

I think you're doubtless being far too tough on yourself. When you write, do your characters ever surprise you? To me that's the best mark of a "real" character, when they act in ways you didn't anticipate.
