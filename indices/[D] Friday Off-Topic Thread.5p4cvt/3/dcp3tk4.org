I write, in fits and starts, a book. I have a tendency to get stuck rewriting the same scenes over and over. I make progress mostly when I force myself to continue forwards before I'm quite satisfied with what I've got. I don't know how good the end product will be. It /should/ be good. Certainly my friends tell me they like the world building and the magic system and the excessively long world history. But there's a nagging sense that maybe I'm just not good at writing characters. My writing style is different from the authors that I like reading, and I worry that my point of view characters will come across as unfeeling, or that to avoid that I will be too blunt in just having them think their feelings too explicitly. I find it difficult to have them think about information as they get it, so they end up doing the bulk of their introspection and analysis and planning when they are alone and nothing else is happening.

I don't know what to do about this. I pivot between an unhealthy sense of being the best writer ever and wondering if I'm a little bit retarded.
