I don't think that's necessarily a good thing after reading this analysis of Peter Thiel based on his own words.

  Thiel is quite a different figure from Bannon, but his ambivalence about democracy is even more explicit, shading over into outright contempt. A Silicon Valley libertarian who got rich by developing PayPal, Thiel historically likes his capitalism undiluted by sentimentality. He shares Bannon's disdain for complacent elites and their crony capitalism, and has been an attention-getting provocateur against establishment institutions such as his alma mater, Stanford University. (He has famously offered grants to talented students who forgo college.) He is interested in technology that overcomes familiar human limitations, including space colonization and medical research into immortality. This kind of technological utopianism has a long pedigree in Silicon Valley, and was already well established in the 1990s, when it got friendly treatment from buzzy venues like Wired.

  Thiel's recasting himself as Tech Trump was perhaps most striking because, just a few years ago, he had written off politics altogether. “I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible,” Thiel wrote in a 2009 Cato Institute essay. Instead, “the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms.” He proposed redirecting energy to private enterprises that could end-run both the right's “totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes” and the left's “unthinking demos that guides so-called ‘social democracy.'” He proposed cyberspace, outer space and the high seas as refuges for anti-political libertarians. In a follow-up essay, Thiel explained, “I believe that politics is way too intense. That's why I'm a libertarian. Politics gets people angry, destroys relationships and polarizes peoples' vision: the world is us versus them; good people versus the other. Politics is about interfering with other people's lives without their consent. That's probably why, in the past, libertarians have made little progress in the political sphere. Thus, I advocate focusing energy elsewhere, onto peaceful projects that some consider utopian.”

  Whatever Thiel's motive, there is no sign that it is a new enthusiasm for democracy. Thiel wrote in his 2009 essay that “the broader education of the body politic has become a fool's errand.” There is no evidence that he has changed his mind about that. Trump's campaign, as noted, confirms Thiel's dire 2009 description of politics as an us-versus-them, anger-stoking festival of irrationality. But rather than renounce politics, Trump is pushing it in a direction that Thiel seems to tolerate, even embrace: If you can't escape the democratic herd, then maybe you can manage it on its own irrational terms. If politics is essentially demagoguery, then what a libertarian needs is a skillful and congenial demagogue.

Here's the same article's take on Steve Bannon:

#+begin_quote
  To understand Bannon's outlook, the best source we have is a remote address he gave in 2014 to a conference of the Human Dignity Institute, a conservative political group with right-wing Catholic ties, which was being held at the Vatican. In the talk, recently published by BuzzFeed, Bannon laid out a strikingly coherent picture of his worldview, which has a few fundamental elements.

  First, the United States and Europe are at the beginning of “a very brutal and bloody conflict” against “a new barbarity that's starting, which will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years,” unless “we” defeat it. This is “jihadist Islamic fascism.” The “river of blood” that the Islamic State promises “is going to come to Western Europe, it's going to come to the United Kingdom.” (Bannon seems to be just the leading edge of this clash-of-civilizations theme in the Trump administration. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has called radical Islam an “existential threat” and suggested that Islam itself is “a cancer” of an ideology rather than a genuine religion.)

  Second, what “we” must defend against Islamic fascism is a very specific version of Western civilization. The lesson of World War II and the struggle against totalitarianism, Bannon explains, is that the great and singular achievement of the West is “an enlightened form of capitalism.” It is, he says, a specifically “Christian” or “Judeo-Christian” version of capitalism that produces wealth for the good of the community, in which “divine providence” empowers its favored people “to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth.” The thing to notice is what is left out. In a description of a coming battle for Western civilization and of the lessons of the 20th-century struggle against totalitarianism, Bannon does not mention democracy. He doesn't mention constitutionalism. Capitalism is the thing at stake in a global clash of civilizations, the most precious part of a legacy of freedom.

  What does it mean that Bannon doesn't talk about democracy or constitutionalism? Maybe he just forgot. But it seems more likely that his nationalist capitalism is an alternative theory of political legitimacy, and one whose emergence doesn't necessarily depend on the machinery of democracy. The role of politics in Bannon's view seems to be not to choose the direction of national and global economics, but to move them toward a destination already in Bannon's mind. When Bannon famously called himself a “Leninist,” he might have had this idea in mind: that the role of political action is to seize the state and move ruthlessly toward a predetermined goal, marshaling whatever forces will help you get there. Bannon gives no hint that the populist wave is a call for deepened democracy, which would mean, for instance, expanding political participation for working people and the marginalized (rather than embracing an anti-union agenda and vote-suppression laws) and reducing the political influence of the superwealthy class that produced Trump and is now beginning to fill his Cabinet and the ranks of his advisers.
