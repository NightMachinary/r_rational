That description of Thiel doesn't read too bad to me? It seems to acknowledge that democracy is a tool that's possibly necessary, but not nearly sufficient, to gain good governance. That in addition to the elections, which prevent some failure modes of governance, you still need someone to get involved to push the governing people into the right direction, and that Thiel seems to see himself as that person.
