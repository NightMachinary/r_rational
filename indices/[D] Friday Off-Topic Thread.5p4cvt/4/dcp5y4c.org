I'm looking for more inspirational short videos about space travel (whether past/current/planned future missions or more hopeful ideas of what we might one day achieve). An example would be [[https://vimeo.com/108650530][Wanderers]]. It doesn't need to be the exact same format, but some combination of inspirational music/voiceover and nice pictures or video of space stuff would be good.
