Another way to earn resentment is to phrase your messages in such a way that from someone else's perspective can easily be misinterpreted as

#+begin_quote
  laying it a bit thick with humblebragging while simultaneously insulting people that you're sharing a community with.
#+end_quote

I don't remember if it was you or m.b. someone else, who in a similar thread once shared a facebook picture, with the context of how their fellow students (I think?) made a problem out of not-wanting-to-party-with-them, but this is almost the same type of communication problem (I'll try to post the comment I've mentioned here, if I find it).

#+begin_quote
  Any idiot could do it.

  took /me/ 30 seconds and would have taken /you/ 3 minutes

  I can't believe you people.
#+end_quote

I agree with your general message itself, regarding an individual's overhyped prestige in a peer group. However, the manner in which you've tried to decline such “prestige-shower” was extremely and unnecessarily rude.
