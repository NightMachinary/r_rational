I actually made it 1.6 years without clicking those buttons.

How?

I don't speak much.

I was making a complaint about a specific markdown rule, not "HOW DO I FORMAT I'M NOT GOOD AT COMPUTERS".

Turns out that rule a trade-off to deal with editors that don't have softwrapping.

So Toka, I'd like to thank you for leading me to research this, and hereby assign you *100 Prestige*.
