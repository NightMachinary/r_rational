Yeah, that was the Hindenberg of PR attempts.

If you were actually concerned with being over-hyped (I do have that fear myself) an "Awww shucks" would have been far more effective than "Fuck you for over-hyping me (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"

Nobody would have come at you with pitchforks or sworn vengeance upon you for accepting that praise.

Out of interest, what were you aiming for by sharing this?

1. Are we meant to agree: "Yeah, fuck that guy for over-hyping you"?
2. Is it a smug: "Normals, amirite?"?
3. Are you exasperated that people can't solve their own problems?
4. Did you think that you had done a funny smack-down?
5. Is this some form of signalling?
6. Do you want a hug?
7. Why is reddit's formatting so terrible? I have to press enter twice in order to get a new line. Jesus Christ.
