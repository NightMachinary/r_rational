First off, because you appear to have a history of depression or something like it, just from my previous interactions with you. Remember that bit of HPMOR where Harry decides to ignore the despair because he intellectually knows it's being caused by dementors and not by reality? This exact situation is what that was about. Optimism is absolutely warranted when you know for a fact that a film of unrealistic pessimism has been placed over your perceptions.

Second, you are predicting that the rest of time will be filled with fascism and war from just eight years of bad politics. Fascism didn't even last twelve years before getting obliterated last time, and even if our democratic institutions collapse under Trump (an eventuality with very low priors to begin with, considering those institutions have survived a civil war and institutionalized racism), it seems likely to me that the United States would crumble under its weight and be replaced by something else long before it reached the point of galactic hegemony.

Trump is going to be bad. He will be a disaster. But he is going to be a disaster contained to four years of time, or perhaps even less. He will smash into our fragile economic recovery like a train into a donut shop and the people who voted him in will be forced to realize exactly how wrong they were. Not all of them, perhaps not even most of them. But enough. The margins are thin. Trump simply cannot keep the promises he has made, and the flyover states which voted for him out of hope that something might be fixed for them will notice that nothing has improved for them. It's the economy, stupid. It's always the economy.

So, in one hand you have the unquestionable fact that your perceptions are being negatively affected by a known cognative bias. On the other, we have the fact that things have absolutely been worse before. Why do you trust your own prediction of doom?
