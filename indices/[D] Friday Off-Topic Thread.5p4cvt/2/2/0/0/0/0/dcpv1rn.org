  Second, you are predicting that the rest of time will be filled with fascism and war
#+end_quote

No I'm not. Nobody [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Quotes/Warhammer40000][quotes Warhammer 40K]] literally. The whole point of 40K is that barring something like a deliberately sadistic superintelligence or bizarre improbabilities like that, it's /physically impossible/ for real life to /ever/ get as bad as 40K. We don't have /actual thirsting gods who actually gain sustenance from torturing your soul after you die./

The "long version" link I gave was more-or-less what I /actually predict/.

  from just eight years of bad politics.
#+end_quote

Do you mean the next eight years of blatantly evil politics or the last eight years of /merely bad/ politics?

#+begin_quote
  Fascism didn't even last twelve years before getting obliterated last time
#+end_quote

Well, except in Spain, but yes, I fully expect it to collapse in on its own contradictions this time as well, /taking much of our civilization with it/, including, unfortunately, the part that I live in. Can't seem to get my wife to move somewhere safer.

  even if our democratic institutions collapse under Trump (an eventuality with very low priors to begin with, considering those institutions have survived a civil war and institutionalized racism),
#+end_quote

I think we're getting to some of the actual difference here. You think we have democratic institutions, which are unlikely to collapse. I think that if we /had/ democratic institutions (despite the fact that they were /designed/ for a meritocratic-aristocratic system, /not/ a democratic one), they were /long since/ captive to factors like Southern nationalism and institutionalized racism.

If democracy is, loosely speaking, government by rational conversation and participation among the broad population, I don't think we've had it in a very long time, and it's entirely possible we /never/ had it to the extent that many other countries /do/ have it.

To me, this isn't a decent system being suddenly gamed, subverted, or taken over by Very Bad People. This is an utterly rotted-through system having its fungus-and-termite infested wood kicked in by Very Bad People, who were astute enough to notice the mushrooms and termites growing out of the frail pretense.

  Trump is going to be bad. He will be a disaster. But he is going to be a disaster contained to four years of time, or perhaps even less.
#+end_quote

I predict he will be a disaster for as long as he remains alive.

#+begin_quote
  He will smash into our fragile economic recovery like a train into a donut shop
#+end_quote

Yep.

#+begin_quote
  and the people who voted him in will be forced to realize exactly how wrong they were. Not all of them, perhaps not even most of them. But enough.
#+end_quote

Meanwhile, every step of the way, he's building up his cult of personality and getting people used to the notion of doublethinking, of accepting contradictory ideas as simultaneously true according to a leader's instructions.

#+begin_quote
  The margins are thin. Trump simply cannot keep the promises he has made, and the flyover states which voted for him out of hope that something might be fixed for them will notice that nothing has improved for them. It's the economy, stupid. It's always the economy.
#+end_quote

Most totalitarian regimes have "elections", you realize. They just aren't /meaningful/ elections in which there's a significant chance of the regime actually losing power.

  On the other, we have the fact that things have absolutely been worse before.
#+end_quote

We are on track to be exactly as bad as things have been before, in the worst possible way.
