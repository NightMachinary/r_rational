I didn't watch it, but I liked this quote someone shared with me.

#+begin_quote
  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and spirit of America. We will not fail, our country will thrive and proposer again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth of the miseries of disease and to harness the technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: whether we are brown, black or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.

It's not that I think this is indicative of any change in his character or policies from what I already believe about him, but at least it sounded like a Presidential speech. Either he keeps it up and earns my respect, if not my support, or he doesn't and I can hold this up as an example of what he could be.
