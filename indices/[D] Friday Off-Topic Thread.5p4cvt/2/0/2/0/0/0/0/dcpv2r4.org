"people were too stupid to intelligently govern themselves" is just such a weird thing to say / take away from all that. Democracy not being a perfect answer isn't about people being stupid or smart, it's just an effect of having a large amount of agents without very good coordination mechanisms.

Being ambivalent about current governance process doesn't mean he thinks everyone else is stupid.
