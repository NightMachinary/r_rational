As another voice from the conversation, I would like to mention that for the 'both' system, you would have the +/- system map to certain numbers in the core numbers system, and you could use either version as you pleased. In this situation, you still retain edge-case functionality with the ability to use whichever number you please, while also having the most intuitive values you'd commonly use lined up in a simpler system for easier design when not in those edge cases. Conversion between the two could be effectively detailed with a tooltip in the design interface, and speaking as someone who was designing Pokemon before all of the systems were yet again thrown into flux, having a simpler list of options really makes the design process easier, even as I appreciate the benefit of edge cases like a Pokemon with fifty tentacles that all need their own amount of relevance too small to properly describe with pluses or minuses.
