  If you were actually concerned with being over-hyped (I actually have that fear myself) an "Awww shucks" would have been far more effective than "Fuck you for over-hyping me (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻"

  Nobody would have come at you with pitchforks or sworn vengeance upon you for accepting that praise.

This is at least the /third/ time I've had to make a denial of expertise in matters relevant to that subforum (though the other two times were in private messages). It does get annoying.

Note also my signature in the screenshot, which specifically says =Politeness is the enemy of honesty.=.

  Out of interest, what were you aiming for by sharing this?

  Are we meant to agree: "Yeah, fuck that guy for over-hyping you"? Is it a smug: "Normals, amirite?"? Are you exasperated that people can't solve their own problems? Did you think that you had done a funny smack-down? Is this some form of signalling?

All of these.

  Why is reddit's formatting so terrible? I have to press enter twice in order to get a new line. Jesus Christ.

How have you held an account on this site for literally two years without clicking the =formatting help= button at the lower right corner of the text input box and following [[http://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting][the =the commenting wiki page= link]]?

Maybe it isn't as good as HTML--but it certainly is better than plain text.
