Speaking of plotting meteorological data... I feel like the discussion around the arctic ice extent in the media is often around "oh this next big ice chunk broke off", but what's more interesting/worrying is the overall temperatures and ice extent. For example, [[https://icons-sf.wxug.com/hurricane/2016/arctic-temp-dec.png][the winter of 2016's temperatures for the arctic were at some points, a record +25C anomaly from the mean!]]. Equally interesting is the [[https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf/nsidc_global_area_byyear_b.png][sea surface ice extent, which is significantly down in 2016-2017.]] It's hard to understate the magnitude of the change in the ice extent. [[https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_stddev_timeseries.png][2016-2017 is now at greater than 2 standard deviations away]] from the mean ice extent, briefly flirting with a 4 standard deviations last November. Previous years had low ice extents, but 2016's is shockingly low, a massive departure from even 2015. The change is so massive that it seems the past trends will not even hold into the future, even after temperatures return to normal. The loss of ice extent will become permanent and will create a new normal climate for the arctic, a much warmer one. It seems plausible we may begin to see an ice-free arctic during the summer months by the next century.

I think the greater implications of this change are also understated in the media. I don't foresee the rise in sea levels as a major problem for most of the world. However, the arctic ice extent serves as a significant source of albedo for Earth, reflecting light away and cooling the planet. With this greatly diminished, polar regions will warm, and the increased moisture content in the air will increase the air pressure in polar regions slightly. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex#Climate_change][Increased air pressure will decrease the strength of the polar vortexes (vortexes are Low-pressure events), and weaker polar vortexes will be pulled away from the Northern latitudes and southwards.]] This is a vicious cycle, as the polar vortex moves away from the arctic, arctic temperatures warm further, displacing polar vortexes further, increasing arctic temperatures further, etc. This may also paradoxically result in Canadian and Siberian areas remaining colder than usual, despite the overall temperature increases, as weaker polar vortexes will move south into these regions.
