On scientific grounds, aggregating arctic and antarctic sea-ice is pretty dubious. But 2016 was a terrible year for both, so it's not like plotting them separately is less concerning :(

And while I think that sea level rise will be a huge problem this century (due to terrestrial ice sliding into the ocean), you're spot-on about the albedo and circulation issues.
