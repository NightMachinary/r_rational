That's not nearly as alien as I would expect an uplifted dog to be. Even though dogs have been domesticated and have learned to live with humans, they're still canines, not primates. Specifically, I can't imagine an uplifted dog dealing well with no senses of smell or taste, and probably also human-quality senses of vision (better) and hearing (worse). Albert acts more like an uploaded human with memories of being a dog.
