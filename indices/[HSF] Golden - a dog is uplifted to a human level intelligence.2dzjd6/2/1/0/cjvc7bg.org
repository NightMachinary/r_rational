Yeah, I can imagine a lot of possible reasons for the uplifted dog being close to humans -- the out-of-story reason being that a truly inhuman character would be hard to empathize with. (Although some stories, like Peter Watts' /[[http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/][The Things]]/, have tried.) I think that simply taking a golden retriever and adding the appropriate genetic manipulations to allow it to communicate in human language, would result in something very different from human psychology, even though dogs are capable of (and bred to) pay attention to their human masters/alphas.
