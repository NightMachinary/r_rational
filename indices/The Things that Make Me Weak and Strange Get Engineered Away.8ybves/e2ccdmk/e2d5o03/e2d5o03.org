This, so much.

I get that the author is trying to go for some ambiguous ending where you fill in the blank yourself, but if you're going to do that, don't do it by using terrible grammar to confuse the reader.

As it was written years ago, it doesn't really matter, but you think the writer would have tweaked that by now.
