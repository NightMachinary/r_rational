Even before reading the link, I'm just going to mention that the title of this is from Jonathan Coulton and his song "Future Soon." Not sure if this sub allows YouTube links, but if it does, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS9U9vOymFQ][you can listen to it here]]. JoCo (as he's called by fans) holds a special place in my heart for his hilarious and nerdy songs. [[https://jococruise.com/][He also has a cruise annually]] which is amazing (2019 is already sold out, but it includes They Might Be Giants, the McElroy family (of The Adventure Zone fame) and Paul & Storm).

... ok, fanboying moment over, time to read!
