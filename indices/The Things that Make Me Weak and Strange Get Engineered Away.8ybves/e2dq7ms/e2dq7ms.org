Is there a word for science fiction that tries to play out a hypothetical scenario, but that scenario has already played out in real life and proves the fiction dead wrong? Because this is an example of such fiction. Someone should tell Cory about the word "sharashka" and what actually happens when a police state requires nerd labor. If you think they will let nerds have their happy monastery, boy you're in for a surprise.
