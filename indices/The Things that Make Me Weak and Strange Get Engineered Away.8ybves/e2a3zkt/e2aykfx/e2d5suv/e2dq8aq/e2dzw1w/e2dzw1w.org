I never claimed IMMUNITY TO BULLETS. That's you. I said that over half would NOT fear a gun wielder.

I dunno, let's do a test.\\
*Undersiders*

Grue: Darkness ability makes gun inefective. Disables shooter easily.

Bitch: Giant dog provides both mobility and cover. Disables or kills shooter easily.

Tattletale: No defense against gun itself. However, gun wielder has already been paid off not to attack her, or she simply tells him to go ahead and do it if he never wants to see his family again, as she already has a plan in motion to keep herself safe. I'll let you have this point, though.

Imp: Shooter is unaware of Imp's existence until he is disabled or dead.

Regent: Takes temporary control of shooter to cause him to miss or drop gun. Disables with taser. I could do spoilers, but you know he could do a LOT worse if he wanted.

Skitter: Is aware of shooters location at all times if within 3-4 city blocks. Has 'grown' spidersilk armor, but even without it, could simply disable or slay shooter while remaining out of line of sight.

*Test Results:* 5/6 not worried about guns, 4/6 if I'm feeling generous (Grue).
