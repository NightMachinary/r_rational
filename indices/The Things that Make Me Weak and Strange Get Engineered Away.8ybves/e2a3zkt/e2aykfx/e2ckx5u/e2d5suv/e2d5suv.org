Sure, except that over half of the 'parahumans' wouldn't really fear a guy with a gun.

When there is such a scattering of superpowers across a wide spectrum of both power and utility, the whole concept of law and order breaks down simply because the institutions that enforce them are unable to compete with those they are enforcing them ON.

Oh, sure, you COULD give Superman a parking ticket, or try to charge him with assault if he backhands someone through a wall without reasonable provocation, but trying to enforce in a practical way is much harder. Even if you find someone with a power that lets them do the job, you then have to wonder what keeps them from using it on you or becoming a tyrant.
