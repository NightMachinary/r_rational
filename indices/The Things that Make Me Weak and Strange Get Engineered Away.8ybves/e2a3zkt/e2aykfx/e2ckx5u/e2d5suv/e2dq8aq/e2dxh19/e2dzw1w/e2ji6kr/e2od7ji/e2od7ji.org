In the long term, as well. See, your example is interesting, because you move from gunman or two to entire SQUADS of them. You assume, quite mistakenly, that one side will adapt its tactics while the other will not. If some group is using squads of gunmen, then the parahumans will naturally begin to team up to take such things under consideration as well, and they have MUCH more effective force multipliers than the gunmen.

The giant dog provides plenty of cover to take down one or two guys. In addition, she often has a pack of them handy. If anything, she's got it just as good against gunmen solo, simply because she can always train more dogs. And if she's solo, she can use as many as she likes... but in this case, she's free to team up. How good are guns in total darkness while you are being hunted by car-size dogs that can find you just as easily by scent? How do you arrange ambushes against someone who can detect a flea or louse on your body, as well as those as your teammates, while there's also a guy who can make you shoot yourself?

As for Tattletale, she kind of DID do exactly that. The problem with a 'corrupt' organization is that you only need a very small minority of people within it in key places for it to do shady things. Knowing those people and getting them what they want kind of is her power.\\
Remember that most of the heroes and villains held back from doing really crazy things to keep up the 'game', but if you have squads of gunmen coming after you, the gloves come off. As for a random citizen, most of the stories in Worm take place in big cities that are not exactly on the 'freedom' side of the right to bear arms.

The only thing a year of gun-heavy climate will get you is some dead parahumans for the first week or two, followed by a LOT of dead gun dudes--as well as civilians--because it means the parahumans you are hunting no longer have any inclination to 'play nice' and will happily team up to break those organizations that try to hunt them.
