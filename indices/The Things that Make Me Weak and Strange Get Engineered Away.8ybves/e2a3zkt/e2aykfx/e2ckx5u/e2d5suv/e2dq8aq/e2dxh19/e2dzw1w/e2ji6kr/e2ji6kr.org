In the short term, yes, they may be able to survive a gunfight. In the long term, they /are/ going to get shot if they regularly go up against squads of gunmen. A giant dog can only provide so much cover. Grue is vulnerable to stray bullets and ambushes. Regent has limited capacity to deflect aim; five armed people could probably take him with laughable ease if they're careful. Tattletale is powerful, but she can't cover every angle. She can't have every single law enforcement officer under her influence, she can't be simultaneously keeping track of every single patrol, plan and attack strategy of the multitude of heroic and lawful organizations in the city, and even if she does, all it takes is one angry carrying citizen to kill her.

Skitter and Imp I'll give you. But the rest wouldn't survive a year in action in a gun-heavy climate.
