Okay...I needed to take some time off before I replied as it's essentially a common comment I've found frustrating.

One thing I /don't/ want is a story about irredeemable youkai. From what I've read youkai subsist on belief more than anything, but are not only held back by belief in them being man-eaters they actually /encourage/ it. Not unlike minorities who feel empowered by frightening depictions of them. One idea I have is how the youkai are in disagreement regarding how they should interact with humanity, whether to integrate or remain as essentially minstrels and shylocks.

As far as dark goes, it'll be about the level of Teeth and Claws (which you should totally finish as it's a good fic). Glad you mentioned My Little Pony, as I look at what /that/ fandom's accomplished and lament that Touhou hasn't done so. Let me assure you that I'm /not/ going for Fallout: Equestria levels of dark here (good fic, but there's a reason I haven't looked at the spin-offs). No, the too-many-to-list thoughtful, extrapolative, world-building examples I /really/ wish Touhou had more of are what I'm going for. The ones that asked "what if we too this 22-minute kiddie toy commercial...*seriously?*" and made it /work./ [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UnderTheNorthernLights][Under the Northern Lights]] is at the lighter end of the tone I'm going for. (And if you can tell me why Touhou didn't end up as popular as MLP in spite of having so many similar traits I'd be /very/ grateful!)

As for having a goal I so far have "have the more proactive faction leaders /get somewhere/, have others react to them, and see where that leads." I still haven't figured out how to /end/ the fic, though, so I'm scared of writing myself into a corner and ending up with a dead fic.
