This seems like a setting which would be far better suited for explorations of fun theory, instead of the grim dark meathooks of the grim dark fantasy world.

So.. /do not/ make it darker, just make at least some of the characters be really interested in what fun actually is, and how their powers can make the world a better place while amusing them as well.
