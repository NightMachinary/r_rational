A lot of good points regarding Yukari, and good on you to note those. And yes, I certainly agree that Yukari's definitely a rationalist in the context of her goals. I see you as an invaluable resource in the near future.

I /do/ plan on telling the story through her perspective, just...not /entirely/ through her perspective. There are other women with other agendas, notably Kanako and Byakuren, who have their own differing progressive designs for Gensokyo. And then there're the Lunarians, who I'd also like to have proactive. And things get even more complicated when bringing Makai into the mix...
