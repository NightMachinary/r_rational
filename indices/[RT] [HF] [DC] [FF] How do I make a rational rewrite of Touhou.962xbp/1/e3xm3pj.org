Yukari and the other sages of Gensokyo are actually fairly rational given their goals and the rules of the universe they operate under. Yukari and the other sages predicted that the advance of science would metaphysically threaten their existence. They can't destroy humanity because the need human belief/faith/fear. So they engineered a pocket reality where the human population can be carefully controlled and regulated. They and other youkai have extremely destructive reality warping powers, so they work out a system of formalized system of duels that let battle in a controlled but enjoyable fashion. Feral youkaj and youkai that refuse the system get eliminated by Reimu. Reimu also eliminates human villagers that become Youkai (ie Forbidden Scrollery), thus keeping the supply of fear/faith/belief from becoming unusable.

In Silent Sinner In Blue and it related stories, Yukari perfectly demonstrates Quirrelmort's idea of losing to achieves a broader goal in her interactions with the Lunarians. Likewise in Wild and Horned Hermit, Yukari lets Reimu beat her and takes the blame for an incident caused by Sumireko while secretly fixing the problem.

If you want rationalist Touhou, just retell it from Yukari's perspective as she plots and schemes continuously to keep Gensokyo running smoothly.

If you want a darker story, maybe Kosuzu discovering the truth of Gensokyo (ie the villagers are a carefully controlled resource that live in fear, outsiders are drawn in for Youkai that need meat, etc.)? Yukari already works as a rationalist antagonist given that she has the logical goal of sustaining herself and other Youkai at the expense of a villages fear and the occasionally eaten outsider.
