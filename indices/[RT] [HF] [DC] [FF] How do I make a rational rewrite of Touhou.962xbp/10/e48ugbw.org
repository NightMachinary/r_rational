I was wondering how to write one, but I was hoping for something that didn't have the darker side of Touhou. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3669012][Teeth and Claws]] looks like it's building up to a rational dark Touhou fic, but I don't know how it ends because I didn't finish it. I'm fine with dark My Little Pony, but I think dark Touhou is too close to home. Fallout Equestria isn't canon. Yukari [[https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/wild_and_horned_hermit_ch35#17][kidnapping people]] and [[https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfect_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Outsider][feeding them to youkai]] is.

You need to have some kind of goal in a touhou fic. If you want to focus on the dark side, a good one would be trying to end Gensokyo, preferably with a minimal loss of human life until the youkai fade away. Also, you could make one that takes place centuries ago where they're trying to make Gensokyo.

I have heard a theory that Remilia's fate manipulation is basically just rationality. If anyone has any idea how a vampire could convince a vampire hunter that can manipulate space and time to stop trying to kill her and become her maid, that would be an interesting story.
