Given that the Touhou universe is full of inhuman beings, it's not necessarily surprising that those beings tend to behave in ways that don't match human rationality. If I wanted to write in the Touhou universe, I'd start with that premise. Touhou isn't a setting full of magical humans making bad decisions (there are only a few of those); it's mostly a setting full of immortal alien hedonists who don't often experience much in the way of consequences for their actions.

For a rational take on the setting, you probably want an outsider's perspective; a protagonist who lacks many of the advantages and protections the natives take for granted, and doesn't have enough ties to the locals to be willing to graciously overlook all the destruction caused by the latest cataclysmic temper tantrum some centuries-old brat just threw. As a rational work, you're mostly looking at the thorny game-theoretic problem of attempting to negotiate with aliens who have a different value system.
