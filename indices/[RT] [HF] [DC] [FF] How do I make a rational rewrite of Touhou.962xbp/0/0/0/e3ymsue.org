One thing you can do: bear down on this idea. That is, look at how youkai think in shinto mythology, and in other fictional settings that treat them more seriously (e.g. Mushi-Shi, Natsume Yuujinchou.) Then use that to inform how /these/ youkai "must be" thinking, treating whatever surface-level actions they're performing as a pretence.

Mind you, youkai acting under pretences isn't really "a thing" in Shinto mythology; but it would still play well with a Western readership, because "keeping up a pretence while playing the long game" is 100% how the equivalent creatures act in western Fairy tales.
