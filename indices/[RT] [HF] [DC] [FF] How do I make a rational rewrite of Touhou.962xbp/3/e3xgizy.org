Anyways, I care approximately 0% about touhou, for various reasons, but I'm interested in helping you with your quest. So first of all, you've gotta figure out what you want to /do./ This isn't what draws you to touhou, but rather what is drawing you to make a specifically rational work within the setting. You seem to be aware of it, but seem confused by all the other stuff tohou has going on.

Second of all, you need to start dissecting the setting. For example, the people the series focuses on are big names insulated from the consequences of their actions, which is a story as old as time. Focusing on a little person or someone who doesn't have as big a name and is forced to pick up the pieces after the big names roll through is one way to up the dark level. Not everyone in the setting is an immortal prepubescent girl.

Put another way, the one's capable of having a serious throw down aren't interested in doing so because they're going to be nice and comfortable anyways, while the ones that actually have a bone to pick and stakes are cannon fodder. Mayhaps a time for revolution?
