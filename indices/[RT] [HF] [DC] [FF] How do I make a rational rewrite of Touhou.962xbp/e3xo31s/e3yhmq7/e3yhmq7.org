Yeah, the Houral Elixer's one of those things that's so objectively beneficial that we have to make up reasons why it isn't. Thankfully, Reimu choosing not to take it can be easily attributed to her stubborn religious beliefs, constantly tested by the realities of Gensokyo. Though because of the Spell Card Rules she developed she's at considerably /less/ risk, not that she gets thanks for it from the humans she saved. A story element I plan on including, by the way.

As for Flandre, the only way I can see her backstory making sense is that at least one of her replicants wasn't locked up...which kinda defeats the whole point. And how'd she get her weapon? I'm pretty sure getting Norse-themed weapons requires work on the individual's part, even if only “I made a mean acid-dripping snake go *kyuu*, and then Loki thanked me!”
