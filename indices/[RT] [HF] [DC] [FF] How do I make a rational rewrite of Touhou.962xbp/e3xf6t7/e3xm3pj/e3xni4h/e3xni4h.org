You may be interested in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5829008/1/Imperfect-Metamorphosis][/Imperfect Metamorphosis/]], a /Touhou/ fanfiction to end all /Touhou/ fanfiction^{1}. I've read about 16/70 of it, likely based on Yudkowsky's recommendation, and if I recall correctly, it was reasonably rational and appropriately dark.

But to answer your question, here's my own idea:

There is some kind of supremely powerful overseer-entity, which ensures that Gensokyo is peaceful. If it discovers that someone isn't being peaceful, it retaliates with overwhelming force: either just terminates the offender, or brainwashes them, or throws them Outside to be comprehended by crazy human scientists/philosophers until they're reduced to basic concepts (whichever you prefer). I think there's an obvious character to fit this role, namely the border-controller.^{2}

Consequently, everyone has to pretend that all their disputes and conflicts are silly squabbles.

Problem is, they're /not/. Many of these non-human entities are unrepentant murderers and monsters, fundamentally evil or amoral creatures who enjoy carnage. Others are, oppositely, good and nice. Still others don't care about good/evil at all, or have blue & orange morality. The sanctuary houses numerous entities of different ideologies, and some of them grew rather used over centuries to impose their values upon the world by force.

But if they try that now, the overseer-entity would notice, and would promptly curb-stomp them.

As such, they're forced to keep up the facade of outwards niceness, while covertly weaving sinister plots, scheming and manipulating. Every once in a while it gets a bit too intense, weapons get put to use, but naturally everyone involved abruptly de-escalates right near the end and plays it off as a joke.

Since many of these entities are supremely powerful (but not /quite/ on the overseer's level), that equilibrium is unstable. Enter the protagonist:

- An enforcer of the overseer-entity (drama).

- A megalomaniacal brilliant manipulator who starts off as a minor fairy (political thriller).

- A bloodthirty vampire who is now forced to play politics during adorable tea parties (dark comedy).

- Someone else, I dunno.

Clarify if you want ideas about something more particular.

^{1. Or not. I mean, that's basically the only thing I consumed of /Touhou/ aside from some brief skimming of its TV Tropes page, but it's a million words long and apparently employs *all the characters*, so that seems like a reasonable guess.}

^{2. Which is OP as hell, by the way; I'm suggesting to make her basically God of the setting and you would /still/ need to nerf her for there to be a story. Seriously, what stops her from blurring the border between "potential world I wish to occupy" and "actual world" for instant global victory? Non-munchkins...}
