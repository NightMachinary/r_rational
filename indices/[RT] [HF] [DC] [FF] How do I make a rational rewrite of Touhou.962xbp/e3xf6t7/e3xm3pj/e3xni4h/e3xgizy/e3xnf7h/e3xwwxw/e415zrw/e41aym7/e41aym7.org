I have, in fact. I've read the whole run of Forbidden Scrollery, as well as a large part of Wild and Horned Hermit and Sangetsusei. They're good for bits of lore and (judging by the stories he tells) insight into how ZUN thinks, but I've stopped following them as well as they didn't make for satisfying reading. Still ,I should give them a looksee again with a particularly analytical friend to see if ai missed anything. Also, I'll keep in mind that notable characters aren't necessarily representative of their kind.
