Whoa, I don't plan on making it /grim/ dark; more like nobledark, made all the more tricky by Touhou being grimbright by default. [[https://www.deviantart.com/mikeytheblackmantis/art/Of-Grimdarks-and-Noblebrights-321271581][â€œWhat?"]], you ask? Grimbright's when a dangerous setting is played light-heartedly, while nobledark's where people are basically good even when he situation very much isn't. I do note that my clarification doesn't essentially contradict your noting that I'm swimming against the current here. Still, I find it difficult to focus on fun theory when a significant number of the population are relegated to being peddlers, minstrels, and shylocks.

Though I am curious by that new term. What /is/ fun theory?
