You should really check out the other source material such as the mangas and art books. They give the bulk of the background information and characterizations of the characters. Another important thing to remember is that the characters in the games are not an accurate representation of all members of their species. All the characters are or are closely involved with a character who can cause world changing events, so they act differently than what most of their races would. I stopped following for a while, but I used to be really into it so if you want to ask about some of the "dark" background you can ask.
