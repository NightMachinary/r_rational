  From what I've read youkai subsist on belief more than anything, but are not only held back by belief in them being man-eaters they actually encourage it.

This reminds me of a theory I have about Akyuu lying about the dangers of youkai. Her job isn't to spread accurate information. It's to protect from youkai. Youkai must be feared, whether the fears are founded or not. As long as people fear youkai, youkai can be harmless. But once people believe youkai to be their allies, the youkai will be forced to kill for the fear they need to live. She can likely do more to help humanity by lying to them than by actually recording the weaknesses of youkai.

Also, eating people is somewhat less dark when you consider that reincarnation is something well established.

  And if you can tell me why Touhou didn't end up as popular as MLP in spite of having so many similar traits I'd be very grateful!

Some theories:

- In My Little Pony you get into it by watching the shows. You will have to ask around for good fanfiction, but at least the beginning is clear. In Touhou, you can pirate games with patches to translate them into English, buy some of them if you're not cheap, and have to work for nuggets of story. You can learn everything you need from the fandom, but it's not at all clear how to do it. Though it's probably easier than actually beating those games. Especially if you want to find out about all those characters from the extra stages.

- My Little Pony was made in the US. Touhou was made in Japan. Most people don't consume media from other countries that hasn't been properly localized. Granted, most people don't watch children's TV shows either, but I suspect the fist one might be worse.

- My Little Pony is based on Western culture. Everyone knows what a unicorn and a pegasus and a dragon is. In Touhou, the majority of characters are from purely Eastern mythology, and those that are not are highly inaccurate. For example, portraying vampires as being a kind of devil, and a witch using some kind of Chinese magical reactor instead of a wand.

- My Little Pony isn't too hard to take seriously hand have rational stories and make it exactly has dark as you want. In Touhou, you basically either have to have very light stories where you ignore the diets of the majority of the characters, break canon and take everything else seriously but ignore their diets or work on crazy justifications, or have a very grimdark story. The fact that hell actually exists doesn't help, though you don't stay there forever and it seems to exist to help people become better rather than just torture them like in UNSONG. Also, some people consider eating people to be wrong even if you're not the one killing them. I don't know how big a problem that is because the idea seems utterly alien to me, but there's probably people out there who consider Orin stealing and eating corpses to plant it firmly in grimdark territory.

  As far as dark goes, it'll be about the level of Teeth and Claws (which you should totally finish as it's a good fic).

I think no matter what happens it's already too dark for me. Maybe not too dark for past me who read Fallout Equestria, but I feel like I can't handle darkness like I used to. It might be a good fic, but I don't think it's one I can handle.
