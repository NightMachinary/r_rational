[[http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/fun-theory/][Fun Theory]] is a term coined by Yudkowsky in one of his sequences to describe hedonics in the context of maximizing "fun" over an immortal post-scarcity lifespan. He basically reinvented the term for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus][hedonic calculus]]... in some cases Yudkowsky misses the conventional term because of his autodidact background, but in this case, I believe he intentionally chose a new term because "fun" is more general and has less wire-heading connotations in comparison to the term "hedonic calculus".
