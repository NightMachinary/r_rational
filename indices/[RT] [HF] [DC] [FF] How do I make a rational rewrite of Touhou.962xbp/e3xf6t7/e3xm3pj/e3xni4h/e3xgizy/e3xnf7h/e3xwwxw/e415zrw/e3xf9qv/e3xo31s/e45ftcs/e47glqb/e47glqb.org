The same gal that quote was from was also able to exploit Gensokyo to make cold fusion work in one of the earlier WaHH issues. While combat magic's held back by the law, utility magic isn't.

As for youkai eating people.../everyone/ keeps telling me that, but the narrative shows me otherwise. "Speaking of WaHH, what about that one comment from Yukari to Kasen?" She's talking about importing suicidal drifters; locals are protected by the very danmaku rules you yourself mention. Perhaps I shouldn't say "dark" in the future, because people immediately jump to grimdark.

Perhaps youkai /enjoy/ the taste of humans but don't /have/ to eat them, doing so only because they've been socialized to. And what of the youkai we /do/ see, who only seem interested in pranking, peddling, and partying? A dark story can easily focus on the subplot of one group of youkai wanting to more fully integrate with society, and be open about being youkai, conflicting with another who're quite comfortable with the status quo of general delinquent behavior. Such is the dilemma Byakuren's faced with.

Dark can also come from an upstart goddess introducing technology and displacing workers. What are all the now-unemployed extractive workers going to do? Perhaps work at (and have to train for) the conceptually new jobs offered, but how will that radically change society? And how will people react someone like Kanako sending society reeling only to take control of it?

Even if I already decided on the answers, those were good questions and points you brought up; they brought out my ideas in the first place, and provided a bit more information about the audience.
