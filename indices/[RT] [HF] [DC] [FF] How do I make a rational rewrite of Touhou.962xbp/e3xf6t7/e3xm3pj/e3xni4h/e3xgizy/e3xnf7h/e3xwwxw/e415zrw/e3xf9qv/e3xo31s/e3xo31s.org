One thing that always bugged me was Reimu saying she would never drink the immortal elixir if she had the option of having it, which I think it's pretty stupid considering she risks her life almost daily. So it has to be balanced, maybe by making it almost impossible to make or the elixir faction just not trusting her ever enough (even though they trust her enough to send her against the lunarians in lolk with a weaker form of the elixir...arghh so complicated).

Also the whole thing about Flandre sitting in a basement for centuries for basically no reason at all
