My explanation for the gender imbalance is that Gensokyo became a matriarchal society as a result of all the men being so busy fighting that the women ended up running everything, similar to Sparta and the Mongols. It's more evened out nowadays, but male youkai kinda want to stay out of trouble.

Personally, I like the concept of an all-female cast as it forces readers (and writers) to think of women as variable people rather than force this gender or that into specific roles. Apart from social justice sorts like myself, people tend to not even bat an eye at an all-male cast. Plus, I turn the Touhou cast into bishies and I'm likely to get...distracted...

(Incidentally, I took a while to post this precisely because of the second paragraph. I'm concerned as to how well-received my opinion will be here...)
