I wrote a Touhou story for a challenge prompt. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hr0iXNyCx7qvBzRXut23lrolhZ7Lu7tHEcs-oopnJ44/edit?usp=sharing][Feel free to read it if you want.]] It didn't garner much attention.

My main goal was trying to explain Gensokyo without changing it very much (and answer a plot hole of statistical significance). It sounds like you'd be changing the crazy, instead of justifying it. What are you thinking of changing?

Will you keep the magical laser paintball?

Will characters kill each other often?

One problem is the matter of food. So, so many youkai feed on humans. One resolution is to make human eating possible but optional for the youkai, and rare. Other resolutions might be farming humans, or having very many humans, or having humans respawn or regenerate. How would you resolve that?

Whatever you write, I'd be very interested.
