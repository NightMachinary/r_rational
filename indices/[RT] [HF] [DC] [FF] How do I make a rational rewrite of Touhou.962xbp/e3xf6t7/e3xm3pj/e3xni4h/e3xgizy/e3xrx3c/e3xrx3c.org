Thank you for your suggestions, I'll answer them in order. I mostly have what I want to do figured out: refocus the story around the ambitious faction leaders and have them actually /get/ somewhere with their plots. Though I don't know what I don't know, so what do I seem confused about, if I may ask?

While it's the opposite of your second suggestion, there really aren't any pieces to pick up (lately), and the canon works generally focus on the most inconsequential denizens anyway. That said, putting more focus on the local humans and their economy is something I'd like to see (and therefore write) more of, especially regarding the earlier incidents that afftemed the weather (and thus the crop yields!).

As for a revolution of the weak vs. the strong, that actually /was/ a plot point in one of the games...that didn't really get developed. Social change is most certainly something a big element I want in this rewrite, however!
