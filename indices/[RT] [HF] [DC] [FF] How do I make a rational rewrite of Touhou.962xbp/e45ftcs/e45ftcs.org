"You can't allow yourself to be held back by common sense in Gensokyo."

In other words, any attempt at exploiting the systems is going to run into the issue that there is very little systematizing and a whole lot of weird conceptual bullshit going on. Around 50% of the cast has an ability that would be somewhere between horrifying and unstoppable if they weren't constrained to settle their differences via magical laser paintball.

If you just want to make a story that's /darker/ than the original, there's plenty of space to work with. Start with the fact that Youkai eat people and go nuts. What sort of precautions does a villager take to avoid getting eaten? It's a setting where every old-timey superstition about ghosts and monsters is /actually true/ and breaking the rules could get you eaten - I imagine this would lead to some pretty serious paranoia. That, or a lot of people pursuing magical powers in self-defense, and perhaps becoming youkai themselves.

But the danmaku rules you're just going to have to accept as given or the whole thing pretty much falls apart. Just accept that the only acceptable way to use your superpowers offensively is by expressing them as artful bullet patterns and see how that shapes peoples' actions. Would society be more violent, since magical violence is mostly harmless and easy to fix? Or does it lead people to be more polite, since you can get challenged to a duel for any old thing?
