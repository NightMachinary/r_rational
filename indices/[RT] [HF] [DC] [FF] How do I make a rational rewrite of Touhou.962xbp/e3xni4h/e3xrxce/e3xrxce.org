Oh yeah, I read a bit of it. I don't plan on my fic being /that/ dark or violent, but it's a good read just the same. Not enough Byakuren or Kanako parts, though. Their interaction with each other was certainly one of my favorite parts, though.

As for your idea, it certainly looks like one I can work with. I certainly agree that the prohibition on violence doesn't make clashing ideals any less acrimonious. I also agree that Yukari most definitely works as a subtle overseer of Gensokyo's ordered chaos. I don't think there'd be any /one/ protagonist, so much as powerful viewpoint characters working with and against each other.

As for clarifying if I want any ideas, what specifically /do/ you know about Touhou?
