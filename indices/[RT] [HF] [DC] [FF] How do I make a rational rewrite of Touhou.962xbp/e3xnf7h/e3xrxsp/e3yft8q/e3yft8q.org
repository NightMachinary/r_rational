The feeding on belief makes sense. That makes anyone who compiles statistics about youkai behavior a dangerous nuisance, though--don't you dare tell the other human villagers that their chances of being eaten are actually tiny! Such stats might kill a youkai, or drive a youkai to reinforce belief in them.

The belief thing isn't free of problems, though. Secretive youkai should disappear, flashy youkai should become the most powerful. (Koishi wouldn't persist in that world for long, for example). There should be a mechanism for youkai to ensure their continued existence without belief, that is, a part of their diet that isn't humans or human beliefs. Maybe belief recharges them, but they can subsist on other things if needed.

'Not a lot of killing' will need some explanation, but many good possibilities have been put forth already.
