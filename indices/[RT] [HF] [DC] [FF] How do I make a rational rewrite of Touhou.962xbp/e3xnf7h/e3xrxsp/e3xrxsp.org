I gave your fic a look. I think it's lack of acclaim is due to it being one of many "guy in Gensokyo"-type fics. Did show off the characters all right, though.

I don't plan on having a lot of killing, though I'm undecided on the danmaku battles. It's likely I'll include it since it's an important social element, but I'm not likely to write out a lot of spell card battles.

As for food, I believe that youkai technically only need to feed on belief; it's just that fear is their preferred flavor. Same with anthropophagy: they /like/ the taste of humans, but don't necessarily /have/ to eat them. Thing is, since youkai are beings of belief, and humans /believe/ youkai eat humans, a fear that's fostered by the youkai themselves... Yeah, we have a self-perpetuating social problem, and a serious challenge for would-be reformers like Byakuren.
