Thanks. This is helpful.

The advantage of showing up as a clone, even if you intend to attend in person, is exactly what it turned out to be in practice: ambush protection.

The purpose of the shell game was to prevent Hiashi from going straight for the original Naruto; it's not that the Byakugan can identify clones from originals (IIRC that's a special ability of the Sharingan in canon, and I haven't changed this), but that the 360 degree vision means Naruto's only means of evasion/concealment was to hide in a crowd and keep moving.

Of course, Hiashi /could/ see, as soon as he activated the Byakugan at the end of the Hinata conversation, that Naruto's wristband was full of his chakra and therefore probably someone under the Transformation Technique. He attempted a one-hit-kill move on Naruto in full knowledge of this.

The original question of why Naruto would obey Hiashi's demand to turn up in person in the first place is still valid, though. I agree that Naruto's behaviour wasn't really rational here, although I do think it was in character - Naruto is arrogant, and bad at backing down from challenges, and also wary of risking his relationship with Hinata by further alienating the HyÅ«ga (as well as extremely tired and not thinking straight). So he attempts to play by Hiashi's rules and win, and just barely manages it.
