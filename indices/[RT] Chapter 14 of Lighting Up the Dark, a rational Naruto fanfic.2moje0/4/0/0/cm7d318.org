Thanks for the answer. My point was that Naruto has 3 options:\\
1) Show up in person\\
2) Show up as a clone\\
3) Show up as a wristband attached to a clone

Naruto has two concerns here: Not alienating the Hyuga, and surviving. Surviving is better accomplished by being a clone. The Hyuga are alienated if they find out that Naruto is a clone, but the only way they can notice that is if they attack Naruto, in which case it is still preferable to be a clone since he prefers surviving over playing by the rules (I assume). Therefore, option 3 may well be better than option 1, but option 3 is pareto-dominated by option 2. Rational!Naruto should realize this, or at least facepalm about it afterwards. It is especially noticeable to me because I just finished writing about Naruto almost making this exact mistake in my own rational!Naruto fanfic.

Btw, the sharingan only had the ability to identify clones in the anime filler (valley of the end fight), except madara who says he could identify wood clones with his eternal mangekyo I think. It was stated during the chunin exams that the Byakugan has better insight than the sharingan in every way, so it only makes sense that the sharingan would not be able to identify clones either.
