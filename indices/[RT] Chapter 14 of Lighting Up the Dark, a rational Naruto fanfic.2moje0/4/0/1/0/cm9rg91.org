If it was a shadow clone, it would automatically get half the chakra anyway, since that's how shadow clones work - by taking an equal share of your chakra when created.

Naruto couldn't be sleeping because that dispels shadow clones (which is also why he didn't take a nap while the Uzumaki Naruto Coalition was preparing, and why his clones all got dispelled when Haku knocked him out). Incidentally, this is probably a major reason why shadow clones aren't normally sent on independent missions.

Your suggestion is an interesting one, but I think there's more character development potential in having Naruto face up to the fact that he acted irrationally and nearly got killed as a result. While the idea of him facing Hiashi as a chessmaster with contingencies and counter-contingencies has its own appeal, I'm not sure he's at that level quite yet. For one thing, he lacks the experience of battling intelligent opponents that would allow him to develop that sort of behaviour.
