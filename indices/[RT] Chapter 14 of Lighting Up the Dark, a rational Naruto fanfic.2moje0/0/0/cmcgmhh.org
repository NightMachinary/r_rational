Rational!Naruto/Princess Bride:

- Chouji Akimichi (heck, any of the Akimichis) dressed up in a fire-retardant cloak and doused with burning oil, hurtling through the Hyuga compound on a trolley, screaming "I AM THE DREAD JONIN ROBURETSU!" to provide a diversion while Naruto is busy sneaking into Hinata's room.

- "You see, there's two kinds of dead," said Tsunade, poking at Sasuke's limp body with an accusing digit; the supine genin was covered in the intricate whorls and marking of Orochimaru's Curse Seal, and still as a corpse. "This guy here? He's only /mostly/ dead."

"I learned this jutsu from Pervert-Sensei", Naruto said and slapped the ground with the flat of his palm.

"/Katon: Fire Swamp of the Underworld!/" Spreading around his hand like ripples in water, the wave of chakra mutated the surroundings as it passed, turning the training ground into marshland, with gouts of flame intermittently bursting from the mire.

"Just watch out for the T.O.U.S."

"T-T.O.U.S.?" stammered Hinata. She almost jumped out of her skin when the towering form of Gamabunta leaned down from behind and whispered in her ear (although his voice was still loud and booming enough to carry halfway across Konoha).
