PS: Remember how Peter Falk seemed like a natural, playing the snarky granddad who's reading the /Princess Bride/ story to the little kid in the movie? The same Peter Falk who played Columbo? The same Peter Falk who had a glass eye, i.e. only one regular eye?

Can't you just imagine Kakashi as the laconic granddad, reading the story of the /Kunoichi Bride/ to an excitable Konohamaru?
