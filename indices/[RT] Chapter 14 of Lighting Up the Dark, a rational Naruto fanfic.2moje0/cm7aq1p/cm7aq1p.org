Great to see another chapter!

I hate to be the guy who gives only negative feedback, but I have to quibble about rational!naruto's rationality. Why on earth does he go to the Hyuga compound in person if he genuinely thinks that Hiashi might kill him? There is literally no advantage to showing up as a clone and then being there in person anyway, unless Naruto is oath bound to obey Hiashi's demands somehow. Remember [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Yudkowsky's advice]] on how to write intelligent characters. Ask yourself what you would do in Naruto's situation: Would you show up in person if you could send a clone? Of course not.

I will also add in some of my own rules on writing rationalist fiction:\\
1) The greatest power of rationality is not to achieve a desired result in a clever manner, but to decide what should be done in the first place.\\
2) If a character gets in a "I almost died there" situation without massively rethinking everything they did to get to that point, they are not acting rationally.

I get that you are aiming more for humour than realism here, but it makes it difficult for me to think of Naruto as rational when his actions are so plainly driven by the needs of the plot. If you want to fix this it is easy to just say that Naruto HAD to show up in person because his shadow clones have a maximum range, or something.

BTW: If Hiashi could identify the original with his byakugan (otherwise the shell game wouldn't be necessary), how come he doesn't see right away that the first naruto was a clone?
