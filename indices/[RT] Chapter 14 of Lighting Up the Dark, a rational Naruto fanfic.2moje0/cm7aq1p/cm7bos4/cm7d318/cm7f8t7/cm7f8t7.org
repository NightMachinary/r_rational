Drat. Apparently my dōjutsu knowledge is weak. Thanks for the info.

I think the Hyūga could notice that Naruto is a clone without attacking him, and in fact this is something Naruto probably wouldn't put past Hyūga Hiashi (e.g. "oops, my servant has just bumped into you violently", or even "let me test you with a completely innocent sparring match").

You're right that this is a big enough deal that I'll address it in the next chapter, though.
