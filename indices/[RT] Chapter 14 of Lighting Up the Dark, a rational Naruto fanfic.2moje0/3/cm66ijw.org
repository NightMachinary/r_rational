You know, when I originally heard that someone was making this based off of that omake, I was /pretty/ skeptical of the quality... and then I got to reading it, and it immediately went on my watch list.

And now you release another chapter, and you're making me wish I could add it again, *harder*. Loving how it's turning out, can't wait for more!
