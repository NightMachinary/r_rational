So can someone versed in the ways of Reddit explain to me why this post keeps getting upvoted and downvoted? I assume the upvotes mean something like "thank you for posting a link to an interesting story", but what do the downvotes mean? "This doesn't belong on /rational"? "Down with fanfiction"? "This story is of poor quality and should be hidden away so that no one ever sees it again"?
