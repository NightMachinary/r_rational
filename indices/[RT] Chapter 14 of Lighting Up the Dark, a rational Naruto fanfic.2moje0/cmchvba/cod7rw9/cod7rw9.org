The upvote/downvote counts actually lie to you. It's a bit of a thing put in place by the website code to make people who are shadow banned think they are still being voted on, to make as much time as possible pass before they just make a new account. The only part of the post/comment voting system that doesn't lie is karma count.

By the way, loved the story. Excited to see more.
