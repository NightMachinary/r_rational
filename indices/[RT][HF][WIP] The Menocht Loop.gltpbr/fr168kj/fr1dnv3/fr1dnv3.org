Well, "no real stakes" is kind of a feature of time loop stories - Re:Zero gets around it because Subaru never knows when a loop is going to end and he'll have to deal with the consequences, but MoL has it in abundance for really long stretches.

What I do like about this story's approach to the topic of stakes is that, since it's a more character focused work, the fact that there's no real stakes is actually a problem for the MC - he's gone a bit psychopathic during his time in the loop, and is having difficulty connecting to people who are just going to reset anyway.

You can see this in the second loop, the "slice of life school days" one. His interactions with normal people are just completely off until he decides to put on a mask and pretend. Linda is the clearest example - he's just going through the motions of a relationship to seem normal. There's also his interactions with his mom later where he completely misunderstands her motivations

The plot does meander around but that's largely due to the scenario-based setup; the plot's generally going to be "how do I get past the next scenario", unless the MC decides to goof off in a solved scenario.
