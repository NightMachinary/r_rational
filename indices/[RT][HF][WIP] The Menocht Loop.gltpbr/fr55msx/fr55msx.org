I'm up to chapter 17 at this point.

Mistakes like this make me wonder if I've gotten too used to the high quality prose in AW's works. Everything seems stilted, the dialogue seems off. The culture seems a mishmash with heavy American slang (for example "formal") setting me up to expect everything else to be American then juxtaposing that with its own jargon. The motivations and sense of experience of the main character are hard to grasp, for example we're meant to think he's been on the first loop for years but he only lost a limb when he was in that coffin? And yet there wasn't any sense of confusion or complexity with how he solved it, which seems fair if it's meant to be about how he stalled on the first level but regardless seems off with it being the first time he has cut off a limb.

One example of the dialogue feeling just really not right is at the party where he's talking to some elderly matron and she's like "well we don't let anyone below 65% in". It's like if you were a club for people who bench and they said "well if you can't bench 84.3kg you shouldn't be in this club", it's something you can imagine being written on the rules but you'd think some ancient club (at least that's the sense I'm getting from that) should have better ways of being snide.

Something like "Well if you can't beat the trials with your eyes closed" or "Well if you can't even lift yourself" don't use numbers. To be fair Mother of Learning was not exactly high quality writing either.

Also in the first fake out, are his decisions meant to be stupid because surprise he can undo them or are we really meant to believe this actual 30 year old thinks this is the best way to live his life after getting out of the time loop and believing he is one of the strongest practitioners on the planet, it's like reading about Hercules deciding to hide his strength so he can try to get a 9-5 job stacking shelves

Not to say it's irredeemable, the worst thing about these books is there's always some good ideas and concepts that just need a little guidance or refinement
