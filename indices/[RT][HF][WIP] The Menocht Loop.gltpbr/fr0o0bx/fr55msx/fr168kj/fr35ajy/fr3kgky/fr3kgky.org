And, after finishing Chapter 29, I'm left with the same impression.

For example, in the "military" loop, the MC is an officer of some sort, whose goal is to defeat a bunch of terrorists in a cult who want to attack the MC's country. But we aren't given almost any details about the country, the cult, the military, or even the duties of the rank that the MC occupies.

And, for a story supposedly about a person who has to overcome his difficulty socializing with people... I never get the impression (after the first school loop that he spends re-acclimating to being around people, anyway) that he has any trouble at all socializing with people. And, while I agree with other comments here that there are no stakes, I don't think that's a result of the time loop, so much as the MC hasn't had any really difficult problems to face (i.e. ones that can't be overcome by either sheer necromantic power or just by keeping his head down) since he was hunted down at that party.

Again, it's not badly-written, but, based on what's been released to date, I just have no desire to seek it out again and read more when it continues.
