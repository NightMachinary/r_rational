That's kind of my point - MoL has very low stakes for most of its runtime. I don't think Zorian encountered anything that could actually negatively impact the loop until roughly the end of the first section with the arachnea, which (in terms of word count) was about where this story is now, if I recall correctly.

I fully expect this story to have some way of raising the stakes relatively soon (the current scenario is well suited for it), but of course you can't tell until it happens.

Low stakes are kind of just a thing that happens in time loop stories.
