I'm just about to start Chapter 10, and I'm finding it a bit light on exposition so far. For instance, we're at a school, but we're not told nearly anything about it except that it's a school. The MC gets a test that measures "affinities" but there's no real effort to explain what the number given is a percentage /of/.

I just don't feel like I'm being given the details necessary to understand what's going on beyond the surface level. And given that this is a story that seems to be trying to sell me on the mystery behind the time loop, being stingy on basic information about the setting doesn't bode very well.

It's not bad, not to the point where I'd stop reading it, but if I catch up to the last chapter that's been posted and it hasn't given me a better sense of the world it's in, I doubt I'll pick it back up.
