DKS, thanks for continuing to work on this excellent story. I've attempted to write up a [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcWtlDrhEbMtt-tkt5Xkfx5bFByglHaEhDoQ0cPdeoI/edit?usp=sharing][brief rules primer]] for the world, as much as I could deduce from what's been covered so far. If you could comment if I'm on the right track, I'd be very appreciative.

From my review, I found a few things that I'm unable to answer without a little Word of God:

- Do Recovery/Restoration normally help Physique and Spirit return to max if reduced, or is this only a function of Spirit Transference?
- If/when Recovery/Restoration bring Physique/Spirit back to max, at the established rate of 100:1, does it apply to both Physique AND HP, or get consumed first for Physique then remainder to HP?
- Does the stacking 1.5x cost for additional same-day attunements and unlocks count only attunements (as suggested in all the math), or both attunements and unlocks (as suggested by Chapter 3's Skillweb infobox)?
- Does the 6x cost for Uncommon vs. Common, continue up the rarities with each tier costing 6x more?
- Somewhere in the story, Athos got 10 more Essence (113 vs 103) than MrFloatyBox told him about, either from HP or MP. As he's an unreliable narrator, can we assume these might be related to the unexpected Ding he experienced when opening his character sheet?

I am fully aware I'm over analyzing the math behind an excellent narrative, but I think that's very much in the spirit of this subreddit.
