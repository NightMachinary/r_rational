Aw, way to boop that snoot Athos. Really putting the team on your back haha.

Eugene seems like he genuinely just wants to help Athos, dubious methods aside. It sucks that he's getting such a bad rap on RR for having a bad first impression (and second impression (and possible third impression (ok, so he doesnt seem like the greatest team player, but he's at least doing things that help the team, so i cant bring myself to hate him))).

Wait, im confused, so Athos and Boy Muckface both got healed when spirit was transferred? How does that work? Shouldnt Athos have gotten worse by giving up spirit and Boy have gotten back to around his initial condition after the spirit transfer?
