tldr: Eugene seems young, dumb, and looking to get rich quick, and he is absolutely abusing Athos' predisposition to help humans. But I don't think he's doing it out of apathy or malice. I think he might genuinely care about our doggo, but his ability to gauge threats is way off (due to character and possibly culture). I think a big heaping serving of life experience is all that Eugene needs to become a functional part of society.

Definitely a prick, he strikes me as the young, ambitious, jerk adventurer type. I mean, the guy was gonna get eaten by a giant lizard and thought he was fine--he needs a serious calibration to his threat assessment, which I think is where the biggest problem with him lies (again, young and stupid). (Although, I think this might stem from living in a world where killing things literally makes you stronger and richer, so the moral misalignment might be an issue of culture as well as character)

He is totally abusing Athos' morality by guilt tripping him into participating in prize fights, but I think Eugene isn't doing it out of a lack of empathy or a sort of malice. Up until the first arena fight, he saw Athos help kill a big ass fire breathing lizard, and drive off a pack of wolves solo and bounce back from serious injuries time and again. I'm willing to bet he figured the super dog was nigh indestructible, so entering him into a team fight would be little risk to Athos and they'd both make a huge profit from it (threat assessment, young and dumb). The guy does imply afterward that he doesn't want Athos to actually get hurt when he admits that running from the cops when that headhunter comes around was for the best.

With the most recent pit fight shenanigans, let's not forget that Athos basically asked him if he can spot him half a million dollars. Obviously Athos isn't making that kind of money that quickly through safe or legal means. Even after a night of brainstorming, Eugene was the only guy that was able to come up with a plan to solve Athos' problem.
