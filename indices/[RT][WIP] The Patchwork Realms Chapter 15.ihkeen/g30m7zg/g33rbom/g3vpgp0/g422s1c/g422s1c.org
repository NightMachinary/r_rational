  Do Recovery/Restoration normally help Physique and Spirit return to max if reduced, or is this only a function of Spirit Transference? If/when Recovery/Restoration bring Physique/Spirit back to max, at the established rate of 100:1, does it apply to both Physique AND HP, or get consumed first for Physique then remainder to HP?
#+end_quote

Yep. Recovery / Restoration regenerate your HP / MP first and then any leftover points go towards regenerating Physique / Spirit.

  Does the stacking 1.5x cost for additional same-day attunements and unlocks count only attunements (as suggested in all the math), or both attunements and unlocks (as suggested by Chapter 3's Skillweb infobox)?
#+end_quote

Attuning a node always costs the same as it did to unlock it. That's true even if you buy it on a different day. This absolutely does not have anything to do with the fact that it was easier to program my spreadsheet that way.

  Does the 6x cost for Uncommon vs. Common, continue up the rarities with each tier costing 6x more?
#+end_quote

Yes.

  Somewhere in the story, Athos got 10 more Essence (113 vs 103) than MrFloatyBox told him about, either from HP or MP. As he's an unreliable narrator, can we assume these might be related to the unexpected Ding he experienced when opening his character sheet?

That's probably just bad tracking on my part.

  I am fully aware I'm over analyzing the math behind an excellent narrative, but I think that's very much in the spirit of this subreddit.

Hey, I'm delighted! Feel free to overanalyze.

Also, wow. Your rules doc is remarkably accurate.
