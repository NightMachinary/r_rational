It's fiction, so I suppose there's no truth to the matter, but "humans do bad things, so AI isn't liable to do worse, which is why I'm going to bull ahead with making one as fast as I can" being someone's response to the question "how are you going to not kill us all with your AI?" does not inspire my confidence in their sanity.
