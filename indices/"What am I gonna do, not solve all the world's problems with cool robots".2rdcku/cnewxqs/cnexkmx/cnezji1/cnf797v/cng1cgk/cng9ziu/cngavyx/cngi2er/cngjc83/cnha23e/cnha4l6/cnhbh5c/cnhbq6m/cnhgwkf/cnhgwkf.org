Nothing magical, strictly utilitarian.

To function outside of deliberate programmatic instructions it must have enough sophistication to exhibit emergent behaviors.

To analyze the actions it can take it must have a model of itself and its interfaces with the world. This would qualify as "self-awareness" for any practical definition of the term, especially if this model is one that can be updated by the AI itself as changes happen.

To analyze how it can get others to take actions on its behalf it must have a model of those others and the likely outcomes of particular actions on its part. This is "Theory of Other".

Perhaps you do not see these things as hard because they are things that people are inherently good at, to the point where the lack is considered a major disability.
