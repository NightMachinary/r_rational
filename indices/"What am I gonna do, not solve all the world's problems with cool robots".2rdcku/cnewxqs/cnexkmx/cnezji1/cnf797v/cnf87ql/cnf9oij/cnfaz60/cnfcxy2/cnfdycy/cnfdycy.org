Do please explain further, what percentage of humanity is required to keep internet running? 1%? 0.1%? 0.01%? Even if your argument was correct, that's the only percentage of humanity which you are effectively arguing will survive -- and that only at the starting stages.

Honestly your argument is like saying that humans need animals, therefore animals must be safe from humans, that no human would ever hurt an animal or it would be an idiot.
