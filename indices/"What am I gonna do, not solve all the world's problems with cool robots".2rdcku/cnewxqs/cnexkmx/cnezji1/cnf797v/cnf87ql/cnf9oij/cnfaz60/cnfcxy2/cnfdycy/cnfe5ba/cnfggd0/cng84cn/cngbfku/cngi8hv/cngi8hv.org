I am indeed being dismissive.

People are largely self-repairing and self reproducing, robots are not, and for the near future (century timescale) I don't see that changing outside the movies.

If an AI wanted to get to that point, it would actually have to take care of humanity. It could then turn hostile at some later point, but so could any number of world leaders with nuclear bombs at their fingertips.

This just isn't a high-grade risk, and certainly not one that will spring up without warning.
