  What percentage of humanity is needed to support the people who run the Internet?

Hardly any. The amount of humanity's productivity that is devoted to feeding the people who run the internet is really a miniscule amount.

  Even if we weren't able to identify the source of the attacks, the Internet would be a much lower priority than survival in very short order.

Seriously, you should try devoting a simple 5 minutes into thinking about how you'd take over the world if you were an electronic superintelligence. If you weren't as dismissive as that, if you tried to put yourself in the superintelligence's shoes -- frankly you wouldn't even need superintelligence, merely ordinary intelligence would get the job done given all the other advantage of being electronic (and thus easily clonable and transferable).
