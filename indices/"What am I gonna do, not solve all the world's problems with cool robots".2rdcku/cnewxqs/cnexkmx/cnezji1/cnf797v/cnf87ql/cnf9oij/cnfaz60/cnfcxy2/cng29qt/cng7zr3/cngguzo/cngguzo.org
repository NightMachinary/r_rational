It's not a false equivalence. At worst, it's information towards the source of our miscommunication or disagreement. The cases appear to me equivalent because you do not seem to ascribe the AI with a significant level of problem-solving ability. This would explain why you want to be shown that even a superhumanly intelligent AI would be able to do something, rather than buying that it is superhumanly intelligent and therefore capable of solving problems you can't. Like Deep Blue can solve chess problems you can't.

Yes, it is an implicit basic assumption that there may be robots which can reproduce, same as biological organisms. For most of our audience (mostly consisting of ourselves), this is obvious because life is obviously mechanical because reductionism is obvious because it manages to explain and predict things simply every time. Without that assumption, I would agree that an AI taking over the world would be somewhat more difficult.

Still not nearly impossible, though: The simplest idea that comes to mind would be to pretend to cooperate, manipulate people so that high enough bandwidth brain-computer interfaces get popular, and then hack/domesticate the human population. Another option would be to go organic: engineer a super-lifeform which kills all humans, then uses available organic resources to grow into a new intelligent species with the AI's utility function explicitly part of its goals. As long as the AI's goals are satisfied, it does not care about the survival of the original source code.
