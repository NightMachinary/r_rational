What percentage of humanity is needed to support the people who run the Internet?

Even if we weren't able to identify the source of the attacks, the Internet would be a much lower priority than survival in very short order.

That would be the bit that "The Matrix" got right in it's weird allegory way: the machines /need/ us.

Certainly a hostile AI could engage in petty brutality, but outright warfare on humanity would be /stupid/.
