That's not a very good definition of hubris, nor is it connected to the original meaning in Greek. Hubris, originally, was straightforwardly 'presuming to put yourself on a level with the gods'; Arachne and Icarus are the most straightforward examples. Calling pride or self-confidence 'hubris' is a backdoor argument /claiming/ it's excessive without justification. It's just above shouting [[http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/]["YOU AM PLAY GODS!"]] at the person.

J. Craig Venter (who's currently running a synthetic biology company) and MIRI (whose eventual goal is godlike AI) are both being hubristic, for certain, but that doesn't mean their projects are wrong, or that they're overconfident. Venter certainly isn't; he's basically succeeded already, IIRC, with only legal issues delaying them from full-scale production.
