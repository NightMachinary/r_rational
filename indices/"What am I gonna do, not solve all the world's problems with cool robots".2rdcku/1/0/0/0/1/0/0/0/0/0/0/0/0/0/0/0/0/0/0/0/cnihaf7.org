Inductive reasoning works, but it is limited by its inputs and the processing power available (including inter-processor latency, which is a significant problem in supercomputing).

Deductive reasoning is likewise limited.

I know things that are not on the Internet, as I expect you do also.

Your hypothetical AI-superbeing will be as limited by its body as any human, though the limitations will be different.

That isn't to say that /any/ program could not go out of control with unintended consequences, I have it happen to me too frequently as it is. It is simply that the assumption that an AI will somehow transcend human ability in the dramatic ways hypothesised requires more rigor than has been presented thus far.
