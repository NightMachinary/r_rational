Machine intellect also costs calories, although i am not sure how the two compare on efficiency. I really think energy expenditure is an underestimated dimension to the question of AI... I'll get into that next paragraph... The more interesting point is your final point.

  It's less that AIs will "transcend human limitations" (we actually don't have that many, since we're inductive reasoners), then that they'll actually have some advantages over us from the start.

I don't know if this is already an identified hypothesis, but I think that if thinking machines really are possible (a question Alan Turing found too meaningless to discuss), a limit to their utility will be identified, more or less along the lines of what I call the lazy servant paradox. Basically, in trying to keep them useful and subordinate, they will be kept dumber than they otherwise would have been. Closely related is the idea that if we don't keep them useful and subordinate, they will do the bare minimum. These could probably be combined into a neater phrase, but there, I published it.

Now i realize I promised I would tie in energy expenditure in the second paragraph, but I failed to.
