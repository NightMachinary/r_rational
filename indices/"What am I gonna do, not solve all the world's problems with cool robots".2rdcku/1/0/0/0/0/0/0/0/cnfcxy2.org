I know this may shock you, but humanity does not /need/ the Internet. However, the Internet needs people on a day to day basis to keep it running.

An AI can certainly do quite a bit of damage through Internet connected systems, but to do so would be for it to quite effectively commit suicide, since it would be attacking itself as well.

Hence it would be an Artificial Idiot.
