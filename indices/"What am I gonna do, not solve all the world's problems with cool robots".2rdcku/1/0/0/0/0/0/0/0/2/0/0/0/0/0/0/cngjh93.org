What repair or construction is there that a robot won't be able to do if they have human-level intelligence and human-level hands (let alone superhuman-level ones?)

You are always effectively saying "they won't be a threat in the future because they're not a threat now". This is annoying and irksome, and frankly says more about how you're stuck believing in some status quo that can never be changed rather than figuring out, how the status quo WILL change if some of your underlying assumptions stop being valid.
