If true, the hypocrisy hypothesis only applies to human sapience or minds that evolved similarly. An artificial general intelligence could be quite impressive before passing us in our specialized field of "deceiving humans."

It's still not a safe bet that it /won't/ have that capability (especially if it's light-years beyond us in intelligence as Yudkowsky thinks it will be), but it doesn't /have/ to.

And if AI happens first through uploading or copying a human mind, it would of course have the same strengths and weaknesses as humans.
