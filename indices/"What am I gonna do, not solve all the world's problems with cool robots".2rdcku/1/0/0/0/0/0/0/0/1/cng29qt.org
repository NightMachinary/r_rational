With your logic, you would deny that Deep Blue can defeat Kasparov, because if Deep Blue does what you think it would do it will lose.

The AI is smarter than people. It certainly is smarter than what little brain power you have spent trying to imagine what it would do. You simply do not have the cognitive capacity to simulate its thoughts. The other way around, though - if it had the information to specify a human as clever as you, it could simulate that human spending a year thinking over what decisions to make for every second.

So yeah, the AI would not be an idiot. It might pretend to cooperate for a day, a decade, a millennium, or a million years - however long or short it takes for the probability of conquest to peak (since a million years < 1/10000 of the future, probability is the dominant factor). Or it might just see a gap in the defenses right away.
