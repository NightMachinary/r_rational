Yes, that's exactly correct. The AI would just manipulate the political landscape in the same way that we would play poker against a child while their front company (or whatever they choose to do to make a shit ton of money and power) would gather together the resources needed for whatever the computer needs to replace us. The AI could always make robotic humans and just replace us with those but there are propably more optimal ways.

Name one thing that we could provide an AI that they wouldn't be able to make a better version of.
