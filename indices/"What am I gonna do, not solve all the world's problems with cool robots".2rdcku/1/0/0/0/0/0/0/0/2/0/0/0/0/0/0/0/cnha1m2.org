Humans would have to produce enough of a machine infrastructure to provide resilience of a similar order to living things for the system as a whole for there to be a threat that couldn't be dealt with.

As long as a simple storm can effectively disable the machine infrastructure over a wide area, deliberate actions by people who feel threatened by those machines would be very effective.

This /might/ change in the future, but given past efforts towards more reliable infrastructure I wouldn't count on it.
