  "You worried even a little bit about artificial intelligence being a good idea?"

  "Why? Because organic intelligence has been so awesome? Worst case scenario, an AI makes a doomsday device. We already did that. Starts a World War? We did that /twice/. Tries to kill us all? We have scientists working on weaponised superviruses /right now/. Go talk to /them/ about scientific ethics. I'm going to keep trying to make a person, thank you very much.

ffs. The root of the problem isn't that AIs might try to turn their light cone into paperclips. It's that if they did, they might succeed.

Lots of crazy people try lots of things. And---crucially---they fail.
