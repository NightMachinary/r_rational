Nothing? I mean, Zorian completely changed his behavior, started skipping classes, and fortov (or one of his simulcrums if he was Red Robe) was still there pushing that girl in the Ivy then looking for Zorian. He would see the difference in Zorian's behavior from the first time Zorian wasn't at school. After years of seeing the exact same action over and over, it would be beyond obvious the first time Zorian wasn't there or had some new way of curing the ivy etc.
