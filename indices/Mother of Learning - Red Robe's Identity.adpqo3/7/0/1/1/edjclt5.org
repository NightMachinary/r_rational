Zorian himself admits that the time loops are variable. It's conceivable that in some time loops Zorian was with his friends, or studying somewhere, or eating at a restaurant, or what have you when Fortov came to his room. Since Fortov doesn't really care about finding his brother that much, he gives up if Zorian isn't in his room. Fortov wouldn't investigate to see why Zorian wasn't in his room, just that the door was locked and Zorian wasn't there.
