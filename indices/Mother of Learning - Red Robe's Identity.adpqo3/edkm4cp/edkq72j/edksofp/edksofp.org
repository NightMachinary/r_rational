I understand your point. Jornak wouldn't have the same emotional impact as someone closer to Zorian. I'm not sure if the author though would weigh that as a consideration. Out of all the "close" people to Zorian, I agree that Fortov would be most likely.

I think Fortov has weak motive, but I was struggling to come up with any at all before and your guess at it stemming from his frustration is plausible.
