Very possible. However, as I said in my post, I'm looking for the characters who when revealed will have the most emotional impact and positive shock value. Usually in a mystery story, the villain is revealed to be someone close to the protagonist, so going solely off literary tropes Fortov is a very likely candidate. However, there is no reason Nobody103 can't make Red Robe a minor character. I am just assuming that Red Robe will be somebody Zorian knows and has close connection to, since that will make for the best reveal from a reader's perspective.
