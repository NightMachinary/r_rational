Fortov also didn't immediately kill/soul kill Zorian when he had him on the ropes in the araenea cave. Redrobe/Fortov instead was monologing to Zorian saying how Zach was useless after so many years in the time loop. Why would he waste time monologing? Only reason is that he recognized Zorian as his brother and did not want to kill him. I believe Zorian did not wear a mask that day. Red robe also had a past history/ties with the araenea. Maybe he was introduced to them after trying to figure out what happened to Zorian in the dungeon when he went with tavien for the first time. We all know fortov cares about zorian since he was about to confront zach punching zorian in the train station.
