Huh? I didn't ask why the invaders might /want/ to exterminate the Araneae, I asked for the evidence that they were actually doing it. Obviously the Matriarch would need to be on the side of the invaders to learn how to best free the primordial to fulfill the Bargain.

As a sidenote... here's a fun line from Chapter 19 that would be interpreted in a new light: "It was nice to have someone on his side in this whole tangled mess. /He just hoped he wasn't making the same mistake with the araneae that Zach made with the person behind the invasion./"

Edit: Doing a little more reading though, it is quite clear it is not them. It has just been too long since I read the beginning.
