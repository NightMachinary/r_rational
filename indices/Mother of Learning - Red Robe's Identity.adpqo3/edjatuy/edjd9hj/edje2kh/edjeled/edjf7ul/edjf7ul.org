A genocidal campaign seems a bit strong, I don't recall any hard clad evidence of a genocidal campaign against the Araneae. Just random encounters as the invaders try to accomplish their goals of summoning the primordial. Not that it would matter too much anyway since if you know you are in a loop it might not matter much to you. She would have to help the invasion just so she would know how to free the primordial as part of the deal for escaping the loop.

As for why help Zorian.. that would be the main question. Perhaps she has some use for him that will become more obvious as time goes on. But probably not, just an idea that wasn't explored.
