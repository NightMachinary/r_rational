I think readers would find it convoluted. The Araneae taking a potion to turn into a human would be like Taiven taking a potion to turn herself into a man. Both just wouldn't work well as an answer to the mystery that's been sewn throughout the story. Readers would honestly just find it weird. I'm trying to find the characters, who when revealed to be Red Robe, will make us go "Holy Shit!!!", not "Huh?".
