Hmmmm. What Reason would motivate Zach to do this then, in your theory?

I still think it's unlikely. I can't see any motivation for Zach to string Zorian along for 40 chapters as a friend, and then kill him. Or to summon a Primordial. Plus it's heavily implied that Zorian read Zach's mind in chapter 90, since he figured out how to get past a mind blank. He surely would have noticed if Zach was Red Robe when reading his mind.

The best friend betraying you can be a good plot twist, but only if it makes sense and the betrayal has a strong motive. If it just comes out of nowhere it usually makes a shit plot twist.
