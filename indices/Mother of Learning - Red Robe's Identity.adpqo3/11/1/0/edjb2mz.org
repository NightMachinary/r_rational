Two options, no one did, Panaxeth lied because he knew Zorian thought someone had left and the Guardian was fooled somehow. Or it was someone else that Zach sent, a cultist or someone.

Edit: Maybe it was Veyers. Maybe Zach became friends with him or even managed to make him a temporary looper and then didn't want him to die so he figured out a way to send him out of the loop.
