I don't think he has a grand plan, he just wants some specific thing. He does like Zorian and actually wants to be his friend, he isn't stringing him along. But he thinks that whatever he wants isn't something Zorian would want, so he started hiding it from him at the very beginning and it's just snowballed from there.

I don't know what it is he wants, but I don't think it's summoning the primordial.

Fairly sure he hasn't read Zach's mind. He figured out how to get past the mind blank since he's suspicious Zach is up to something and wants an ace up his sleeve. But he's not going to just use it unprovoked.

It's not completely out of nowhere, we've already had some fairly strong hints that Zach is hiding a big secret. The circumstances of Zach entering the time loop in the first place, Zach not wanting Zorian to read his mind, Zach going into an angry rage after the final talk with Panaxeth that prompted Zorian to figure out the mind blank thing. And IMO, the flimsy memory loss story.
