Simulacra don't have souls, which is the only thing the gate sends back to the beginning of the loop. There is no foreshadowing whatsoever to support this getting overturned; if anything, the story has been pretty consistent that souls are divine, incredibly resistant to being paired up with anything other than their original body, and integral to one's personality and mind. Not sure how this SimulZach stays and plays, especially since Panaxeth is skilled with flesh, not ectoplasmic constructs.

I agree that Fortov would be a big letdown that requires a bunch of characters to pass around the idiot ball, but I think you can get that personal connection still. I think the answer is the one you think is impossible: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aazrb6/a_final_rr_theory_spoilers_through_93/][an earlier version of Zorian is RR]].
