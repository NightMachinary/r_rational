So, because I dislike discussing MoL outside its chapter release date, I opened this thread late. Regardless, I'd like to point out, Fortov as RedRobe is awful awful theory. Just take note on what he did before Arc 1's end.

1. Fortov were doing music on early festival night. Was it violin? I don't remember.
2. Fortov always asked Zorian for creeper salves. Always.
3. Fortov attended class to explain Ibery developing crush. Won't he be bored if he was RR?
4. Fortov always hung out by his friend before going with train to Cyoria. Again, won't he be bored?

Fortov as RedRobe was [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s running joke failed to get caught. Please abandon ship. Boranova spirit ancestor theory is much better theory.
