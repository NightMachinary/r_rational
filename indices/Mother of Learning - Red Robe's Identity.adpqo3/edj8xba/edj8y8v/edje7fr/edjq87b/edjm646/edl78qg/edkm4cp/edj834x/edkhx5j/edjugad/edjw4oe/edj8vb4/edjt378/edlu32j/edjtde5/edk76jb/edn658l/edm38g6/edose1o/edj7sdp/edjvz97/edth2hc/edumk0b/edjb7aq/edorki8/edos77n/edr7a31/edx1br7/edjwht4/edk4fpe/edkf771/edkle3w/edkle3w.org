I am wondering what you think about Zorian being Red Robe.

The Soul Merge thing is very suspicious from the beginning, this is why I think it awoke Zorian not transplanted the soul tag.

Zorian somehow did a super simulacrum and boom RR.

I was wondering if you think that a Zorian Sim (or something) that went down a darker more teenager angsty path instead of fixing his mind magic like he had to in the beginning, makes ANY literary sense?
