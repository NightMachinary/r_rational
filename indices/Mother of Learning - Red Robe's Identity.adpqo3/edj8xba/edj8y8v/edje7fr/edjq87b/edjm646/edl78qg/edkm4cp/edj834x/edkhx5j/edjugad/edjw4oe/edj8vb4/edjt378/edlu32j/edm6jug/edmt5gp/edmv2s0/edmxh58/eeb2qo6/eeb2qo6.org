Maybe, but for all we know soul blend is the more damaging.

After all, soul blend is effectively single target, while soul explosion is AOE.

We also know that Z+Z were not in center of the explosion, and that Zorian restarting when he did saved them from some of the damage. He flat out tells us so.
