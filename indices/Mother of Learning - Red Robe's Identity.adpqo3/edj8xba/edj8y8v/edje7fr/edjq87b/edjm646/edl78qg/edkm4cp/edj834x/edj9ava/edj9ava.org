But that's the thing, Zorian has consistently hated him, so everytime they interact, Zorian shows scorn to him and tries to get Fortov to leave him alone. Plus, up until the very last 2-3 time loops, Red Robe thinks the only other Time looper is Zach. Fortov wouldn't be on the lookout for strange behavior from his brother, and plus everytime Zorian and Fortov interact, Zorian has the same reaction, "Fuck off". They barely interact, and the interactions the brothers did have stayed consistent even after the time loop started. Fortov would not find anything Zorian did suspicious.
