I dont think there is a satisfying way to explain how sudomir finds out about the time loop.

And doesn't Zack need to take them to the gate for the primordial to make it's offer?

I only see Zack trusting and getting betrayed by a classmate.

The soul marker is divine energy so probably even sudomir cannot alter it himself.
