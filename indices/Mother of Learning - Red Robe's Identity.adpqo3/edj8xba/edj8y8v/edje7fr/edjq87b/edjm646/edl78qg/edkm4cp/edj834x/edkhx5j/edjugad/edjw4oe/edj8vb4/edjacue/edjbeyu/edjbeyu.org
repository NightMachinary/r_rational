I think it's more complicated than that. I do think there was someone else who was Red Robe, but they weren't included in the loop, or were a regular temporary looper. I think Zach was the one who orchestrated it and if there was someone else who left before, it was because he intentionally helped them.

I do think he has a good reason and he won't just be "the bad guy who wants everyone to die". The finale will be Zorian figuring everything out, besting Zach, but then sparing him because he actually had a good reason.
