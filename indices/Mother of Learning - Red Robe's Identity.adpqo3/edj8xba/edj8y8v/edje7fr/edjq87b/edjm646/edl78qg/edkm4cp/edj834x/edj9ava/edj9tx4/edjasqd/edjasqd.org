Zorian did not start skipping school until after Red Robe left the time loop. If Red Robe is Fortov, then Fortov would have just reverted to his previous self. Plus, Fortov or his simulacrum never looked very hard for Zorian if he couldn't find him. Zorian states that the time loop never repeated itself perfectly, except for Fortov pushing the girl into the Ivy, which could be seen as suspicious. But anyways, it wouldn't be impossible for Zorian to be hanging out with friends and doing something out somewhere, making fortov unable to find him.
