Besides the simulacrum theory(which I think I originated 2-3 years ago) and maybe Damien being involved somehow and thus validating Zorian's dislike, I think the option I like best is that Veyers' family attempt to activate his bloodline resulted in him being possessed by a demon, who somehow managed to get into the loop. The demon then gets a marker somehow, and gets its own body through the aid of Panaxeth, and the rest is backstory.
