Here's one you don't mention as a possibility: An Araneae. If the Matriarch was really Red Robe that could be satisfying. She has the prerequisite mind magic abilities to f with Zach, picks up on the loop thing pretty quick with Zorian, uses Zorian and his information incredibly effectively.. It is touched on that there are potions that can transfigure you between species, so she could easily have investigated such things to transform and learn human magic over her many years in the loop, and learned simulcrum and all that.....

Also, her clues that she left seemed unnecessarily not very helpful and very difficult to follow.
