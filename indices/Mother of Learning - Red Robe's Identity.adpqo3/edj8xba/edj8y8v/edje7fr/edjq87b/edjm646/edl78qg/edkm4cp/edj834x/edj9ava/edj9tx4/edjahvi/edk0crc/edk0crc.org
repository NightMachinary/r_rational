Just Kirielle herself is too big of a change. For god knows how many loops it never happened, than suddenly Zorian takes her. They take the same train, how would Fortov miss that? Not to mention it is so close to the beginning of the restart there's hardly any excuse for some other factor causing Zorian to change his mind.
