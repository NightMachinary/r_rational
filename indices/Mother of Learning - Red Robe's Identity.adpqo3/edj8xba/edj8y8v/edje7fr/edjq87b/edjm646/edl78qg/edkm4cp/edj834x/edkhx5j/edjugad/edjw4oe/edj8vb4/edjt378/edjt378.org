Zach is like a token evil friend red herring, that causes discussion but falls apart under inspection (when the author is good, which we accept as a given).

There's definitely something screwy with his mind though, which is why he won't let Zorian examine it, and is so paranoid about it.

My theory is that Fortov learned some structured mind magic, including a memory erasure spell, a compulsion spell, and probably a bunch others. He definitely did something with those cranium rats, but I think it's unlikely they taught him, like the Aranea did Zorian. It's probably more like a dark mirror, but since Fortov's incompetent and skeeves off of others, there was probably some mind mage in control of the cranium rats which RR usurped, in a way similar to that evil soul mage who I can't remember. Also, wasn't there that one girl who's family did mind magic and was interested in the Aranea? Definitely a hint there.

In any case, Fortov probably got close to Zach and betrayed him. I feel like they're both extroverts who might be friends given the right circumstances, and since Zach went around trying to be friends with everyone at least once among all the loops, it's likely they'd be friends. I could see Zach giving him the temporary marker several times, until they figured out how to make it permanent. (Though is there a point in the fic supporting this part? Did Zach have instinctual reactions to the temporary marker when brought up?)

Once it was permenent, they probably +partied a lot+ got practical experience and investigated the other side until Fortov betrayed Zach.

--------------

Though, I've suddenly had an idea of a modification of this theory, so that Fortov's journey better mirrors Zorian's, with the theme of Fortov being parasite on others in comparison to Zorian.

Fortov became friends with Zach, but keeps forgetting each month, causing Zach to find the thing to get him a temporary marker. Not sure if Fortov would join him on this journey, though, but Zach did have that thing toward the beginning about figuring out how to make everyone a badass when he became friends with them.

Once he got the temporary marker they probably wanted to figure out how to make it permanent. Since he knew he was going to die unless it was made permenent, he was probably willing to do a lot. The best know soul mage he knew of was probably QI, and tbh, I bet he had more connections to the cult than Zorian, so he probably decided he could "sacrifice himself," and infiltrate them. He's kinda cowardly, so I bet he was fine joining them as the winning team, and learned enough from QI or other associated soul mages to make his marker permanent.

Then, after leaching off others enough, he betrayed Zach so he didn't have to constantly deal with him. The mage controlling the cranial rats probably worked for the cult, so he probably learned his mind magic skills from them.

Then, he was free to do exactly what Zorian speculated he could've done, apprentice to everyone under the sun and steal everyone's secrets. (Or was it the community who speculated that?)

Fortov's erasure of Zach's memories didn't even need to have a compulsion part. It could just be his subconscious feelings about things.

We're left around the start of the story: RR learning and preparing for leaving and Zach mentally regressed to a pre-Fortov state but powerful enough to be doing challenges like killing dragons instead of making friends with classmates. Who knows, maybe his simulcrum requesting-Zorian-for-help path was one meant to make sure he always avoided Zach, in addition to being incredibly consistent, in order to make sure Zach would never notice him. It's just the sort of thing he'd find boring and overlook: a too stable set of actions that doesn't seem to be affected by the butterfly effect.

Also, blah blah, setting up what's his name to be a decoy in case Zach ever tried to investigate him. Similar to Fortov, but not him, so any personality similarities would support the other guy. Also, didn't he have other connections to the cult? It makes him an even better decoy.

--------------

I may have gone a bit too far in coming up with justifications, but I haven't reread MoL recently, so I have no idea how justified it is. But, Fortov makes a ton of sense, and I'm wholeheartedly behind Fortov being RR.

Also, originally this was meant to be a response to another comment, but I decided to post as a top-level comment since it got off my original point. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
