Hereby the refutations;

1. Author has little discipline on how to call somebody. Maybe as a tactic to familiarize reader what's being talked about, but later on it became anny. Take Xvim Chao; it was never Mr Chao. Always Xvim.
2. No refutation. I write this because reddit can't skip number.
3. Same as above.
4. Estin required loose sand when he was training with Zorian. He might be able to move larger chunk of earth after much training. But, it should be visible for Zorian to take note.
