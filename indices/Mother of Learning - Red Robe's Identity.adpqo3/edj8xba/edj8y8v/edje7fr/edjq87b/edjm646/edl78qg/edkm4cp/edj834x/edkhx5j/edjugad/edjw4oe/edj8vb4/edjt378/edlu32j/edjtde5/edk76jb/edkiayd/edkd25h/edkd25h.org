During the fight between Zorian and Red Robe, Red Robe had the body of a man. It could still have been a girl that changed their sex with magic to hide their true identity, but that seems convoluted. Also someone else already mentioned how Fortov was not a natural mind mage to me, and I agree. This does not take away from the theory, since Fortov after Fortov learned his brother Damien was a mind mage, his Jealousy he tried to learn mind magic to outdo Damien. Except he sucked at it, and a half trained Zorian could overpower him.

Mind magic might also explain how Veyers fits into this. Fortov learned that Veyers activated a latent bloodline talent he had, so Fortov sought Veyers out to learn how to activate his own bloodline talent for mind magic.
