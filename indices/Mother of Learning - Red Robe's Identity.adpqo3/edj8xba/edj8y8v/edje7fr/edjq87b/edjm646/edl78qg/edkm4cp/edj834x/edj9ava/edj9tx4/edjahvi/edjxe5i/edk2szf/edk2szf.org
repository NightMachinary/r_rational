Chapter 4:

  "You always stay in your room and get killed in the initial barrage if I don't do something to stop it. And let me tell you, convincing you not to stay in your room without resorting to violence or getting Ilsa involved is a damn chore. You can really be a stubborn ass when you want to be," Zach said with a sigh.

But there may be a problem with the timeline on this hypothesis, because the relationship between Zach's attempts to save Zorian and Fortov's (presumed) attempts to save Zorian is unclear. The dance and the summer festival is on the Saturday. Fortov asks Zorian to make the salve on the Friday, after school, and Zorian says it will take about three hours (Ch 3). He finishes the salve on the Friday and heads to his room. On the Saturday, Zorian stays in his room and gets killed in the initial barrage, unless Zach or someone else arranges for him to leave.

I'm not sure how Fortov "saves" Zorian by occupying his time in the alchemy lab for three hours on the Friday.
