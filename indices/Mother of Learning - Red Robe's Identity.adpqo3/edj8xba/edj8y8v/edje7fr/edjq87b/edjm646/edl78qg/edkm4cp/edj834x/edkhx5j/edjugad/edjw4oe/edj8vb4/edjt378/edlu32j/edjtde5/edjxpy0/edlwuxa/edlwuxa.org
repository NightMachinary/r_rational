There's actually an established way to give a Simulacrum continuity between loops, and that's if a Simulacrum existed before the loop began.

We know the loop recreates everything including magic and souls, so the Simulcrum will have a persistent body to start the loop with. Simulacrums are confirmed to run off the original, which has the marker. The marker ensures the mind state of the attached individual is carried across, so the Simulacrum gets to keep their knowledge. Problem solved! Primordial gives the Simulacrum a copy of Zach's soul (probably minus the divine additions) and a body outside the loop.

We're good to go.
