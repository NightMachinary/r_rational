Fair. The problem is how do you get him to learn soul magic, and you can give whatever solution you want, but it adds complexity...

Wasn't Kael's whole thing that he had a bloodline that gives him this ability automatically? And the cult is already sacrificing people for their bloodlines (shifters). And he lives with Zorian in iterations where Zorian brings Kirielle to Cyoria.

I can see this as a very plausible way to get him Fortov soul sight. I've just started rereading the fic, and while Fortov is technically there at the beginning, he doesn't interact with Zorian. The mom is also pushing to get Zorian to take Kirielle. It's very plausible for a slight perturbance with Fortov to cause Zorian to take Kirielle as we normally see. Then, Fortov sacrifices Kael or something along those lines. It even fixes the question of why wouldn't a simulcrum Fortov standing in for his normal life wonder why Zorian brought Kirielle.

I'm even more convinced.
