The biggest flaw I see with Fortov as RR is it's hard for me to imagine how he gets into the gate and meets Panaxeth, which is literally the only way to talk to him. (Otherwise, why wouldn't it just tell QI, "hey, go fuck up this Zach kid and your invasion is gonna work.") Why would Zach ever bring him down there? And while you say RR is merely above average, he's skilled enough to cast multiple simulacra and managed to bypass some very serious soul defenses on Zach to even do the bit of mind magic he did.

As for me, I wrote up a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aazrb6/a_final_rr_theory_spoilers_through_93/][very long post]] along with a few medium-long comments about why I'm convinced Zorian is RR. I haven't seen much good evidence to the contrary, either.
