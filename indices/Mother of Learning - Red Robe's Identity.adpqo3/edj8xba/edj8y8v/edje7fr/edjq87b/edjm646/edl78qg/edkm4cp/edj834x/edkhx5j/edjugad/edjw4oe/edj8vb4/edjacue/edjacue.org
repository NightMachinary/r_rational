Not really possible, it is too convoluted. Plus we know someone left the timeloop before Zach. At best it may be a simulacrum of Zach, which many readers have tried to push as a theory, but I'm skeptical of it. It simply wouldn't be that good of a reveal. Part of the reason this story is so good is how well it handles the mystery in it. Revealing the main villain to be basically "Evil Zach" would be, I think, lame. And I suspect that many other readers would feel the same way.
