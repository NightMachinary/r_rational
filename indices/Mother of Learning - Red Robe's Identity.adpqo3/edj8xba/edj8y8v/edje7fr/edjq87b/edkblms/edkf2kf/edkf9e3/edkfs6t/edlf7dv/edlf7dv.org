The first restart Zach was back to school after the coma, he was feeling sick, and was sent home by Ilsa. If the damage to Zorian's soul was enough to leave him in a coma for some restarts, he should have noticed the moment he woke up. He probably would have awoken feeling ill and at a diferent time of the day (or a diferent day), like he did after being caught in QI's suicide attack. No idea why merging his soul with Zach's does not cause enough damage to be felt by Zorian though.
