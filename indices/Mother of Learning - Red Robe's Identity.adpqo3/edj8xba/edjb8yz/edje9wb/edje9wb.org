Maybe he just told a simulacrum to do it every time to keep up appearances and then, because he's a shit mage, doesn't get a report from it before the end of the loop, so every single time it goes into the last class not knowing what to expect and every single time it tries to avoid her with the purple creepers and yeah you get the point.

Hell, if Fortov never bothered to learn alchemy better, it's entirely possible he never learned to make the healing salve himself! We also know that simulacrums can develop their own priorities, and feeling bad about hurting her would be exactly in character and irresponsible enough for a simulacrum to actually try and help with.
