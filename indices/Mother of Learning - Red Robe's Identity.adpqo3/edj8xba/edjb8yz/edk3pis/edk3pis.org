The creeper patch incident could actually be supporting evidence of the Fortov as RR theory. Zach masterminded sending Zorian to the dance so he wouldn't be at his apartment where he is killed at the end of the month. Maybe making a potion puts a non-looping Zorian on a path where he survives the attack on Cyoria. It would be an action done repeatedly out of love by Fortov, even if he doesn't get along with his brother.

Of course, this all falls apart if Fortov continued to push the girl after RR departed the time loop.
