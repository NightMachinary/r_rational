That's pretty interesting actually. There would be poetic irony in their relationship, as you pointed out.

The creeper patch is also interesting, because it is the only thing in the time loop that happens regularly. Nothing else does. Zorian specifically says this in one of the chapters, that all of the time loops follow the same general format, but there is a large amount of variability by the end of the month. Except for the creeper patch incident, which always happened at the end of the month. This of course doesn't explain why Fortov would seek Zorian out for a potion to cure the girl of the rash, however. It still is interesting though.
