The purple creeper incident is a really round-about way to remove Zorian from his room, and it does little to guarantee that he'll still be out of his room when the artillery spell hits during the invasion. RR by the time of encountering Zorian is already proficient enough with mind magic to screw with Zach's mind, so I find it difficult to believe he couldn't just mind magic Zorian into leaving his room.

RR presumably leaves the invasion pretty close to Chapter 26. He kills the aranea, encounters Zorian, realized that there is at least one more unknown mind magic proficient looper, and immediately leaves the loop.

Fortov also seems a poor choice for someone to learn enough magic within 6 loops to make an alliance with the lich and learn how to jail-break his marker. And he doesn't really offer anything to Zach to warrant a temporary marker.
