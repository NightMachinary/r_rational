The quoted texts are really convincing.

So if RR = Fortov, then * before the story begins, Fortov was looping but unaware of it, and was pushing Ibery into a purple patch, was probably failing to convince Zorian to make a salve, and Zorian died. At least, that must have been happening whenever there was no interference from Zach. * before the story begins, Fortov goes through a loop that he will end up remembering, but, because he is not yet aware he is in a loop, he pushes Ibery into a purple patch and fails to convince Zorian to make the salve, like usual. However, this time, Fortov remembers. * still before the story begins, Fortov is now looping and aware that Zorian will die in his room if he and/or Zach don't do something about it, and starts refining his excuses to convince Zorian to leave his room. This is also the situation when the story begins. * when the story begins, Fortov is looping and is going out of his way to push Ibery into a purple patch to save Zorian from the bombing, despite changes to the loop by Zach and/or Zorian. Also, Fortov does not seek out Zorian when Zorian is not in danger from the bombing. This is the behaviour that Zorian observes. * RR leaves the loop somewhere before chapter 54, presumably quite a long time before chapter 51. * Looping Fortov 'reverts' to his old self somewhere before chapter 54, but there are no purple patch interactions with Zorian because Zorian is either at Imaya's or not in Cyoria most of the time * In chapter 75, Zorian allows another purple patch interaction to happen by accidentally being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is the only interaction with the "original" non-loop-aware Fortov in the book. Zorian is predisposed to interpret this behaviour as consistent with the other repetitions he observed, when in fact, it is not.

The big question is this theory is: why doesn't Fortov become aware that Zorian is looping, or if he does, why doesn't he confront Zorian about it? But I'd have to reread it to figure out how 'early' RR actually left the loop and whether this question is a plot hole or not.
