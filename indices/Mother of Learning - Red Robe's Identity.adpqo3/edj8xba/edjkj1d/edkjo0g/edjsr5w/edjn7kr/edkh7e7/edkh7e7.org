Goddamn, this is awesome.

You know, I'm realizing Zorian really started showing his newly developed empathy (non-magical) for others in that interlude with Ivery in Ch 9 (where he analyzes her word choice to realize how important it is to her).

It'd be quite fitting in a literary sense for Fortov/Zorian to diverge in their character development from a semi-common origin...
