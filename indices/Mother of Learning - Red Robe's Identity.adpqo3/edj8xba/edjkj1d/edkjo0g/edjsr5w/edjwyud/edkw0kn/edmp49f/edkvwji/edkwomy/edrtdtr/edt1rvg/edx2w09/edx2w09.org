No, because he's not trying to get Zorian outside of his room on the actual day of the invasion. During the festival itself is too late; he tries to get Zorian to make him a salve a day or two before that, so that Ibery has enough time to recover from the effects of the purple creeper patch and to find a date. On the day of the invasion itself, he never tried to interact with Zorian. Plus, without Red Robe's involvement, the student dormitories are never even targeted in the first place and the invasion is nowhere near as successful at bypassing the Academy's wards.

It just doesn't make sense for Fortov to do this this way, if he's supposedly Red Robe trying to save his brother.
