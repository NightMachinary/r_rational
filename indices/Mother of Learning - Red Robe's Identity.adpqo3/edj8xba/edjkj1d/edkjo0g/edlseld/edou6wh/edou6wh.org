Wait, how is that evidence of a discrepancy?

For starters, he's lying about more than Ibery's crush, he doesn't explain anything about the situation. Which is a lot more complicated than the story he tells Zorian: he literally took the worst assignment to run away from a girl, and then adds injury to insult when he pushes her in the creeper patch. He clearly doesn't outright dislike her---otherwise why not just crush her heart?

Since we know he doesn't hate her, it shouldn't be surprising he tells a white lie to Zorian, which renders her completely blameless. And since Zorian's always ready to believe the worst about his brother, he doesn't question it.

Plus, there are bigger problems. How does Fortov get introduced to Panaxeth? Why would Zach take him down to the gate in the first place? Why would Fortov purposefully aim artillery magic at Zorian's dorm? What reason does Fortov even have to join up with Panaxeth, especially since his entire problem is his lack of work ethic?
