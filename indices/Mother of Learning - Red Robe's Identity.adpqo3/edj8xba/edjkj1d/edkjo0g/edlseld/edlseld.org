The difficulty is that the part of the social situation that Fortov is lying about is not the embarrassing part.

He always candidly admits to pushing Ibery into the purple creeper patch. That's the embarrassing part. What he lies about is Ibery's crush. In Ch 3, he says that she has a crush on someone else ("this boy") and that he urgently needs Zorian to make a salve immediately else she'll never forgive him. In Ch 75, he says that he pushed her into the patch because she has a crush on him (Fortov) and he couldn't otherwise deter her.

Zorian concludes from his own observations that Ibery really does have a massive crush on Fortov, so the falsehood is probably what Fortov said in Ch 3 rather than what he said in Ch 75, and the former took place when RR was still in the loop.

The proposition that Fortov and Ibery were just normal students whose daily lives were mostly unaffected by the other changes in the loop does not explain the discrepancy between Fortov's behaviour in Ch 3 and his behaviour in Ch 75.
