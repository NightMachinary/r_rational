I made a thread in mother of learning subreddit here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/aeo7f8/just_bingeread_94_chapters_and_came_here_with_my/]], but here's my own theory.

TLDR: I think Red Robe is Estin Grier. He's a classmate of Zach's and an immigrant from Ulquaan Ibasa (and therefore okay with watching Cyoria invaded and friends with Quatach-Ichl). He can block projectiles with earth magic, which is useful in doing things like stopping point-blank bullets. And his size/strength match too. Zorian suspected that RR was Estin early on, and I never saw a reason he decided Estin wasn't Red Robe that made sense (but I might have missed something!).

Additional explanations/reasons/thoughts:

1. *RR is a classmate of Zach's.* Whomever RR turns out to be, I'm pretty confident that Red Robe is a classmate of Zach. First, he literally calls him "Zach" (something a classmate is far more likely to do than a random noble/lawyer) and recognizes him on sight. Second, Zach repeatedly told Zorian that he tried to clue in his classmates about the time loop. It just seems far more likely that one of Zach's classmates would have believed him and could have taken advantage of Zach if said classmate had access to soul magic as a necromancer (with family members from Ulquaan Ibasa)-- Estin checks off a lot of boxes.

2. *Okay with invasion and ties to allegiance with Quatach-Ichl and Lady Zoltan.* Seems like RR never explained the time loop to QI (or else he would have risked the Lich taking the marker for himself). How, then, did RR earn QI's and Lady Zoltan's trust? Even for them to believe in his advice, he needed something. Granted, maybe he was strong and could tell them about the invasion ahead of time, but I think he would need some introduction or connection to Ulquaan Ibasa. Estin's family members are from there. Plus, as an immigrant from Ulquaan Ibasa, he was probably okay with the whole invasion/destruction plot. He checks both boxes here.

3. *Soul magic/mind magic.* All of RR's current powers/magic can be explained away with the time loop. But the thing about RR is that in the very first loop where he learns about the time loop from Zach, and before RR accumulated power/knowledge via the loop, RR would still need to be able to do something to the temporary marker/Zach's mind right away. Both soul and mind magic are rare and it doesn't seem like your average classmate would know any. Unless, of course, they were from a land of necromancers. Like Estin.

4. *Stopping bullets* This a bit more tenuous, since RR could have gained almost any power that explains how he stopped Zorian's bullets. But Zorian emptied an entire chamber into RR from near point-blank range. He was certain that he landed the shots. Estin's primary defense is earth magic and the one thing we know from his skirmishes is that he's naturally adept at stopping projectiles near instantaneously. This makes sense too.

5. *Soul killing Veyers.* Again, it would be someone with a grudge or a lot of interaction with Veyers. Makes me think it's a student/classmate (this one is tenuous, though, and a lot of people fit here)

Anyway, those are my immediate thoughts and I haven't seen this put forward before. I'd be interested to hear any comments supporting/disproving the "RR is Estin" theory.
