...The thing that gets me is, this invasion-and-summoning thing was planned way in advance, like before the time loops started. In fact the time loops were initiated early, on purpose, so that the end of the time loop would coincide with Panaxeth Day. That makes me think that Red Robe was in this from the start, and that something about Zach's bloodline meant that he had to be the "official" looper, but Red Robe had a plan to become a looper before the loop even began.

​

We also think Red Robe has a way to get access to the Imperial Dagger.

​

So: who has high-up Empire connections but also wants to completely wreck the Empire by summoning Panaxeth? I dunno. Probably not someone we've met. It seems like mind-interrogating all the people who were studying the Gate might have been pretty fruitful -- see what they know about what happened on the night the loops started. It's too late now though.
