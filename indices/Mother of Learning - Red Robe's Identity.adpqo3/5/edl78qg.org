Personally, I think fortov is gay or transgender, and thus uncomfortable with her advances ergo pushed her in the patch.

It has been long hinted that he has his own troubles, and in ch 76 daimen said  "All this dancing around and refusing to say what's bothering you, I almost thought you had turned into a woman while I wasn't looking."

Which angered him a lot.

Red Robe is sudomir. Nothing that has come out has changed my opinion about this. Here is my previous argument of red robe is sudomir. I'm not gonna beat a dead horse, but if anyone has arguments against it, come at me bro~

  He likes monologuing just like red robe. Also, when zorian fought red robe he was shocked by none of the attacks phasing him at all; if he was a simulacrum, he would have been dispelled if he was damaged; but sudomir has his freaky shift thing! That's why being shot didn't affect him.

  He is the only cultist with detailed list of cult supporters that distanced themselves from the cult (lawyers and judges ect.). He also has a lot of experience with shifter/blood magics so it would make sense that vayers would seek him out. He has a relatively spotless reputation if you don't find his murder mansion, so Zach could have gotten taken in when trying to help vayers! Because he's a member of the cult, he likely has a red robe on hand as well~

  Zorian had noted that red robe seems to give the info to the invaders and then not pay any attention to the invasion,,, BECAUSE HE HAS OTHER STUFF TO DO! At his mansion!

  It's well known that sudomir and the invaders have a touchy working relationship which fits with the dialogue between red robe and the lich.

  And last, but most importantly, HIS WIFE NEED A BODY!!! And who is making bodies left and right right now?
