First Fortov is NOT a natural mind mage (he has a non-awakened bloodline and need a special ritual to unlock it), Also red robe is NOT a natural mind mage too. The attack he performed on zorian with unstructured mind magic was really crude and that the mark of people working hard on the skill without having the related talent. Zorian felt the same with soul sight for example. Fortov is likely to be red robe tho, even if there is some big flaws with that theory.

Apart from him the other satisfying red robe candidates are: -ibery, the girl with a crush on Fortov who is not a classmate of Zach and zorian but could be contacted on another way by Zach. She has been portrayed as self-centered and a little crazy about her love on fortov. Red robe could be a girl after all, I see nowhere a proof he is a man

-naim, the martial art guy. Zorian don't know him enough and he is probably one of those Zach tried to convince first of the time loop

- the classmate whose family originate from ulquan ibasa. He was tested AFTER RR left and is likely to be trusted by quatach ichl relatively quickly.

-the lawyer

-the old linguist teacher. Zorian think the rats are the reason he got knifed in one of the first restarts but the guy could be red robe simulacrum. After all zorian questioned him AFTER red robe left the time loop. Also, the man appeared in the first few chapters a lot and he spend a lot of time doing work alone in his office. Readers don't seem to suspect him too and would completely surprise anyone not reading my comment xD

-the director never named or a royal. The reveal would not be as satisfying than a classmate but that would severely complicate the fight and would compromise their identity, leading to much drama. That would also force zorian to get closer of the political factions and maybe create a House,something he hates. Not likely after the reveal of zorian research goal this chapter but was my number 1 supposition of what the endgame would look like until now.
