I doubt Fortov would be unaware of Kirelle going to Cyoria with Zorian, and such a massive departure from the norm on the very first day of the restart should have made Fortov extremely suspicious. I wouldn't be surprised if Fortov was Red Robe, but I doubt it.

Given all the other things that have been done with magic, I don't think concealing Red Robe's actual gender with magic is such a stretch. I'd agree that Taiven is likely out (isn't she missing presumed dead for most of the early restarts?), as is Xvim. Raynie seems like a bit of a stretch (shifter), but she is pretty scarce in the story until after Red Robe left the loop. Tinami Aope has info about spiders and familial access to mind magic, but her interactions with Zorian in the chapters immediately preceding Red Robe's departure make her an unlikely suspect.

Edit- Also, why would Zach ever place a temporary marker on Fortov?
