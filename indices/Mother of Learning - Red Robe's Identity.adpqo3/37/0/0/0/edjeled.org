It makes no sense for many different reasons. She would have immediately mind-raped Zorian when he came to them revealing his time looping nature, she literally has him at her mercy the first time the Matriarch meets him, Zorian explicitly points out she could have screwed him over with nothing to stop her.

Also, why the hell would she sabotage her own invasion just to sell the deception to Zorian? It goes back to the above why help Zorian at all.

Finally, why on Domagoj would they help the invaders who /are currently engaged in a genocidal campaign to exterminate them!?!/

Finally, her clues are very helpful from her perspective. They're very hard for him to accidentally pick up if she doesn't want him to, and simultaneously easy to access if she leaves the time loop.
