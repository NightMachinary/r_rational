Does nobody else think the lawyer Jornak is a likely contender?

- Zach, after finding out about Tesen's betrayal, seeks out help. Out of desperation, he connects with Veyers who leads him to Jornak, who has a history of helping downtrodden scions.

- Jornak is already connected with the Cult of the Dragon Below, and thus has knowledge of the red robes, some skills as a mage, access to QI, and motive for the invasion to succeed.

- Jornak messes with Zach's mind & memory, soulkills Veyers to hide the link, and after he exists the loop, ZZ find his reset soul confused as to why there's a dead Veyers in his basement.
