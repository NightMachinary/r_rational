You have basically thrown all rationality out of the window and decided to go with what is emotionally most satisfying...

But there is no logical way for Fortov to get caught up in the time loop. I really cannot see how it could be him.

Meanwhile you have said that Benisek is weak and stupid. Where did you get that impression? We know he is a huge gossip, but not much else.

I actually think Benisek is RR. It was too suspicious in ch94 that he knew of the killings and that he was asking when Z and Z got so friendly.
