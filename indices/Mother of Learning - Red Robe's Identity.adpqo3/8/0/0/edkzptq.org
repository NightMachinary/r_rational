I mean, it's not necessarily /him/ who controls them but it could be his family. The fact that there are multiple swarms of rats suggests that there could be one person in charge of each of them.

Plus it's possible he can control them whenever he wants, but most of the time they act independantly, just following global orders.

But even if it's not direct control, I really think the rats have a connection with RR. There's no reason to have dragged the revelation about them for so long otherwise, and it would give RR the right connections to be at the same time someone we know and someone who has enough credibility to be able to negotiate with QI so rapidly.
