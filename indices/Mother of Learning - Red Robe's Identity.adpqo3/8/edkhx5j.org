I think it's unlikely that Fortov is RR. There are just too many inconsistencies with him being RR, and he has no reason to want to destroy Cyora and summon a Primordial.

As for the identity of RR, I think it is closely linked to one of the other big mystery of the series: why are the Cranium Rats working for the Ibasan invasion forces ? Zorian tried to deal the answer out of QI, but QI deemed it a secret important enough not to tell it.

Think about it: Cranium Rats are magical creatures who use mind magic. Plus they remind me of the bees of the Taramatula family. I think it's likely that whoever RR is, he has a innate ability to control the Cranium Rats. It actually checkd up as all evidence points towards RR being part of the invasion since before the month began, plus he has enough influence to be able to negotiate with QI very soon in the month.

If RR does control the Cranium Rats, then it reduces the list of candidates a lot.

A person who is likely to have this ability is Tinami Aope. The matriarch already checked her but after she did so she also mentioned the possibility that her mind was just a fake construct. RR's mind magic wasn't very good, but constructing false minds for yourself could be a secret technique of the Aope family, or maybe she used the Cranium Rats to achieve that feat.
