I can't really remember it very well, but RR was never one, and neither was Fortov.

I vaguely remember their battle after RR killed the Aranea, and when RR mentally attacked Zorian, it came across as a structured spell, like Xvim's defenses, which was why Zorian was able to counter it so easily.

I really need to do a reread of the book.
