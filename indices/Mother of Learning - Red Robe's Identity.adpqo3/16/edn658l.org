There are two things about RR that I think are clues that constrain the space of who he could possibly be really strongly.

1. RR was able to get the Imperial Dagger from the Eldemarian royal vault without causing a nationwide manhunt (because Zorian would have heard about it, and didn't), like Zach, Zorian, and QI did. Now, it could be the case that he initially made it in with the help of QI, then figured out a silent way in that he could perform solo, but that seems like a tall order. If he couldn't steal it by breaking into the vault, that means he had help on the inside (or is an insider himself). I think that leaves us with two distinct possibilities: First, that he's a high ranking member of the central government (possibly even a royal), who has legitimate access to the vault, if not the authority to take the dagger out, and second, that the angels arranged a way for the Controller to get the Dagger in the time loop, like with the sulrothum and the ring, one which RR is somehow aware of. That leaves three further sub-possibilities: that RR is the real loop controller and Zach was in fact an anomaly, that RR stumbled onto this method of getting the Dagger like ZZ stumbled onto asking for the Ring, and that Zach originally knew about it (and probably the Sulrothum) but had the information ripped from his mind when a mind mage got him before the story began.

Of those four, I think that "high-ranking member of the government" and :stole the knowledge from Zach" are most plausible.

1. The second element that I think is an important clue is that RR somehow got major access to Zach's mind at some point in time. This implies that either RR managed to subdue Zach (which would be ridiculously hard even in the best circumstances), or Zach willingly let RR into his mind. This seems crazy, given his paranoia about giving the same to Zorian, but that paranoia is both partially compulsion based, likely implanted by RR to avoid his work being discovered, and partially based on his having lost memories in the past, which is also probably this incident. If this is the case, RR was someone who Zach came to trust implicitly. Then Zach felt the need to let a mind mage into his head, and RR betrayed him utterly. I have a theory on why Zach might have let RR in, but I want to back up and theorize a little more on that.

The fact that the angels left a way for the Controller to obtain the Ring without fighting suggests that they might have done the same for the other key pieces. It's entirely plausible that they could give a reasonable amount of information to the Controller before entering the loop about how to use their contingencies to access all 5 artifacts even early on in the loop, by suggesting to them a method of travel and how to use it (Bakora gates are a candidate), the locations of each key piece, and a set of passwords for the dragon, QI (a stretch that he'd willingly give the crown away, but he has to have done so for RR to ever have had a temporary marker), and the Eldemarian royal family. If that's the case, early!Zach would have had access to all 5 key pieces, and probably also basic knowledge of how to work his marker, including the reset switch. This also means that early!Zach could have known about Panaxeth.

I think that this lets us sketch a vague possibility for how RR came to be a permanent looper working to free Panaxeth.

Step the first: Zach starts looping with a fair chunk of knowledge given by the angels so that he understands what he's doing, why, and how the loop works. This is when he receives his divine blessing. He has access to all 5 key pieces thanks to what the angels have told him, and knows their loop functions.

Step the second: Panaxeth contacts Zach and tries to convince him to let him go free, Zach refuses. Because Zach is the real Controller, Panaxeth can't or won't do anything more blatant to hinder him, so it starts to plan another way out.

Step 3: Zach continually clashes with Veyers, who habitually picks fights with him and gets violent when Zach refuses. Zach is irritated by this but doesn't do anything rash.

Step 4: Zach finds a talented mage who could be a major asset in his quest, and decides to give him a temporary marker. They work together for a few months. During this time, either Panaxeth contacts this mage and offers him the same deal he offered Silverlake, or Zach tells the mage about Panaxeth and the mage comes up with the thought on his own. Either way, the mage makes the decision to betray Zach.

Step 4: The mage formulates a plan to steal Zach's loop knowledge and neuter him as a long-term threat while he gains the knowledge and power he'll need to fulfill Panaxeth's task in the outside world. He manipulates Veyers into doing something that genuinely enrages Zach, something genuinely heinous, as part of their ongoing one-sided rivalry. Then he subtly pushes Zach into responding by soulkilling Veyers.

Step 5: Zach is overwhelmed by guilt after soulkilling someone in anger. The mage manipulates Zach into asking the him to remove all memory of Veyers. The mage does so, but also steals all Zach's knowledge of loop mechanics and key access method, then wipes out all that, his own existence, and puts a set of compulsions on Zach to make it unlikely he'll ever figure out what happened. Satisfied with how Zach is dealt with, he returns to the Sovereign Gate with all 5 key pieces. There, Panaxeth hacks the loop (or possibly his temporary marker), so that he can continue to loop until he's satisfied he can pull off the invasion for real.

I'm aware that the theory is a little out there and possibly overspecific, but I think it probably hits some relevant points. Unfortunately, looking it back over, it's less restrictive on RR candidates than I originally thought. All it really requires is a social-spec that Zach would come to trust who could learn some serious mind magic with his help within 6 months, who then might decide to betray him. I think that leaves Fortov as a viable candidate (which I didn't, when I started this post).

The specific element "Veyers did something so bad that Zach soulkilled him and that left him open for RR somehow" is something I think seems genuinely likely, in light of Veyers appearing in the most recent chapter.
