Also, Zorian dies in his room in one of the early loops he remembers, and Zach remarks how difficult it is to save him. So presumable, Fortov has not yet discovered a good way to 'rescue' Zorian when the story begins. Fortov is trying different tactics on Zorian every loop and is even aware of Zach doing the same, so he is not going to be terribly surprised at Zorian showing different /reactions/ every loop. Even if Zorian starts acting differently earlier in the loop, Fortov may just blame it on Zach.
