Call me crazy, but I think it's Zach. There are a number of things that would have to be explained somehow, but I think it would be simpler than bringing in someone as "the bad guy" who we don't have any attachment to.

Likely most of the time that Red Robe was actually present it was probably a high ranking cultist or something, but there was no one else in the loop and Zach was the one who helped the invaders so much. He faked the memory loss and didn't want Zorian in his mind cause he would figure it out pretty quickly.

What I don't know is why he's keeping up the illusion now, after getting out of the loop. He created the simulcron that he fought, he grabbed Veyers out of the house and strengthened the wards, his simulacrum went and fought the aranea. But I don't know what he wants at this point.

Like I said, call me crazy. I'm pretty sure we'll get conclusive proof that Veyers isn't Red Robe next chapter and Zach is my next choice.
