This theory got me thinking.

What if when you enter the loop, you are copied as well?

So there is a Zach that enters the loop, and a Zach that was created as part of the loop.

(RealZach and LoopZach)

So, hypothetically, LoopZach starts the loop conscious, but has a compulsion to go to his estate, fall asleep and forget about what happened.

RealZach figured out a way to duplicate his marker for LoopZach (hypothetically much easier for a copy of yourself right?), so that he could have a useful helper that he uses mind magic on to keep under control as a happy and willing partner.

However, as RealZach continues to modify LoopZachs mind over time, LoopZachs interests diverge from his own, and RealZach outgrows his need for LoopZach, so he just leaves him to his own devices after wiping his memory of RealZach (might have felt squeemish about killing himself? Zach does have problems with Simulacrum afterall)

The main looper had to care about soulkilling Veyers, so if there really was a RealZach and LoopZach, then there's motive and ability.
