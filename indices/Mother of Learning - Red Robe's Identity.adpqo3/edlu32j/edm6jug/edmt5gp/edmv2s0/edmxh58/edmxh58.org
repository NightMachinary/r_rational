We can ask nobody to be sure, but it was my headcanon that Zorian had definitely spent some time comatose since it makes sense. Zach spent 7 restarts comatose - just for matching reasons Zorian should have had a few of those too. Even the time when he gets his ass handed to him by the Sword Divers Web, he wakes up later in the day. So if a mental attack can lead to a few hours unable to wake up, soul blend should have at least a few days too.
