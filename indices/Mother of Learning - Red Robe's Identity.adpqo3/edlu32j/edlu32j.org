From literary standpoint Fortov is one of many candidates for equal shock value. You know, if it turns out to be Ibery I would be no less shocked. Or Zack, or Kael, or even Akoja. I think hybrid approach is needed.

1. RR repeatedly helped Ibasans with invasion. Every time until they exit, as far as Zorian remembers.
2. They are not natural mind mage.
3. They are able to see invisible Zorian.
4. They had access to the dagger at the end of the restart.
5. They are stronger than Zorian but weaker than Zach (if Zach to be believed)
6. Zach was in coma for several restarts after the soulmerge.
7. RR either doesn't know Zorian identity or doesn't want to hurt him.
8. Veyers is erased from the loop. Either Zach's memory is redacted or he is lying about it is unclear.

Now on Fortov. There are nearly 100% chance that Zorian was in coma as well after the soulmerge. This should really bring his attention to him. Actually, this should bring attention of anyone who interact with him to some degree. Same for bringing Kiri to Cyoria, this is a noticeable divergence. So however satisfying Fortov hypothesis is, he should held a moon-sized idiot ball for it to be true.

By the way, there is something strange in chapter 93 happens. Giggling girls from chapter 1, asking Zorian if he can show some magic. Nowhere to be seen after inside the loop only to appear right after Z&Z leave it.

Now Ibery, she did not interact with Zorian much, but in ch. 1 we saw her suffering giggling girls company along with Zorian. Then Zorian disappears and she suffers alone. So after some time she erased them from restarts.

Ibery has a crush on Fortov and won't take no for an answer. Maybe being thrown out to a creeper patch is her scheme to guild trip Fortov so he, IDK, kiss her or something. No Zorian, no salve, no Fortov, frustration, no giggling girls.

If you think this theory is far-fetched, you are correct. I think RR Fortov is as much far-fetched as RR Ibery.

Also, there is Byrn Ivaring, this guy always checking Zorian after some key differences. First loop after coma, first loop with Kirielle, out of loop train ride. This may be him checking on Zorian. Granted, him being Red Robe would be not as satisfying as Ibery, but he can.

It still can be Veyers. That would be unreveal of "Quirrell is Voldemort" magnitude.

I agree with MagicwaffIez, Sudomir is much more likely:

1. He was deep in the invasion business even before the loop.
2. He is a member of the Cult.
3. He is a competent necromancer.
4. He has access to the Crown.
5. He care not for some random students like Zach or Zorian.
6. He is the only one who knows about wraith bombs(spoiler for ch. 94)

Of course, there is one little detail. Why didn't he even once tried to make the bombs earlier. If course, he may indeed tried and heroes just didn't know it at the time.
