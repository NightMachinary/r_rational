Hmmm. Damn that's actually pretty solid. Plus Sudomir has gotten enough screen time to be a viable candidate. I'll admit chapter 94 definitely helps this theory. I'm not ready to write off Furtov, (As I said, I started from a shock/emotional impact of the different reveals and worked backwards) but thank you for suggesting this one too me, I'll admit its got a decent change of being true. You're the only person I've seen with a viable alternative. Everyone else keeps suggesting Zach or Zorian simulcrums, and one guy an Areana. Kudos to you sir.
