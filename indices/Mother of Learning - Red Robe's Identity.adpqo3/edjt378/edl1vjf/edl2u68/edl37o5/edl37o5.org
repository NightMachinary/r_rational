I'm continuously convinced. Zach and Fortov would totally hit it off.

#+begin_quote
  during their first two years, Zach was a below-average student more distinguished because of his charm than magical talent. Kind of like a nicer version of Fortov, actually.

Chapter 3

Update 1:

  "I know everyone thinks I'm jealous but that's not normal!" said Akoja in a hushed but agitated voice. "I'm pretty smart and I study all the time and I'm still having problems with the curriculum. And we've both been in the same class as Neolu for the past two years and she was never this good. And... and now she's beating me in every single class!"

  "Kind of like Zach," said Zorian.

  "Exactly like Zach!" she agreed. "They even hang out together, two of them and one other girl I don't know, behaving like... like they're in their own private little world."

  ...

  Akoja scoffed. "Whatever. The point is the three of them do nothing but waste time together and antagonize the teachers and get perfect scores anyway. They even refused the chance to get transferred to 1st tier groups, can you believe that!?"

Chapter 3

They totally have temporary markers. There's no way they'd be acing every class otherwise. Maybe one class, with Zach giving answers, but not every single one.

Also, if it was their first loop, they'd care a little more about their classes, like I think Zorian did, but I can't remember.

And, didn't Zach forget a bunch of recent history after he got hit at the end of chapter 4? So it would totally make sense for him to forget about the temporary markers.

Jeez. :)

Update 2:

Because Fortov got Zorian to make the salve, he stayed up late and woke to knocking at the beginning of chapter 4. This is Ako, and if Zorian woke up earlier, he might have been getting breakfast or something and missed Ako. He wouldn't have been in his room, or he might not have answered the door. Essentially, he wouldn't have gone to the dance with her.

Without going with her, he would have been in his dorm when it was hit. He would have either skipped it entirely, or went back early.

  Wait a minute... that's his residence building!

  He collapsed to his knees again as the implications of this hit him. If he had opted to stay in his room like he had originally planned, he'd have been dead right now. It was a sobering thought. But what the hell was happening here!? That was no firework, that's for sure! It looked and sounded more like a high level artillery spell.

This is a nice comparison between Fortov and Zorian. Zorian didn't care at all where Fortov was during the invasion (as he argued to Zach in the recent chapter), but Fortov made sure that his brother wouldn't be killed in the invasion.

It adds more to the theory that Fortov goes along with the invasion only so he (and his family) survives, not because he really loves the other side.

Update 3:

Nvm, Zach just admitted he was the one that made sure Zorian didn't die.
