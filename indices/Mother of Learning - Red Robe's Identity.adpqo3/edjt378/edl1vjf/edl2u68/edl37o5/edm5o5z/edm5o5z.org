  They totally have temporary markers. There's no way they'd be acing every class otherwise. Maybe one class, with Zach giving answers, but not every single one.

He just tells them the answers to every quiz and teacher-asked question beforehand. It's not like they check if they have notes before asking questions. No need for temp markers.

And as for edit 3, yeah but that doesn't mean Fortov isn't looking out for him whenever Zach isn't paying attention.
