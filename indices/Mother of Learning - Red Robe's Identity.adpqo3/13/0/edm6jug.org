  Now on Fortov. There are nearly 100% chance that Zorian was in coma as well after the soulmerge. This should really bring his attention to him. Actually, this should bring attention of anyone who interact with him to some degree. Same for bringing Kiri to Cyoria, this is a noticeable divergence. So however satisfying Fortov hypothesis is, he should held a moon-sized idiot ball for it to be true.

This is not nearly true. QI fucking exploded on Zorian and he woke up the very next loop. Yeah he nearly died again but he remembered it. Without it, your Fortov isn't RR theory kind of falls apart. We also don't know if Zorian brought kirielle to Cyoria in some previous loops but didn't remember. It could happen every dozen or so restarts thanks to a comment Fortov makes and he just didn't notice a difference, plus they literally never interact after leaving the train station save for the creeper patch incident.
