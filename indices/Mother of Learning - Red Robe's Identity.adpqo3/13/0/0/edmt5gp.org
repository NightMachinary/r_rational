Well, Zach was in a coma after the bomb, and it was only a) because Zorian terminated the restart before the full force of the attack could hit them 2) his soul defenses were solid... But still if he had not managed to stay awake then he'd be in the coma too.

What are the odds that loop1!Zorian has the a) soul defense sills b) ability to remain sealer skills that ch83 Zorian had? Using this as a way to remove Fortrov from RR list makes sense to me.
