I would have named this thread differently:

Who is the progenitor of Red Robe?

Cause there are two instances (original/weak pre-loop personality and experienced/learned version which left loop to assist in primordial release).

Like Zorian changed during the time inside, RR is very different from his base personality. (the body might be different as well). Revealing the progenitor makes very little difference, cause the real Red Robe is still out there, causing mess.

Why do you think Fortov is natural mind mage as Zorian? IIRC, he has the least talent in this field (Zorian did checked out his family and none of them were bright stars in mindscape).

There were very little females so far, so maybe in strict literary sense is female is also very plausible. The RR obfuscates the features, so maybe the Tinami is the culprit. She has some mediocre training in mind magic for starters. It makes very little sense though, but I think it is more plausible than Fortov.

Anyway, it's just the progenitor. It will make very little impact even if it is revealed who was the progenitor of the Red Robe.

I'll repeat my own theory on RR progenitor. It is a mage, part of dragon cult, also something like nth (at least 3rd or 4th) in the line of succession in Royal family of Eldemar (explains how he got the dagger to perform soul kill without breaking into the vault). Has his own personal red robe of inner circle and as most (all) cult members are proficient if forbidden magic (blood/soul/mind magic), he was the person who assisted with bloodline ignition for Veyers Boranova. Also this is the reason why Veyers was removed from loop - he knew RR progenitor prior loop - it was done to sever this lead (this was done much earlier in the loop when RR has not yet left the loop, much earlier when ejecting aranea).
