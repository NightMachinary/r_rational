Obligatory "Simulacrum of Zach is Red Robe" theory.

A core part of the story (and any timeloop story) is personal growth. Simulacrum!Zach who instead was warped by the loop and/or failed to grow as a person would be a good foil to Zorian. Further contrasted with the Zach Zorian now knows.

I could see this being done with Fortnov, him somehow getting into the loop and slowly breaking under the strain. But he's the weaker less developed option imo.

We have had SO MUCH foreshadowing about Simulcrums rebelling. Just. Multiple chapters pointing out they can do what they want and how prone they are to trolling or even outright ignoring their creator's orders.

We've started this final month with a few questions about duplicates. Zorian had to replace his original, and think through the morality of effectively killing himself. He and Zach had to deal with Silverlake, warning her of the possibility that Loop!Silverlake would try and kill her.

The reveal has to hold personal meaning to Zorian and the story at large. Preferably the maximum amount possible, because pathos. While the strongest outcomes for that would be Zach (Zorian being impossible sadly), Fortov is a good backup option for this. He slots in with Zorian's original "unfair disdain for others" thing he's been growing out of, and ties into Zorian's family issues. "Oh no the brother Zorian hated is a bad guy, probably with a tragic back-story that uncannily reflects Zorian's own flaws back at him" doesn't really feel like a satisfying reveal though? Like, they don't really like each-other to start with. If we got a look into Fortnov's world then it could work, but it would require more work to make relevant. It doesn't add much to the story, or change much.

Simu!Zach = Red Robe completely nukes everything for Zorian and shatters his world-view. It has maximum pathos, and it pulls together ideas from the time loop, of mind manipulation, duplicates, how we develop as people, and how our choices define us.

It also turns a final showdown into anyone's game as it becomes possible for Zach to be pulled between who he was and who he's become, making the final confrontation character-driven.

If this is right, then I think the next chapter should start with our new guest being interested in Zach.
