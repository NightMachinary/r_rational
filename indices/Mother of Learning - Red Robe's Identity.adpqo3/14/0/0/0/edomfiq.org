We know stuff can be deleted, so why couldn't we add stuff to the loop. When they were interrogating the guardian, he implied that there's probably a lot of stuff the controller can do, but only if they know about it.

Adding stuff to the loop is a simple extension. And rereading the soulkill chapter, Red Robe was making these huge beams to delete souls, so he probably was really good at that spell.

Even if it was too much to add a whole simulcrum body, he could quite possibly semi-overwrite someone else, possibly a high ranking cultist. A big part of the simulcrum spell seems to be a magical brain (to be surrounded and controlling ectoplasm), so why not make a permanent one, and attach it to someone else?

It still seems to be a bit far fetched, though, considering how lacking Zach was in soul magic.
