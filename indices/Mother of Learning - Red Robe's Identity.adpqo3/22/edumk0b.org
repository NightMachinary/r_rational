  Zach gave him a warning look in response. He was a pretty good actor, all things considered. Did he used to do this sort of thing a lot during past restart or was he just a natural?

Chapter 87

Even if RR isn't Fortov, there are a lot of hints that RR was once Zach's friend and erased part of his mind.

nobody103 definitely didn't put this line in as a throw away, and it's recent. It's the most directly compelling line that someone got close to him and betrayed him.

That line comes from one spot when ZZ broke into the Black Room area and we're talking to the overseer, pretending to be government agents. If Zach was practiced at this sort of thing, then it would make a lot of sense if he did it with someone else, but forgot about it.

Combined with Zach's rapid improvement in skill (compared to when Zorian first joined the loop, Zach could barely last against QI) and his compulsion to not let Zorian look at his mind, or anyone else, for that matter, it seems really clear that Zach was betrayed by RR.

I'm also moderately annoyed because I had found a single line paragraph that also helped prove RR is Fortov, and I can't find it again. Or maybe it was that RR was a friend that betrayed Zach. I dunno. I think it was around chapter 53, which is when Zach found Zorian.

After reading through a bit, this line is interesting.

  "What, no Fortov?" Zach asked with a whisper.
#+end_quote

If Fortov is RR, he clearly didn't fully erase his memory from Zach's mind, only Veyers. Yeah, he could have erased Veyers, but not himself, to be a red herring, but it just adds more complexity.

Maybe Veyers could be RR, though. We thought it was disproven when we found he was soul killed, but it could have been that him getting pulled out by Panaxeth permanently removed his soul from the loop, as if he was soul killed. In comparison, Zorian left under his own power, so the loop probably just reset him. It still adds complexity though.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Just sharing thoughts as I go through my reread.

Edit:

  "Tell them this is not something they are qualified to negotiate about," Zach suddenly said. "We want to talk to their high priest."

Chapter 88

Not much on its own, but he does say it suddenly, with no particular reason. To be fair, though, Zach is really surprised afterwards when they do get the ring immediately.

Edit 2:

When Silverlake leaves, nobody103 describes her looking as if she was soul killed. That adds plausibility to the idea that someone who accepts Panaxeth's contract leaves permanently, in comparison to how Zorian left.

Still haven't gotten to the part where Zorian leaves, though.

Edit 3:

Nevermind, I forgot that Zach said that Silverlake also went back to normal.

At this point, I have no idea. Part of me wants to say it's Veyers, but that's different from Silverlake.

Who knows anymore.
