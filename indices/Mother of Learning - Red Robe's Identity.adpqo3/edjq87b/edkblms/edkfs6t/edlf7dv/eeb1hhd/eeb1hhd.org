Zorian did actually have some issues with sleeping during his 2nd loop. He is awoken late in the day when Tavien comes to recruit him for the sewer run. He later specifically recalls it when he considers whether he spent any loops in a coma.

We will never get a complete answer to this, but it is fully possible he did spend a few restarts in a coma.
