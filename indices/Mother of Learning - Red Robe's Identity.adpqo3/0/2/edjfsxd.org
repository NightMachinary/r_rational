  There's kind of something weird about the purple-creeper patch being so regular. (This is what originally caused me to start thinking something suspicious might be up with Fortov, and I had an idea that maybe he was intentionally being so regular, although maybe this idea is kind of convoluted, when really this is just supposed to mean that Ibery is really obsessed with Fortov.)

That is my line of reasoning as well. Maybe if Fortov and his relationships were explored more it would have made sense to bring attention to the odd regularity of this particular incident, but it really serves no narrative purpose to have this pointed out if it isn't indicative of anything more.

I'd have to reread the story to check for any other clues that it's the case, but it makes sense that Fortov would attempt to appear to be living a consistent life to avoid detection from Zach or any other loopers. But since normal humans are more prone to variation if small changes are made, his attempts to remain consistent would be the giveaway that he's the only one that truly isn't.
