I feel like there are some logical flaws with it being Fortov, but (and I've said so on this sub before) I agree that Fortov is satisfying from a literary perspective, if the story turns out to have a great explanation for those apparent issues.

I'm particularly amused by the idea of them being so obsessed with ignoring each other that they each fail to notice that the other is the enemy they've been hunting... except the purple-creeper patch incident sort of throws a wrench in it.

There's kind of something weird about the purple-creeper patch being so regular. (This is what originally caused me to start thinking something suspicious might be up with Fortov, and I had an idea that maybe he was intentionally being so regular, although maybe this idea is kind of convoluted, when really this is just supposed to mean that Ibery is really obsessed with Fortov.) The story also draws attention to the fact that Zorian doesn't know what happens to Fortov during the invasion.

I also had a pet theory that Fortov was able to hack the temp marker by being a natural soul-mage analogously to Zorian being a natural mind-mage. Unfortunately, there's not really any evidence for this, other than the fact that it would feel satisfying.

I've seen this pointed out before, but there's also the one weird incident where the train car has different inhabitants for no apparent reason, which could plausibly be the result of Fortov acting differently.

Finally, Fortov is not just selfish, but Zorian specifically describes him as someone who tries to /leech off others' success/ (which is backed up by his interactions with Daimen). This would be consistent with him trying to take advantage of the loop for himself.
