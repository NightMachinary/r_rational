[[https://write.as/r2kubeoqeqfmx.md][Here are some relevant passages in support of the hypothesis.]]

It should be remembered that RR was in the time loop long before Zorian and could have used that time to work out a sequence of events involving Zorian and the purple creeper incident that suited him during the early period when Zorian was essentially a predictable automaton.

Perhaps Fortov/RR simply needed Zorian to be out of his room on the day before the invasion for some reason, and having Zorian make a purple creeper salve was the easiest way to achieve that outcome. In the restarts where Zorian didn't return to his room on the second last day, Fortov/RR had no need to approach him.

Of particular note in the extracts to which I have linked are the inconsistencies between Fortov's own accounts of the purple creeper incident:

- In Ch 3, Fortov says to Zorian that he pushed Ibery into the purple creeper patch. He says he needs the salve made on the second last day of the restart, and no later, because (he says) Ibery has a crush on "this boy" (implicitly, not Fortov); she won't be able to go to the celebration the next day unless her rash is fixed; and she will never forgive Fortov.

- In Ch 75, Fortov says to Zorian that he pushed Ibery into the purple creeper patch because "she was being really aggressive and wouldn't take no for an answer and she kept trying to kiss me".

If the truth is that Ibery "had a massive crush on Fortov" (Ch 9), but Fortov was so uninterested in her that he pushed her into a purple creeper patch to avoid her advances (Ch 75), why would he so urgently need Zorian to make the salve before the end of the restart? Ibery herself says to Zorian that the salve is "not that important" (Ch 9).

Although Ibery said in one restart that Fortov "didn't mean for this to happen" (Ch 9), Zorian concludes, having observed Fortov across many restarts, that Fortov pushing Ibery into the purple creeper patch "has got to be a deliberate move on his part" (Ch 75).

It's all very curious. In many ways, Fortov acts like a looper.
