The question then becomes why Fortov would bother to save Zorian if he was also RR and repeatedly trying to kill him. I don't think Z&Z are described as hiding their faces during their attacks upon the invasion, so it wouldn't be mistaken identity. Unless there was something specific Fortov needed to do in Zorian's room which couldn't be done elsewhere or elsewhen, I don't know how he could be RR.

He could, however, be another temporary looper who escaped the erasure mechanism and somehow escaped before RR did. This would also explain why RR allied with QI and had several other pieces of the Key: when he tried to escape the normal way, he found the Gate already barred. He wasn't strong enough to fight QI, and didn't seem the type to bargain the Crown off him, so an alliance was his best bet.
