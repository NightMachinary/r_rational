This is not quite right. The dormitories being bombed doesn't really happen without RR's intervention. RR is the one telling the invaders all the key phrases and codewords to bypass the wards across the city and the Academy. Without RR, the invaders tend to target churches and government buildings, while with RR's assistance, they instead target places where law enforcement personnel, military groups, weapon supply depots, etc, are located. With RR's assistance, the invaders launch a successful attack against the Academy quickly and efficiently, while without his assistance, they can't destroy any of the buildings less warded since they focus against the main building which is strongly defended, and the teachers have more than enough time to guide all the students to a safe place and to organize a defense.

So if Fortov was actually RR, then he would be directly responsible for Zorian's death. Also, Fortov tries to get Zorian to make him a salve /before/ the day of the festival. It's not even the day of the invasion, so Zorian's building won't blow up, even if he chooses to stay inside his room instead of making the salve.

The timeline just wouldn't make sense.
