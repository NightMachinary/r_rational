75 also occurs after RR leaves the loop- why would Fortrov continue to do it and ask for help when he's back to "normal?" Why not just believe that this is just another long-term perspective change- there are /several/ times where we're told something about a character/magic, but later find out that it's not really the full story. I think the Fortrov thing could be one of them.

IMO these are epileptic trees-type justifications, but we'll see.
