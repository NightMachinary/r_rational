  This may or may not be the first part of a project to abridge Douglas Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid", which somehow takes hundreds of pages to cover the same material.

I am entirely offended! If Hofstadter had merely wanted to cover Gödel's results, he would have had the book he read as a teenager republished!
