My question is, how did this situation with the complementary nature of humans and monsters arise in the first place? What's evolution playing at, giving them each traits that are perfectly balanced by the other, and then giving monsters the ability to absorb human souls? Clearly, nature or design has invented a very clever solution to some problem, but it's not at all clear what that solution is.

It's almost as if monsters and humans are /meant/ to fuse their souls, and the whole business with the war between the two races was not just a terrible mistake but a violation of the natural order.

(Cracktheory: /Undertale/ is part of the /His Dark Materials/ multiverse, and monsters are an alternate-universe version of daemons.)
