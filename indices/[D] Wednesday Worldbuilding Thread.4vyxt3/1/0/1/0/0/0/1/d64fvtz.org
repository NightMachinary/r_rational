In Undertale canon, Boss Monsters are the only monsters whose SOULS exist outside of the body. Albeit for a short while. This is pretty important because this means it's much harder for a human to become a Merged Entity than a monster.

Imagine this. Human souls hover around long enough for any monster to grab it. But if a human wants to become a Merged Entity, they have to specifically hunt a Boss Monster.

In GQ AU, Boss Monsters are the highest and thus most powerful order of their monster class. In a way, they're sentient magical representations of the natural world. Fire Goats like Toriel and Asgore are the top line of all fire (and goat) monsters. Dire Wolves are the top line of the ice and canine lines.

In short, think RPG. All RPG monsters have some kind of a 'boss' right?

There might be more out there representing other stuff like wind, rocks, flora, ect ect. Haven't got the chance to really explore this yet.

There's another trait about on GQ Boss Monsters that may be spoilery, but I consider it minor enough to explain it on reddit.

Boss Monsters literally transfer their life to their offspring. As such, the offspring inherits ALL the power of their parents. This continues until we're left with one superpowered, functionally immortal child who'd become the eternal ruler of that nation.

The longer/bigger the family tree, the more powerful the final descendant will be.
