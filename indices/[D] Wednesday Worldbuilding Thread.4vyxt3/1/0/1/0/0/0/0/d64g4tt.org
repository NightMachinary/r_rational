Whoops I forgot to explain about the complimentary DT thing.

I'm not sure what your question is. If I guessed it right, then yes. DT+Kindness= Kindness Plus. In other words, all Kindness related spells become stronger than normally would be.

Not sure about Hope and Compassion. From what I understand, Hope is the accumulation of all positive traits? I gotta think about that.
