Oh mai I've been summoned. Thank you for liking my work so much :D

For magic in general, I have a guidebook called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6902341]['The Magus Compendium']]. Written so that I don't mess up my own setting.

For stuff that I have yet to record in the Magus Compendium itself that's relevant to the current discussion....

- All Souls both human and monster have Love and Compassion as part of their SOUL's building blocks
- Monsters have all seven traits (which includes Determination) in very low quantities. They're usually in perfect balance and that's why they're 'white'.
- Human SOULS on the other hand are not balanced. They tend to have a trait that dominates everything else. This imbalance may be caused by uneven distribution of Determination.
- Complimentary Determination acts as a booster.
- Edit: Forgot to mention this. Fixed typos and terminology errors. Both humans and monsters can ignore the Love and Compassion which lead to antisocial behaviour. Monsters are less inclined to ignore this than humans. Humans are also way more likely to take this antisocial behaviour to the extreme.

The absorption of Souls is officially called a 'Merge' in Magi circles. A Merged Entity's priority of control goes to the living host. If a monster absorbs a human's soul, the monster is the one with primary control. If a human absorbs a monster's soul, the human is in control.

This does NOT eliminate identity. In a merger, they live together in the same body as a union of two spirits in one. Ideally, this is the end result of a very close relationship (siblings, soulmates, lovers, ect).

A Merge can also exchange control if one party gives the control to another. For example, the monster may hand over their body's controls to the human if the human had the knowledge required to solve the problem. Imagine very technical work such as computer hacking.

Everything goes out of whack if you're dealing with excessive levels of Determination. A SOUL with lots of Determination can force their control outside of the norms, because that is the nature of DT itself.

As for physical change. I personally think that a Merger will always have a physical change. How much? It depends on their state of mind. A Merged entity living in peace can look very normal, with some extra markings at most. But that same Merged entity in combat can have some very fanciful cosmetics.

Also, a Merged Entity tend to take on the colours of the SOUL they absorbed. If it's Orange, the design takes an orange hue. If green, they take a green design and so on so on.

Did I miss anything?
