Shoutouts to [[/u/Sophiera]] whom is exploring magics based on those seven traits with great depth in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5296460][The Golden Quiche]]. I quite adore that piece of fiction, and it's part of what inspired me to this. If you've any contributions, feel free to chime in! We're a welcoming community, and I in particular could use your opinion.

I have been rolling around the idea of human mages. The basic thought is that monsters (or their presence), to greater or lesser extent, release magic into the environment which other souls may acclimate to and absorb. Maybe, anyway, still haven't decided on just how they'll work.
