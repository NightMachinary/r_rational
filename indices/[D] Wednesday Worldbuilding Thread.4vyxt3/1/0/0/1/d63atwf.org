I suspect that Undyne did not generate her own determination, but rather had a small quantity injected into her by Alphys - a tiny dosage to avoid the horrors of the determination experiments. Because of the small dosage, it only activates when things are at their worst - in a minor way when Undyne is dying at all, and in a major way when the human has proven themselves omnicidal.
