This is true and pure speculation, but I believe that humans and monsters being unable to absorb souls of the same type are not for the same reasons. For monsters, I believe it is because they lack enough metaphysical strength (including Determination) to hold the magic of more than one soul together. Human souls, meanwhile, simply retain enough agency post death to exit from the soul-group. These thoughts inspired by true pacifist spoilers and no-mercy spoilers.
