That is correct. In genocide, however, she seems to stabilize to some extent (though for obvious reasons we don't get to see the long-term effects of her transformation there), and the reasons for that are less obvious.

Though... the thought occurs that if she uses green magic for utility, and it seems to also be used for healing (though it could be a meta-level thing) based on the color of attacks that "heal" you, it could be a combination of her highly enhanced determination and a more pure expression of green magic that brought her back from the brink.
