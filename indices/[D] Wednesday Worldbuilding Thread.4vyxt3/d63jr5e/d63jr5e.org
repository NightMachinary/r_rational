I'm thinking of creating a world in which souls and reincarnation are a thing, but I'm not sure how to accomplish this. Currently my best idea is that in this universe, Dualism is correct, and matter and spirit are separate things. This requires that matter and spirit can influence each other, which has some pretty interesting implications---e.g. telekinesis and telepathy potentially exist. I'm certain there are huge implications that follow from this, but I'm not familiar enough with cognitive science to know what they are. Any ideas?
