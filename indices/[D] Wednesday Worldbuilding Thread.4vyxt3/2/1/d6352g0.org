Either specifically set up a leveling system designed to be exploited to hell and back by clever players, that /has/ to be exploited to progress (so some sort of way to drop skills/levels would also be needed) or don't include the standard xp/level thing at all, and make it more puzzle style, with abilities that need to be used in tandem and intelligently.
