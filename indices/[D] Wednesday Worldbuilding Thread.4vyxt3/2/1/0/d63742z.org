That's actually a good idea. I like the first one. Like, make the game with a system that's arbitrarily complex, but once it's figured out I could have various abilities abuseable to create certain effects.

I'm sure that if I were to make a normal system, people would find various things about it easy to abuse on the first go, and then instead of nerfing the OP stuff, working with the weak things and figuring out how people could abuse them.

I would want equal opportunity abuse unless I hated particular classes. :P
