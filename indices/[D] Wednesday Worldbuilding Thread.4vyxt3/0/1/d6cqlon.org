Re: the reason for the flower wars, I think "to pass the time" isn't really a good explanation for an adapted trait. What you're probably looking for is "as a conspicuous display to signal relative intelligence". Ie that they're not doing it because they're bored (this can theoretically explain every activity, and thus fails to explain any activity), but because doing well in war shows that you're intelligent and you'd make a good ally, so they participate in order to compete for prestige.
