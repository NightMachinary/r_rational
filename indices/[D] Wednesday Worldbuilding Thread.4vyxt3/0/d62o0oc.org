I'm building an alien species that I'll be releasing into the Creative Commons, for people who want aliens but don't feel confident in their worldbuilding abilities or don't have the time (I previously did something similar with /The Culture Column,/ which produced a good kickstarter later on). Is there anyone who'd be interested in the occasional idea bouncing?

I've written up a fair amount already, so you can check that out first to see if you'd be interested in this species (please forgive the occasional typo; it's only a couple of days ago that authors could edit their articles, and these are too old for that).
