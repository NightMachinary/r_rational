I love reading about hyptothetical aliens, so I'm really excited to read this series! I'll give you my thoughts, but I have no special expertise.

ideas5:

I love the idea of sexual dimorphism, and the laughing gas on the planet seems like a cool touch. I'd love a more detailed breakdown of atmospheric gases, but to be honest I'm sure leaving it out is better because it allows the detailed science to be ignored, and all an RPG player really cares about is if you can breathe on it. I'd like to know if the oxygen concentration is higher or lower than Earth though, because that would have implications for things like fire.

Communicating by sound seems fine, emoting by scent is cool and prevents them from being too normal.

The miscommunication about war styles seems interesting. I feel like humanity would not have been aggressive at the alien species for capturing their own men though, I think people would be more charitable than that (but I'm a charitable soul, I guess). My feeling is because of the movie /Mars Attacks/ where humanity was willing to assume that the martians freaked out about the dove, forgive them for all the murdering, and invite them to speak at a political assembly. So maybe not the best source. I'm interested about how the conflict was resolved and how communication was even established at all!!

  ll species can be subdivided into two further broad clades: Unaforma and Dupliciter, which are distinguished by whether they .

WHETHER THEY WHAT??? oh my god I want to know :(

YES LEARNING ABOUT THE SEXUAL DIMORPHISM.

You describe the head, as though there's only one head type for both genders. Based on the carnivore/herbivore diet split, I'd expect the females to have more specialised feeding hardware as well as 'hunting' hardware (unless there's an ecological reason that this isn't necessary)

  This structure is horrible for communicative purposes, but that's okay: they actually talk through their nostrils.

I love this turn of phrase.

ideas7:

I like the allusions to the planet having different cultures, in the differences in property ownership and as well to the allusion to racial differences. I think the planet of hats trope is annoying and I'm glad steps are made to avoid it in some way. (Planet of hats makes me think of the episode of Stargate where they accidentally gate to an unknown second gate in Antarctica, and Carter climbs out of the cave, sees snow as far as the eye can see, and reports back that they are on an ice planet).
