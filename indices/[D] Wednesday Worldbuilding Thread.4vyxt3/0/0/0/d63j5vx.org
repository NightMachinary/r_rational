  I'll give you my thoughts, but I have no special expertise.
#+end_quote

If you PM me an email address then I can Share the google doc that I'm using as I develop them further.

  WHETHER THEY WHAT??? oh my god I want to know :(
#+end_quote

Whoops! Whether they exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism of the "filling two separate niches" variety . Which is stupid and hard to justify, I've since decided.

#+begin_quote
  You describe the head, as though there's only one head type for both genders. Based on the carnivore/herbivore diet split, I'd expect the females to have more specialised feeding hardware as well as 'hunting' hardware (unless there's an ecological reason that this isn't necessary)
#+end_quote

I commissioned some concept art for them, incidentally. Here's a piece from when we were [[http://i.imgur.com/lHR4XVs.jpg][deciding on the head]]. I settled on using #1 and #2, the former being for males and the latter for females. You can see how the females are more robust, with spiky ridges and a sort of crest that the males don't have. I wasn't sure why the artist added those frond-like attachments, but I liked them and decided to make them chemosensitive. The dots over the eyes on #2 are heat-sensitive pits. Both of these are larger on the females because, as juveniles, they have to hunt alone and usually do so at night.

3 and 4 are members of the same clade. The first lost its chemosensitive fronds for some reason, while the latter lost a single pair and became, apparently, an ant-eater sort of thing.

The image that you see near #4, with an underside view, is a depiction of the radula. Jaws as such didn't evolve on this planet, though there are jaw-like structures and alternate adaptations in various creatures. In the aglo clade, the tongue has a bony underside which is used to seal the radula shut when it isn't being used, but in one predatory lineage this has turned into a weapon (you wouldn't be too far from the truth if you imagined the pharyngeal jaws from /Alien/).

Aglos don't have that adaptation, but they /do/ have strong arms. Pre-technological aglos typically killed through strangulation (and the males, at least, hunted partially like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5qijI--v9E&index=2&l][Hawaiian caterpillars]], with part of the group laying in wait while the others flushed out prey). As you can see in [[http://i.imgur.com/NuPDr6c.png][this piece of concept art]] their forearms are on the thin side. I am unsure if I am going to keep this and say that they developed this way for finer manipulation once tool use became important, or give them thicker arms in the future.

  I'd love a more detailed breakdown of atmospheric gases, but to be honest I'm sure leaving it out is better because it allows the detailed science to be ignored, and all an RPG player really cares about is if you can breathe on it.
#+end_quote

Unfortunately I am but an egg in the fields of science, and going into too much detail about the atmosphere will likely betray my ignorance too much.

#+begin_quote
  I'd like to know if the oxygen concentration is higher or lower than Earth though, because that would have implications for things like fire.
#+end_quote

Probably not too much different from Earth's, but I'd imagine that it's just a little bit less concentrated.

#+begin_quote
  I feel like humanity would not have been aggressive at the alien species for capturing their own men though, I think people would be more charitable than that (but I'm a charitable soul, I guess).
#+end_quote

I guess it all depends on who was in charge at the time!

#+begin_quote
  I'm interested about how the conflict was resolved and how communication was even established at all!!
#+end_quote

I'm not yet sure how communication was established, but we were probably the ones to figure out what was going on. The Agloanikoi, for their part, are not too far from Eliezier's Baby-Eaters and are perfectly acquainted with the concept of reasonable mistakes based on insufficient knowledge.

They still insisted on a hostage exchange, though, and that's probably never going to end. We're also probably stereotyped as untrustworthy unless you have something over us (at least for a few generations, anyway).

#+begin_quote
  I think the planet of hats trope is annoying and I'm glad steps are made to avoid it in some way.
#+end_quote

I plan on making a series out of this, and one of the first things that I decided was that there would be a section where I'd describe how different types of people fit into the culture. If I were writing one for Klingons, for example, then it'd talk about Klingon taxi drivers and Klingon doctors and idk Klingon janitors or something, and how they fit into this warrior-centric culture. Do they conceptualize themselves differently? Do they feel good about themselves? How do other Klingons view them?
