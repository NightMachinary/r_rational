If someone were to make a rational high fantasy rpg series of games, what are some traits you would look for in the way the game actually plays? I've decided to play with Unreal Engine a bit and have some ideas for a story, but short on actual gameplay. One thing i was thinking about was making the whole thing a meta 4th wall experience where the player is from another world and the characters know it, then basing the experience off that.

I'd like ideas i could implement and potentially sell.
