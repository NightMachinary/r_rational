I wanted to design a virtual reality game so the story actually is kind of based around one of the core gameplay ideas butt I don't want to share too much because I don't want to give spoilers if I ever actually make it completely or 4 copyright and other potential reasons however I can give you some of the basic rundown so I think without being too out there. As you and others have noted ideas are a dime a dozen so I'm not too worried about sharing it.

The RPG is going to be based on defense and defending particular people because they have some of you and your soul is now in this world and you are given the task to defend these people. This will be as they go throughout their lives and potentially span into the future significantly. the player is going to be tied to specific areas where they are given the task to defend those areas it'll be similar to a tower defense of sorts and survival style games in that you'll have enemies attacking you or attacking what you're defending and your job is to defeat them.

I think the idea is fairly simple and easy to execute I could do it by modding Halo 1 easily because that's what I have experience modding in. From what I can tell Unreal Engine it seems fairly simple do I want so I'm going to try getting the basic premise over the next six months in my spare time.

By the way I used speech to text on my phone for this because I'm not at my PC. I will reread this tomorrow to check if there's any bad grammar and fix it then.
