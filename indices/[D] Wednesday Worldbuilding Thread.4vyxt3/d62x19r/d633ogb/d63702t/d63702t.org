I kept it vague and was hoping for some out there answers as my idea is fairly general and based around the story a lot. I was expecting more general 'I really liked X from game ABC, but Y made it suck, so if you did X without Y, it would be cool, but you could do it like Z to make it fit a rational system.'

A dynamic system with freeform spell creation (a la some of the Minecraft mods) is way beyond my abilities, but one day I would like to work on one.

That said, my system would be points-style with spells/abilities/manapool all being affected by the number of points you put into it.
