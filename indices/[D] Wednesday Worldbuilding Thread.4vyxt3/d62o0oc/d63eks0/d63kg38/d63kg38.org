Also on the note of cultures: while there are various subgroups within mainstream Aglo culture (in the same way that Western Civilization is swallowing up everything else but still has variations), there are two main divisions outside it: Vukojebina and the Atomic Pirates.

Vukojebina is a Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian word which means "place in the middle of nowhere" but literally translates to "Wolf-fuckness." Xenologists used it to translate the Aglo term for the desert that dominates the southwestern portion of the planet's supercontinent (named Astra-Gondwana). Aglos live in trees, so they're very hesitant about this idea of a dry, very flat place where there are no trees for you to run around in and all your nimbleness means nothing. Even a minor predator might get you.

Understandably, nobody actually /wants/ to live here, which means that it's populated by the descendants of people who were driven here. Mainstreamers don't like the Vukojebinans because the latter are stereotyped as brigands who will attack you, then flee into the desert where you can't get to them; for their part, the Vukojebinans don't like this view, and moreover are resentful of the fact that their ancestors were treated so poorly.

The Atomic Pirates are a different story. Around the continent of Astra-Gondwana are a number of islands* with cultures that with stunningly similar histories: aglos traditionally don't like sailing (it's nothing like the forest, super-hurricanes are horrible horrible things, etc.), so people who settled these islands were uniformly risk-takers, perhaps stupidly brave, and often had a reason to run away. Like the Vukojebinans, they don't have a stellar reputation, but they've staked out a place for themselves by having developed nuclear weapons. Nowadays they're...maybe like Russia, in terms of international reputation: maybe you like them, maybe you hate them, but either way they have nukes and your opinion doesn't matter. Mainland aglos have nukes too, nowadays, but one of the Atomic Pirate islands got to them first (and shared, because the Atomic Pirates have a sense of shared kinship via similar experiences) and that had a huge impact.

*All named after (1) Wild West outlaws (e.g. Holliday), (2) Western actors (e.g. Eastwood), (3) female pirates (e.g. Delahaye, Lo Hon-Cho), and (4) Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (though these islands are more often called the Magnificent Seven). The one exception is "German Freddy Island," which is a reference to an alt!history novella where Nietzsche goes to the West and gets wrapped up in events at the O.K. Corral.

1 and 2 are off the west coast of Astra-Gondwana, along with some western islands that are named after western pirates. The rest are off the east coast.
