Wow! That other info was really cool, I love the concept art. And the Hawaiian caterpillars. The earth is a really weird and wonderful place....

Would love to read your writeup but again I'm not sure if I'll be able to come up with cool and creative ideas. But I love reading about aliens, and I wish I didn't have to read entire sci-fi novels to do so (not that I don't like reading sci-fi novels, of course, but it puts a limit on how quickly I can read about aliens!). Dragon's Egg still has my favourite aliens, even though they are really quite anthropomorphic, insomuch as sesame sized amoeba-shaped intelligent beings that live on the surface of neutron stars can be considered anthropomorphic...
