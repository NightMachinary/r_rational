You could make the case either way.

My interpretation is no, a human would not physically transform. Monsters can do that because their bodies are insubstantial and held together by magic and hope - Flowey, Undyne, and the Amalgamates exhibit some shapeshifting even without human souls. While human bodies are made of ordinary matter, so they can't be disassembled and rebuilt in that way.

But in the end, it depends on the nature of bodies and souls, which is quite a bit up to interpretation.
