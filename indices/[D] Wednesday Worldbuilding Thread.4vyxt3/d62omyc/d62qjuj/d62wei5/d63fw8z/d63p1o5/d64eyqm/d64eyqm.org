Is there anything special that makes Boss Monsters unique? Feel free not to answer if that's plot-relevant, by the way.

When you say that complementary DT acts as a booster, are you meaning that it gets... "aspected", for lack of better term, toward the other six traits (or Hope and Compassion)? Or are you referring to its effects on monsters?

Thank you very much for this response, regardless!
