Human SOULs (I.E. hearts) are made of a combination of the seven traits (Determination, Patience, Bravery, Integrity, Perseverance, Kindness, and Justice), but contain very little Magic. They do still have some magic, though, because at least seven Wizards existed at some point in the past.

Anyway, a human who has absorbed a monster soul likely wouldn't change much on a physical level, since human bodies have true substance rather than just being a magical projection of the soul. But the increase in Magic could give them a visible aura or nimbus of a sort, appropriate to the magic of the monster they killed (such as a fiery aura, taken from either Tauriel or Asgore).
