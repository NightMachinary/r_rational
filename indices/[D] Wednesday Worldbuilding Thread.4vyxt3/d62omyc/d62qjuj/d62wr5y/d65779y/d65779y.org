A note on undyne's determination: It does not actually seem to be able to save her from death, only delay it. In the neutral route, if you reduce her to zero health, she pulls herself together with determination, but even if you stop attacking, she still keeps falling apart anyway, and eventually melts. No idea how that effects speculation, but it's worth noting.
