Well, I've gotten the impression that there are two primary things that distinguish monster souls (and this is a general statement; Boss Monsters seem different in this regard) from human ones: that because of their lack of physicality, their bodies and soul are inseparable enough to be considered one and the same for /most/ purposes, and the metaphysical Determination that humans possess that allows them to overcome the limitations of their bodies.

That this Determination seems to be stored partially in the physical based on Alphys' experiments is curious, and curiouser still that Undyne seems able through sheer force of will to generate her own beyond that which her body can handle. She is an exceptionally interesting case, and shows that DT isn't solely limited to humans. Additionally, she seems capable of producing /additional/ mass to replace that lost in an attack -- even to the point that she might otherwise have died -- though this does have limits which need be explored.

Most monsters fall apart instantly upon reaching zero health; the exceptions seem to be those that have the same drive to keep living -- in that moment -- that humans are renowned for.

Regarding your actual questions (my mind got away from me for a bit there): As to the first, primarily it is that a monster's soul provides a blueprint for and generates their body. This is also the reason why monsters often seem to wear their heart on their sleeves. While the 'shell' of their body doesn't leave them exactly open, their soul -- the 'culmination of [their] being' is far more exposed than in humans. This is also what leaves them more open to the emotion behind attacks than humans are. As far as its other effects, I suspect that in the world of Undertale, that same openness is what lends monsters prowess with magic.

While it is said that monster souls are made of love, hope, and compassion, the same book states that 'the absolute nature of SOUL is unknown.' So I'm not sure that we do really know what monster souls are made of.

The one thing that I haven't been able to figure out in any capacity is why monsters are capable of absorbing human souls, and vice versa, but are incapable of absorbing the other.
