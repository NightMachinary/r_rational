Because the guy who was renting my apartment moved out, meaning that instead of having a comfortably positive income I now have a significantly negative one. Ergo, I need to ramp up the various money-making activities I'm working on.

On that subject, would you use the following:

A site that does raffles as a complement to Kickstarter. A creator uses KS to fund their product, then periodically runs a raffle afterwards for prizes like "early access to next chapter" or "cameo in next chapter".

A friend and I have been talking about building this and we're trying to get market validation.
