This chapter was good. Nice portrayel of how...problematic, we'll say, Hinata's mental state is, as well as how her team-mates are concerned over her. And how she keeps mis-interpreting said concern as embarrassment, disappointment or coddling. Sadly, to the point of personal injury and collapse.

The little bits of lore sprinkled in were nice as well - the reference of a specific jumping style for tree-branch travel, along with how genjutsu can still effect folk with magic eye Bloodline such as the Byakugan or Sharingan. Finally, the mention of some sort of 'is this all a dream' belief which has formed from Genjutsu use, which I believe actually has some analogue in this reality...

Oh, and the surprise Orochimaru attack. That wasn't expected at all.

EDIT: Also, how do I get the emails when you update on your website again? I think it involved registering the forum you post the story in manually, but I couldn't figure it out when I tried. I'm vaguely concerned I'll miss updates when you stop updating the FF.net version.
