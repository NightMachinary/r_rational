It feels like there's a chunk missing between chapters. Chapter 5 ended in town, after gathering equipment, and there should've still been another day in town before anything else happened. It's jarring to find the group suddenly getting ambushed in a forest. Sure, some of that was the intentional "this is Genjutsu" thing, but since they seem to have actually left, to continue on with their mission, it'd help to have some kind of transition explaining that. Possibly in Chapter 5 itself, which I understand was cut short when it was originally posted.

Also, typo:

  "ATTACK!" she yelled, surging to her feet and sending /foot/ spilling everywhere.
