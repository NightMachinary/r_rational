Yeah, I've been lazy/forgetful about updating the ToC because the forum is, you know, /right there/ and it's going to be a while before there's enough threads to roll to a second page. And even when they do, you can just hit 'Last Page' to get to thread #1. I might just end up deleting the ToC because it's pretty redundant.
