Thanks, folks. Posting relevant details: - The title is "After Dark". - Link to the story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9847401/1/After-Dark]]

Warning: it runs to some 200,000 words, being a true novel rather than a novella. There are 111 chapters, in seven story arcs, though I couldn't see how to use subdivisions like that on FF.net. The first arc explores the events around the end-game from the point of view of people running around without a full picture of tevents. So the story starts slowly.
