Standard fantasy setting under federation of standard good kingdoms are under attack by standard fantasy zombies (though later on all these gain more depth) and do the standard fantasy thing of summoning a hero from another world to theirs to retrieve the standard fantasy magic sword and save the day.

They get him, but also accidentally grab a materials engineer. Uplift ensues as steel is developed, magic is quantified, and the might of a 21st century society is weighted against that of the ever more dangerous zombie hordes in this ever-expanding war in a complex web of politics, magic, and economics.
