That "attack" seems like it was just a huge suicide. Now they have no spell cannons, I'll be quite surprised if the zombies are significantly depleted, and it sounds like the firestorm is just going to wash back and wreck their base as well..

A little worried about the A/N as well, but I guess I'll just have to trust since he's obviously a better writer than me.
