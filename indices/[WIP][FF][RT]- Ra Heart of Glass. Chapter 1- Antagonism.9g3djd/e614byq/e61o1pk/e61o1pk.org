Shouldn't you be warning people /before/ they've read the first chapter?

Regarding the chapter itself, I think you need to make their identities at the start more clear. In particular, this line confused me.

  At least, he assumed it was her daughter, because they look exactly alike.

I thought it was hilarious because I perceived it as calling attention to Laura and Natalie being near-identical twins. But instead of being recognized as twins, the bartender mistook them for mother and daughter. This proved not to be the case, of course, but I think you need to make it immediately clear that this person is /not/ Nat. As it is, it felt very jarring to have the-person-I-think-is-Nat speaking in a way that is completely wrong for Natalie.

Then there's Laura building some kind of ad hoc company that consists of selling her ideas (or is it mana? Exactly what she's doing is unclear) also seems off. Partly, I just don't think she'd be happy with writing spells for other people to profit from. But also, if she's going to be ambitious on any level, why this? The company she built is apparently predicated on desiring wealth, which she's never shown interest in before. Everything she's ever done was for a goal to the point that she didn't care about finishing her PhD and she didn't care about the pay at Hatt Group. Her new life isn't wholly inconsistent but I feel like you need to explain how or why she has come to pursue something that is so meaningless by comparison. What motivated her?
