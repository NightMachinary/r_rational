The way I envision Laura's accumulation of wealth (which depending on if it fits in, I may go into more detail in a later chapter) is something like: the mana storage/transport company she talks about in Iceland becomes successful simply by virtue of the fact that no one else is (or can figure out how) to do it. Ed Hatt buys the company because he sees the potential to make even more money. Laura agrees, not because she cares about the money, but because she sees the opportunity to do more experiments and research on how to "break out". None of them pan out, but several of them are very novel and have serious business applications. Hatt buys the rights to them, always lowballing. Laura doesn't care enough to negotiate.

You are correct in that she's not happy. She's profoundly /unhappy/. She really doesn't care about money, she's just sort of fallen ass-backwards into it and doesn't know what to do with it. She's basically given up on the idea of breaking out of the simulation and now just sort of fucks around aimlessly.
