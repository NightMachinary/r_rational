Ahh. (Thank you!)

Word of God: The belligerent man was indeed speaking a different language from the one being used.

Secret Narrator-Bypassing Word of God: The narrator and the belligerent man were both visibly Caucasian. The others in that location were not, and (not including the belligerent man) were aware that the narrator had sworn a solemn oath not to use his native language while in that country for the purpose of language improvement through complete immersion. After the language being used was rejected by the belligerent man, the narrator requested third-party explanation to the man due to understanding what was being said, but {feeling bound to not}/{being unwilling to} use the same language to reply.
