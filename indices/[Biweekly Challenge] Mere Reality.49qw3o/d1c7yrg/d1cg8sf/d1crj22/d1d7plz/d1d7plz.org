Abusive mother inculcates in the child a desire to avoid interpersonal strife above all things; may or may not have high-functioning Asperger's; doesn't understand certain social cues, so he doesn't notice them and interprets it as being ignored; surrounds himself with those who first accept him, not wanting there to be strife and conflict; all his friends have different culture than him, and some (the belligerent man and his girlfriend) are racist; his girlfriend/wife cannot fathom why he does some things, leading to gross miscommunication for which their daughter suffers.

That's the primary scenario I had in mind. Another may be that he has trouble with empathy because of his upbringing, meaning he doesn't understand interactions that don't have an obvious logic to them, or interactions that require he intuit an underlying context. It could also be that he's racist, and assumes everyone that looks different speaks a different language; even if that person speaks his language, he'll think it was another one and his brain won't process the information.
