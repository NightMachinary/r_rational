The [[http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/aliens/images/f/fa/Monolith.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width/254?cb=20100901202040][black monolith]] floated above the rocks, surveying all beneath it. Computers more powerful than the entire computing power of the sentient race on the planet made calculations, comparisons, plans, critiques. Senors and probes swept across the surface of this third planet from the son analyzing every lifefrom from the birds that flew up high to the bacteria that swam the rocky tunnels miles beneath the surface.

It had been ordered to uplift all lifeforms to an appropriate intelligence. However, it had also been ordered to respect any local civilizations in an appropriate and polite manner. The local intelligent lifeforms, bilateral bipidel furless milk bearing animals, were heavily dependent on a number of lifeforms for their survival. Even their own cells were filled with defanged bacteria which handled their respiration.

Eventually it settled on a compromise. It would only uplift bilateria animals, allowing those that remained to feast on plants and fungi and bacterial products as much as they needed.

It's femtotech probes started to twist and rearrange the atoms of every non intelligent bilateral organism on the planet simultaneously. Thin strands of [[http://www.aleph.se/Nada/Game/Fukuyama/technology.html][computronium]], super dense computing power made from constantly produced and evaporated black holes, were interlaced and interwoven into every organism's brain or nervous system. Where necessary compromises were made to respect the biological imperatives of each, deviations chosen to maximize variety. For some that lacked appropriate ways to indicate their intelligence speaking organs were given, light sensors, auditory sensors as well as enhanced muscles to allow body language communication from organism to organism and emotional intelligence. They would be able to communicate with and interact with their fellow intelligent beings now. As appropriate it improved the agility of some organism's [[http://www.harunyahya.com/image/the_world_of_ants/ant5.jpg][tool manipulation organs]] so that they could better interact with technology.

Then, its task complete, it waited. This would serve as a good first modification. It would wait and see the consequences before continuing.
