So, what you're wondering is given that the "Wizard" is doing something to allow all these things uplifted thought, how it could /possibly/ be restricted to your bilaterian cutoff?

A simple solution comes to mind: it's the brain.

All bilaterians have something of a brain, even if it's only a slightly-larger ganglion of neurons at the front-end of the creature's nerve cord. Thus, it's possible that whatever-does-the-uplifting either sought out or was only able to affect things with that trait; this could be intentional, or it could be a case where the "wizard" simply told his spell/optimizing AI/simulator program/plot-relavent McGuffin to "work on anything with a brain" without thinking over the consequence, or defining "brain" more specifically.

Of course, the question of whether a brain is needed somehow or whether the "spell" could have been set to go off on "anything with a heart" or "anything containing DNA" is interesting.
