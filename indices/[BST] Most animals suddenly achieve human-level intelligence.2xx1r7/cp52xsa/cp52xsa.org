Maybe it was a project, designed to make the human race smarter. The wizard miscalculated, because (arbitrary rule) you can't make anything smarter than yourself alone. There was also a targeting issue, where the wizard targeted the brain, and to ensure he got the entire population, made it target all brains sufficiently similar to his own. This spell/device/process found that all Bilateral brains were sufficiently similar to upgrade, and continued working until the soft cap (the wizards own intelligence) was reached.
