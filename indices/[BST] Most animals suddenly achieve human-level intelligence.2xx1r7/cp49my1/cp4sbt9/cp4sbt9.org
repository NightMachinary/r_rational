I'd guess something in-between, with brain being referenced for various interface tasks like where to get sensory data to feed the soul, where to put it's motor output, from where to retrieve the seed memories and personality, and how to not add multiple souls to the same organism. Conceivably, you could have made it work on any neuron, or on anything with DNA, but to get results actually continue the existing "individuals" of higher animals would have been a LOT more programming work.
