It all depends on how removed from real-world science you want to be, as well.

In the real world, this is simply not possible in many animals, without other, significant changes to their physiology. Sentience simply isn't possible in some lower level animals, from a physical point of view. Things like high level cognition take up lots of space, even when optimized. So that scenario is impossible, from a real world point of view. So we're going to need to depart from it a bit.

Magical means? As far as magic goes, as Vulcan said, a mechanism through which souls are linked to animals can be a viable explanation. I'd prefer a fridge-horror type scenario though, where he uses actual human embryos, held in stasis, but their minds, through temporal manipulation, are accelerated to use. And you can accelerate it to whatever point in life you need. So the wizard could pick and choose how developed he wants different animals to be.

From a scientific perspective, as I said, the physiology of most animals isn't right for sentience. You can probably bioengineer most apes and monkeys with slightly larger brains and some reconfigured neural pathways and gift them with human level intelligence. But doing this all remotely, through some form of pathogen or nanotechnology, isn't feasible, to say the least. Even with advanced technology, that seems a stretch. You still need material for all that reworking, and mass is still mass. Can't pull it out of thin air. So I'd propose, from a scientific angle, microprocessors. Powerful supercomputers, at the nanite scale. Geared towards human neural pathing, and configured to feed off of the organism for its power. They'll replicate in the organism(s), interface with its brain, and essentially emulate sentience. That would be my suggestion from the technology aspect.

TL;DR: You can try doing it in 2 ways. Magic or Science. Magic = Bind human embryo's who've been mentally accelerated temporally to animals through some ritual and spell. It would probably have to be self propagating and/or affect a very large area.

Tech = Make self replicating nanobot supercomputers that travel like a pathogen "infecting" animals, and emulating sentience.
