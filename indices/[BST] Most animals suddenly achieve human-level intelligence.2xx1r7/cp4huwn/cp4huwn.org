On June 27th, 2019, dolphin-kind attempted a desperate experiment. Humans were clearly intelligent, but they didn't appear to care about their marine cousins. The humans were killing the krill with industrial poisons and starving the fish eaters by depleting fish stocks. Even the orcas were finding hunting to be less than what they needed. Mercury poisoning was taking it's toll on every oceanic race. Within another few years, it would not be possible to generate a sufficiently potent gestalt to create the connection. The great whales and orcas were finally convinced to assist, despite their doubts.

The experiment was a success! Humans could now understand marine mammals, but the success was more expansive than expected. The shared intelligence had gone beyond humankind. All mammals and even some highly developed birds and reptiles were caught in the merger.

Humankind now knew, without a doubt, that they were not the only intelligences on the planet. Unfortunately, there was a serious flaw. The great whales and orcas who had provided so much of the mental potential for the experiment were horrified when they could not break free of the mental connection. They were now apparently the basis of a worldwide gestalt intelligence.

Humanity wasn't the basis of the gestalt, but their mental presence was huge. Every animal race connected into the network began a mental transformation, becoming more human in their intelligence profile. For some animals this wasn't a great shift. The marine mammals, elephants, swine, and some primates were quite intelligent, thank you very much, but after nearly a hundred years, most mammals larger than three kilos in mass had human-level intelligence. Mammals smaller than that had intelligence based on their brain mass. Crows, ravens, parrots, crocodiles, alligators, and geckos were far smarter than they had ever been before, idiot-savant intelligences, brilliant in some ways but sadly lacking in others.

The dolphins were ostracized by the great whales, orcas, elephants and other highly intelligent species, including humans. The once-less-intelligent races, however, were very appreciative of their new intelligence, for the most part.

Despite their differences, nearly all animals except cats and dogs opposed humanity's rulership of Earth. A vast, uneasy alliance of the nonhuman races formed.
