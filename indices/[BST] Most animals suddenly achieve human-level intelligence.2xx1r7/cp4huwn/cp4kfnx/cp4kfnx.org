  On June 27th, 2019, dolphin-kind attempted a desperate experiment. Humans were clearly intelligent, but they didn't appear to care about their marine cousins. The humans were killing the krill with industrial poisons and starving the fish eaters by depleting fish stocks. Even the orcas were finding hunting to be less than what they needed.

Some orcas tend to eat dolphins, so presumably the dolphins weren't too moved by their plight.
