I'm not so sure that's all he's asking for. Saying "an intelligence increasing-virus did it [increasing the intelligence of bilaterian animals]" doesn't say what the intelligence-increasing mechanism is, it doesn't say how it works, only that the thing that triggers that process is a virus. Maybe something with symbiotic relationships would work? As the old saying goes, two brains [capable of communicating with each other] are better than one, and two million brains [all capable of communicating with each other] are also better than one. Although I think it would probably be REALLY difficult to make all bilateral animal species sentient with the exact same mechanism, since different animals have different nervous systems. Maybe something with semi/quasi-intelligent nanotechnology or something? Colonies of millions of artificial microbes that get carried in the water and on dust particles and each get inside a host specimen and figures out how to increase that specimen's intelligence from the inside as well as spread that intelligence to the specimen's offspring. The reason the artificial microbes don't just augment the animal's intelligence directly by becoming part of the organism permaently would be because there are a lot more bilaterian animals to smarten then the artificial microbes.

In fact, maybe the story could be about humanity on the verge of at least several extinction events and they need more collective intelligence (and maybe a different variety of mental skills from the minds of different species too) to solve all their problems. The reason this scientist decided to create his intelligence improving artificial nanotechnological life is because they can spread through ecoystems fairly quickly, faster than they approach the singularity/whatever other risk-of-extinction events they're trying to make it through. The intelligence-improving artificial microorganisms can only work with the material of the organisms themselves, and can only improve their intelligence for a certain amount of time before they die. The artificial microorganisms have no means of reproduction on their own, so they can only be created in the lab.

Of course, if you're going for the fantasy version, a magical researcher employs a druid, a necromancer and an Empath to figure out how the sentient mind/soul works and decides to reproduce the mechanism that makes them work on other forms of life that don't have sentience. To show off, and just because he can.
