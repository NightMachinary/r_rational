Aether current is a natural physical phenomenon that has the intrinsic tendency to create consciousness and intelligence in a form known as the soul. All higher animals possess souls, and souls are the source of their intelligence. They all possess a true brain, which houses the soul and passes the souls orders onto the body, which evolved in /Bilateria/ from pseudo-brains, which coordinate simple movements.

For most of evolutionary history the strength of the aether on Earth was relatively low. As such, simple brains could only house simple souls, and animals evolved ever more sophisticated methods for guiding aether currents to make larger souls. Soon, however, the sun will pass all a region of very high aether. Then all these adaption will become unnecessary, and any animal with a true brain will also possess full consciousness.
