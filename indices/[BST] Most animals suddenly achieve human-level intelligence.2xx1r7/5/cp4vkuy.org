An alien intelligence has solved arbitrarily strong AI (which requires arbitrarily high resources to run (and they aren't keen on making anything smarter than themselves due to the friendliness problem)), and these aliens know the minimum brain size and optimal arrangement to produce various types of AI. It turns out that humanlike AIs can be reduced and optimized significantly compared to the bullshit trial and error of evolution.

These aliens are eco-activists, and have a desire to uplift compatible lifeforms to the level of the dominant species, whenever the dominant species becomes intelligent enough, dominant enough, and technologically advanced enough to end up wiping out all other species through accident or malice. In this way, the other inhabitants might express their own informed consent. All animals, including below-average humans, whose brains meet the minimum size requirements, have been restructured and optimized, resulting in human-level intelligences. It turns out this prevents very small animals who lack the size, or very simple animals who lack the brains, from being eligible.

Soon, tardigrades will control the Earth.
