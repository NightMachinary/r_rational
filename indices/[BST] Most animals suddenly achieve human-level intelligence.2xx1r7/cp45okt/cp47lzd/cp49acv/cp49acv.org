Maybe the wizard did this accidentally? While recreating human souls, he mistakenly released a few hextillion into the wild, where they promtly attached themselves to any animal with the right hardware to support a soul.

The "we did this semi-deliberately to avoid an oncoming catastrophe" idea sounds good - it gives the story a driving conflict, and is less inherently contrived than the Scientific Accident plot device. Potential stumbling blocks: It risks the Oncoming Catastrophe eclipsing the fun moral quandaries. And you've got intelligence enhancement that can bring a tapeworm to the human level, so you should at least nod in the direction of the intelligence explosion and explain why it hasn't already happened. Otherwise, it sounds good.
