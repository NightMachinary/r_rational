Maybe the "virus" isn't magical, but was designed by a mischievous highly advanced alien civilization. (Basically indistinguishable from magic, to us.)

The "virus" either itself is or contains genetic information that can implement an alien better-than-human general intelligence inside very tiny nano-machinery, equipped with certain versatile tools to modify physiology. The alien intelligence uses these tools to modify various factors and increase the intelligence of the being it resides in or of its offspring...modifying the genetic code of the creature's gametes, for example, permanently uplifting all descendants. It chooses to only do this for bilaterals.

The humans don't need to know about the aliens who dropped the virus. All they know is that all of a sudden animal behavior started changing, accompanied with sophisticated genetic and physiological changes at the cellular level not previously seen in nature and clearly not evolutionary in origin.

We can also say the intelligent alien nano machinery actively makes some effort to avoid human detection, so the humans in the story know that what's happening isn't natural but never really figure it out completely. The reader need not necessarily be told, but the author can write the story with a comfortably consistent world in mind.
