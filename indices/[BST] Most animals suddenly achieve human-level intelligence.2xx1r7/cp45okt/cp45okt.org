Maybe the wizard, or the mad scientist, was researching a magical virus that lives in people's brains and makes them a little smarter. Naturally he tried on animals first, but then the virus escaped and randomly mutated to make their hosts a /lot/ smarter.

Also the mutated virus is now harmful to humans, otherwise everyone would be super-smart.
