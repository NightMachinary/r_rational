  How would they prevent the parents to go to court over this without going full on black ops kidnapping on them?

Practically speaking, if the parents objected then Mary's people would have few routes to take and it probably wouldn't happen. This is not, however, because Mary objects to kidnapping everyone per se, but because the kids probably wouldn't agree to the plan and going ahead with it despite that is a golden recipe for things turning awful.

If, say, Austin's parents said "no," then Mary (or, more likely, Bert) would sit down, explain the situation to Austin, and propose a few options. One of these would be "Don't do anything, but we'll keep in touch and...we'll see how things turn out, and in the meantime, obviously, don't tell your parents." Another one of them, though, would be "Are you cool with your family being abducted to a black site where their needs will be seen to and you'll be able to visit them whenever?" (Assuming, of course, that Mary and Bert thought it wouldn't be a horrible idea just to bring up the option).

You won't be seeing Austin's family for some time, though, so I'll just go ahead and confirm ahead of time that Bert didn't need to have this conversation.

Hannah's foster parents, on the other hand, plain don't know what she's up to. As far as they're concerned, Child Protective Services moved her again and that's that. Hers was an easier situation, though.
