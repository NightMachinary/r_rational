  “There is no consent form,” replies Blank. “Either you want to do this or you don't. Your parents are not going to decide this for you. Really, they'd probably refuse to give permission to put you in harm's way, if it were up to them. Most people aren't good about weighing costs when it comes to their loved ones.”

This is weird. So much said before that paragraph makes it seem like they are going "by the book" so to speak. But then they remove the right of the parents to decide for their children and expect that to remain unchallenged? How would they prevent the parents to go to court over this without going full on black ops kidnapping on them?
