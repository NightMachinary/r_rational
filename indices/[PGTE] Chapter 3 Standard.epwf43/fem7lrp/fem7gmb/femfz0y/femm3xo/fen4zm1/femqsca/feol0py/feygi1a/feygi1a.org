I would have bet 2:1 that Akua would trap an angel, by heroism or larceny to become a heroine, but Tyrant and Hierach already used that trick so I'd need a few chapters to see the tone of akua and angelic interactions to be willing to make a projection this book, but it does still seem likely.

Anybodies guess if it's comes out as loyalty or Cat riding her new traitorous lieutenant though.
