One of the things that I like about PGTE is that the internal rules of the universe allow for big cheesy moments to be entirely justified. Eg making an anguished declaration of love mid battle is a viable strategy for getting a power up and turning the tide. So from a readers perspective you can have these kind of indulgent moments without violating suspension of disbelief
