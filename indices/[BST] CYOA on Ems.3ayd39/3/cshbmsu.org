Some of the particular CYOAs I'm feeling inspired by:

- Star Dust, at [[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/StarDustCYOA]] , creates a whole world out of some ship-building choice-making.
- Rebellion, at [[https://feathersnake.wordpress.com/2015/01/30/rebellion-cyoa/]] , has a system with multiple types of points to buy.
- Treasure Hunter, at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/310e5h/treasure_hunter_cyoa/]] , lets the user create a nearly complete story (out of a number of possible stories) for themselves.
- Super Soldier, at [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/2fj7fd/super_soldier_cyoa/]] , demonstrates a basic character-creation process.
