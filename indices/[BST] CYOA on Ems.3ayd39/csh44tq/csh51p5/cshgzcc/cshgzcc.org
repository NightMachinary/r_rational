Sure, and people talk about video being "on tape" when they really mean a hard disk, but when they're talking specifically about the technology they refer to DVRs instead of VCRs. Heck, "tivo" has pretty much become a generic replacement for "tape".

They're talking about SSDs lapping hard disks in peak storage in 2016. Hard disks will remain cheaper for a while, but I suspect that by 2020 nobody's going to use hard disks for anything but super high capacity "nearline" data center storage. By 2040 it'll be like talking about film cameras.

Anyway, I just found it kind of jarring. That's all.
