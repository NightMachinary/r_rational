Do you mean a choosable-path-adventure ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure]["Choose Your Own Adventure"]] is copyrighted), like the ones that you might have come across when you were a kid? Those generally go something like:

  If you pluck the gem from its altar, go to page 9.

[[http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Clone-An-Interactive-Adventure/dp/0982853726]["Trial of the Clone"]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/To-Be-Not/dp/0982853742]["To Be Or Not To Be"]] are modern examples of that, with more complex features like inventories, stat tracking, etc.

Or do you mean something more like what's in that subreddit, which are single image choices that don't have further consequences beyond the reader's own imagining?

Edit: Also, reddit formatting tip, put an extra return after "Choose Your Origin:" and your list will have nice-looking bullets. Also, if you install [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]] you can get a Live Preview to show you what your post will be formatted like.
