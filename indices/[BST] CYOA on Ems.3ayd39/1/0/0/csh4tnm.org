Well, I can't help with snazzy images, but I /can/ help with the inspiration/imagination thing. If you look at the top posts from that subreddit, you'll see one thing that they tend to have in common; all the choices are positive.

I think the reason that people find this more compelling (assuming upvotes are roughly equivalent to "compelling") is that they like to imagine themselves in a good circumstance, and they don't like to imagine themselves in a bad circumstance. People don't like choosing the least-worst option, and if they /do/ have to chose the least-worst option, they don't tend to give it that much more thought. It doesn't capture them in the same way.

So you want your prompts (which is what every choice should be) to expand the possibilities outward, and each needs to be positively compelling in its own right. You /especially/ can't have a mix of good and bad options, because no one is going to give that much thought to the bad options after they've seen how bad those bad options are (which means you should just not write the bad options in). The inspiration comes from people trying to evaluate.

(The one big caveat in regards to negative choice is something like [[/r/wouldyourather]], but the purpose there isn't imagination/inspiration, it's meant to reveal something about a person. There's little lasting impact to those, I've found.)
