I wasn't referring to a dearth of CYOAs in general (of which there are a lot more than exist on the subreddit; go to archive.moe and search for the subject "cyoa" in the /tg/ board) but of Prison CYOAs, which are rare relative to the genre. The reason is that they start out with you being in a shitty situation and giving you points to make it less shitty but not, at any point, totally non-shitty.

Every so often somebody else makes another CYOA determined to "break the trend" and plop you in a shitty situation that you can only partially alleviate, and like all the others it falls into obscurity almost immediately.
