Now /that/ is a criterion I likely wouldn't have thought of, especially so early in the design process, but which is worth keeping in mind.

In a number of the CYOAs I've looked at, there are /some/ negative choices - but they're generally provided with some balancing mechanism to make them worth considering anyway, such as a point-build process. That's why I threw in the 'humanity score' in the post's examples. Combine that with a cash budget, and it should be feasible to tweak any given option to be a choice worth contemplating.
