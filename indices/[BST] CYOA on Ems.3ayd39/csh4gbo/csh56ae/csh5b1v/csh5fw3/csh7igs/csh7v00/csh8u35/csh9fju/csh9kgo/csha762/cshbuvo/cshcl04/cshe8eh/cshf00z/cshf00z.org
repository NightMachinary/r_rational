Quite possibly. Still, I find it fascinating that it's at least /plausible/ to discuss ems coming into being in just 20 years, as opposed to the usual Singularity timeline having them appear in around 35-40.

If it makes you feel any better, AI researchers who go em can, if someone pays for the electricity, be run nearly arbitrarily fast; so progress in non-WBE AI is likely to proceed quite quickly as soon as anyone cares to make the effort.

I expect the Overton window to have shifted to the point where Basic Guaranteed Income (or a Negative Income Tax) will be seen somewhere around the equivalent of how present-day left-wing parties' major planks are - maybe something around present-day views on health care. (Eg, taken for granted in Europe, decried as a communist abomination by the American right, etc, etc.)
