  How does an em make a living
#+end_quote

As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, my current candidates for ems' jobs are white-collar paper-pushing, driving a robot (such as a vehicle), human interaction (such as personal concierge), or lab-rat. All of these require, at the least, that the electricity used by the em's CPU be paid for, which seems likely to be a scarce resource to the time in question.

  How do they prevent the em from backing themselves up?
#+end_quote

By having root authority over the computer running the em's simulated brain.

  What stops the em society from reaching into the physical world and making themselves self-sufficient?
#+end_quote

Not having enough cash to research how to turn a robotic factory into a Von Neumann self-replicator, and then to buy the necessary resources to make one. (Which doesn't even get into the costs of /defending/ such a proto-Von-Neumann factory from hostile interests.)

#+begin_quote
  In short, why aren't they /powerful/?
#+end_quote

Biological humans have a rather extensive first-mover advantage, and in this timeline, sapient ems were only created five years ago.
