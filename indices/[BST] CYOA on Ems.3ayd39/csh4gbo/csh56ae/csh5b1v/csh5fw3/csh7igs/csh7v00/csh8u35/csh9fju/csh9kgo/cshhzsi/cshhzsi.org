  Wouldn't an em naturally want to carry, "the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it" to its logical limit and take a Pirate Party-type position on copyright?

Maybe. Or it might decide that since it's data it would like to have control of its own fate and not depend purely on physical and cryptographic copy protection to give people an incentive not to fork it into a torture sim. Especially since copy protection increases the possibility of catastrophic failure of any given instance.
