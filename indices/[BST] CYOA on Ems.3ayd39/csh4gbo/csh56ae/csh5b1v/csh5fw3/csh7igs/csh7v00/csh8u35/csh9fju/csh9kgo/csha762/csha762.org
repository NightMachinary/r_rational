  the substance of an em's life
#+end_quote

I'm focusing on a slightly more fundamental detail: Who has the physical power to flip off an em's power switch, and who has the legal right to delete an em? Compared to that detail, whether an em's memory of a book is considered a "copy" that has to be paid for seems something of a lesser detail - important, surely, but not quite as much as the em's basic survival.
