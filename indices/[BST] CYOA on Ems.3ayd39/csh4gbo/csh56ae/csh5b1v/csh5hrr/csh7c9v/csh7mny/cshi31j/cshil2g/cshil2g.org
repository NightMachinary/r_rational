It's been in my to-read pile for quite some time, but has never made it to the top.

(In case you're curious, not counting re-reading S.I. to refamiliarize myself, and various non-fiction research reading, my to-read pile is currently topped by the 40-odd Oz books, Pratchett and Baxter's "Long Utopia", the fourth-and-subsequent Lensman books, and selections from my collection of John Varley.) (... Okay, I just realized: something old, something new, something (frequently) borrowed (from), and something blue.)
