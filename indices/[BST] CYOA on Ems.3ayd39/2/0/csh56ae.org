I haven't even decided whether to include "physical location of server" as a selectable option with various limits (such as jurisdictions heavily influenced by Islamic law having a maximum humanity score for software that can be run there). Or whether to split 'employer' (Military, Intelligence, Corporate, Freelance, etc) from 'job' (white-collar, robot-control, human-interaction, research subject, etc).
