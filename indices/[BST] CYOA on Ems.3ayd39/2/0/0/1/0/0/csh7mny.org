  Maybe if you follow Kurzweilian predictions?

For the LoadBear thing, I just used straight-line extrapolations of present-day and historical trend-lines. With a few assumptions about em size, in 2035, the minimum cost to run an em is around $15 an hour; in 2040, $2 an hour; in 2045, $0.20 an hour; and by 2050, around $500 per year. This is probably underestimating how fast the tech will change once high-skill em researchers can be run at greater than realtime, but suffices for simple worldbuilding where there's a lack of a coherent model that includes the greater complexity.
