  ... I think that in order to have a conversation on much of your post, we would have to taboo a lot of the basic words, since the definitions I'm aware of seem to only partly overlap with the ones you're using.

Hence my inviting you to an entire subreddit devoted to tabooing the words and talking about what everyone really means. Contrary to the name, there are lots of pro-capitalist people on there who can discuss well.

But "social democracy", for instance, means something roughly like, "partial nationalization in some cases + welfare-state + pro-worker labor laws + capitalism". Or, if you prefer extensional training samples rather than intentional definitions, "that thing they had in post-WW2 Europe, until Thatcher mucked it up in Britain and then the rest of the Continent followed suit in the '90s."

  Given ems are people, with little necessarily in common other than their substrate, this is about as hard a question to answer as, say, "what do Canadians think of such-and-such a trade deal?".

It really isn't, because copyright law is directly about regulating the substance of an em's life: data. Ems can't exactly have any kind of a living environment to interact in or with without data, and copyright laws are all about restricting which bits of data can go where. Wouldn't an em naturally want to carry, "the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it" to its logical limit and take a Pirate Party-type position on copyright?
