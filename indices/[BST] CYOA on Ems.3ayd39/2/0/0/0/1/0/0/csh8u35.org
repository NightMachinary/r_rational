  Whenever I see such a term, I always wonder whether the intended meaning is 'anti-corporatist', as in against mercentalist oligarchies who conspire to prevent the rise of any competitors; or 'anti-competitionist', as in forbidding anyone from even trying to offer better services for lower cost than existing providers.

Neither. Rather than just pointing you to [[/r/socialism]] or some propaganda literature, we have a middle-ground subreddit entitled [[/r/DebateaCommunist]] where you could ask the relevant questions about what we mean by "anticapitalist". If you do want some propaganda literature, the /Communist Manifesto/ and /Debt: the First 5000 Years/ make very good sequels to Yvain's "Meditations on Moloch".

I honestly am starting to feel like someone needs to write "A Rationalist's Introduction to Why People Don't Like Capitalism and What They're Talking About", and since I'm the only one /this/ intensely interested in destroying capitalism, I'll probably have to do that. It might come after the entire rest of everything on my queue, but if it gets sufficiently delayed it'll come after I [[https://kitano25.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/e382a4e383a1e383bce382b8-11.jpg][pick up a Stone Mask and start yelling, "I REJECT MY HUMANITY, JOJO!"]] (That's actually a terrible idea, since I really don't want to subsist off blood and avoid going outdoors during daylight hours.)

The very short summary is: we are against /private, profit-seeking ownership of the means of production, and their operation via wage-labor/. The reason for italicizing that definition is because it's /important/: almost all economic systems have included /elements/ of communal cooperation, loose social cooperation (as between ordinary friends rather than tribe-mates or family members), trade and exchange, and hierarchical domination. /Capitalism/, as such, is a historically recent (1800s, more-or-less) and particularly pernicious arrangement of these elements according to the definition I gave, and in fact even capitalism has taken varied forms in different places and times, some more vicious and others even somewhat benign. Moreover, all of them were /instituted/ by the deliberate imposition, through violence (usually /state/ violence), of new ways of living and new ownership arrangements on existing populations.

Or, to sum it all up, we are talking about a system created by people, not about some kind of "naturally-occurring" economic phenomenon. In fact, the best argument usually made /for/ capitalism is that /naturally/ occurring economies are /really fucking poor/.

All capitalism's variations, by definition, are characterized by private, profit-seeking ownership of the means of production, and the operation of those means (such as machines and such) by wage-labor. And the standard anticapitalist criticism is that capitalism contains "internal contradictions", or in other words, it cannot keep the promises it makes in order to justify itself.

(So for example, capitalism promises cheap consumer goods, but then creates glut/depression/debt-crisis conditions in which the overwhelming majority of the population can't /afford/ those consumer goods. So you end up with "poverty in the midst of plenty", as Henry George put it in /Progress and Poverty/.)

  Of course, once you start having /ems/ around who compete with biological humans, then even competitionist capitalism may lead to Chinese-style "interesting" results...

Hence why we say that capitalism has "internal contradictions": in the limit as goods and labor grow more plentiful, investments grow more scarce (because the most productive potential enterprises already exist), and thus both workers' wages and the owners' rate of profit falls while wealth accrues to rent-extractors. This is an unintended, counterintuitive, undesirable, self-destructive, but /causal/ result: the attractor state of the system.

The usual counterargument is social democracy, which is actually a very good system for its available level of technology, but also has a tendency to be dismantled by ideologues trying to make a purer capitalism. Social democracy also contains its own internal contradictions, such as generosity to consumers, workers, and retirees eventually leading to a reduction in the rate of profit, thus creating capital flight.

*TL;DR: Capitalism, especially the particular variety of /neoliberal/ capitalism we experience in Western countries these days, is only one possible economic system among many, rather than [[https://unlearningeconomics.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/how-natural-is-capitalism-exactly/][a name abstracting over an inevitable fact of nature]]. You not only can but /should/ reasonably expect that increasingly powerful minds, unbound by physical bodies or today's laws, might invent something more suitable to their own circumstances than a linear extrapolation of today's economic system (which is itself a kludge-loaded dying whale with increasingly many band-aids strapped on to make old social arrangements keep sputtering on in the face of new technological and sociopolitical realities). For example, what would ems think of copyright?*
