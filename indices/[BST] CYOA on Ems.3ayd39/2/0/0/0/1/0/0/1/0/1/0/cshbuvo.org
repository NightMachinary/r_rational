  Compared to that detail, whether an em's memory of a book is considered a "copy" that has to be paid for seems something of a lesser detail - important, surely, but not quite as much as the em's basic survival.

How does an em make a living, presuming you have a scarcity-based economy and it's not just /free/, if not by producing digital goods, or using digital goods as tools to produce physical goods and services?

What about the copy of a book an em keeps on its /bookshelf/? Although the memory thing is actually pretty important, considering how many of your memories are inevitably going to contain what could arguably be called "copyrighted material". If your physics class used a copyrighted textbook, do your memories of the class constitute copyrighted data for which you have to pay? And what if you don't pay: do you have to forget physics?

This /was/ all covered in that video, "Life: the Singularity ruined by lawyers".

  Who has the physical power to flip off an em's power switch, and who has the legal right to delete an em?

How do they prevent the em from backing themselves up? What stops the em society from reaching into the physical world and making themselves self-sufficient?

In short, why aren't they /powerful/?
