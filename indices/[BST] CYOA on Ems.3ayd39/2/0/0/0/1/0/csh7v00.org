Whenever I see such a term, I always wonder whether the intended meaning is 'anti-corporatist', as in against mercentalist oligarchies who conspire to prevent the rise of any competitors; or 'anti-competitionist', as in forbidding anyone from even trying to offer better services for lower cost than existing providers.

There's a difference between the form of capitalism which Adam Smith espoused (and David Brin currently champions), and the form of capitalism preferred by the current reigning elite; and getting rid of the latter shouldn't necessarily mean getting rid of the former.

Of course, once you start having /ems/ around who compete with biological humans, then even competitionist capitalism may lead to Chinese-style "interesting" results...
