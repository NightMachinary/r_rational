  Settling down at his desk, he allowed Fawkes to step...

  Resigning himself to his fate, he reached out and grabbed...

  Leaning back in the chair, he closed his eyes and thought...

  Shrugging, he figured it wouldn't hurt...

  Walking up to Harry, Voldemort used a finger...

  Abandoning stealth, Harry dived over the gravestone...

  Rolling and ignoring the flash of pain, he ran like he had never run...
