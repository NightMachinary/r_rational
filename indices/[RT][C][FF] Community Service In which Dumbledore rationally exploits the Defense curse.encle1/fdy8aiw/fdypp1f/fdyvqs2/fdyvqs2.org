Why is so much fanfiction written the same way?

#+begin_quote
  As the noun verbed, Noun verbed blah blah blah.

  Noun verbed as the noun verbed.

  Gerunding blah blah blah, Noun verbed as the noun verbed.

  Noun verbed, gerunding as the noun verbed.

It's like when someone says "you're now aware of your own breathing and you can feel your tongue sitting in your mouth," once you notice it you're done for. I feel like more than half of the fics I look at have the word "as" or a gerund phrase or both within the first paragraph. If it pops up that close to the beginning, it's almost always a sign that that's just how the author writes. It's not something you can unnotice, and that makes it unpleasant to push through a story written that way.

"Dumbledore sighed as he verbed the noun, feeling blah blah blah blah." I feel like I've read that sentence a billion times. Most of the time I'll immediately close the fic if it opens with a sentence like that (this is mostly hyperbole - if it were strictly true then I'd never read fanfiction, but I /do/ almost always immediately close a fic if the first sentence starts like "Feeling like he was ancient, Dumbledore sighed as he blaaaah") but I pushed through this one because you posted it on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] with the [RT] tag.

I personally don't feel like it was really worth reading, but it /definitely/ shouldn't be marked as "rational." I thought it might have a spark of rationality hidden behind the bog-standard fanfiction-quality writing, but it doesn't, it's just a "clever" idea that isn't actually clever because the only reason why the pieces (all Death Eaters being captured, the Wizengamot being controlled by "Dumbledore's faction," a sentence of "community service" being a thing in the wizarding world) were in a position that allowed the idea to work in the first place is because of authorial fiat, and only reason the pieces /stayed/ in a position (the premise is that the Death Eaters got "community service" instead of Azkaban, so there's nothing stopping them from running around killing people or running away to hide in Australia) that allowed the idea to unfurl is because of authorial fiat.
