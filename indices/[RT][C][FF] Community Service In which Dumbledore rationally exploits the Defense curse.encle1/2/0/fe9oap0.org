Only responding to the first bit here: do you particularly dislike the grammatical structure? What do you prefer in its place? I don't /think/ gerund phrases particularly stand out to me over other constructions, though I can imagine they'd wear out their welcome if I saw them /everywhere/. Maybe you're reading the openings of too many fanfics? XD
