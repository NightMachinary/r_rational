Certainly. My original post assumes a certain level of authorial competence.

Card is wildly inconsistent both from book to book and from page to page within a single book, and all of his series face massive drop-offs in quality. Someone once wrote an article about how they think his work is written by committee. I thought /Ender's Shadow/ was good and to a lesser extent /Shadow of the Hegemon,/ and the final two books were pretty meh. Same with the Ender Quartet: /Ender's Game/ and /Speaker for the Dead/ are great, /Xenocide/ and /Children of the Mind/ both quite weak. Same with Alvin Maker: first half good, second half bad. I liked Pastwatch, although it was also very inconsistent.

But when Card is good, he's good, and a lot of his writing advice seems smart and useful.
