Having read your post, I find I agree with most of it. The only reservation I have is that the mechanics of writing being neglected is basically often enough to cause me to just quit reading a story before it has a chance to develop at all - if a story has malapropisms every third sentence, or uses case badly, or doesn't put new speakers into a new paragraph, or uses SMS shorthand like 'u' in place of 'you' or similar major mechanical errors, I will stop reading and not come back no matter what the plot or characters promise to become.

Perhaps it is because your writing is sufficiently well-developed that you already have mastered the difference between 'defiantly' and 'definitely', unlike seemingly half of fanfic writers. So for you advice about how to format your writing is basically worthless. However, a lot of people, especially fanfiction writers, have yet to master such difficult elements as "Dialogue from a new speaker should occur in a new paragraph" (this specific example is violated by 3 of the 17 newest English HP fanfic stories on fanfiction.net at the time of this writing within their first three paragraphs).

Basically, your own writing is not so bad that its terrible format errors eclipse the actual story you are trying to tell. But for some writers this is really, really not true and for them the advice 'come back when you've learned the basic mechanics of how to write in English' is warranted, if impolite, and before they fix that basic mechanical level of writing I won't ever read their fiction no matter how good the plot or characters are.

Basic mechanics of how to write, and discussions of similar matters, are not particularly helpful to you. But a lot of writers are not as competent in these matters as you, and therefore their stuff is doomed before it ever gets to the point of "Does this 'story' have a plot?" or "Do I care about any of the characters?".

Semi-off-topic: Finally, I am not entirely sure I would take serious writing advice from OSC about plot, characters, and so forth. The Wise Reader stuff I think is interesting, but I would take what he's written with a grain of salt. I personally found Ender's Game engaging and interesting, and one of my favorite novels in my youth (even though it aged poorly). However, I have never really been similarly engaged by anything else OSC has ever written - and I have tried a lot. I wasn't enthused by:

- Any of the Ender's Game sequels, including Children of the Mind/Xenocide or the Bean stuff
- Any of the Alvin maker books (tried reading three of them, couldn't even remember titles now).
- The Homecoming Saga (book 1, anyway)
- Pastwatch Christopher Columbus.
- A few non-series books (Wyrms, Magic Street, Enchantment).

The only thing he wrote besides Ender's Game that I liked at all was the Worthing Saga short fiction collection, and even then a lot of the short stories in it were forgettable (like 3 of them were actually memorable and good). It feels to me that whatever OSC's writing and editing process is, it only spits out a good worthwhile read once in every twenty times or less. Does any of his non-Ender's Game series get drastically better after the first book?
