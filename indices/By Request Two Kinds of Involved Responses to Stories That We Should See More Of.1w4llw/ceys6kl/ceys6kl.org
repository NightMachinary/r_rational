I'm pretty sure I don't have the literary knowledge to offer criticism of the first kind - takes a special kind of reader to produce that detailed critique and analysis, and I'm just not it. Nor are most people commenting on fanfic, hence the sentence-level focus on "this is worded clunkily" when you're not equipped to tear apart the work as a whole.

Introspecting and reporting the experience of reading though... that sounds more doable. Takes a watchful eye on your own reactions, but it is at least something I already notice, at least a little.
