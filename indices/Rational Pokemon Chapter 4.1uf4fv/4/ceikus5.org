How can they possibly scientifically say "higher cognitive functions"? Mew-two is a pokemon right? Also it implies mentally retarded people or perhaps people who already suffered brain damage could be used in the pokeball?

That leads me to believe that all pokemon in the universe are dumb (so no Mewtwo, etc), they're not classed as pokemon, or possibly seomthing else.

I wonder what about children or comatose people etc. And since they work on people why not attack others with them, team Rocket can use it to capture their enemies or soldiers. Brain damage better than death right
