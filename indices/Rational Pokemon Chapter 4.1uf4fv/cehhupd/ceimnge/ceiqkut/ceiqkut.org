    only outlaws etc. Team Rocket simulation attacks?

  This question seems to have gotten garbled somewhat?

It's a reference to the saying "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns" or more generally, "if you outlaw X, only outlaws will X" where X is both dangerous and a competetive advantage in a fight.

"Simulation attack" is an umbrella term for all the shenanigans you can get up to if you can simulate somebody and convince them that they're in reality. Conversational replay attacks, predicting behaviors, "we are simulating 1000 copies of you having this conversation, if you turn us down we'll torture them, how likely is it that you're the real one" etc.

  the transition utterly screws with their memory, sense of self, personality... essentially what we consider their "mind."

This does imply that Pokemon either have none of those things, or are unable to notice the difference. What about the smarter breeds? Capturing Mew == insanity? Is that how Mewtwo came about?
