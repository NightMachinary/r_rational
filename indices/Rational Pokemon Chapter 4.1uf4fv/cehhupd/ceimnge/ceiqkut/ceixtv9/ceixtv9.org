  It's a reference to the saying "If you outlaw guns, only outlaws will have guns" or more generally, "if you outlaw X, only outlaws will X" where X is both dangerous and a competetive advantage in a fight.

Yes, but there are still measures of warfare those in authority that consider themselves the "good guys" simply cannot condone by use.

Weaponizing the ability to effectively turn people into vegetables is one of them. Like biological warfare, criminals or terrorists may employ such tactics, but retaining the moral highground comes with some sacrifices.

  "Simulation attack" is an umbrella term for all the shenanigans you can get up to if you can simulate somebody and convince them that they're in reality. Conversational replay attacks, predicting behaviors, "we are simulating 1000 copies of you having this conversation, if you turn us down we'll torture them, how likely is it that you're the real one" etc.

1) People aren't conscious while in pokeballs, and upon exiting one would be too mentally damaged to remember any programmed experiences while in one.

2) If the above technological hurdles were theoretically leaped, it would still require belief on the part of the subject, which would be difficult as such a breakthrough would be secret.

  This does imply that Pokemon either have none of those things, or are unable to notice the difference. What about the smarter breeds?

Yes, this fic is based much more on the games than the anime, where the mean pokemon intelligence is much closer to a dog's than a human's. The smarter breeds are predominantly psychic types, and the whole psychic phenomenon is something I'm going to address eventually :) Suffice to say the ability to bend spoons doesn't require a human intelligence.

  Capturing Mew == insanity?
#+end_quote

Any pokemon with intelligence approaching the human level would be mentally harmed by being caught, yes: they might retain some superior intelligence, but it would be something like a lobotomy that removes their ability to think for themselves and, say, decide to fly away the second they're released from the ball.

  Is that how Mewtwo came about?
