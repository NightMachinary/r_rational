  only outlaws etc. Team Rocket simulation attacks?

This question seems to have gotten garbled somewhat?

  Oh, one thing that wasn't clear and that I do really want an answer to. Pokeballs dematerialize human, materialize again, human has brain damage. But Pokemon are aware in their balls. So does the brain damage happen on scanning, or on materialization?

Ok, so here's the way I'm envisioning it:

The transmutation from matter to energy and vice-versa is precise enough that it preserves just about everything organic that's part of the scanned organism.

This including all the cells and microbes and bacteria and whatnot that complex life forms contain within themselves, all in the same position they had been in. So when a pokeball absorbs a complex organism that, for example, has bacteria in their small intestine that assist in digestion, it all gets released in the same exact position it had been, rather than having those bacteria reform in its bloodstream or in somewhere in a bone or something.

The brain, however, is a different matter: creatures with basic perceptions of time and self-awareness can come through it more or less unharmed. Not exactly unchanged... but not detrimental to what humans want in pokemon, meaning less individuality, less unpredictability, more submissive/suggestive. It's not quite right to say pokemon are /aware/ in their balls, so much as their time in the ball can be translated to a suggested memory or experience upon release. If you've played the latest Pokemon, X and Y, think of Pokemon Amie or Supertraining as these kinds of things.

The higher cognitive functions of people, on the other hand, are much more fragile. Whether because the technology hasn't advanced enough yet, or simply because of the complexity of the information processed, the transition utterly screws with their memory, sense of self, personality... essentially what we consider their "mind." At best, they're reduced to an infantile/animal state: at worst, near catatonic.
