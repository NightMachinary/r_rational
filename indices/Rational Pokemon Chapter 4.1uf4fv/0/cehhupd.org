I do wonder what the Pokeballs-on-humans thing will come down to. Do Pokemon simply have fundamentally different brain anatomy? Or do Pokemon take brain damage every time a Pokeball is used and the trainer just doesn't notice? And, of course, if you outlaw research, only outlaws etc. Team Rocket simulation attacks?

[edit] Oh, one thing that wasn't clear and that I do /really/ want an answer to. Pokeballs dematerialize human, materialize again, human has brain damage. But Pokemon are /aware/ in their balls. So does the brain damage happen on scanning, or on materialization?

[edit] I really like, in general, how the fic sticks to the pattern of "smart, competent and informed people explaining their reasoning". Some people here seem to think "rational" is just a synonym for "realistic".
