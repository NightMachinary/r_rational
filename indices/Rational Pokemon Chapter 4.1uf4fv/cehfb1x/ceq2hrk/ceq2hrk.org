  Which means that somehow one of the most advanced pieces of technology we could conceive of is so cheap in labor and materials to make that it costs less than a soda.

You're ignoring the in-game backstory that pokeballs almost literally [[http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Apricorn][grow on trees]], and existed long before the pokemon world's industrial revolution.

Consider that they wouldn't make pokeballs out of whatever synthetic metals and plastics they're made of, unless it were both more reliable /and cheaper/ than just having mass-farmed apricorn orchards. So, in terms of processing required, it pretty much /is/ a soda (with the historical apricorn-based balls being respectively analogous to a bottle of orange juice.)
