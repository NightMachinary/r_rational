Now we're getting somewhere. One could presume that developing a synthetic pokeball was basically the pokemon world's equivalent of the development of the Internet: funded originally for military reasons, which forced scientific discoveries that commercialized, and eventually commoditized, the market.

Remember that you don't necessarily have to be a "pokemon trainer" in job description to need pokeballs; I imagine that, if nothing else, everyone who lives outside a city would want a few on them at all times, for the good few seconds of reprieve (to run away!) it'll buy them if a wild pokemon tries to attack them. (They work, in that sense, a lot like mace/bear spray.)

Plus, in any realistic setting, you'd have an eBay equivalent for selling freshly-caught pokemon, where trainers can also post bounties for pokemon of specific types. This'd incentivize a lot of people who also happen to wield dangerous tools in their work (e.g. policemen, long-haul truckers, train conductors) to carry balls to catch pokemon they happen to injure in the line of duty, for later sale. (And, to be less charitable, it'd incentivize a lot of people to go out "hunting" pokemon with regular weapons.)
