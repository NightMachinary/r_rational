Absolutely. When you think about a lot of the people you encounter in the game, like Backpackers or Tourists or Fishermen or whatever, you notice that most of them only have 1-3 pokemon. Most people in the pokemon world probably have a handful of pokemon, but it's really only trainers that would need dozens of pokeballs, and as long as they serve some important functions in the pokemon society (like say, protecting against rampaging pokemon, or collecting them for research purposes) it makes sense to support them through subsidies.
