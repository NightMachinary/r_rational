From the article:

#+begin_quote
  The special Pok√© Balls made from Apricorns are unique, quite rare, and often valuable for a Trainer to have on hand in battle. This is due to the fragile nature of Apricorn trees, which may die if too many Apricorns are picked at once or before they are mature enough. Only one Apricorn may be picked per tree per day, in order to prevent harm to it.

That one of the materials grows on trees is not indicative that it should be cheap, even putting aside all the labor and other materials that are needed to make the finished result.

The industrial revolution should help mass produce pokeballs to make them cheaper, but cheaper than a soda? Cheaper than a T-Shirt? Not everyone uses as many pokeballs as trainers do, the supply and demand balance would be utterly unhinged for Silph Co. to make so many that they're so cheap.

The only thing that makes sense to me is that their purchase is subsidized for trainers.
