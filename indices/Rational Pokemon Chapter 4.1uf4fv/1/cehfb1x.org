Hey guys, here's Chapter 4. Still out of the country, so edits might be a bit slow at first.

Something of note in this chapter: the economy of pokemon according to the games is just utterly screwy. Pokedollars are based on Japanese yen, each of which is equivalent to a penny. So in the games, a bottle of water is 200 pokedollars, or 2 dollars. Not a big deal, right? Except a pokeball is ALSO 200 pokedollars, while a bottle of soda is 300. Which means that somehow one of the most advanced pieces of technology we could conceive of is so cheap in labor and materials to make that it costs less than a soda. And that's not even getting into the $100,000 bicycles.

Like I said: utterly screwy.

So I'm going to scrap and rebuild it from the ground up. I'm going to use $ to represent the currency for ease and simplicity, and try to rescale things into a more rational framework, but don't jump to any conclusions about how everything is priced based just on this chapter, as the technology they have available warps the price of many things, and it's going to be a work in progress. Any feedback or suggestions appreciated.
