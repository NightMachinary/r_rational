Interesting, looks like the creepy VR crown thing is indeed the device Siphon is using to move souls around (or at least Loki believes it is).

That raises the question, were they trying to put someone else's soul into Canciana's body and failed or were they trying to move Canciana soul into someone else's body (and potentially succeeded)?
