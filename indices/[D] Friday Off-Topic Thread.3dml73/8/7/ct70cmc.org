I take a melatonin supplement in the evening if I find I am having difficulty falling asleep. I Also have a few rules I follow about how/when I sleep. At 11 pm, I stop playing any sort of high-brain-activity simulating video game. No watching TV either. I stick to reading and writing. At midnight, I get in bed. Then, I typically read for another half hour until I get sleepy. I try to read something slow-paced or dense that I need to read (currently: Romance of the Three Kingdoms) so that I don't get too excited and stay awake.

I also don't drink caffeinated beverages after 4 pm. I do, however, have a coffee in the morning and a diet coke in the early afternoon.
