I have a special alarm which slowly turns on a light thirty minutes before I wake up. I find that helps. It's an artificial sunrise. I have a few other technique to try and hack my body's like flux.

An actual routine solves most my issues.

I never drink caffeine after midday, and rarely much before that. No super size portions.
