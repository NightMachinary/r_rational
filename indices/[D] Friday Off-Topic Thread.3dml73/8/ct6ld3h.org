How do you balance sleep and caffeine? I've noticed that the more caffeine I drink, the worse I sleep the next night (ie: drink a double espresso and a Coke one day, involuntarily wake up at 6:00 next day after only getting to sleep at 2:00). When I let up off the caffeine, I'm less able to make up for lack of sleep, but I get more in the first place.

Currently I'm actually starting by throwing coffee out for a while and cutting back. But I had quite liked coffee.
