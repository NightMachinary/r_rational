I'm ADHD and have been self-medicating with coffee my entire life. If I don't have at least 4 cups a day I can't focus on anything /and/ I have no energy. I don't have any problem sleeping - I'm a morning person, and rarely stay up past 10PM.

The only time I've had that experience that people talk about where they can't sleep after having stimulants was when I went off coffee because I was taking ADHD medication (ritalin, focalin, adderal, I tried all three) and one time I had my Adderall dose calibrated too high and was actually getting a buzz off it.

I went back to caffeine because I didn't feel they were doing any better a job. Also, I didn't like the side effects: particularly the one where I had to provide documentation that I was on a prescription stimulant after a drug test.
