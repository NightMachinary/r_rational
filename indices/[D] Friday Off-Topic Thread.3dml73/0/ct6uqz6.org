So I was thinking about how to punch a clean tunnel all the way through a neutron star, and the obvious solution is to use a really fast black hole. Any matter that goes inside the event horizon doesn't come back out, and if it's going more than 0.99c, I think that it won't have time for its gravity to greatly influence the surrounding material, ergo: Smooth perfect tunnel with minimal collateral damage.

(Which immediately collapses, but whatever.)

The problems are, I don't know how to account for extremely high jerk when calculating effects. And, very large objects moving very fast produce gravity waves, and I have no intuition for wave mechanics at all. I know that wavefronts can build by constructive interference, which might make nasty tidal effects further out than I want. I just don't know. I'm also not entirely clear on the effects of relativistic mass on a black hole's Schwarzschild radius, but kugelblitzes (black holes formed from energy density of light) suggest that the radius comes from relativistic mass, which includes kinetic energy.

So my question is this: If a 1 * 10^{26} kg rest mass black hole moving at 0.99c went straight down through a skyscraper without directly hitting any supports, what would happen? I think that it would carve a bottomless pit two meters across, but I don't know if the building would be left standing, or how far away it would be safe to stand when a hole suddenly appears with a thunderclap for no obvious reason.

Pretending gravity is instantaneous, you would only experience more than 150 Gs of acceleration as long as the black hole is within 6,000 km of you, and it would enter and leave that range in 1/25 of a second, which seems within human mechanical shock tolerance, I think. Especially since the force is applied smoothly over the entire body, rather than delivered through discrete external points of contact. But the /peak/ acceleration could be a few quadrillion Gs, which may limit survivability. Now, gravity isn't actually instantaneous, so the black hole is almost keeping pace with its own gravity, and you're not going to fall up towards it for most of its approach. Intuitively, its upward and downward accelerations should cancel in the end. so you might get hit with a huge upward hammer blow when it gets to you, then get pulled downward more softly over a longer time.

It seems like it /should/ be possible for it to go fast enough that its gravity just doesn't have time to destroy you, even if it is momentarily putting everyone on the planet in a car crash. At worst, I'm pretty sure it won't destroy the Earth probably. If it doesn't work, is there any way to fix it?
