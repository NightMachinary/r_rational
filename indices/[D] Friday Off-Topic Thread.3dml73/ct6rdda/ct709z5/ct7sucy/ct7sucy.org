Well I know I've read about backlit screens stimulating the brain to a higher level than other media do. It was in an article on sleep deprivation. I feel like that higher level of stimulation has got to have something to do with it. I'd love to get some kind of Actual Science to back me up, but unfortunately I don't know anyone who does ADHD research.
