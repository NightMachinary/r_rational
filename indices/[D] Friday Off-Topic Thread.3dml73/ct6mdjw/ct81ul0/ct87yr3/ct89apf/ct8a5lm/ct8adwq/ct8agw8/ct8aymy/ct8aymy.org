Like, Wiki explains it as:

#+begin_quote
  In the essay, Camus introduces his philosophy of the absurd: man's futile search for meaning, unity, and clarity in the face of an unintelligible world devoid of God and eternal truths or values.
#+end_quote

But... the search for meaning, unity, and clarity isn't futile, the world isn't unintelligible, and pretty much all the real truths and values in the world are, if not /eternal/, than still /cosmic/ in scale, well beyond what you can change by flipping a coin or picking out a different thing to have for breakfast. The only thing he's getting right here is the lack of the Christian concept of a God, and if that's really so damn desirable, well, go ahead and acquire enough power over the fundamentals of reality to /make/ one!

Why bother complaining about absurdity when the world just isn't absurd?

And if you're wondering why I bother replying to you, it's because while you seem to think that any clear thinker would find the world absurd, I don't, which means we've actually got a substantial disagreement to reach the bottom of. You can't make the issue go away by just labelling me as ignorant for failing to find the world absurd and meaningless.
