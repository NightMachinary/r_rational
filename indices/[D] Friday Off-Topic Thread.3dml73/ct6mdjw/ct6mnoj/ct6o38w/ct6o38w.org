Lovecraft absolutely had issues of all kinds and I think a lot of his ideas were sick / are now outdated. But this is one that I agree with and feel he expressed well.

And I usually work to stay busy and active (haven't quite mastered compartmentalization to the degree you mention, but I'm working on it because I also feel it's the only long-term solution), I just worry that it's basically just masking the issue.
