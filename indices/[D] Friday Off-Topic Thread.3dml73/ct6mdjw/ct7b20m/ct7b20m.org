Where you see things which don't care for you, I see */opportunity!/* I mean it would be fantastic if there were other intelligences or a universe which cares about us like a benevolent god, but [[/u/Kerbal_NSA]] put it perfectly:

#+begin_quote
  “When I see the vast cosmic expanse I know I am utterly dwarfed, a little speck to the side. And you know how that makes me feel? Powerful. Significant beyond description. For I have an incomprehensible amount of matter and energy before my eyes and its all for the taking. Every star, every planet, every molecule of interstellar gas will be ours to do with as we please. The entire universe is nothing but the clay we mould to our will.”

When there's no competition, you are that more likely to *win*.

Don't look for meaning, think about what you want and pursue it. I derive purpose and meaning from accomplishment and joy in striving to achieve my goals.

But let's say that I'm silly for thinking that we can create our own purpose and meaning. I've had days (pretty rare though) where I thought that everything I've said above was stupid. However, I still believe that if I exist in a universe where humanity completely fails to survive and destroys itself in the next few years is inherently better than a universe where we never existed no matter how horrible life can get. It's /always/ better to have tried than to give up, y'know? It's one of the few absolute rules I follow in my daily life. To me, accepting your statements feels too much like giving up and that feels like true failure rather than just simply failing to reach my goals. If you try, failure's not completely certain, but to not even try makes it a 100% guarantee that you'll never get to do what you want.

Hope my rambling helps!
