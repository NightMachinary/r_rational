The problem with that post is, I know how an /evil/ mentor or older worker in a field expresses, "You're really growing up into a fine example of what you're trying to be", but I have not the slightest idea how /good/ characters say that, because the good ones tend to be Mysterious Old Wizards, or to come down with Dead Aniki Syndrome before they can say it.
