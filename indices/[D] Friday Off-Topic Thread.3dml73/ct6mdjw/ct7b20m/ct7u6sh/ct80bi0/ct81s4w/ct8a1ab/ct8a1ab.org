Eeeh....don't try to be fancy or /awesome/. Just say exactly "You're really growing up into a fine example of what you're trying to be" and if the junior respects or worships the senior mentor, then they'll be really happy to hear that from them.

By the way, I may not look up to you as an actual mentor-figure, but I've talked you enough to respect your opinions and to always listen to any advice you have for me as someone further along in the computer science field.

So the fact that you said that to me is a nice ego boost for me! Thanks!

Who says there can't be a touching moment over the Internet?
