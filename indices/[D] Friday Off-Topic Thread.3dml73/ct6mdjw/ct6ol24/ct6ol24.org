Excuse me, but I have work to do. Will try to respond in full shortly. In fact, I'm tempted to respond "in-character", except that no hold on I really am "Spiral" like that and don't just quote that show nonstop to sound cool. Because infinite loops of TTGL quotes aren't really cool, they're just /true/.

The full, complete, polished king of all Anti-Nihilist Rants might even be a good thing to post to the IEET once I finally have site access.

Suffice that you should start with the following things you've probably read before:

- HPMoR's "light in the universe" shpiel
- The Fun Theory Sequence
- I'm sure CS Lewis said something about how people are eternal splendors deep down. I just can't fetch the quote at the moment.
- TTGL quote that applies extra-strongly to living in a causal universe: "Love and spirit change the universe!" The only thing Leeron got wrong is that they do so /through our actions/.
