Well, I dimly remember reading that particular excerpt in high school. It absolutely blew my mind; following its logic gave my an intellectual high I have since never experienced. Unfortunately I was not able to find it; I suspect my teacher at that time heavily condensed some sections.

Be aware that reading Kant is far on the right side of difficulty in his primary texts. Secondary literature is heavily recommended if you value your time.
