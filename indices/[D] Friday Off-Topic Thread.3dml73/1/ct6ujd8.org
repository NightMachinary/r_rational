I've been playing lots of three of Zachtronic's puzzle games recently, and they're really fun and excellent. They establish rules, then force you to exploit the rules to solve problems efficiently. They are very good at teaching ideas about logic and planning and optimization and so forth.

The three games I've been playing are:

Spacechem - based /extremely/ loosely on chemistry (more of a chemistry artistic motif then any real chemistry). Involves bonding and debonding atoms, fusing and fissioning atoms, to make inputs into desired outputs, using a system of relays, detectors, grab-and-drop plans, etc. Solution usually involves making a certain number of desired outputs from inputs.

Infinifactory - Move blocks around to make and modify things in 3D, creating assembly lines of conveyors, pushers, welders, detectors, lasers, and all sorts of other tools. Set up an assembly line and watch it go.

TIS 100 - The assembly language programming puzzle game you never knew you wanted. Using a grid of extremely simple computers with an accumulator and a ram storage for a single integer, write code to do things like detect edges, multiply, find min and max of sequences, etc.

They all provide heaps of fun just trying to solve the puzzles at all, but then after that you can try to make your solution better - either faster, or using less resources and building blocks. They teach a lot of ideas about planning, programming, logic, and so forth, in the course of the action of the game.

Infinifactory even has a hotkey to make looping gifs like [[http://i.imgur.com/UoEk9R4.gifv][this one I made of one of my solutions]]
