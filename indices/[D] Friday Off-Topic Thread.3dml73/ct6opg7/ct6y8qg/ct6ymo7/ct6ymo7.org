I submit that Germany is in the EU for more than economic reasons. To quote /Yes, Minister/:

#+begin_quote
  Minister Hacker: Europe is a community of nations, dedicated towards one goal.

  Sir Humphrey: Oh, ha ha ha.

  Hacker: May we share the joke, Humphrey?

  Sir Humphrey: Oh Minister, let's look at this objectively. It is a game played for national interests, and always was. Why do you suppose we went into it?

  Hacker: To strengthen the brotherhood of free Western nations.

  Sir Humphrey: Oh really. We went in to screw the French by splitting them off from the Germans.

  Hacker: So why did the French go into it, then?

  Sir Humphrey: Well, to protect their inefficient farmers from commercial competition.

  Hacker: That certainly doesn't apply to the Germans.

  Sir Humphrey: No, no. They went in to cleanse themselves of genocide and apply for readmission to the human race.
