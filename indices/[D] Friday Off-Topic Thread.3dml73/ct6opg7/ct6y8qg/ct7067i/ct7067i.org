Huh, I dunno, for some reason I have the opposite impression. It seems like the EU is madly successful and just doesn't work great for not-rich nations to join. The free capital, trade, and labor flows across the borders of the European nations has generated an enormous amount of wealth for everyone involved. You get some issues for economically weak nations that need control of their own currency to deal with their poorly run government budgets, but even if you, say, let these countries default on their obligations and bumped down their credit ratings a ton, it still seems like the EU has made everyone way way better off than before. Whatever reasons countries had for getting involved, they've inadvertently made it possible to have much better european trade and labor mobility.

Heck, if anything the problem is that the EU doesn't have enough centralization of authority. This is a discussion for another day but it seems like... the EU is like the best thing to happen in terms of wealth creation in the developed world in the past 30 years?
