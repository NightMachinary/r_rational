What is the rational thing for the eurozone, IMF, and Greece to do at this point?

- Do the austerity measures specified by the recent deals have a chance of getting the Greek economy back on its feet and producing a surplus so that it can (eventually) pay back the debt? (Call this forward-looking.) Or are other nations just trying to 'punish' Greece for its past policy decisions? (Call this backward-looking.)

- If both are not possible, is it more important to keep Greece in the eurozone or to recover the lender's money?
