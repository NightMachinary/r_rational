I need some math help.

Imagine a sphere (actually an oblate spheroid). Imagine a few thousand points on it. These points can be defined by polar coordinates (which requires a pole, a polar axis, a radius, and an azimuth, the first two of which are constant). All these thousands of points would be derived from some formula. For a simple example, let's say the radius increases by the [[https://oeis.org/A000045][Fibonacci sequence]] while the azimuth increases by the [[https://oeis.org/A000040][sequence of primes]]. That would mean that our coordinates would be:

- (0, 2°)
- (1, 3°)
- (1, 5°)
- (2, 7°)
- (3, 11°)

And so on.

So what I want is some mathematical way of generating polar coordinates such that a person looking at /only the marked locations on the sphere/ would be able to work backwards and discover my method of generation. They should be able to do this even if they have no idea that I'm using a system of polar coordinates, they have no idea where I'm placing my pole or polar axis, and they don't have any idea what number system I'm using. The "discovered" formula should exactly match my formula with no ambiguity. Ideally, the formula would create repeating coordinates after generating a few thousand locations.

The problem is, I don't know exactly what properties the formula needs to have in order for this to be true. I'm totally fine with two solutions to the formula, but three or higher doesn't work for my purposes.

(Background for the story this is for can be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/3daqgk/making_a_solvable_puzzle/][found here]], though it shouldn't be at all necessary.)
