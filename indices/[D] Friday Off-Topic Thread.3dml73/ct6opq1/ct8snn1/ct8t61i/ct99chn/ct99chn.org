Sure thing.

In the Valdemar prehistory, two mages named Urtho and Ma'ar were fighting a big war. Near the end of this war, one of them comes up with a super weapon that will (IIRC) detonate the magic used to make magitek. Urtho manages to make it half-backfire, or something. These guys are both Urza-tier, so the resulting explosion leaves craters [[https://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luzxz9GVxG1qa73dwo1_500.png][the size of countries]] (Urtho's is in the south) and sends out concentric shockwaves for months. The Pelagir Forest on the map? By the present day, that's the amount of land the hawkbrothers hadn't managed to cleanse yet.

Thousands of years later, circular sections a few feet in diameter are being swapped over long distances. The group of people who are all about math and technology take the reported locations and determine that the places and times correspond to two interfering concentric /converging/ circles, one on each of the ancient fortress sites. They determine that the storms are increasing in strength, and they send an expedition to Urtho's tower (Ma'ars being under a lot of water) to try to stop the final strongest storm from killing a bunch of people, especially the Shin'a'in nomads who live in the plains in the crater around Urtho's tower (we learn in this book that their goddess told them to live there to guard the tower) and damaging the leyline system that concentrates magic.

After concentrating some of the biggest names in the series in the tower, they find a way to save Hardorn, Valdemar, Karse, and Intel. (You will note that that's not a lot of terrain. Things got pretty bad elsewhere. The (evil, eastern) Empire, where they routinely used magic as a logistics element, was not a good place to be in the immediate aftermath.)

Other notes: yes, the magic shockwaves travelled around the planet several times.
