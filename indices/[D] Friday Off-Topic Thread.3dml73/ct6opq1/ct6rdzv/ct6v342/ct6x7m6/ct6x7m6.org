Okay so a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) works like this:

X(n+1) = a * X + b (mod m)

So you have m which would be your period (y). Which is also the number of distinct teleport locations.

Then you have the parameters for the LCG which are a and b. This could be your end location. (but a,b can not be chosen completely arbitrary).

Then you start with a seed (any integer < m) and put it in the formula to get the next number.

So the first location determines all locations. And you can start at any of the locations on the map to find all others.

You can get x,y coordinates on a map out of the random numbers with x = X mod width and y = (int) (X / width)

That should be generate a pattern given enough points. a and b are also determinable. Even unknown a,b and m is doable but harder.
