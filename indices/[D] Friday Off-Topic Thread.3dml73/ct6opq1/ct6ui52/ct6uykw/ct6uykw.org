I want a generator for a series of polar coordinates over a planet that is relatively difficult (but possible) for a human to divine when given a large sample size. I want that generator to confine itself to only a small handful of points. I also want that generator, when written out in the shortest possible form, to include a single location.

So in the above example with the radial coordinate following the Fibonacci sequence and the axial coordinate following the sequence of primes, the shortest possible way of stating the generator includes a single location (which is the pole of the polar coordinate system).
