My sophomore political theory class. I remember someone mentioning the Prince-is-satire argument in class, and the teacher laughed and asked if he'd been on Wikipedia lately.

I can provide some supporting evidence, if you'd like. In his private letters, Machiavelli never mentions any satirical intent behind /The Prince/. While there is an apparent disparity with his love of republicanism in /The Discourses/, the times had changed: his beloved Republic had collapsed, and now a tyrant was returned to power. He's very clear in /The Prince/ that he's not arguing that tyranny is better than democracy, but being realistic -- seeing the world as it was, not as he wanted it to be -- and then describing good rules (ie, how to provide stability and prosperity) for tyrants, should one arise: as it did. During his exile, he was thinking about how the Medicis could /not/ fuck it up (since he was always thinking about political theory) and so he decided to write it down. It was a treatise driven by what he had seen in the conditions of 15th century Italy. Sure, it's covertly cynical in that he's working out the details of a system he personally disagrees with, but it's not satire.

In any case, I think the burden of proof is on the satirists in this discussion. :)
