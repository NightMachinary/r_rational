The theory stated by my professor (30 years ago) was that /The Prince/ was Machiavelli's resume. As such, it bore a passing resemblance to the truth his (potential) employer believed, but also a good deal of flattery and sugar-coating.

His /Discourses/ are more philosophical and not strictly focused on getting him a job.
