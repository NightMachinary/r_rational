I live in Palo Alto and am thinking of DMing another campaign of Dungeons and Dragons. It's set in my homebrew [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11386854/1/Story-and-Rules-of-Wyweria][campaign setting]] that I've used once before. If anyone's in the area and would be interested in playing, let me know. We use Pathfinder and currently have two players.

The campaign will be set during the Age of Legends, a time during which many small kingdoms were ruled by individuals of great power. Every King was a powerful Monster or mage of some sort, someone who could establish absolute authority over a certain area. The last campaign was set in Avaria, the kingdom ruled by the magelord Avar. For the most part, Avar was a "good" magelord, who cared almost nothing for the day-to-day lives of the inhabitants of Avaria. If thieving or banditry ever got so out of hand it impacted his ability to collect taxes to spend on spell components, or prevented merchants from reaching him, he took a few moments out of his day to smite the criminals. He only really cared about territory and relative peace, but that's pretty good as Magelords go. ?

The PCs were a mercenary group typically employed by merchants for protection. They had run-ins with other mercenary groups, with the government forces, with criminal organizations that were functionally indistinguishable from the government forces, and with Holy Orders who had inscrutable goals. None were as inscrutable as the Elves who had a completely foreign system of ethics and law.

The adventures will mostly be run as linked one-shots-- episodes that your adventuring company works through. Ideally, at the end of each session, we've finished whatever short-term things have been opened up that session while advancing the overarching goals and plots of the player characters. I have a number of adventures and story hooks prepared, and of course there's also fun to be had generally exploring the environment, interacting with NPCs and each other, etc.

Generally, missing any single session shouldn't leave you out of the loop or not make sense from a story perspective-- it'll be segmented into "jobs" that your company does, for profit or for personal reasons. The end of each sessions should mark the end of that particular job. If someone is present for one job but not another, it's entirely reasonable that that character was taking the week off, or busy working another job, for that session. This will prevent weirdness that comes from characters popping in and out of existence.

This format tends to serve pretty well for the purposes. Typically the idea would be to meet on a weekend morning for a time of 3-4 hours, though depending on people's schedules we may change things. It has historically been difficult to find a time people can play for 3 hours regularly other than Sunday mornings or weekday evenings (and weekday evenings are very susceptible to schedule issues).

In any case, let me know if you're interested and in the area!
