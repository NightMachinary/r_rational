Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I don't feel my take is either unreasonable or irrational. Making Sasuke a sadistic torturer was a deliberate character choice, and a major change from canon. Making him use physical means was another choice; he's got the Mangekyou Sharingan, he can torture someone for three days in the span of a second, without doing any physical damage. It's been a long time since I read it, so perhaps I'm misremembering, but I recall significant sexual overtones to the torture scenes. The scenes were, on the whole, unnecessary--the curtain could easily have been drawn. The level of detail in the scenes was definitely unnecessary.

Ergo, my suspicion that something else was going on.

As to my opinion not being rational -- I started with a prior and adjusted based on evidence. In my post above I said "I think", not "it was", implying a probability. In what way was this not rational?
