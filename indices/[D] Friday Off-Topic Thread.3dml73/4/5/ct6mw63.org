Yep, that's human. Camus has a lot to say on the same topic: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy," etc. It's one of the reasons I'm really happy I discovered Stoicism: while before, I used to be filled with existential dread, now I've kinda ... accepted that there is no meaning in the universe? To say "I'm having an existential crisis over the meaning of life" is akin to saying "I'm having an existential crisis over the dissolution of NaCl in H2O." And that's okay, yknow. That's okay.

I guess Stoicism has helped, but I don't know if I can solely credit the change to that particular philosophy. It helped, sure, but is it a direct side effect? I guess I don't know what did this to me. I'm just happy that I don't have to worry too much about the big questions anymore.
