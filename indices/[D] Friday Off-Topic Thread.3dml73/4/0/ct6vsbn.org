For me it's always had the opposite effect. Actually, I'd say it's probably the closest thing I've ever had as a committed atheist to a religious experience. To glimpse, if even a little, at the immense complexity and scope of the universe; to marvel at the underlying physical laws from which we emerge like ripples in a pond - it's not /exactly/ awe-inspiring, but it does generate an emotion very much like it.

Now, from a certain perspective the relative tininess of human affairs might deprive it of meaning. After all, if we live in a universe which doesn't care for our existence, does anything really matter? Poppycock! True, /most/ of the universe doesn't care for our existence, being a non-entity incapable of thought. But we're part of the universe /too!/ And we clearly care. We have morality, even if it can only be applied to ourselves. We give each other purpose, in as much it's possible to have one. Indeed, the very concept of "purpose" is itself a human social construct! To quote HPMOR - there /is/ light in the world, and it is /us!/
