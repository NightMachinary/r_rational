  when there is no competition there is no drive to grow either

I wouldn't say that competition is required for growth, but rather is a catalyst. After all even with no competition, NASA is still sending probes out into space. In fact, we just recently sent a probe close enough to Pluto to get for the first time, detailed close-up photos of the dwarf planet.

Also, which would you rather have, no competition or an alien civilization so advanced we can't compete against it?
