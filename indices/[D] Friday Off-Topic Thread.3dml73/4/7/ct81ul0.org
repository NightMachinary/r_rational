Let's start from the facts: the world is currently a very mixed bag, from the point of view of almost all humans. Yet, let's get the obvious [[http://wtf.animeblogger.net/?p=140][out of the way]]:

  The universe is a large place, and there's plenty of time to grow and explore it, and meet our many friends waiting among the stars.

  We just need to use our lives, given to us by those that came before us, to create the right world for those that will follow us.

I don't really understand how any of it could be called /meaningless/. What, after all, is this /meaning/ you ask for? Mostly, it's a two-way causal relationship between you and things that are emotionally relevant to you, things you care about.

If you just suffer from a lack of ability to care about things, well, that's clinical depression. It's not the way the universe is. It's a map-territory confusion.

Lovecraft was writing at the end of the "death of God" period in the humanities, before Dadaism, existentialism, and postmodernism really came into their own. However, I think we can today mount a much better reply to the "death of God" than they could:

You observe that the universe doesn't contain a Christian, Zoroastrian, or Judeo-Islamic style of "god": an omnipotent and sometimes anthropomorphic creator-being with a desire to engage in social relations with humanity, the most common such relation being hierarchical rulership and worship. Except that the Christians and Jews think God /loves/ them, in a really neglectful, abusive, sadomasochastic way.

Ok. There's no God. So /the job is open./ We "mortals" are the biggest, most powerful beings in the room. Except that we've all seen just how awesome a "mortal" can get when they acquire loads and loads of optimization ability:

  There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors. This does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn. We must play. But our merriment must be of that kind (and it is, in fact, the merriest kind) which exists between people who have, from the outset, taken each other seriously - no flippancy, no superiority, no presumption.

So the question is not, "what does the universe intend for me?". It doesn't intend, so it doesn't intend anything. This doesn't make life meaningless, because meaning comes from relations, and "the universe" is just not the kind of thing that can engage in human-style social and emotional relations at all.

The question is, "What sort of cosmic principle am I?" Which god, or whose angel, are you?

That undoubtedly sounds frightening, and also religious, and therefore depressingly solemn. Who wants to live in a universe of never-ending cosmic duties? Of course, Duty is just another principle, and as a /final/ principle, before which /all else/ should be moved out of the way, it's just not very good, is it?

[[http://www.thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun][What's the point if we can't have fun?]]

And what would the point be if you were a lone cosmic principle? "[H]oly boredom is good and sufficient reason for the invention of free will," said the God-Emperor Leto II! Luckily, you're not a /lone/ cosmic principle at all: you're surrounded by /other/ cosmic principles, /other people/, whether they're more or less realized as such.

You ask for meaning in life? You're surrounded by it! The very fact that your universe runs on /causality/ makes it, inherently, a /participatory/ universe in which /you have your part to play/. "There are no ordinary people", and that means that you are inherently a unique and important thread in the tapestry of the world.

You are a powerful, significant thing in the universe, so much so that the only thing even remotely capable of thwarting your power is /more of that same power/, as wielded (at the moment) by other beings of your exact kind. What is beyond your reach? Nothing! All the lights in the sky and all the time in the world are open to you, to all of us, to grasp and share.

So why would you sit around moping that life is meaningless when you could be living it?
