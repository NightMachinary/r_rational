/nihilistic devil's advocate mode/

... when I could be living it, yeah yeah, so what? I live life, and have lots of fun - nobody said that I'm "moping." But, ultimately, those are all just distractions from the purposelessness of it all. I'm a chemical reaction, and one day it will end. The ups, the downs - all for naught. "Unique and important" aren't criteria by themselves when the things that I'm important /to/ are themselves meaningless. So why not just end it today?

Or that is to say - /why/ should I have fun?

I'm picking on your response because it's the most written-out, but this critique really applies to all the "Oh you're being silly! Science and yourself and etc all provide purpose and meaning! Go out there and live your life!" These are just distractions from the problem of absurdity, and don't come anywhere near to actually answering it. The "anti-Nihilist rant to end all anti-Nihilist rants" was (or should have been) Camus' /Sisyphus/, since it steel-manned the nihilist position, explored why it's not at all flawed, and then moved on to a solution (ie, the Stoicism of the final line). There's an awesome video about it [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35s4-3T5dJY][here]].
