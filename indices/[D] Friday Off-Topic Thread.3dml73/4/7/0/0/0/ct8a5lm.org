It seems we're talking past each other. Life has no meaning; this I understand. There is no meaning in the universe. It simply does not care about us, because it is incapable of caring. I'm not asking it to care, I'm just asking: What's the point of "living life and having fun," as you recommend? Why is that preferable to suicide?

Have you read Camus? I'm wondering how much knowledge of existentialism and absurdity you have, is all. I don'f want us to talk past each other indefinitely
