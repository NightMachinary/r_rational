There was a recent discussion about how Lovecraft's elder gods and eldritch horrors are a pretty good model for the incomprehensibility of the world. Big Data is a thing. Also, the problem of induction, and the limitedness of human experience, and the fact that we live in extremistan (per Nicholas Nassim Taleb's indomitable /Black Swan/).

  if that's really so damn desirable, well, go ahead and acquire enough power over the fundamentals of reality to make one!

What's your timeframe on that? I'm extremely confident, and I think you'll agree, that it's not gonna happen within our lifetimes. Your saying things like this is what's making it /really difficult/ for me to take you seriously
