Actually, I'm old enough to be done with school (until I inevitably sacrifice my soul to the PhD system), and while I don't find my current occupation /maximally/ fun, it certainly provides nonzero fun, sets me up for good life conditions outside of work, and provides a steady income that lets me save for the future, as well as helping me build connections and experience I can make use of later.
