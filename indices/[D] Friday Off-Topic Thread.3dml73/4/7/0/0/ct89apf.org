/Why/ is a feature of your cognition, not the universe. If you're /really/ so bothered by existential dilemmas, we can just wire your meaningfulness switches closed. Again: do not confuse the mapper with the territory, and thus do not ask the territory to display features of people.

Or if you really want the territory to talk back so badly, we can make you a god-figure. Sure, idolatry, but you're the one making confused complaints about the universe.

You can only address this problem by giving a coherent counterfactual. If you claim life is meaningless, /what would it take/ for life to be meaningful?
