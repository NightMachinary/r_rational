Does anyone know if there have been any studies on helping ADHD/ADD kids/adults be more focused when reading or studying by having them use a tablet or other back-lit device?

I was talking to a woman this week who said she was never a big reader until she bought a tablet and tried the reading app, and was able to get her son to read in the same way. Both have ADHD, so I was curious if this is a known method already.
