Having just read the rules for Zendo (and half a paper defining PAC-learnability, which I think we'll agree is probably not adequate) ...

I think I understand what you're saying about the difficulties involved in making a rule that's unambiguous given the evidence. This is similar to the scene in HPMOR where Harry gives Hermione three numbers and asks her to find the pattern.

So ... I still don't know where that leaves me. I don't know how to create a generator that restricts the hypothesis space properly. I can imagine simple rules, but don't know how to evaluate the ambiguity of those rules.

What /is/ the most PAC-learnable sequence of 1,000 points on the surface of a sphere? What are some general (layman's) guidelines for making rules which are learnable given examples that fit those rules?
