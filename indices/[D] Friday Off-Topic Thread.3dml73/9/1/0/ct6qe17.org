The problem with a Lissajous figure (unless I'm misunderstanding it) is that it doesn't give you an origin; I would /like/ for the climax of the story to be either a race towards (or adventure to) some specific place.

Archimedean spiral gives that, but is a little bit too ... simple? I suppose I would have to think about what data was available to the hypothetical heroes.
