I read Terry Pratchett's /The Reaper Man/ and while the wizarding sections were at best a distraction from Death it's still made it into my favorites. I also recently read /Man's Search For Meaning/, written by psychologist/therapist and *holocaust survivor* Victor Frankl. Interesting to read about the challenge of staying positive while suffering in a literal hell-on-earth.

Those two books must form some sort of inoculation or antidote to existential stress. You'll be a happier person after reading them.
