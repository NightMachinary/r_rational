I think austerity is unlikely to benefit Greece's economy long-term, and indeed will deepen their recession. I think it's in Greece's best long-term interests to exit the euro, and it would have been even better for them had they done that earlier. Short term it would hurt them, and probably any politician of theirs who made that decision would be effectively ending their career, but they would stabilize eventually and get something approaching a stable economy. I think it's beneficial to the others on the Euro if Greece stays in. I don't know if the harm done to Greeks by it's staying is outweighed by the benefits to the others, such that from a utilitarian perspective I should urge Greece to stay in - I am not an economist or domain expert in these matters.
