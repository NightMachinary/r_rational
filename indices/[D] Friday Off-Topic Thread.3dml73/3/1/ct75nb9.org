On the Greek side, I'd have executed a Grexit a long time ago. There's no advantage to staying in a monetary union that prevents a natural devaluation of currency (important for recovery in a bad economy), while simultaneously enforcing an insurmountable but undefaultable debt with little relief and punishing austerity. On the European side, I'd encourage Greece to stay in the union while offering considerable debt relief and minimal austerity. (Or just let Greece leave, if I didn't particularly care about it.)

The problem is none of these parties are anything resembling rational actors. It's kind of impressive, actually. They're failing in ways that perfectly selfish agents wouldn't even /consider/, since perfectly selfish agents are at least rational enough not to act directly against their own self-interest. Greece in particular has been charting new ground in politco-economic failure. From [[http://www.vox.com/2015/7/13/8949925/greece-syriza][Vox:]]

  Greece had two awful choices: Stay in the eurozone and be crushed by fiscal and monetary polices set by the Germans, or leave the eurozone and be crushed by a financial crisis. [Syriza] managed, horribly, to combine both of the original two options into one political-economic disaster...

  As O'Brien writes, “Syriza's strategy, insofar as there was one, couldn't have been much more of a failure.” If anything, that's too kind. Syriza's strategy, insofar as there was one, uncovered a method of failing that was much more complete and all-encompassing than anyone had thought possible at the start of the process.

At this point, the only improvements I see for the short-term are a sudden change of heart by the Germans, or a Greek election putting a new party in power. Until then, it will probably be ongoing disaster as usual.
