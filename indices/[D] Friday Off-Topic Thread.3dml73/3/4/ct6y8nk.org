As a voice of disagreement, Greece leaving the Euro will probably not do any good for their economy. Default and staying in the Euro is much better than creating a drachma due to their [[http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/balance-of-trade][pretty large trade deficit]], if we're especially nice and suggest that the Drachma will devalue to say only 25% (rather than the 10% figure thrown around) imports will suddenly cost 16 billion Euros rather than the 4 billion they are paying now, and their exports will be worth 500 million.

Obviously they are hoping that they will be extremely competitive and somehow either avoid that much devaluation (unlikely) or pay for it with more debt (who is going to lend exactly to a government not backed by Europe? They don't have a primary surplus big enough to cover the trade deficit).

The best thing was in 2008/9 when it was clear what the crash was Europe bosses should've gotten around the table, decided which countries were going to default, what they were going to default on, and how much, then announced bond buying for countries to stop contagion and gotten on with it. Unfortunately the dragging out of this process has benefited no one.

They can't really default any more so it's probably just going to be Europe financing their debts while they struggle to get back on their feet in austerity.
