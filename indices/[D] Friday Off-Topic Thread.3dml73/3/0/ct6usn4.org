Grexit has been the best move for a long time, and a large haircut or default. The current policies /only make rational sense/ as punishments, and as making an example of Greece for the other Southern European nations. The Euro has broken European trade balances, but the North doesn't want to acknowledge that because it works to their benefit (and because the Germans believe running a trade surplus to be a matter of national virtue, and damn the accounting math that says their surplus /must/ be someone else's deficit).
