I get what you mean. I've gotten a number of complaints-by-review about "my philosophy", even though the philosophy they're referring to is given through the eyes of someone marked in the story synopsis as a villain. Psychoanalysis of an author through their work is not generally a good idea.

When I see rape and/or torture in fiction, I usually think that it's pointlessly edgy, hamfisted, etc. unless it's done with a really deft hand. I think those sorts of criticisms are much more appropriate to levy against a work.
