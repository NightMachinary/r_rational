  Making him use physical means was another choice; he's got the Mangekyou Sharingan, he can torture someone for three days in the span of a second, without doing any physical damage.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/22][Sakura had already shown herself able to break the Mangekyou's illusions by shifting to her aspect of light,]] so Sasuke couldn't risk using those to brainwash her. Even under extreme physical duress, she still managed to let one aspect of herself escape through her mindscape to warn Naruto, so I think Sasuke was justified in using such extreme measures. In any event, I myself never noticed any sexual connotations in the torture scenes, in any of my six read-throughs of the story.
