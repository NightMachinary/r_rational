Everyone should read /The Prince/ by Machiavelli.

Some choice quotes that feed the cynic in me;

- love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.

- Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them.

- A prince, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; It is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.

The book is also completely free on Amazon and Project Gutenberg.
