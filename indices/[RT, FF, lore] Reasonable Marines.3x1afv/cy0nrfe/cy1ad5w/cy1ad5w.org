Depends on the era. If it's early imperium, the emperor could probably have done a lot better with some small changes, like warning his primarchs about chaos.

Modern day? The space wolves have the right non-mechanicus tech base and connections to have a shot of improving things, but don't think that way. If you manipulate the void dragon's prison so it ?goes back? to encouraging finding new information, it might work. IIRC, ark Mechanicus ships have proper ai and full stc data but the Mechanicus don't know this, so that might work too
