The funny thing about 40k is that every race/faction has a different reason for lacking progress.

Eldar are just trying to survive long enough to create a god (Ynnead) that can kill the thing that eats their souls when they die. They seem to act fairly reasonably in this context, surprisingly.

The Mechanicus lost the vast majority of people that actually understood their tech back in the heresy, and their god (Omnimessiah/ probably the void dragon) seems to actively encourage recovery of old data over finding of new, so good luck with them. They also get severely angry when any other humans try to take away their tech monopoly.

The tau are too small to matter, and also are brainwashed by their ethereal caste. There's also weak evidence that they were created as a weapon against and/or attempt to redeem the necrons.

The orks had their intended intelligent caste/subspecies go extinct, and were designed as a weapon anyways. Despite this, they seem to often build new things, and even seem to have attempts at research. It's unclear whether their constant state of warfare keeps them from progressing.

Chaos is not really worth mentioning here, but I will note that Tzeentch (one of the big 4 gods of chaos and also the god of hope) explicitly schemes against himself and his followers because it's more fun that way.

The necrons are kind of weird here. They had a working society with no ftl and a multi star system empire that was advanced enough to have a chance against a ftl capable progenitor race, then made a deal with soul eating star gods for immortal bodies and a way of breaking into their enemy's ftl network. They somehow managed to get their average citizens to lose mental acuity and maybe sapience in this deal, allegedly due to said star gods doing something, which can be alternately blamed on poor computational substrate in new bodies or maybe their souls getting eaten. On the bright side, they did successfully murder the abusive precursor race they were fighting, and they also destroyed/captured the star gods that betrayed them. It really says something about the universe when these seem to be the most effective race...
