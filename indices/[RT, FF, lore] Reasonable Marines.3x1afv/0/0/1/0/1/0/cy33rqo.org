Actually, I read the Humanity Fuck Yeah threads and they're 40K-unrelated. It's more like humanity porn, where humans are the most X in a galaxy of not-very-X aliens. Humanity is the most militaristically psychotic. Humanity is the only species able to lie. Humanity is the most adaptable species. Humanity will fuck literally anything that moves and a lot of things that don't.

I find it quite enjoyable, despite its masturbatory nature.
