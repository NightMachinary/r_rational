The Imperium range between capitalist and feudalist, with a heavy dose of loosely-enforced but genocidal religious fundamentalism. That is, if you're an Imperial citizen, you've probably done something "worthy" of Exterminatus, but you'll only /actually/ get Exterminatus if an Inquisitor actually shows up, which they mostly don't.

For context, basically every meme you've ever seen about xenos, HERESY, BLAM, and "HUMANITY FUCK YEAH" was, quite unfortunately in the last case, Warhammer 40k-related.

The Tau are called "weaboo space communists", and are considered "too good" for the setting because they're /merely/ Totalitarian Utilitarians who're willing to /use fucking diplomacy for once/ and accept other species as vassals rather than being outright xenocidal.
