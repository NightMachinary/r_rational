Canonically, you actually can't: the Grimdark Force will stop you.

That said, I consider canon WH40k to be kind of... /incoherent/, because nobody ever actually /reinvents/ clear, rational thought /in ten millennia of human existence across an entire galaxy/. The Old Ones, the Eldar, the Necrons, and even the goddamn Interex (basically Culture/Federation expies) are all said to have had Sufficiently Advanced technology, /and yet/, none of the scientific theories behind such technologies are /in any way/ recoverable via /mere experimentation/.

WH40k should be considered an example of what happens when you try to run a universe on souls and magic and it backfires massively, because it would ultimately have been simpler and more robust to your universe coherency (eg: the number of times direct paraphysical intervention becomes necessary just to keep Time running) just to use science.

Oh, and half the time, Chaos will fuck your shit up, and if you're human-aligned, you can't actually get rid of Chaos, because it's fueled by /your SOOOOOUUUUL/, without which you will /literally/ turn into a p-zombie. No joke. The Necrons are basically, "this one species got cancer all the time, so they tried to upload themselves into robot bodies, AND IT WENT HORRIBLY WRONG BECAUSE STAR GODS ATE THEIR SOULS."
