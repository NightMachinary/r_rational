  That said, I consider canon WH40k to be kind of... incoherent, because nobody ever actually reinvents clear, rational thought in ten millennia of human existence across an entire galaxy. The Old Ones, the Eldar, the Necrons, and even the goddamn Interex (basically Culture/Federation expies) are all said to have had Sufficiently Advanced technology, and yet, none of the scientific theories behind such technologies are in any way recoverable via mere experimentation.

One explanation is that its very difficult to maintain coherent infrastructure at scale in this universe. When it takes long time periods to travel between star systems and theres a real risk of any ship getting lost or delayed you need the insane imperial levels of forced cooperation to get anything done.

It may also just be a fact of this universe that technological progress becomes exponentially more difficult. Even pre dark age humanity doesn't seem to have invented anything ridiculously powerful, just better versions of the conventional tech the imperium uses, aided by weak AI. The few things the eldar have done above this are more reliant on warp powers

Its basically a universe where technological solutions can't really exist to the major problems, and the species are stuck in a hobbesian/malthusian death spiral
