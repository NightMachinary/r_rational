My biggest beef with warhammer 40k is that every race in the present era (minus the tau who are essentially cave men) is using their capabilities to such an abysmal degree that it's comparable to some one having a fully functional car and just using its headlights and windshield wipers.

It's not even a sensible kind of "minima" thing going on here.

Their ships are so weird.

And tyrannids... Oh don't even get me started on how dumb tyrannids are.
