40k, at it's base, does a pretty good job of giving a good explanation for why everything is terrible: Free thinking will literally eat your brain.

Actually, now that I write that, I just want you to go read the Laundry Files and then come back. The necessity of bureaucracy + cthulhuian horrors that come from your brain? Explains a lot.

THAT SAID, my other favorite "oh hey that makes it make sense" about 40K is that all their tech is basically true Singularity-left overs (although what happened to the AIs is unanswered), and that the "warp" part of their engines (when in real space) is the /heat sink/.

Edit: So it's not that the Mechanicus doesn't /try/ to understand or is unaware that they're a cargo cult - it's that the rituals are literally basically the best understanding possible for a human for the sheer advancedeness of the tech.
