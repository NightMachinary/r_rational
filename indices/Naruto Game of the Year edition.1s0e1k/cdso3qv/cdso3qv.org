Not rationalist, but quite smart. The plot is that Naruto dies and finds out that he's in fact in a game, and whenever he dies he has to start over from birth. So he has time to learn... quite a bit over the resets. There's also an overarching plot that is very interesting.

Unfortunately it only updates once every forever.
