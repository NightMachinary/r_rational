Even if your logic is right that still only works if the GAI is acting short sightedly. Gathering as much resources as possible is also extremely desirable to delay heat death, especially given how /staggeringly/ computing efficiency increases as the universe gets colder.\\
Plus even if that gram of matter could be better used locally, that doesn't work when you consider the exponential growth allowed by von neumann devices.

There's also no reason there has to be a trade off between computers and probes. Once you've turned all the matter into really tiny black holes you harvest for direct matter-energy conversion, or some other useable form. Then there's no reason you have to stay put, and can't also be expanding at a significant fraction of c.\\
Staying put only makes sense, if you lack the ability to do any better than solar energy.
