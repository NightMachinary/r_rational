The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle]] sets a absolute limit on how much computing you can do with a given amount of energy. This limit depends on the background temperature, thus why I said you can do many orders of magnitude faster computing in the degenerate era.\\
You can't escape having to use energy, and energy is a finite resource, thus creating the incentive to expand. No matter how smart the GAI gets it could always benefit from having more computing power, especially since it doesn't know how much power might come at the next tier of intelligence.

There's just no amount of computing efficiency that suddenly makes expansion uneconomical. The energy required for expansion just isn't high enough, especially given the incentive to get as many resources as possible and hoard them for the degenerate era. In fact considering light speed lags, it might actually be best off having itself entirely concentrated in a ever expanding sphere (well the shape would vary, there's no reason to expand in directions that there isn't stuff).\\
On the other hand computing is much faster in colder areas so it might want to concentrate some of it's most important stuff in intergalactic space, it depends on what kind of time discounting makes sense.

This video explains a lot about just how staggeringly efficient you can make your computing once you get to the degenerate era: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qam5BkXIEhQ]]
