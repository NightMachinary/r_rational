I had an interesting exchange recently.

After I took my date to a bus stop in the middle of night, I was walking home when I saw this group of four homeless-looking people who were behaving slightly aggressively. I walked past them, they started walking with me and a few of them shoot some questions at me. In particular, one of them who was slightly dark-skinned asked me "am I white or black?"

I thought about this for a moment and decided that the best reply is "You're the same color as Obama."

The slightly dark-skinned person joked and said something like "Yeah, my second cousin is Obama". Another person said "Fucking racist shit, let's beat him up". He sounded quite hesitant and there wasn't much conviction in his voice and everyone else ignored him and they went on their way.

My interpretation of this was that they meant to ask a question that seemingly doesn't have any good answers from their perspective and then maybe harm me in some way if I do give a wrong answer?

I think my answer was pretty good because a) it was true b) I was comparing him to a powerful high-status person, so it's quite hard to interpret it in a racist way.

Of course it would have probably been safer to ignore them totally.
