In the link, the skills referred to as 'physical' are all ones where there's immediate positive feedback of failure. You fail a magic trick, and the wrong card shows up. You mess up playing an instrument, and you hear a grating screech or other undesired sound. You mess up playing sports, and you lose the ball or whichever equivalent.

With mental habits, there's often nothing to tell you if you messed up. And when there is, it's rarely immediate. If you try to build a mental habit of cleaning your room every week and you forget one week, you might notice during the next week, but it's not the same as immediately after forgetting to clean your room realizing like a kick to the gut that you forgot to clean your room. With commitment, that kick in the gut can happen when a relevant topic crosses your mind, but there's no guarantee that you'll make that connection swiftly.

Cleaning your room is a fairly easy example, though. There are worse cases where there simply /isn't/ a persisting reminder like the cleanliness of your room. In those cases, all you have as a lifeline is the kicks in the gut that you give yourself when you realize you forgot.

Just speculating now, I'm thinking that a way to improve on this problem would be to create persisting reminders for the mental habit. Ideally, they'd trigger whenever the habit is relevant, but more important is that you don't get used to them. If you put an alarm on your computer or phone to regularly tell you to clean your room, it becomes incredibly easy to simply adopt a predefined set of actions that make the alarm stop and all the while not think about what it tells you.
