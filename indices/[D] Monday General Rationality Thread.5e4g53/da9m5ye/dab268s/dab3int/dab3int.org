This is good to think about. I hadn't considered feedback loops as an integral part of this.

For me personally, I have a spreadsheet for weekly and monthly review, but even that seems far to periodical to get good immediate feedback.

You're right, fighting the sort of "acclimation" that happens is really important. To that end, I often think about changing self-identity, i.e. the way you look at yourself, so it's no longer about "forcing yourself to do a thing" and more about "ah, of course I do these things, it's a part of who I am".
