Try taking a more pragmatic approach here. Why is rationality important to you? What do you want to use rationality /for/? If you don't know what your main goals are, you could always donate 10% of your income to effective charities and to existential risk reduction efforts until you have figured out what you really want to do. No one is perfectly rational all the time. The important thing is that people are aware of their flaws and work to overcome them. There's always room to improve. If you're feeling depressed, you need to /see a therapist/. You also need to /go out and meet people and keep yourself occupied with other things besides your depression./

Also, do you know why you haven't abandoned your religious beliefs? Are they still constraining your expectations, or are they serving some other function? And are there any healthier alternative methods you could use besides holding onto your religious beliefs? If letting go of your religious beliefs poses a serious threat to your mental health, then don't let go of them yet! Wait until you're mentally healthier and are in a fit state to think more clearly about such things. You could also try to let go of those beliefs very gradually and carefully, rather than trying to force it to happen all at once. In some ways religion is like a drug. If you're dependent on it and you suddenly stop taking it you'll go into withdrawal.
