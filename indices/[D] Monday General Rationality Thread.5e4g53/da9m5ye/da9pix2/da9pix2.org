When I was a teenager the solution seemed obvious, I could just decide to do things that way. It seemed simple enough for me, I saw it as a simple reprogramming of my thoughts, though that may have been because I'm autistic. However, I no longer think it's that simple.

I found myself unable to abandon my religious beliefs despite the logical arguments of atheists, discovered I didn't have any goals I was passionate about, and then I came down with depression that saps my motivation to self improve. Now I'm not sure what to do.

Sometimes I wonder if being irrational is a psychologically healthy thing to do, that humans need at least some bias in order to function. Other times I question whether the ideal of rationality is impossible to achieve or if I just can't do it and don't know who to judge for being wrong.
