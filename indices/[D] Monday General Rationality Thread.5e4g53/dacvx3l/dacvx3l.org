I had a general question about genre identification, and was looking for more suggestions. Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask... I didn't feel this merited its own post.

I've been enjoying the heck out of many of the recommendations here, and I've hit many of the popular ones (Worm, Time Braid, HPMOR, Shadows of the Limelight, Pokemon: The Origin of Species, etc...) but Mother of Learning especially has stuck out as a favorite. One recommendation I read about a few months back was A Practical Guide to Evil, and more recently, I heard about The Gods Are Bastards; I've voraciously devoured both series.

But as I understand it, MoL is considered rational, but the other two are... not? Or at least, they have rational elements but are not as rational? If so... what genre do they fall into? And do people have more recommendations similar to those?

Thank you!
