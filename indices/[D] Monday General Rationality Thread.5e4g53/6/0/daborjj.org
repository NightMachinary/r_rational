Somewhat catastrophic in the near-mid term, as anyone who can shove an object into LEO could then accelerate it out into deep space and back at arbitrary velocities, allowing any group or individual with that level of tech to have access to a city-destroying WMD. If we can find a way to handle /that/, then astonishingly positive, as we would finally have a way to /access/ most of our future light cone.
