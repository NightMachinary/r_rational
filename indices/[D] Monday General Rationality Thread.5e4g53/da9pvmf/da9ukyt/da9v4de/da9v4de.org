I'm not that confident. Presume that the goal is to get as much computing power as possible. There is a distance/mass-requirement where it starts to be less efficient to send off a von-neuman probe then to use that mass/energy as more computation.

I don't think computing/mass is likely to be so efficient that the few grams required to populate another star would be better used locally, but I'm not entirely confident they're not. Or that there's not some other equilibrium point.
