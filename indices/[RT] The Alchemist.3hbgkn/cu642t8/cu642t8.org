I'm on chapter 6 so far, and while it hasn't shown any signs of being rational, it does fill the first 2 rationalists requisites, lots of science and cataloging as well as makeshift experimentation and resource gathering.

As for characterization the MC is a mad scientist type with and asshole -ish attitude, and I mean actually mad for science, sometimes chosing to learn about the new world instead of focusign on people around him.
