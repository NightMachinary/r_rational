Very few people notice and most don't care unless you're shilling in some dishonest or exploitative way. Also it's not against the rules, just against "reddiquette." It's not required to participate in the community just to write a self-promotion post. But if it's all you're doing, complaints will come sooner or later.

Self-promotion is natural and honestly yours is pretty good. Most people just post a summary or link and don't bother explaining why the story fits the sub.
