I'd say this fits here very well. Intelligent, driven protagonist who has their (what personal pronouns do we use to refer to Loki when they're not currently definitely male or female?) own goals; a magic system that seems to have rules even if they're vague, and characters that have distinct personalities.

It's also got pretty great banter, what with the main character being a Trickster god, and I like the satire of Corporate Culture.
