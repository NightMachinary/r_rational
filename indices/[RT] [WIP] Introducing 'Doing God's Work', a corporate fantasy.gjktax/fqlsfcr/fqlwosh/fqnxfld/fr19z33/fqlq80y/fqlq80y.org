Welcome!

I read the first three or so chapters back when they were large chapters, and it really is quite good. Even if not necessarily rational, it should qualify as adjacent (from what I read). I keep meaning to go back and catch up, but the tbr list is long.

That said, and please don't take this harshly, as much as I support your story, you really aren't supposed to make an account and use it solely for self-promo. Reddit is meant to be a collection of communities, not a platform for advertising. I highly recommend finding some communities to join, it's a great place, get involved. :)
