There's a reddit-wide convention called the 10:1 rule. So long as you comment around on other people's posts or contribute to discussions elsewhere at a ratio of ~10 comments per 1 post of your own content, no one's gonna bat an eye.

Here on the subreddit, so long as you're not self-promoting updates more frequently than about once a week (rule #3), we on the moderation team aren't going to do anything about it.

/Please/ continue to post updates to this story, it's a good fit for the sub (imo) and is well-written and intriguing. Please don't take a friendly pointer as a reason to stop posting links to updates for a great story.
