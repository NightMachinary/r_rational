No, no, it needn't be the last or only, so long as it isn't the sole thing you do with your account it'll be fine. A moderate amount of self-promotion is perfectly acceptable, and there are other communities in which your story may be very welcome as well. So long as you make meaningful contributions to other threads, you're good. :)
