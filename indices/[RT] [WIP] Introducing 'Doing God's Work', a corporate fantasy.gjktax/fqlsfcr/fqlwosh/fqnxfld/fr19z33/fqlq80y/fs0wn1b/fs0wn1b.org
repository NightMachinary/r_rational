Half a month later, here I am. Finally caught up. The story is amazing. I love the characters (the protagonist specially, but the rest of his "friends" are also very fun to read and see their interactions), the setting is super interesting, faced with that sweet rational angle... And there is something in the flow of the story that makes it super hard to put down. I had never found me in the situation of having to forbid myself from reading before bed, because it always ends up with me sleeping 1-2 hours later than planned. I can't wait to read more.

Also I have to mention that seen the christian god taking the role of the tyrant is mildly umpleasant for me given my background. But I must admit that I know which parts of the bible would inspire such portrayal.
