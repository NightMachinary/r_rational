I've never explicitly stated it in the story (yet), but Loki will happily go by any pronouns at any time, regardless of what form they're currently taking. Most people around her will use traditional pronouns for whatever gender she presents as at the time, but the way I picture him viewing himself is that he's a little bit of all genders at all times.
