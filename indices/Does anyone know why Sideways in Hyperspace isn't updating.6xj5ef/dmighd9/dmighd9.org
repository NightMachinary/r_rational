I'm still alive I promise.

Okay so basically a number of things conspired to force me to take a break between arcs. First, the lease was up on my apartment on September 1st, and dealing with that took a lot of time and energy. Second, I had been posting a chapter a week since December of last year. That's an 8 month stretch with no breaks, and I had long since burned through the buffer of chapters I had premade and was essentially writing a new chapter every week in the gap between scheduled updates, which was...not ideal.

Thus, I gave myself a break period and I'll be resuming regular updates on October 15th. In the interim period there will likely be some interludes and additional supplementary content that I post to fill the gap.

Basically, I wanted to make sure I gave myself the time to do things right, instead of rushing through the story and half assing it. Consider it like, the break between seasons on a TV show.
