I feel like this is definitely a series of thoughts I've had before, but, like, about an RPG that I was going to run. I think in a novel you can let your needs inform the decision, yeah? Like, you can't control where the party are going to go (or rather, you can but...) in an RPG, but in a novel you are driving the train, so you only need to worldbuild what you can see from the tracks.

Like, if I'm putting a multiverse into my story, I'm doing it for a reason. Maybe I want a cowboy and an astronaut in the party, or maybe I am putting some heat on the bad guy (If we don't do something...the Bleakness will swallow every hue of the rainbow of worlds!). That reason will tell me how deep I need to go in my worldbuilding.

I guess I'm nodding towards 'fake depth', but only in the way that everything in fiction is 'fake'. Like, you know all the stuff that is going to happen, so if you need to go into depth on one character's backstory at some point, then flesh that out. But if you aren't ever going to have characters talk about something, no need to waste your time writing notes nobody is gonna get to see, yeah?
