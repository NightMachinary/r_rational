I have, at the moment, three or four different multiverse stories in varying stages of development, and have been trying to work out some basic principles of how to make an enormous variety of cultures and histories without it being incredibly draining and/or revealing a lack of depth. Obviously if you're going to have a hundred worlds in a story, you can't (or wouldn't want to) spend hours on hours with each of those worlds, figuring out all the normal detailed worldbuilding stuff.

The way that I think of it is that if you go into any major American international airport, you'll see dozens of different people of noticeably different cultures, especially if you sit around for long enough to listen to them talk. If you're doing a multiverse, then you need to capture all the differences between people, and make it really feel like they're from different worlds.

The options, as I see them:

- Planet of Hats. Not preferred, since real places and cultures aren't like that, and it's the kind of thing you would only include for the purposes of mocking, at least nowadays. It's helpful if you have a television show or short series though, because you can just instantly 'get' a place.
- Groupings. People do this in the real world, grouping different cultures together and then sometimes pretending that they're the same, or similar enough for different policies and procedures, or for pragmatic stereotyping/profiling. It's also helpful in that you can broadly define tech level groups, governance groups, ethnic groups, etc., and it'll be easier for the reader to have a handle on, especially if you make concept handles for your different groups.
- Power law focus. 20% of worlds are responsible for 80% of the impact, so focus on that small sliver of worlds that are the most important. Depending on how your multiverse looks from a broad view, it could be that there are two or three worlds that are of extreme importance, those worlds that are at one end or the other of some distribution space. This helps to make a wide, diverse multiverse more understandable, because you can focus on the main players.
- Fake depth. Reference things that don't actually have any background, steep everything in mystery, don't inform the reader of what they're being shown, mostly so that you don't have to do all the work. You need to explain those things that are important to the plot or characters, but you can offhandedly mention weird dishes or strange customs without having to make up the entirety of the surrounding culture. I think this is probably the best way to go about it, or at least an important part.

I'm not sure that I'm looking for tips, necessarily, just thinking out loud about how to make a (non-infinite) multiverse more manageable, with applications for singular worlds with a wide variety of intermingled cultures.
