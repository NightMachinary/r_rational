  trying to work out some basic principles of how to make an enormous variety of cultures and histories without it being incredibly draining and/or revealing a lack of depth. Obviously if you're going to have a hundred worlds in a story, you can't (or wouldn't want to) spend hours on hours with each of those worlds, figuring out all the normal detailed worldbuilding stuff.

Looking at two extremes:

Option A: "Here are 100 cultures, and 1 fact about each of them." This feels shallow, and gives the impression that you have sacrificed depth for breadth.

Option B: "Here are 3 cultures. Watch as I render these 3 cultures in an incredibly high level of fidelity. See how deep these three cultures are? Oh, by the way, there are also 97 cultures that exist, and I'm not going to tell you anything about them except that they exist." The audience now sees that you have explored several cultures in depth, and will trust that all of the cultures yet unseen have just as much depth as the cultures you have shown them directly. And indeed, that is an expectation that you can make good on: every now and then, you can pull one of the 90+ unused cultures out of the toy chest to play with them for a bit, and the number of cultures that are rendered in high fidelity will gradually increase. Even if you pull one culture out for a short episode and only have time to render it in low fidelity, the audience will assume, "Oh, there's some greater depth to this culture that we just haven't seen yet, and if this culture ever comes back, surely we will get to explore some of that depth rather than just seeing it Flanderized."

  You need to explain those things that are important to the plot or characters, but you can offhandedly mention weird dishes or strange customs without having to make up the entirety of the surrounding culture.

Part of this is going to be how good you are at "off-handedly" mentioning things, but off-handedly mentioning something runs the risk of appearing shallow in a way that makes readers assume everything else will also be shallow. I recommend taking the approach I described above: pick one or two things and render them in /super/ high fidelity, then say, "oh by the way, dozens more things exist in this category, and all of those unnamed examples exist with exactly the amount of depth I spent describing that one thing." As an example, rather than off-handedly mentioning weird dishes, I would recommend having /one/ dish which is described with an exquisite amount of detail in a way that informs us about a character we care about (and ideally progresses the plot), then allow us to infer that all of the other dishes that exist in this culture must exist with the same level of detail.

If you really want something to appear deep, you have to show how /fractally/ deep it is. Which is to say, even when you zoom in a lot, you shouldn't run out of things to talk about. e.g. Meat is a category that includes beef, pork, fowl, etc. Pork is a category that includes chops, tenderloin, spareribs, and shoulder. Pork tenderloin can be roasted, baked, or grilled. Grilled pork tenderloin can be flavored with teriyaki, chili, or barbecue. (And let me tell you, my dad used to make the best chili-flavored pork tenderloin out on the grill in the back yard...) Keep peeling back the layers and show just how deep you can drill down on any part of these, and people will come away thinking, "Well, I only really got a detailed description of one kind of pork, but I assume that other varieties of pork exist with the same level of fidelity, and this leads me to believe that pork is a category that contains a lot of depth, a depth that is also probably matched by other meat categories like beef and fowl."

By doing that "deep dive" on pork tenderloin, you can also show how the categories exist in relation to each other, rather than having a list of 50 random and seemingly unrelated bullet points on a "list of foods that exist on this planet." People like putting things into categories, and subcategories, and sub-subcategories: it gives everything a context that makes it feel relevant to a larger cultural framework, as opposed to a loose factoid that isn't evidently relevant to anything in particular.

  Depending on how your multiverse looks from a broad view, it could be that there are two or three worlds that are of extreme importance, those worlds that are at one end or the other of some distribution space.

"Importance in the grand scheme of things" matters a lot less than "importance to the lives of our characters." For example, in the grand scheme of things, London is a city that is a lot more important than my home town. (My home town is of barely any cultural relevance.) However, if you were to write my biography, you would spend a lot of time talking about my home town, and very little time talking about London. While London is /objectively/ important, it's not really a part of how I subjectively experience the world, and any story told from my subjective viewpoint is probably not going to pay much heed to what's going on in London. Heck, you might read my entire biography cover-to-cover and never even encounter any /mention/ of London, despite the fact that London was a global center of commerce at the start of the 20th century.

I'd worry less about how important words are in "objective" terms and more about how relevant they are in the context of the story you are trying to tell. There might be a town somewhere with a population of 50 people, but if that happens to be the hometown of one of your main character, maybe that small town matters more than a city of 9 million people.
