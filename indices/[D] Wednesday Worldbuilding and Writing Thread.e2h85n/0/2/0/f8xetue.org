Thanks for your reply, I really like the idea of humans using tools to harvest bone marrow, or inserting impediments into the harvested bone that are held in place as the skull heals. Given how I'm viewing the bone's healing ability as really strong, I'm not sure it wouldnt push out or crush any inserted pipes, but it's a really interesting avenue to explore.
