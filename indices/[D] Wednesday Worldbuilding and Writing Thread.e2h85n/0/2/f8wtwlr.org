Is there exposed bone underwater? I'd expect any fish that can eat meat would have a much larger presence near the skull.

Birds would likely live inside the skull and do a lot of the picking clean.

If any small carnivorous mammals somehow got to the skull they'd probably flourish, but I don't know how they'd get there to begin with. Maybe by humans.

Humans might be the only ones who could break the bones, they might use it as an easy source of material. Bone marrow is edible and highly nutritious, and an untapped resource, so there would be a lot of incentive to try to find a way to access it. Maybe wooden pipes would be inserted into holes so it won't heal correctly?
