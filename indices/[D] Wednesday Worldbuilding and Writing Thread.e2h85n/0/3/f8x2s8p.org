I think the result will be very gross.

While you are correct that animals will pick the meat clean in the first week or so, once the flesh is exposed to the elements the entire skull is going to develop a massive, unholy staph infection that dribbles pus down the skull like wax from a candle. Any animals that try to eat the meat once it starts to fester will get a bad case of gastroenteritis (with explosive vomiting and diarrhea) and either die of dehydration or learn to leave the island well enough alone. Eventually, the fish will evolve to deal with the enterotoxin and start nibbling on anything accessible from the waterline, but for the first century or so you're looking at a giant pus-covered rock in the lake where nothing dares go.

Eventually, the pus is going to decay and form a oily sludge that accumulates around the skull at the bottom of the lake. It will experience outgasing and hideously scented bubbles of foul gas will periodically glorp to the surface, startling both fish and fool. (You would /have/ to be a fool in order to fishing in the lake, as by this point it would be completely undrinkable for the ambient level of bacteria in the water.) Eventually the entire thing gets covered by a shallow mound of muck. At this point there's a massive die-off of the staph and after century number two you get what's basically rich (if disease ridden) swampy soil where lakeshore plants can grow. Frogs, snakes, shorebirds and other animals will frequent the island as will a wide variety of bugs. Mushrooms will be very common, but mammals will probably avoid the place, as it's too swampy. Nobody wants to sink neck-deep into the staph-sludge, particularly once the beetles and worms start exploding in population size.

One hopes that the tiger cannot experience this happening. It would not be a happy kitty.
