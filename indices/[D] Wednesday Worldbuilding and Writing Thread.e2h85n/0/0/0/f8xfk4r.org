Thanks for your response! As far as the base layer goes, I'd been imagining that the frequency of meat spouts would be too low to allow a consistent layer of bacteria. However, I didn't take into account the fact that animals of any significant size will find it hard to remove all the meat from a flat surface of bone, which could leave enough small pieces for a layer of bacteria to form. Perhaps some kind of moss would spread? The idea of carnivorous trees is definitely one we'll need to think more about, and as far as larger animals go, I'm definitely imagining that you'd see some extremely territorial animals, or perhaps pressure towards animals that can find new meat spouts very quickly (which would be like temporary watering holes, causing animals from all over to converge and fight over the meat).
