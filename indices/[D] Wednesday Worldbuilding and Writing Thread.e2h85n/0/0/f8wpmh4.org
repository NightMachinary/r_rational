The skull likely provides a higher energy source of food than you'd get from any of the classical sources of energy, e.g. the sun or methane vents or whatever else. At the base layer of your ecosystem is whatever directly feeds on the regenerating material, and the ecosystem grows from there.

There are lots of different things you might do for that base layer. It might be plants that are sucking the nutrients up, hooking into the blood stream and hijacking the magically-created nutrients to grow into colossal trees (though a real-world tree like that just wouldn't exist, because it would need too many adaptations). Or maybe the base layer is some kind of small vermin with a large litter, which is particularly good at processing whatever can be scraped from the skull as soon as it forms, and is then eaten by even larger things. Whatever you pick, that's going to really inform the ecosystem as a whole.

For adaptations, you might have a larger animal that intentionally keeps sites clear of other predators/consumers so that the skull can grow a sizeable mound of flesh that the larger animal is more adept at consuming. Here, I'm thinking about something like a lion, which is fairly bad at getting every last bit of meat from the bone, and eventually hits diminishing returns from trying. The mechanism for allowing build-up might vary, but it would create a rule that if you see a spot of the skull where there's a sizable chunk of flesh, you had better watch out.
