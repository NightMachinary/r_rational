On some planets we've found plant-equivalents that have nervous systems. They can follow a simple library of rules to determine which of their organs (flowers, leaves, nutrient storage, etc) to grow where. Most of these plants have much larger libraries of possible features to grow than would appear on a single Earth plant.

On one of these planets, there was a highly successful genus of large grassy patches with thorny bushes, which stumbled onto carnivorism via a pitcher-plant like adaptation and started eating large herbivores, lost all competition from anything that wasn't each other, and rode that calorie surplus plus internal competition all the way to sentience.

So, the Shepherds are sentient 300-square-meter patches of grass, with various organs. The Shepherds can apply some force at joints of their sticks and at the bases of their blades of grass, but these "muscles" get tired very quickly (like a venus fly trap gets tired quickly). For fine manipulation, they use a modified shrub structure. Bare leafless sticks form a scaffold dome, and more sticks drape across this and into the dome as "fingers." They position the scaffold to move the fingers to move the object they're working on. Growing a scaffold structure takes most of a year, so they can't be too specialized, but most Shepherds grow more than one. Scaffold structures can't be much more than a meter tall though; they're not trees. (And no, they can't just grow more brain. Growing more brain just means having the same thought twice at once, badly.)

The Shepherds have invented a style of sled that can be moved with just their grassy appendages. They use a large comb the same way to groom most bugs off their grass (and into their mouths). They can add pulleys to their scaffolds to lift heavier objects, like tools, and drop them for force.

So far, so paleolithic. I'd like the Shepherds to be space-faring. How do they get there?

(And does anything during that time affect their outlook by the time you run into them as a rival in a 4X game?)
