You make your own 'river' using two water tanks and a channel. When the upper tank empties, the Shepherd uses a pulley to pour water from the lower tank into the upper tank. In human terms, this is very slow. But in Shepherd terms, it is infinitely faster than what anyone else can do.

As far as surface areas go, the big thing isn't making it more dense so much as allowing you to make your surface be vertical instead of horizontal. Just like it's easier to move a mattress if you turn it on its side, it's easier to move a Shepherd if it can be tall instead of wide.
