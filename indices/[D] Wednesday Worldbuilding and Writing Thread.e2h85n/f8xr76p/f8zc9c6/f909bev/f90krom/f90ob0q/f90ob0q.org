Yeah, 300 square meters is solar. I don't think that playing with surface shapes gets any more density though - grass already absorbs all the light that gets through it. The only improvement I can think of is using a slanted surface so they can rotate around to face the sun more of the day.

You're right about the combat advantage of mobility. They'd probably take over despite being somewhat sickly. I think that'd swing in favor of more traditionally planted Shepherds once they invent guns (I imagine they use mortars); carts would fall apart after the first round of shelling.

The thing I don't understand about monjolo-powered carts is that a monjolo is river-powered, and a cart moves.
