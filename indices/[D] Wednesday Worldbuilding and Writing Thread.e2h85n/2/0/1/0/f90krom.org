I had been under the impression that the surface area requirement was largely solar based and that as long as you had 300 square meters of sunward facing surface area, the soil requirements could be met with a root ball and regular food/water. Instead of a 10m radius circle or a 15m by 20m field, a trellis would let you occupy the lateral surface of a 4m by 25m cone. While individually they might be weaker, they could concentrate forces and pick five- or even ten-on-one fights vs field-bound Shepherds.

For the cart, you'd use a [[https://qxf2.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/crank_animation.gif][crank]] to convert the reciprocating hammer motion into rotational motion along the wheel's axle. Or, once they get the idea of making a specialist design for cart propulsion, by hooking it up to a water wheel directly.
