A dirty trick to for illusion of depth is to have flawed in-setting methods of simplifying the material. Your groupings option sounds like the best candidate for that - people in-setting group cultures together, but the groupings are transparently not very good at explaining things and riddled with exceptions, because the truth is more complicated. The truth might actually be fairly simple, but you've shown that it's more complicated than something, it'll always be anchored to that comparison.

Real-world cultures are composed of layer upon layer of subcultures. Just demonstrating that someone's outlook is informed by a subculture of their culture is enough to hint at a much richer world. Even if you're full on Planet Of Hats, you can have two Proud Warrior Race Guys bounce off each other because one's from the meticulous care of weapons subculture and the other is from the always recite heroic epics subculture. And subcultures really are much less nuanced than full cultures.

Planet Of Hats works a lot better if you do Planet Of Hats And Scarves. Or is it Planet Of Mismatched Gloves? Whatever, what I mean is you pick two stereotypes. You get something more original by default since there are more pairs of things than there are things. And you're more likely to be able to come up with something relevant to one of two cliches in a given scene than you are for one, so you don't have to have Worf compare scanning a nebula to combat just to give him a line.

The 80-20 rule applies to which subcultures of a culture are going to be relevant to the wider world. American Evangelical Christians are more important to world politics than American Roman Catholics, despite similar numbers. Subcultures are less nuanced than their parent cultures. You might find that everyone you ever meet from Sirius VII is a cutthroat slimeball, even though the planet itself is a fully nuanced world with a rich history (off camera), because Sirius VII Space Shipping has a toxic corporate culture and is also the primary reason you run into Siriusians off their planet.
