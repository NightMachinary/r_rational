I suppose there could be problems if it's serial fiction. He leaves the world building until it actually comes up, and then explains it in story. But if he misjudges how influential something is, or just doesn't do enough to make the new stuff fit within the established, he could end up with a story where people aren't using resources that should be available and known to them, or fail to take countermeasures against things that are introduced later. Not a big problem if the story is reasonably short, but could be annoying to deal with if it goes on for a while. I've noticed a few minor instances of this happening in WtC.
