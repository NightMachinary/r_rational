I think all of these could probably work in combination, with a nod to the fact that the "hats" in Planet of Hats are stereotypes and there is diversity within cultures.

Edit: Like, not every Viking is literally a warrior, indeed a majority aren't. But their culture does very heavily value warriors and they're the element of society that had the most interaction with outsiders (via raiding parties). So they're a "warrior race".

But occasionally you'll meet Norse traders, fishermen, slaves etc, and if you actually visit their homeland you'll obviously find a whole society with of details you can't just extrapolate from their hat.

Actually, a good rule of thumb might be that each culture gets a minimum of two hats. Vikings would get labelled as warriors /and/ sailors, for example.
