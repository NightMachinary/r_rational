My advice would be that you should have make each culture a Planet of Hats with only a small hint that the Hat doesn't quite describe the entirety of the culture, but then flesh it out if you ever end up spending a long amount of time there...

Which, I suppose, is kind of all four of those ideas mashed together. Go into depth with the few places you spend a lot of time (power law), and make the rest Planets of Hats, but with just enough fake depth to imply that the Hat is a stereotype and not the reality.
