Imagine a binary star system containing a red giant (large bright star) and a brown dwarf (small dim star) with an alien planet in an [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Planets_in_binary_star_systems_-_P-_and_S-type.svg][S-type]] orbit around the brown dwarf. This plane has an orbital period of a roughly 16 Earth-years and a rotational period of roughly three Earth-days. As a result, the inhabitants experience an eight Earth-year long "summer" where they experience day-round sunlight and temperate climates alternating with an eight Earth-year long "winter" where the entire planet freezes over for lack of solar warmth.

The native life has developed a cicada-like life cycle, where creatures live for an entire (eight year) summer before laying extremely durable eggs (or seed pods, or spores, or whatever other form of durable larval stage you care to invent) that are expected to survive through the winter and hatch during the next thaw, completely isolated from the prior generation. Your species, due to meddling precursors, has been uplifted to sapience and gifted with bronze era technology, but has not been removed from this environment. What's your plan for ensuring the prosperity of your progeny, given that they won't come out of their eggs knowing how to read and you can only leave them supplies that will survive being frozen for eight years using only bronze era technology?
