The first order of business is trellises (cybernetic scaffolds made out of sturdier materials, allowing a Shepherd to grow into shapes that their biology would not ordinarily support) and monjolos (a sort of water-powered hammer, which takes a stream of water from a reservoir and uses its downhill flow to produce an up and down hammering motion). Together, these allow the Shepherds to craft much more intricate tools. Critically, the trellis allows for objects larger than a meter across to be assembled, while the monjolo allows for a single strenuous lifting of water to be parcelled out into several hours of repetitive hammering or turning.

The next big thing is the wheel. Instead of using a sled to move objects along the Shepherd's surface, you plant a baby Shepherd onto a wheeled cart and have it push itself along the ground using a monjolo hooked up to a wheel. These become a sort of warrior-merchant-aristocrat caste, similar to the bronze age warrior-priest castes. They're still planted in soil (which is held inside the cart), but they've grown up around a series of mast-like trellises which lean out over the sides of the cart, twig-covered limbs draping down like construction cranes.

This cart caste can't build as well as a flat caste, but it can project force and carry messages. The more flats a cart has supporting it, the better its equipment and the better it does against other carts. This probably leads to a feudal system with a Cart King ruling over Cart Lords who offer up levies of well-constructed carts (who serve as both warriors and mobile labourers) in exchange for protection against neighboring kingdoms.

If there are any animals which can be domesticated as work animals, they will be domesticated now if they haven't already - a cart pulled by an animal is swifter than one who pulls itself and is still fresh when it arrives at its destination. Getting livestock for food is more difficult, as most of the things a Shepherd would want to eat (insects, variously sized herbivores) are difficult to keep in an animal pen when you the farmer happen to be made out of edible foliage and are also the animal pen at the same time. Fortunately, there's a solution to that: aquaculture.

If a Shepherd is planted around the rim of a small pond, and is given the requisite trellises to reach over and into the pond as needled, it will be able to farm fish inside the pond and plants which the fish can eat around the rim of the pond. When naturally occurring ponds are all tended, new ones can be dug by the cart caste (at great expense - digging deep holes is a lot of work) in exchange for a cut of the fish. More practically, you'd run out of gardening space before you ran out of room for fish, so instead you'd have some Shepherds growing in long rows in order to maximize their available gardening space, with the understanding that they can trade their garden produce (which isn't directly edible) for fish.

Fire is tricky when you're made out of wood, but it's also required for both metal working and chemistry. The most likely solution is that the cart caste will plant specialist flat castes out in the middle of nowhere and make them conduct any dangerous research projects (including ones involving fire), with promises of food and other material rewards if they are successful Eventually, one of them figures out basic metal working and the cart castes are born into trellises of bronze with clockwork manipulators of frightful dexterity. Iron will be more difficult and will likely require a specialist caste who lives suspended from a crane inside a pit quarry. But iron and steel follow in turn, allowing for still better trellises to be built.

At some point, the idea of having multiple lesser castes share a trellis will be devised, intertwined with one another as to allow greater productivity. No doubt it will be met with horror at first, but it'll be too efficient not to adopt - anyone who refuses for moralistic reasons will get left behind by those with fewer compunctions. The net result is that industrial era cities for the Shepherds are great greenhouses of steel and glass, full of intricate machinery and sprawling worker vines, watched over by rolling blade-armed overseers.

Eventually fire gets introduced to the common factories (too expensive, keeping it restricted to the experimentalists out in the wilderness) and something like an automobile gets built, using steam power and later electrical power (which is generated using steam) to make the cart caste even stronger and faster and later on to make the factories work without the need for open flames.

From there, the progress toward the space age converges with our own. They make rockets (first for military reasons, then for communication satellites, then to explore space) and send up cart caste astronauts alongside some flat castes packed into the walls of the ship (nobody would agree to go to space without their slaves). Whatever it is that you expect Humans to need in order to develop into a proper 4X faction (FTL and laser weapons, doubtlessly), the Shepherds also develop for much the same reasons - they too want to go fast and zap people with lasers.

Overall, great villains, totally stealing them.
