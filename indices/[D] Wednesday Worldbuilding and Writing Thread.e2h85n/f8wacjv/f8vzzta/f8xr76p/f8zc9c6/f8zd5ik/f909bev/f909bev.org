Wow, these are some great ideas!

Trellises and monjolos are a great idea, those really open things up.

I don't think that being planted on a cart would be healthy - it'd be hard to build a cart large enough for 300 square meters of soil. They could survive smaller if they ate enough meat, but that's even further away from their ancestral nutrition than when humans switched to a mostly grain diet. That's not going to stop them, but I don't think cart-dwellers end up being a high caste.

I don't understand how to use a monjolo to propel a cart.

Planting individuals in industrial contexts opens things up a lot. I think that fills in the gaps I had about how they get through their industrial era.

  Whatever it is that you expect Humans to need in order to develop into a proper 4X faction (FTL and laser weapons, doubtlessly)

More guns and less lasers in this setting, and no force fields. Discovering FTL requires space telescopes outside of orbit. Humans discover the FTL effect when Kepler II starts having attitude control issues after a series of black hole imaging experiments. I carefully picked a set of conditions that don't contradict any experimental evidence, but the rest is of course hand-chosen to be as convenient as possible.

  Overall, great villains, totally stealing them.

Well it's a 4X, so they're only as likely to be villains as anyone else is. They're not as warlike as the Artenids (evolved from pack-hunting squidbirds), omnicidal as the Bestrons (once like a parasitic vertebrate-eating hermit crab, now entirely mechanical), insane as the Humans, or as much of a late-game terror as the Nebulons (goofy looking stork-like things that evolved to sentience to better distinguish novelty in the baubles they collect for their their nesting displays).

One advantage the Shepherds have is that, since they can survive on photosynthesis alone (although adding meat would be healthier), they can sustain about 10x the population that, say, humans eating plants would. On the other hand, they can't fit in small spaceships.
