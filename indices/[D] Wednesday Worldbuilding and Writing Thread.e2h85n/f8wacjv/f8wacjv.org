Hi, my friend and I are working on a setting that includes a huge freshwater sea, in the middle of which is a gargantuan tiger skull, the size of a large island. The skull is a remnant of a tiger with a ridiculously powerful healing ability, along with slow, consistent growth. Think Deadpool levels of regeneration, just a bit slower. Additionally, the skull (and the animal it came from) slowly grows larger, and the bones denser.

Periodically, semi-random places on the bone will begin regenerating meat and blood, creating growing temporary plains of living tissue, which are soon scoured clean by animal life. These points are semi-random in that there is some node at the base of the skull nearer to which these meat spouts are more common.

The bones regenerate faster than the meat, and are harder to break, which is why the bones haven't been broken down, and any time the power attempts to grow beyond a skull, the cartilage connecting to other bones gets eaten away, breaking the connection to the power. So the creature is trying to regenerate, but can't do it as fast as the animals that eat any part of it that they can.

There are a lot more details to this setting, and a lot beyond just this specific area that I could talk about, but I don't want to prejudice any possible responses.

The Question: What kind of ecosystems (both human and animal) do you think would develop over the few thousand years this skull has been here? The details of the rates of meat regeneration and size growth aren't set in stone, and can be adjusted to support any really cool ecosystems ideas and story settings. If you find something broken about this power, we could adjust it until it's fixed, or accept it and see what systems of humans and animals would crop up to exploit it.

Thanks for your help guys
