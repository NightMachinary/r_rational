That's a fascinating idea.

With intermittent growths, you've got boom-bust population dynamics. Things that are small and can reproduce rapidly do better at first. Rats are more immediate than dogs, insects more immediate than rats, and bacteria most immediate of all. I'd expect that sea to be /full/ of flesh-eating bacteria--no chance I'd even go near it. The locals' immune systems either resist the bacteria, or they die. Maybe the fresh meat itself has an immune system.

In any case I imagine the carnivorous equivalent of an algal bloom; hundreds of small fish underwater (piranha, crustaceans, worms), insects at ground level (ants, flies, wasps, and especially [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermestidae][demestidae beetles]]), and birds (crows, magpies, vultures, seagulls) above that.

The piranha will turn on each other when meat grows scarce. Birds will eat insects, as will lizards and other medium-scale predators that happen by. You may even get bears paddling in to get a quick bite.

Check out [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_fall][whale fall]] for some idea of what it might look like--that's where a whale carcass descends into the deep ocean and causes an ecosystem to grow around it. Also there's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYbAwulg5zw][Scishow episode]] about it, which talks about how sulfur-loving bacteria change the local ecosystem entirely.

In fact...

All that tiger flesh is going to have implications for the chemistry of the sea. The water will be iron rich--bog iron would abound in the wetlands surrounding the sea. There will be toxic sulfurous clouds, and depending on how the flesh rots there might be large anoxic zones that kill most fish and crustations that enter them. Nitrogen and phosphorous will cause actual [[https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/harmful-algal-blooms][algal blooms]] that are also quite deadly.

Despite all that, water draining from the sea will leave very fertile floodplains. Between that and the iron, humanity will want to settle nearby--but perhaps not too nearby! Humans living there will need some way of determining whether river water is full of flesh-eating bacteria on any given day, or maybe they'll need to boil all the water as a matter of course. Maybe mats of disgusting bacteria, rotting flesh, and dead animals wash down the river periodically. The locals will notice that, and have traditions and protocols around it.

I've got to say, I really like this tiger island idea.
