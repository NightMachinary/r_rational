Loved it,and I'm excited for more! Has anyone read the short web comic Alice Grove? This has a lot of shared elements with that, but it's ultimately different and more fleshed out.

Here's a link to the the first page of Alice Grove (220 pages). The site doesn't have great navigation for its mobile version. [[http://www.alicegrove.com/page/220]]
