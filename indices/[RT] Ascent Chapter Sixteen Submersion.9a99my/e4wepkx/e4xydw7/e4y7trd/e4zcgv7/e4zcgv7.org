I suppose that depends on your definition of 'ancient'. It was only as long ago as the Napoleonic wars are from our time!

For Stephen Baxter I would start with Proxima - its a standalone near-future novel and less insanely expansive than the Xeelee books. As for Iain Banks - the Player of Games out of the Culture books is the shortest, most self-contained and possibly the best. With Alastair Reynolds the Revelation Space series is still his best - just start at the beginning with Revelation Space.
