I should say that I meant your story is more fleshed out, and that is not a criticism of Alice Grove.

Mild Spoilers: The lost ancient human tech including Nano Machines and AI. Their roles here quite are different though. Also, the situation isn't so dire.

Do you have some book recommendations by those authors?
