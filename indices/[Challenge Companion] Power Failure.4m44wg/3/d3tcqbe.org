I've often wanted to see this crossed with historical fiction. Put the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859][Carrington Event]] in the middle of World War I, for example. Newly electrified cities lose their power as their lines overload and catch fire. Telegraph communication fails across the front lines, and automotive commutators heat up and fuse to their brushes.

A vicious disease kills the world's horses, cattle, and oxen some time in the early 1800s. Alternately, a grain blight that kills all the corn, wheat, and/or rice.
