My favorite book for this trope is "Earth Abides". It's about a disease-based-apocalypse. Where the main character survives it because he got bitten by a snake while out hiking and had been recuperating alone in a cabin in the woods.

It goes about the normal trope of things falling apart due to most people being dead. But the book quickly picks up speed as he meets other survivors. And then they start a colony, and starting to try to reboot civilization. There's no huge battle scenes with big stakes. No desperate struggle for survival against impossible odds. Just everyday people trying to figure out how to survive when most of civilization is gone.

It's the most believable and realistic "end of civilization" style book I've ever read.
