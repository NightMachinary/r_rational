As a separate recommendation, at the exact opposite end of the spectrum from Earth Abides:

Ex-Heroes by Peter Clines. It's about a zombie apocalypse in a "I can't believe it's not DC Comics" universe. Where the zombie virus simply killed most of the superheros. The remaining ones have set up an enclave at one of the old movie studio lots in hollywood. Because most of them have nice big stone walls and few entrances for security/secrecy reasons.

Main characters: Iron (wo)man. I can't believe it's not Batman. Actual Rorschach. I can't believe it's not Catwoman. And Lizard Superman. And the one obligatory crippled-superhero who has world-shattering power, for about 2minutes per day.
