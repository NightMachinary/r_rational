Not really. Day of the Triffids is about struggling with an external enemy (a non-sapient one, but still an enemy). Earth abides is more about "what would people do if civilization collapsed".

Interestingly, they find someone similar to the protagonist of Day of the Triffids in Earth Abides. He's the first (and only) person to get put to death, with his ideas of polygamy being one of the best ways to spread disease in a no-contraception world.
