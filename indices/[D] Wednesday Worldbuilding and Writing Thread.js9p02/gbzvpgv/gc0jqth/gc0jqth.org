Existing cantrips:

- Guidance is a D&D cantrip that gives a small bonus (+1 in 3.5, +1d4 in 5E) to any skill check. If cantrips can be cast constantly like 5E ones, then this one cantrip is enough to justify the high school magic curriculum by itself. Especially for professions that consist of bashing your head against a problem until you succeed, like artists and engineers, you'd want to cast that constantly (unless you had a better, non-stacking bonus).

- Cure Minor Wounds (3.5), in addition to curing a paltry 1 HP, also stabilizes a dying person, making it competitive with a complete course in EMT training.

- Mending is a lot better than glue, tape, etc, so that's worth knowing.

- Minor Illusion doesn't have any canonical limitation in fidelity, so that's a remarkably powerful tool for data visualization, communication, giving presentations, and so forth.

- Prestidigitation is, as always, endlessly useful. It flavors food, so that's at least enough to barely learn to cook and never buy spices.

New spells:

- All sorts of minor divinations would be useful. Magically measuring things is very handy, I'd expect a lot of variation on that by trade - off the top of my head carpenters, architects, transportation engineers, tailors, chemists, and athletes.. Medical divinations seem particularly important - even if it's just weight/height/pulse/blood pressure that's some time saved for a nurse and a godsend for an EMT. I wonder whether magic's idea of how hard error-checking is differs enough from a compiler's idea to be useful in programming.

- Mending only works on broken things, but if you could make a variant that works on raw materials then you can use that for superior welding, carpentry, and other trades. I feel like a material-specific version has to be limited enough to count as a cantrip (Weld, Join Wood, etc).

- There are attack cantrips that create fire or frost, which presumably could be modified into more efficient and less combat-ready forms of heating and cooling for chemical processes.

- There are attack cantrips that create small amounts of a material - acid in particular is popular. Again, a version that fills a cup with acid can probably make more acid than a version that was designed to fling acid at your enemies (Create Water makes at least two gallons of the stuff). It's not clear whether the conjured acid disappears - free matter creation is always interesting, but temporary matter is even more interesting chemically. Imagine a chemist gets to perform an experiment in an acid solution, then the acid disappears, precipitating the result instantly.
