Have you read the reply to Radioterrill? I'll post it here if you haven't:

I just want to write a cool fantasy story really, and I don't mind the world too much. What I am going with for now is: an Isekai fantasy (not litRPG) where the story is rarely from the perspective of the isekaied "MC" (but always furthers their plot, as in, the perspectives are all about the MC). And the protag got Isekaied into a hive-mind head-crab(s). - As in, they are a parasitic hive-mind organism which takes control of other creatures (including humans).

The idea is I really like other perspective but hate them when they 1. Don't progress the plot, 2. are about a completely different plot. And I also really like Isekais + non-human protags (especially if they are traditionally "evil" beings), Hence that is what I wanna do.

As you can see, that setting works in almost any world, and I don't mind it really, the only consequence is the follow-on effects in the world's culture the more magic there is which means more world-building (which I don't really want to do).

---

I'd like someone (who likes doing this and would like to do this for fun) to actually MAKE the magic system, world, maps, politics, and consequences off all this. Like actually just do the whole world-building.

I wouldn't mind using someone else's already created world as well if they don't mind me using it. Just I figured some people like doing this and I don't, so why not ask?
