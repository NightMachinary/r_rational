Cool, but unfortunately not at all aligned with my subjective tastes; I don't like any setting where there are some higher-beings creating games etc for lower ones and humans being one of them. Don't enjoy any artificial "death games" like fate/stay night, Dungeon crawler Carl etc or any xanxia which continuously increasing power-levels etc. I am pretty set on wanting just a standard fantasy world like Azarynth healer, Life of a Summoned Demoness, Shade touched etc but no system for a generic isekai story.\\
What I'm after is anyone who is interested in thinking up the specifics; the magic system, the political and geographical situation and characters etc.

Thanks though.
