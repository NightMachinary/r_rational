  And the protag got Isekaied into a hive-mind head-crab(s). - As in, they are a parasitic hive-mind organism which takes control of other creatures (including humans).

I think I have a world for you.

I intended to use it myself, but this makes more sense I think.

TLDR: Imagine a multiversal level species of godlike aliens, who love to watch "spectator sports", of the strategy/tactics variety. What they do is they pluck the an entire race of sentients, like humans, and teleport them, naked and unarmed, on a completely virgin version of their planet. The planet would be just like Earth, if humans never evolved on it.

Now, about 1 in a billion of humans, instead of being bodily inserted there, are instead turned into a a hive of parasites that can take over humans without the humans detecting them. The human "victims" think they have free will, and have a blind spot that prevents them from noticing the head-crab, theirs or on others. Only the insane, brain damaged, or extremely drunk/high humans can notice the crabs, but only briefly before the control is re-asserted. Otherwise, the crabs control them in a way that feels like it was their natural idea.

The game the Crabs must play is thus: the 8 hiveminds each are given a different place in the world, and access to a similar starting population. Their goal is to create a world-spanning empire in 5000 years, and defeat all the other Crab Hives. The last Hive standing is rewarded with being "uplifted" to a status of a godlike being just like the Spectators. The losers have their minds deleted from the face of space-time.

- Each Hive starts with one crab controlling one human. They must not only breed new crabs but also FIND the other humans.

- Human population is spread optimally all over the virgin planet (more where there is good land and pleasant weather, fewer on the deserts or the polar region). The Hives must reach these humans as fast as possible, lest the humans die of exposure, or form their own hostile tribes.

- both the Hives and the natural humans only have as much survival knowledge as they would normally have, and must learn through trial and error. Most humans will die, and some Hives might even fail before their war starts.

- Essentially, this would be a bit of a LitRTS world, with Hives as "players" controlling their populations through the continents and centuries, but also LitRPG about individual humans within the Hives (and "wild", uncontrolled humans) having adventures and "leveling up" at survival and then, at the skills needed to further the empires. So for example, one chapter could follow the thought process and strategic battles of the Hive, while another focuses on the adventures of a particular guy who first deals with the wilderness "Robinson Cruse/Cast Away" style, then becomes a leader of a tribe, then a general of the Hive's empire, being unknowingly manipulated.

- I would prefer to have the setting be low-magic. Basically the only magic in it would be the psychic power of the Hive that allows it to not just control, but upgrade and "level up" its individual slaves. This should allow the individual humans to use feats of "magical seaming" levels of knowledge, almost superhuman skill and "precognition" where in fact they would be just tapping unconsciously into the power given by the Hive. Other than that, this would start as survivalist setting of humans VS prehistoric wild nature, and then human empires vs other human empires.

What do you think?
