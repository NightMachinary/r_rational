Please clarify, is this for a setting in which the main character has been reincarnated as a parasitic hive-mind and we see their actions from the perspective of the native host species, or a setting in which the main character has been reincarnated as a human, but where the primary perspective is a parasitic hive-mind organism whose plans are foiled by the protagonist? These have somewhat different world-design constraints, as you can probably imagine.
