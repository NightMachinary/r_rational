  Imagine a character who is world renowned for winning the Chutes and Ladders World Championship 3 times in a row, and everyone in universe takes this seriously.

That is a hilarious idea.

I'd definitely have a reveal that there is some crazy explanation for their victories--a demon, say--and that the character unwittingly loses the geas contest for 'cheating' despite thinking they'd won all those times with personal skill.
