Not really, you have to give up something meaningful or make a solemn promise for the power to kick in. If you say gave up eating any meat that would be enough to work. That said, there are certain circumstances where his power will improve and in his strong state he could make such a contract but it would probably not last very long or give you much of a benefit. The main character is also limited in how many contracts he can have open at once, so he probably wouldn't waste it.

The actual circumstances are due to a winner of a game winning while the main character is in a strong state and not realizing it. The winner gains the ability to make a rule that people have to follow in a certain range of themselves, as long as they themselves are willing to follow it. The winner makes a rule compelling people to tell the truth and goes to Washington, with a good chunk of the city suddenly losing the ability to lie without warning. It isn't just lying, you are literally compelled to tell the truth though you can just remain silent. But this isn't a good look for the politicians that choose not to talk to anyone. Funny chaos ensues before the winner comes clean and admits what they did out of guilt when there are several suicides/deaths. This act makes the gamesmaster infamous and leads to the chaos of the games as everyone dreams about what else they could win.

A completely random game could be funny though I think giving some way to change the dice rolls by adding/subtracting would make it more strategic depending on what they do.
