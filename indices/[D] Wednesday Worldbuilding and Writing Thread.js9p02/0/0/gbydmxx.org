If you gain benefits from entering into these contracts, could the contracts be stupidly specific and unlikely so that you could get these benefits without any real cost? "I promise not to eat live mongoose while married to a woman named Ermina Willingham III." And then make a dozen contracts like that so you get a range of benefits.

Losing the ability to lie isn't particularly bad, you just have to be clever about what you say. If it's a temporary affliction, they take some sick days off work.
