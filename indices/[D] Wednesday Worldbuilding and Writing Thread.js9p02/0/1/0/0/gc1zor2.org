What the main character specifically does is create a projection of himself and anything he is wearing within line of sight. He wears a costume/mask, not sure what he wears, that he uses to hide his nervousness/stage right. This projection forcibly creates a telepathic link of the people that are directly around it. This link makes it impossible to lie or tell half-truths as people can see each other's thoughts and feelings. He can only keep the link active for about ten minutes before he gets a massive headache and he will eventually fall unconscious if he keeps pushing things. While people are linked is when you can actually make a contract.

In his games, he hides somewhere nearby with a telescope or camera than projects his appearance near the people who want to play. Once he becomes famous, there are hordes of people wearing his costume and showing up wherever he announces the next game so it is much easier to hide.

I don't think you could do a youtube that was by itself supernatural but he normally posts a puzzle on a website that if solved shows the location of the next game. That said there are other power users in the world so I could imagine someone makign a contract with the gamesmaster to boost their power for help. So maybe.

The Liar Game has a great musical chairs arc that had alot of strategy and was related to gambling. I have a vague idea of a large scale game as the first big game held after the world becomes aware of the gamesmaster. The large amount of losers and the unpleasant side effects of losing are used to discourage too many players from playing at once. Because realistically if such a game was offered where you could win mental superpowers or cure a mental illness in the US at least, the number of people who would come to play would be huge.

I was thinking of some type of dice or card game with betting as a major component and you have to earn a certain amount to make it to the next game. The trick is that you can only bet beanie babies or something silly like that with the more valuable the beanie babie the more it is worth in betting. Perhaps also a rule that you can only bet with beanie babies you are directly carrying by yourself to keep rich people from buying out entire stores. Plus I just love the absurdity of criminals cheating and killing each other to steal someone's beanie baby collection and someone saying the line, " I raise you a claude the crab," with complete seriousness.
