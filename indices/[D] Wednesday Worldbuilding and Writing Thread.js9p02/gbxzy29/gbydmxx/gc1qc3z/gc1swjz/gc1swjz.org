If you're really trying to ratchet up the absurdity, can you imagine intense 24-hour news coverage/analysis in the style of national election media frenzies but instead covering people trying to guess how many marbles are in a huge jar?

Or you could distort children's games like Musical Chairs or Duck Duck Goose into horrifying bloodbaths.

Would the power be extensible to games played asynchronously/asymmetrically/remotely? Could the person with the power just publish a YouTube video with a "You laugh you lose" or "you flinch you lose" challenge and see the world line up to attempt it?
