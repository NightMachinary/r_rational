For less conventional games, you have the publicity stunt style of contest/endurance trial, like putting four people in a phone booth or requiring then to put their left hand on the surface of a car with the winner being the last to give up and leave. Or things like the dance-athon.

Spelling bees are already hilariously tense and over-dramatized, applying the same atmosphere to normal people who are not semi-traumatized 11-year-olds who train obsessively could be hilarious.

Arrangements where a single person who is not themselves a player get to select a winner at their sole direction could create fun scenarios. Think, the Bachelor type of contest. The Bachelor has lots of power here, but only one of the contestants can actually win. Most reality TV competitions or game shows are actually pretty ripe for this as well, especially if you want to get into satirizing how rigged these contests can be and how that might or might not mesh well with this power.
