  What are some realistic consequences if politicians and bureaucrats in government literally lost their ability to lie? Beyond the comedy aspects, which is probably going to be hard to write.

I'd hide the fact that they've lost the ability to lie, at first--and just have one politician go mute while the rest are on recess or something. When they get back chaos ensues, with a manhunt for the person causing lying to be impossible. All the while everyone involved can't help but give genuine reasons to want to be able to lie again--personal embarrassments, mostly, as a way of screening their political motivations.

  Any funny ideas for contests that people take WAY too seriously?

You could make a big deal about how the MC has a contingency option that he won't use because it's too powerful and dangerous. When he is forced to use it, it should be challenging someone to "The Game," which of course you instantly lose by thinking about. Turns out neither player has heard of it (or his memory was wiped and all he knows is that his opponent will instantly lose if he brings it up) so a bystander decides the winner by explaining it to one or the other.

You could parody all the insane extra rules for rock paper scissors. Two players in a solemn competition keep making up weirder and weirder hand signs and meanings. Jumpcut to whiteboarding the interactions between fifty hand signs.

You could have someone challenge someone else to tic-tac-toe, undergoing a contract 'if you lose'. It's a tie. Then they get into an argument about whether a tie is a loss. The loser of the argument necessarily is the loser overall--meaning you can talk about the Lawyer paradox.

You can have him moderate the Ultimatum game, except each participant secretly arranged for their friend to communicate threats to the other participant (since the participants cannot speak). Like "If you give him less than 51% of the total, he's committed to burning your house down." "Aha, my teammate thought of that, and has already sold his house!" or some other barely-plausible escalation.

Other than those game ideas, you should have a scene early on where the MC goes on live television with some world leaders to explain how he arranged for all of them to agree to a treaty where none would try to use his powers for political gain, and will punish anyone who does. The loss of the mental benefits that the contract provides would disadvantage any defector--they agreed to it in response to a 'mental benefits arms race'--but the punishment that the others would mete out ends up being their primary motivation. Also the scene culminates in the world leaders singing and dancing, the second part of his Geas, as proof that it is genuine.

Feel free to change these ideas however it suits you.
