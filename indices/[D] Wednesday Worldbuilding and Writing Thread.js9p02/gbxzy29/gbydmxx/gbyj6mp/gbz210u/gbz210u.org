  A completely random game could be funny though I think giving some way to change the dice rolls by adding/subtracting would make it more strategic depending on what they do.

Well, yeah. Of course adding some method of affecting the outcome would make it more strategic. But the humor is in having high stakes and analysis for a game that gives small children the illusion of strategy, but any adult sees after reading the rules that you do a bunch of dice rolls but ultimately have no method of changing your chance to win or playing better than your opponent. It's an overly complicated coin flip.

Imagine a character who is world renowned for winning the Chutes and Ladders World Championship 3 times in a row, and everyone in universe takes this seriously.
