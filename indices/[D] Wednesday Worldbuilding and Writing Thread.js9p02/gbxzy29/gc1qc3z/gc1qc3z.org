Self-modifying games like Nomic, Mao, or 1000 Blank White Cards could be interesting, although very complex when applied to this power. Especially since you typically play multiple rounds with round winners jockeying for more control of the series/tournament.

If you're looking for comedic effect, improv/theater games that encourage absurd behavior are a pretty direct path: think of playing Zip-Zap-Zop with somebody famously dignified, like the Pope or the Dalai Lama. Party games like Truth or Dare or Spin the Bottle fall into this category, too. Doubly so, since many of these have no victory condition, or extremely subjective/vague victory conditions.

Collaborative/co-operative games like Pandemic where all the players either win or lose together would be interesting from an outside game-theoretical perspective. Some people might strategically try to lose on purpose, effectively introducing meta-level of co-opetition. Games that allow multiple winners or allied victory are also similar.
