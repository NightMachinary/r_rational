no no, I'd like someone (who likes doing this and would like to do this for fun) to actually MAKE the magic system, world, maps, politics, and consequences off all this. Like actually just do the whole world-building.

I wouldn't mind using someone else's already created world as well if they don't mind me using it. Just I figured some people like doing this and I don't, so why not ask?
