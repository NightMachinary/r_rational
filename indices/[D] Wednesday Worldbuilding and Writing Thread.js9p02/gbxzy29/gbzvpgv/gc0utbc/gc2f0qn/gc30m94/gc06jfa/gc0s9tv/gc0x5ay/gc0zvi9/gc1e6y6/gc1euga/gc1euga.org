Yeah, the first one. isekaied into a parasitic hive-mind, and the local species (human/semi-furry or fantasy races w/e) we see the perspective off mostly. I'm imagining the Isekaided hive-mind character is doing a lot of base-building in the "wild", which most of the native characters only see the tip off, but through implication can see the progress of the "MC".
