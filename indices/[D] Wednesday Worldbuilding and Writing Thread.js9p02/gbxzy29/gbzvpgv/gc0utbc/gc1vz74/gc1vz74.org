I think the most interesting thing about this idea is having an external verification of internal properties of my mind. I'm a chronic procrastinator, but one of the things that I've learned is that at least some of my procrastination isn't procrastination. The problem isn't that I am having trouble doing this thing I want to do. The problem is that I've convinced myself that I want or should want to do something that I don't really want.

Now, this doesn't account for all of my procrastination. Honestly probably not more than 10% of it. But the segment it does cover has been really important to my personal growth and understanding of myself. If I could just take a pill and suddenly have the truth that there are some things I just don't want made apparent to me without the need/opportunity for extended introspection, I'm not sure how things would change for me, but it seems likely to be just as dramatic as the actual effect of removing procrastination from my habits.
