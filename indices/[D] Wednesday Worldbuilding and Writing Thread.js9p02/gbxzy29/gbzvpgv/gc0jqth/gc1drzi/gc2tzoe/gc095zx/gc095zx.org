Mage hand obviously has a ton of uses, from daily convenience to chemical safety. Mending would be a massive labor saving device, completely invalidating lots of minor industries, and make basically every object we make last much longer. Mold earth can replace various earthmoving machines. Minor illusion would be a pretty fantastic teaching aid, and would have a thousand other small uses. Prestidigitation, the cleaning part of it, would be hugely useful in the medical field.

As for potential cantrips, minor magical things that would be useful in a dungeon crawl but would be revolutionary in a society: A sterilize water cantrip. Would have prevented any number of disease outbreaks, but is minor enough in a game as to barely merit mention. A boil water cantrip would have a similar function but also be convenient for 1st world people.
