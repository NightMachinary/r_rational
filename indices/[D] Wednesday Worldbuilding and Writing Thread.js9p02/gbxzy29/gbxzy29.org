So I've been working on a idea for story and had a few questions to make the world building a bit more coherent.

Story Title - Terms and Conditions

Elevator Pitch: The story is a comedy inspired by Yu-gi-oh, Metalocalypse, and Penny Arcade's paint the line. Where death, intricate conspiracies, destruction, social upheaval, rebellions, and more occur around simple games. All while the games master tries to do everything he can to ensure the games finish with minimal death and destruction since the stupid players constantly look for loopholes, unorthodox playing styles, and cheating to make the games more dangerous and chaotic.

The story takes place in a world similar to our own except for the existence of a very small number of people born with powers that often have strange conditions that can causes its strengths/capabilities to vary wildly. In the past before guns and science, they were the premier players of the world. But in modern times they are seen as little more than occasional scientific curiosities. Most governments give very generous incentives for people to register their powers and beyond a powered person using their power for occasional pranks or the odd crime every few years, they are pretty much ignored.

The main character is a man currently suffering from crippling depression and anxiety. He has recently gained a power that allows him to form mental contracts others, which forms a geas on the brains of the participants to give them incentive to follow the contract. If a person believes they have broken the contract, everyone under the geas instantly knows about it and they have to suffer a random mental penalty. But to compensate, there is also a random mental benefit you gain as soon as you are put under a geas to encourage the participants to follow the contract. This geas cannot be put on someone who is unwilling to have it. It must be voluntary.

The punishments are temporary and can include things like blindness, increased sensitivity to pain, severe and uncontrollable muscle tremors, the inability to recognize faces, unusual delusions, and visual/auditory hallucinations. Rewards can include things like enhanced senses, being able to temporarily use bullet time, increased memory recall to the point of mental time travel, a cure for mental disorders, improved learning capabilities, etc. If a person actively hates and fights the geas it only lasts a few weeks but otherwise it can actually last for months and potentially even longer if the person under the geas desires the benefits from staying under it.

Despite how powerful his ability is and how easily it would make him wealthy, the main character does not register himself as a powered person. He does not like or trust his government and considers them idiots beholden to the rich and immoral corporations that have ruined the world and the environment. Instead he decides to use his power to try and make himself happy and get over his depression by pushing people into playing games with him. As he is a former game designer who used to design board games and he has always been a huge fan of media involving mental battles, unorthodox strategies, and heavily studies game theory. Everything goes well until people realize that they can win a VERY powerful prize in his games and every single government, wannabe conspiracy, and more do everything in their power to win his games. Hilarity ensues.

So specific questions:

Realistically what US agency would be in charge of handling super powered people in the US if they were very rare and, usually, not particularly dangerous?

What are some realistic consequences if politicians and bureaucrats in government literally lost their ability to lie? Beyond the comedy aspects, which is probably going to be hard to write.

Any funny ideas for contests that people take WAY too seriously? So far I have: Bird Watching, a the floor is lava race across a desert, a massive card game tournament with unusual rules, and a scavenger hunt with simple clues that people over analyze.
