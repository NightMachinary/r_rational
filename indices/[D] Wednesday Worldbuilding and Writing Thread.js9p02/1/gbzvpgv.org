Cantrips are minor spells. In D&D, they are, like all other spells, mostly themed around dungeoncrawling. Imagine you lived in a quasi-modern world, where introductory magic theory was a high school class. Not everyone learns, even most who learn the basics have little true aptitude. But the end result is that maybe 80% of the population can cast a few minor cantrips. With all that cumulative brainpower thrown into the mix, we'd definitely get some cantrips that were actually optimized for daily life, or work.

What cantrip-level spells would you want for your job, or daily life? What might other professions want? What are some non-standard uses for existing cantrips that could be applied to normal circumstances? For example, when I posed this question to my friends, one got hung up on how Mage Hand could revolutionize competitive gaming, just by freeing players from the limitation of their physical number of button-pressing digits. A divination to immediately comprehend dimensions or sizes might be invaluable for many professions, say, carpenters.
