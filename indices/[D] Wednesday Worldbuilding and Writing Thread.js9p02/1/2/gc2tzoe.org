Considering what other things the cantrips do, it'd probably be really easy/cheap to make a combination of a specialized cantrip and a specialized non magical USB I/O device, that is a far higher bandwidth+more intuitive in both direction to all our current I/O devices like screens or keyboards.

Failing that, using Minor Illusion inside a controlled camera setup would still instantly let you move complex images from your visual cortex to software on the computer, letting anyone with the cantrip do in seconds what takes a digital artist or 3d modeler hours. Not only would this revolutionize the arts, it'd also be highly useful for CAD, any scientific use that needs a 2d data array, etc. You might also be able to crate the illusion of hovering text or a written text, which together with text recognition AI lets you input text in a similar way.

Any cantrip that create matter from nothing (like Create Water) OR telekinetic force (like Mage Hand) would utterly revolutionize everything related to space, and shift things violently back to favoring manned spaceflight, because you have infinite Delta-V and probably have to carry a lot less supplies for life support.

Can mending fix broken /software/? Even if it has to have been fully functioning in the past, that still solves enormous swaths of system administration and tech support. It'd also be extremely handy for lost backups, hard drive restoration, etc.

Any spell that cools things break thermodynamics, and has a ton of scientific uses cooling small samples or high tech equipment. It's also really handy when your food is to hot so you don't have to wait for it to cool down. It could also have uses for pushing any tech that needs a cooling system and gets overheated, from gaming PCs to machineguns.

Looking at druidcraft and heal minor wounds, you could probably create some really powerful but extremely small scale agricultural/rapid growth spells, useless for staple crops but extremely valuable for spices, medicine-producing or sample bacteria, rapid testing of genetically engineered organisms, stem cells, etc.

You could probably fairly easily make a "recharge batteries" cantrip from Shocking Grasp and Mend, that's really useful in everyday life (no more having to plug your phone into the wall for hours!) but also in survival situations recharging things like flashlights or water purifiers.

Cantrips can produce small amounts of chemicals, such as acid or noxious gas. It is possible that with modern testing, R&D budgets, and knowledge of chemistry, you could create more powerful substances such as medicines, drugs, much more lethal toxins, neutralizing agents, etc.

Combining the above with the healing and druidcraft bits, and the brain-targeting of Message, and modern knowledge of brain anatomy, you might be able to create an infinitely repeatable and extremely addictive "wirehead" cantrip, that just creates overwhelming pleasure and joy. This one would probably be quite illegal, but also have the biggest incentive to be created and the most popular.

Trustrike could probably be modified slightly to be useful aiming other things than attacks, and a lot of devices and skills involve hitting a narrow target. Also this is combat related but it'd be much more powerful with combat being so dominated by guns.
