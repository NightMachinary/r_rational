  I wonder whether magic's idea of how hard error-checking is differs enough from a compiler's idea to be useful in programming.

If nothing better were possible, a divination to make you notice those hard-to-spot syntax errors would be invaluable. Something like "bring something I would recognize as an error more directly to my attention" seems like the sort of thing Vancian magic can do easily, because of how the writers conceptualize (or, rather, /don't/ conceptualize) magical data processing.
