I have this idea for a story:

*What if anti-procrastination pill was invented?*

Imagine a pill, that if taken daily, removes the need to procrastinate, and prevents akrasia. After taking it, for 24 hours, your actual behavior matches your conscious goals and values, and you are incapable of acting against your rational judgement. You feel motivated to achieve your goals, in order on how important and practical they are. You find it easy to delay gratification, and are not easily distracted from your tasks.

How would society change?

For simplicity sake, lets say the pill is cheap to produce, abundant, and has no major side effects.
