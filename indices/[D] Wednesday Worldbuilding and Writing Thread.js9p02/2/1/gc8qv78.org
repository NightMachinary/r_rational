Think about how many people despise their jobs, and likely procrastinate and dither to survive the days. Any moderately-sized or above business "strongly encouraging" employees to take the pill would see a very large gain in productivity, as would any industrialised country. Sooner or later you'll have politicians crying anyone working "sober" isn't doing enough for their country, a few years later its an informal rule, then a formal rule, then maybe even so widespread some countries just add it to the drinking water as the culture's come to see productivity as a personal goal. If there aren't any major side-effects and businesses have enough political/media influence backing them it seems a possible end.
