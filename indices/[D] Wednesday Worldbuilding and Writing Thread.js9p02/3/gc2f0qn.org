I have a plot bunny idea for a reverse-isekai where a peasant from a fantasy world gets reborn as a normal person in this one. They would have various preconceived notions about levels, experience, buffs/debuffs, dungeons, and so on, as well as the old person in a young body trope. Every time they slip up about their original world, people dismiss it as them just being a bit of a nerd.
