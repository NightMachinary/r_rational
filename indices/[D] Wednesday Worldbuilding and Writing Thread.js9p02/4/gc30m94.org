The world has a karma system. Generally whenever "good" activities are performed karma goes up, and whenever "bad" activities are performed karma goes down. At certain thresholds of karma people get a personalized ability. For example at 100 karma they get one ability, then at 1000, then at 10,000 ect. With the same but in reverse for negative karma. (-100,-1000,-10000, ect) The abilities also generally increase in power with more karma.

With no more specifics than that, what are some general effects this would have on a world? What are some ways people/governments might try to rationally exploit this?
