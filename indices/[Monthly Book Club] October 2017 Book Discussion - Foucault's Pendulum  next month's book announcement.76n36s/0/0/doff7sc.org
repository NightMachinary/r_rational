This murder is pretty interesting: [[http://unsolvedmysteries.wikia.com/wiki/Dorothy_Donovan]]

Basically, a guy (Charles) picks up a hitchhiker, agreeing to take him only a certain distance. When Charles tries to drop the hitchhiker off, the hitchhiker attacks him with a screwdriver demanding his money and truck. Charles manages to drive off unharmed, leaving the stranger behind.

He goes to his house and sees the stranger lurking around, finds a pay phone to call the police, police come with him to the house, sees nothing's been stolen but Charles's mother is dead.

At first Charles was considered the suspect because the hitchhiker story was ridiculous, but Charles was ultimately cleared with evidence of a stranger was found.

The murderer/hitchhiker ultimately confessed after being connected with DNA and said he chose Charles's house because it was the first one he saw with no lights and he was looking for a place to sleep.

So the hitchhiker happening to murder Charles's mother out of all the houses in the local area is quite a shocking coincidence.
