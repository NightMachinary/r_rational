I'm a bit late with this one, but as with the last one, I'd like to opine on the single most impressive aspect of this book. The general concept is kind of neat. Conspiracy theories becoming real offers space for a lot of self-doubt as the characters have to wonder whether they're just getting paranoid for no reason. But it's not why I thought this book was great.

In my opinion, the greatest part of this book (and its single most marketable feature in the circles I move in) is the characters' use of a computer to procedurally generate conspiracy theories /in a book written in the eighties/. That's visionary as heck, and Umberto Eco isn't even a scifi writer!

Similar concepts are explored in /Unsong/ (of course) as well as /Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore/. There's no denying the age difference between those books, though.

Which raises the question: is being visionary a positive attribute of a book by itself? When comparing, for example, Bruce Sterling's /Schismatrix/ with Charles Stross' /Accelerando/, I'm tempted to say no. Sterling was first, and he clearly offered the foundation for what Stross would later write, but to me, /Schismatrix/ pales in comparison to /Accelerando/ partly because the latter work iterates on the ideas of the former and offers a deeper, more complex view of the same themes. Culture marches on (known on TvTropes as "Seinfeld is unfunny").

A work needs to have some amount of popularity to have an impact on culture. Those visionaries who have not only the short-lived popularity to be recognized, but also the staying power to be interesting /after/ others have iterated on their ideas are exceptional in their own way, and that's the category I would put Foucault's Pendulum into.
