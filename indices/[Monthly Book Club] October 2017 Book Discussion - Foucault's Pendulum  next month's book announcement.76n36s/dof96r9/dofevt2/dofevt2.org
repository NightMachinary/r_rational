My favourite conspiracy theory is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis][phantom time hypothesis]], because it's the sort of thing that /could/ be true - it's not Flat Earth level and AFAIK it doesn't talk about (((evil conspiracies))) - and it makes a weird sort of sense from a very, very, very Eurocentric point of view.
