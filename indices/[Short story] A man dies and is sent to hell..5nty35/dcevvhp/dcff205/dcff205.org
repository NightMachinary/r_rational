Never really got why the devil would torture people at all. The original story of the devil that I've worked out(mainly because the the traditional depiction has been edited to hell and back) was that he didn't want to be controlled and rebelled against God. So he decided to become that which he hated most, someone who controls the fates of others? I don't really know enough about the subject to weigh in particularly, but its just something that bothers me.
