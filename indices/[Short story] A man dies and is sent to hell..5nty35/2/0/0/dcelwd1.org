Either A) the man who suggested the idea is the real Satan and they've already switched, OR B) in addition to being clever enough to suggest this new concept, the man also succeeded in tricking the /actual/ Satan into /thinking/ they've already switched. In either case, the person who currently think's they're Satan, decides to give no punishment so that he himself will receive none when/if they switch back.
