Just for the record: I should note that I think this is one of those rare few 'clever' arguments that actually work. Imagine you're the devil - would you really risk inflicting horrendous torture on people when you already /know/ there is such a thing as hell?

I mean, I don't really buy into Pascal's mugging, but in this case the Devil already knows that there is someone with total power to deceive and who is into ironic punishments. So I think a rational devil would just never torture anyone. Heck, rational!hell might actually be a nicer place than heaven, for exactly that reason.
