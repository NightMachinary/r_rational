I think it has to be B.

The first line is "A man dies and is sent to hell." That's a line directly from the author to the reader, not dialogue between the characters, meaning it's to be taken as fact.

Also, if the man was the devil, it would make much more sense for him to do everything /without/ hinting at the possibility that they had switched.
