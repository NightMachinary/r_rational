Clever, but there is just one single problem with this: people are different. What is hell to you may be okay for me. If I was the Devil, then why not just [[https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4lgn2t/wp_the_devil_mixed_up_your_paperwork_and_gave_you/][give the other person a punishment that I think I can stand quite well, but will make that other person suffer?]] There might be a problem with this, as I can't be certain if I am me, or did Devil swap/change my personality...

At this point Devil should probably just hire a few very creative sadists to do his bidding. He won't even have to pay them, just let them choose fitting enough punishments. Much less complicated, gets more severe punishments, and takes a load of work from him. Besides, making others do your work is very /slothful/, right?
