You don't know /who/ will get the punishment, but you /do/ choose the punishment.

Let me try to explain that more clearly: Let's say there are two people- (A)dam and (B)ob. A despises rats, but loves going to circus. B has a pet rat, but also a severe Coulrophobia.

Let's say A thinks he's the Devil. There's about a 50% chance that's true. Let's also say that A has strong work-ethic/any other reason to do his job properly (otherwise he'll always choose no punishment at all).

The punishment A chooses might apply to B, if A's the Devil, or to A, if A is a mind-tricked mortal.

The most rational thing A can do is choose a clown-infested nightmare. If A's a mortal, he'll be able to stand it, and it'll be such a great punishment for B, if B is the one to get it.

My problem with this solution is: we don't know if A's fears are his fears at all. Devil could change or even swap the fears of A and B.

And it all comes down to the problem with the original solution: there's always a big chance of choosing a punishment instead of nothing being bad for you.

Hell, if I was the original!Devil, I'd still make the smart-ass mortal suffer. Why on earth would I mind-trick someone into a situation they will most likely chicken out of?!
