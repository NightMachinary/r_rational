It depends on the magazine. All the major SF/F markets (which is what I submit to) have a website where you can submit your stories and they'll eventually read them and reject/accept. Time varies, Clarkesworld usually gets back to you within a few days, Asimovs and Analog can be a few months sometimes. I imagine places like Reader's Digest have something similar. I know The New Yorker and The Atlantic do.

Google the market you want + submissions. ie: "Clarkesworld Submissions." Or use The Submissions Grinder, they list tons of markets and link directly to their submissions pages.

One word - this has now been "published," due to being posted on a public forum. You can, I suppose, delete it and hope no one notices. That would probably work, TBH, it's not like publishers go googling the text of what's submitted to them. However, if you want to honor a publisher's wishes, you can now only sell it as a "reprint," which pays less (which doesn't really matter with something this short) and which many publishers aren't interested in (which does matter).

Also, since this is flash fiction, I'd recommend trying Daily Science Fiction and Flash Fiction Online, they're the two really well-known SF flash-fic markets.
