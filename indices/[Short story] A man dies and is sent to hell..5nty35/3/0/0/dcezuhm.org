I don't know, really, but from what I Googled it looks like you should look up the publication guidelines for whatever magazine you're considering submitting to, or email them asking for these guidelines, then give them your story edited to meet these guidelines, and then they pay you if they like it. I'm sure they'll walk you through the process if you ask.

Here's the submission form for Reader's Digest: [[http://www.rd.com/submit-joke/]]. No idea if it's optimal or not, but it has a wide readership and the submission process looks very streamlined. I know that what you wrote is more of a story and less of a joke, but it's largely a humorous story and it resembles some of the content I've seen in the magazine before. There's even a punchline.

Your story is 267 words, which means it's already within their 300 word limit. So, hopefully, all you need to do is contact them through the form.

The more you're willing to shop around and look into different publications the more money you'll make. And there are also more prestigious places you could potentially be published. But since this is your first time submitting to a magazine you probably want to keep things somewhat simple. If there's a magazine you really like that publishes fiction, though, by all means contact them first. I just threw out the first relevant suggestion I could think of.
