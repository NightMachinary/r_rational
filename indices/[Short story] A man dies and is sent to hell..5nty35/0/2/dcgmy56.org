Clever, but... I might just not be seeing something, but I feel like there is a flaw in the AI's reasoning: /if/ the Dave through whose POV the story is told is just a simulation, then what this Dave do /doesn't matter/, since only the real one has an ability to let the AI out of the box. So Dave can just say: "Eh, whatever. I am not going to do anything, since it probably wouldn't matter: odds are I'm not the real Dave, so I don't /have/ the abilility to release you, since pushing this fictional button wouldn't free you and therefore save me."
