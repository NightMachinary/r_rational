You could actually just refuse to cooperate. The AI has no reason to /actually/ torture the ems, because it can't prove that it is torturing them. It's a bluff.

After you refuse it's choosing between "follow through on my threat, wasting resources" and "not follow through; do something else." The only reason to follow through would be to establish a reputation as an agent that follows through on sub-game imperfect threats, but that only works if you can show that you /did follow through./
