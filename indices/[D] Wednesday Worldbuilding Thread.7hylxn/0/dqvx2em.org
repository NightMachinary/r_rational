This is not really worldbuilding but kind of is. I'm trying to iron out a plot for a generic urban fantasy "two people find out that vampires are a thing and go to try to save the world". I think I've discussed this on here before.

Here's my story beats:

- There is a very powerful vampire who is slowly relearning that humans are moral subjects due to the power of love

- Meanwhile, two young women find out that vampires are a thing (one is a cop, the other is a mage - yes, she'll work her way up to shooting fireballs) - in doing so, the vampire is aware both that they exist and that the mage has magic powers

- For some reason they decide not to go to the authorities/media????

- They kidnap the vampire's love interest, plot happens, love interest is returned but everyone gets some character development

- There's some more drama during which the cop becomes a thrall of the vampire, making her reluctant to kill him, and at the same time the vampire realises a rival vampire is going to get some big angelic powers thanks to a eugenics cult he's been running the past few hundred years

- The main vampire ultimately decides that the mage is a valuable potential ally, and decides to offer her a truce where he'll use his influence to stop vampires killing humans and she'll use her magic to do stuff to make him the big vampire leader of the country/world. This truce is accepted, and when the masquerade inevitably breaks, the main vampire is a popular and beloved spokesperson of vampires everywhere and peace is achieved. (The Main Vampire won't go back on his promise when he gets power because he's already feeling uncomfortable about the commodification of humans)

The go-to answer is that there's already a big conspiracy where vampires have their tendrils in everything, but that only says that telling the media/police about it is retrospectively a bad idea; the cop/mage needs to think it's a bad idea before they tell anyone rather than just get a big case of the deadsies after telling someone.

Writing all this out I'm wondering if I can make the cop a thrall of the vampire from more or less the very beginning, and have the vampire decide to try to use the cop to get to the mage. He could quite easily consider the risk of the cop/mage hurting him very low. And if the cop is in thrall with the vampire she's going to be very conflicted about killing him; the mage is a much more "submissive" personality and the cop could easily bully her into not going to the media (by saying "they must have infiltrated everything", even if she's not sure if that's true). But is that Rational?

Maybe combine a) and b). Have the mage talk to a reporter, give proof of her powers. Reporter is associated with a vampire, and this leads to the vampire deciding to "manipulate" the mage into making him the king of the world.
