  Going straight to the government / media seems like a "throwing down the key" thing. It's an emotional reaction that drives the plot. But I'm not sure it's something most people would actually do.

That's.... not what I considered. I put myself in that position: I'd contact the government/media/James Randi, but based on the rest of your post I'm probably not considering everything I would /actually/ think if I was at a gay club trying to pick up chicks and ran into a vampire feeding a guy in an alley and then tried to run away from his superpowered ghoul and then my friend MELTED THE FIRE LADDER WITH HER MIND and the ghoul fell several stories and WALKED AWAY.

The one bit I'm struggling on....

  I'd either give up or spend months to years planning my big release.

Option 3 of "team up and fight vampires" is conspicuously absent. Cop would very much /want/ to do this and would probably figure that she's doing something for the greater good, and even if it is all a big conspiracy she can at least make a tiny difference somewhere...

(see below for me writing out some random lines of what the Cop character might be thinking based on what you've wrote - not sure if it helps anyone else but it helps me so....?)

--------------

"Surely someone has already seen this? I mean the guy was SO BLATANT ABOUT IT - I mean if I didn't already suspect vampires were a thing I might think it was a seedy back alley handjob but COME ON"

"oh my god could the police be in on it? I'm the police! I should see what I know. But all the files I used to come to the conclusion that vampires might be a thing were IN THE POLICE FILES. Surely I'm not the first person to have noticed those patterns of attacks."

"at least at the moment they don't know who we are. I wasn't in uniform or anything. Maybe we can just.... maybe there are things people aren't meant to know?"

"was it even real? Mage-friend, did you do that melty thing" - "yes, I did do that, I didn't - magic's not meant to be real, it's just meant to be little things of herbs that make you feel better! I didn't know that I could -"

"could we both be going nuts? I've heard of that. Do you think we should get checked? .... do you think they'd admit us to a mental institution and we'd never get out?" (plot bunny: Cop goes to visit a psychologist who gives her psychological treatment for her delusions... really she'd probably end up seeing a psychiatrist. To do: talk to partner about what he would do as a psychologist with a patient presenting with these "delusions" - I don't think you'd get admitted for simply thinking weird thoughts)

"okay if this is all real and we go to the media we need really good evidence and we need like witness protection because if it doesn't come out yet it means that they're not letting it... "
