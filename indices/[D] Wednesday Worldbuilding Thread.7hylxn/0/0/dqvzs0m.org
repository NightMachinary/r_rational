  Writing all this out I'm wondering if I can make the cop a thrall of the vampire from more or less the very beginning, and have the vampire decide to try to use the cop to get to the mage.
#+end_quote

That could definitely work, regardless of whose point of view it is from (if the story is from the cop's point of view then we get lots of internal conflict, if from the mage's then a feeling of betrayal, and if both then um both).

  But is that Rational?
#+end_quote

I think so, if you let the cop character make some good arguments (and especially a more pleasant alternative plan). Preferably, this scene would be from the mage's point of view so that we can see her thought process here, potentially see any errors that she's making, and understand that it's all reasonable from her point of view. Bonus points if she explicitly flags some part of the argument as overly convenient but rationalizes after the fact; rat!fic has room for people making errors and not being perfect gods of pure reason. R!animorphs has plenty of that but I haven't heard anyone say that it isn't rational (in fact, if we held a poll for "most rational fics" it'd probably be in the top tier).

(One possible argument: Yes, let's talk to reporters, but let's get as much information as we can, both to prove our case and to know what to do after. It's very easy to justify "not doing anything just yet.")

I also like the idea of combining a) and b). Is it possible for her to run into some other kind of (smaller) trouble as well, to further convince her that talking to reporters is not a good idea?
