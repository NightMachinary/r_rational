From a story perspective: if you don't want to put a bunch of detail into how the conspiracy works, I'd just do what Neverwhere does, and assert some big magical reason as part of your premise.

In Neverwhere, exposure to magic means people forget you. I don't remember a deep reason. It's just a thing that you accept as part of the set-up.

--------------

Going straight to the government / media seems like a "throwing down the key" thing. It's an emotional reaction that drives the plot. But I'm not sure it's something most people would actually do.

I see something apparently supernatural. Immediate reaction is that either: magic is real, I'm going nuts, or I'm a victim of an expensive practical joke. I'd spend a few hours on Youtube and WebMD. Have other people posted videos of supernatural stuff? Are there drugs that would slow my perceptions so someone seems super-fast?

Suppose there's no evidence anywhere. I get a clean bill of health.

My next thought is that other people must have seen vampires. Other people must have told the internet, the media and the government. So, why isn't the information public?

On possibility is that the government knows and keeps the whole thing classified. Alternately, there's a conspiracy so powerful that it can scrub vampire information from the CIA, FBI and NSA. Both option are intimidating enough that I'm not going to a local reporter.

Unless I can think of a plausible reason why I'm the first person to try and expose vampires, I'd either give up or spend months to years planning my big release.

And, part of my planning my big release would be arranging resources & an 'escape plan' for when I end up in the public eye. Being either Snowden or Assange sounds terrible. It would be even more terrible if I didn't have money, layers, a PR agent, and place to escape to once I was thrust into the public eye.
