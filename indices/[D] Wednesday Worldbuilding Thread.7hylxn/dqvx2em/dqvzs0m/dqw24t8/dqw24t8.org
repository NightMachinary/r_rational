  Is it possible for her to run into some other kind of (smaller) trouble as well, to further convince her that talking to reporters is not a good idea?
#+end_quote

What sort of smaller trouble did you have in mind? Like, she sets up an appointment with a reporter and there's a dead cat in her letterbox with a note that says "STAY AWAY FROM THE MEDIA"? Or like, she's walking alone one night and a mist condenses into human form and the pallid corpse tries to kill her and she only manages to get out of it from sheer dumb luck? Or every time she speaks to a reporter they seem to "mysteriously change their mind" about running with the story within a day?

Or along the lines of the Mage runs into (say) a person who was robbed by a... satyr, and she tells the Victim to talk to the media about the whole satyr situation, and then the Victim ends up dead from being "kicked to death by some sort of animal"??????

  let the cop character make some good arguments (and especially a more pleasant alternative plan)
#+end_quote

Good point - as long as the cop makes a convincing argument, then if the mage believes it, we're all good. The cop finds some evidence by looking through old police files - perhaps she noticed they were misfiled somehow to suggest a police conspiracy? (THere probably is a little at least, because a vampire would be stupid if they didn't have a human in the police and a human in the media: would make perfect sense for a vampire to have someone in Records who could mislabel the files somehow... now I'm pondering how patient the records team in my building would be with answering questions about how they'd hypothetically misfile stuff so people couldn't find evidence of vampires)
