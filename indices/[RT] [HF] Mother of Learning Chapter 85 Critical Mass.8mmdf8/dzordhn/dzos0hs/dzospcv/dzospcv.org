  And I think Zorian could as well if he prepared enough.

He's had a few restarts to get into its brain, and he knows it well enough to seriously consider starting experimenting with his own mental wonkery in that direction. He could probably just order it to bite itself to death.

  creating anchor upon soul is innovative. Doable?
#+end_quote

Maybe, but it isn't physical which would make it harder than 'just' anchoring a soul to a phylactory or a pocket dimension to.. anything. Perhaps it'll be an 'imprint' that stores Zorian's soul in a dormant state for later retrieval instead, similar to Sudomir's trap. Or spits him out whole with soul. Or it could be a gate anchor on Zach's soul that doesn't need synchronization to cast, because of the time difference inherent in one of them being in the Gate. Or some sort of quasi-soul bond that doesn't actually bond them, only allows one of them to teleport to the other at will from anywhere. Zach escapes, Zorian tags along. Or makes them into a 'two souled being' - one slots into the others mind/body, but somehow keeps Zach's soul there to regulate the life force when Zorian is in charge until they can escape. Or they might just be trying to become a regular possessor entity. Entirely too many possibilities, all of them a bit crazy. Or, hell, if the gods built the machine, it's known in setting that gods duplicated people on occasion, souls included. Maybe it's a possibility to let it run down and it'll just eject copies of the 'controller' since the loop can't end while it is inside. A failsafe.

If they go the escape route instead of actually merging, I'm looking forward to an 'aftermath' story where we get to see Kirielle's reaction, his mother and Ilsa responding to two Zorians. And maybe Taiven responding to one with a supernatural affinity for how her mind works. And the Aranae. And - well, you get the idea. ZZ could help the Aranae start their desired equivalent of a noble house by refining their magic and psychic 'vassal techniques'. They'd even have a ready-made ally in house Aope, as long as it didn't subsume the effort entirely.
