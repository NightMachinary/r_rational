Re the ruler, this is what is mentioned: 1) his headdress 2) his ornate jewelry and 3) the staff.

Pack it up boys, we know where the staff is. They deserve at least one (relatively - it took them stealing the Pear of A and then 20 days or whatever of airship travel) easy artifact grab. And it would be nice if the staff had the ability to command the other artifacts (although thematically that's more a crown thing, but one can hope on behalf of ZnZ)
