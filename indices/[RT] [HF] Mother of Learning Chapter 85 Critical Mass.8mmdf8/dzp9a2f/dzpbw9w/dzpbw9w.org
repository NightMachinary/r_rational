The king's staff being the artifact may explain why he's king if lizardmen run on toughest guys in charge rules. Also I'm pretty sure all of those people are capable of perma casting mind shield which is all they would need. Plus most of those people aren't under threat by the rats. Daimen's team is on Koth, the aranea are masters at mental combat, and Alanics people are probably various members of the church. Taiven and the teachers are the only ones under threat, and I think that once the teachers realize this is real they're gonna play things safe. Finally Taiven is the one who tells Zorian to use mind shield to protect himself in the first place.
