  Zorian turned his attention to the approaching king. He was surprisingly short compared to the warriors scattered around his palace, though the massive gem-encrusted headdress and glittering golden jewelry hanging off of him immediately marked him as the ruler regardless. /In one of his hands he carried a black staff with a large, glowing, amber stone affixed on top./

Does anyone else suspect that this the last imperial artifact?

Also, including all those people in the loop could go wrong horribly. Now QI or the cranium rats only need to explore one mind (they are certainly less protected than those of ZZ) and they'll easily catch onto the entire thing and could ambush them anywhere with soul magic and they'd be finished...
