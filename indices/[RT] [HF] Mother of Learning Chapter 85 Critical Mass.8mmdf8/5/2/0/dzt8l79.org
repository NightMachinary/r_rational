pretty sure there's multiple local kings and this is just one of them who so happens to know where the gate is. My guess is one of the lizard kings actually have it since others might be fond of having the similiar set-up of the one that they happened to meet though it would be weird how the one with the staff hasn't subjugated the other local kings. Maybe stuck in a crypt? Either way I doubt its on the one they just met since it would've been mentioned as they would be dumb not to check with their marker on the first meeting just in case.
