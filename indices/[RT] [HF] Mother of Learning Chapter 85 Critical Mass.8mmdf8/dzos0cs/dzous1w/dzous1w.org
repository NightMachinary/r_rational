It's a little scary how much things will accelerate. The temp markers let them accelerate their own development by leveraging everyone elses. A few more restarts and they can probably bypass the wards on the treasury entirely, so they can teleport in and take the dagger.

They can use that to mostly guarantee four of the artefacts. Zorian got into QI's memories, so he probably knows where he starts the loop. If they knife-soulkill the pyramid wasps/Sulruthm, QI and the hydra/chameleon drakes that leaves them able to pick them up at will. That gives them four artefacts on demand, and they need only find the staff.
