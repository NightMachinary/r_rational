There are three times I can think of when they greatly changed the invasion schedule. The first time was with the help of the Cyorian aranea matriarch and the memory packet she transferred every restarts, while RR was still inside the loop. The invasion still occurred, but it was just so ineffectual that it didn't succeed at causing any great damage, to the point that it was practically cancelled while RR succeeded at convincing Quatach to follow him to attack a specific academy student who apparently was responsible. This scenario won't be able to be replicated, since the next time RR gets involved by giving all the passwords and his predictions, they will also have access to demons (greatly increasing the amount of damage they can create), and Zorian no longer has the matriarch's memory packet, which gave her specific knowledge of when and how to approach whom, and who was connected to the invasion, etc. They spent numerous restarts with a whole colony of mind readers digging through the head of all important people in the region without regards for their own lives, to get that information. And it's gone.

The second time they affected it was before Zorian teamed up with Zach, when he launched an attack against Iasku Manor along with Alanic and regiments from both the Army and the Church. They succeeded, they defeated Sudomir, the dragon and the manor's defenses. They were able to get information on the invasion because Zorian had no regard to propriety or Sudomir's well-being, and did something that Eldemar's own mind mages would not necessarily be willing to do, which was to dig deep enough inside Sudomir's mind to notice that soul magic spell he'd cast on himself to force himself not to say anything about the invasion, and make him forget it. Without Zorian's direct involvement in this, this would be unlikely to happen, and the invasion would go as planned, minus a convenient forward base and midway teleportation point for the Ibasans. And even if Zorian did get involved in Sudomir's interrogation, the only result was for the military to investigate constantly deeper, until the Ibasans felt threatened enough to have to choose either to start the invasion right away, or to abort everything. They did the invasion, and the primordial was successfully summoned. In the real world, they would have the support of demons on top of this, not to mention RR's support with his knowledge of all the passwords, so this method is also not a good way to go about it.

And the third time I can think where Z&Z affected the invasion, and the one I believe you're referring to, is when they launched an attack on the Ibasan base under Cyoria during Quatach's temporary absence, around 2 and a half to 3 weeks into the restart, to eventually leave with the teleportation artifact. The reason the Ibasans cancelled the invasion was probably because they judged that it couldn't succeed. They couldn't summon demons, they didn't have all the passwords to circumvent wards, they lost their best method to transfer a large number of people, and either a powerful group or the Eldemar government itself was perfectly aware of their presence, to the point that they knew when Quatach left and were ready to immediately launch an assault. The reason I think that trying to replicate this would not be as easy in the real world is because: 1) they would have the passwords, which would bolster their confidence in the attack; 2) they would have demons, increasing their morale further and greatly increasing the amount of resistance the base can put out, possibly slowing down Z&Z's team so much that Quatach has time to come back; 3) it would be past the midway point into the restart, and at this point, it's likely that RR could have neutralized a lot of important people, not to mention whoever else the Ibasans will be targeting during that time when they won't be confused as to why their summoning attempts aren't working properly.

In the real world, the first and foremost priority will be to neutralize Red Robe before he has time to make important connections with the invasion forces and before he notices that other time travelers have left the time loop. However, he has already shown himself to be careful when it matters, so this last thing will most likely be the first thing he does. Like before, he will probably begin his restart with heading to wherever he can find one of these robes, and then immediately invading the Noveda mansion to see Zach's state. If Zach is even awake by then, he most likely won't be ready to completely neutralize RR, and this will probably end in a stalemate, where both sides are perfectly aware of the other. And where Red Robe will probably assume that other time travelers have also successfully left the loop, if Zach succeeded at doing it. So he will be fully on guard, and what he does then, and how this will impact his advice to the Ibasans, we have no way of knowing. So in the end, Zach and Zorian have to be ready to face anything whatsoever, including Quatach. Why wouldn't RR just convince the lich to immediately try to dispatch Zach, after all?

Therefore, kicking Quatach out of the loop wouldn't just represent a huge loss of potential knowledge and instructions from a great teacher. It would also make them lose extremely valuable battle experience, experience which they will most likely greatly need, in a simulation that ensures that Quatach will have not the slightest bit of knowledge of what has previously been attempted while fighting him by two (or more) completely unknown opponents.

So in my opinion, it's just not worth it. Except maybe on the very last or before last restart, where they might do it just to ensure that nothing goes wrong in their attempt to exit the loop, and when they just won't have enough time left to learn more.
