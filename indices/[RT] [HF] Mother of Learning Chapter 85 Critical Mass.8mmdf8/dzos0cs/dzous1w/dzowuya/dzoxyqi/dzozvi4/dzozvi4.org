Soulkilling Quatach would have a huge impact on the restarts. So much so that any new knowledge about the invasion would be utterly worthless once they're out of it. They would have no experience fighting the lich, it's possible that any high-ranking members of the Cult of the Dragon Below they targeted would react completely differently without the lich's support, and any large-scale attempts at ending the invasion in some way or other wouldn't be guaranteed to have any success outside the loop.

Granted, it would be a great advantage to start the loop with the Crown, but they would also lose a lot in return, not the least of which is the incredible potential of trading items for Quatach's knowledge. It would seem to me like a bad idea overall, even if they did happen to somehow have obtained knowledge of where Quatach begins the restarts.

On an unrelated note, I look forward to seeing what methods Z&Z will implement to try to reduce the impact of the Ibasans being able to summon demons during the actual invasion in the real world.
