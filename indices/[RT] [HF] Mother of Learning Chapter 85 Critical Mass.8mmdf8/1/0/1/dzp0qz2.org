Zorian in particular is about to get much much more overpowered, using the dagger artifact he can study the hydra while it's docile and become mentally unified with his simulacrums, then he can use mental enhancements to accelerate his thinking speed. If you stack this with some improved time dilation chambers stored in pocket dimensions, you get a n_simulacrums * mental_speedup_factor * time_dilation_factor total improvement over normal learning speed. I think he could get 100 years of work done in the next 19 restarts.
