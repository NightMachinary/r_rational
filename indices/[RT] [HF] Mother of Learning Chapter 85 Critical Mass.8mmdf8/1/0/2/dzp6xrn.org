i think a few restarts will be wasted before the acceleration gets intense. ZZ need to continue to use QI as a resource (which they must to get the crown, and possibly dagger, at all if they didn't get QI's starting location from the mind attack). QI definitely looks into ZZ after they try to contact him and get tutoring from him. those that are included with temp markers will be sieves of information to the cranium rats as they certainly do not have the mind magic capabilities to prevent it. Also, mundane means of the marked people accidentally giving away information is an issue too.

the aranea, of course, could be included without issue, but the list of humans is much shorter. i suppose some of the temp markers may be able to cast Mind Blank (for a whole month, no less, which may reduce the number that can be continually marked) but that comes with its own problems, as its been said that using Mind Blank for too long causes up to insanity.

the non-aranea that seem fit within the specifications would be: xvim, who might be able to contest the cranium rats without mind blank and can probably weather holding it for as long as he needs, damien, his wife and his team, as they're too far away to be a liability at the start and can just cast mind blank on themselves while in the city, any of alanic (and those he vouched for)/lukav/ilsa/nora/kyron, who could randomly have the ability and silverlake, who is also far away at the start and whose abilities are still a bit of an unknown.

i suppose the question is how many restarts will be wasted. this next one could end with more soul damage after attempting to contact QI and his subsequent background check which could waste 5+ more
