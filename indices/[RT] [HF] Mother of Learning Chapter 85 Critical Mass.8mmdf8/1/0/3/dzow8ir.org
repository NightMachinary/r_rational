Holy shit I never even thought about the dagger, but they can't soulkill QI because they don't know were he is at the start of the restarts, so they wouldn't be able to get the crown. They also want to use the hydra so no soulkilling it either, and lets be honest they're gonna have a kaiju fight between the hydra and sand worm atleast once.
