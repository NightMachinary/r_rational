Zorian got into some of QI's memories this restart. We don't know exactly what he got, but I'm guessing he might of prioritized QI's starting location. Even if he doesn't do that, and they just keep killing the hydra instead of turning it on the others - that's two guaranteed artefacts. But QI seems a bit too dangerous to leave 'alive' if they can access the crown at the beginning of the restart safely.
