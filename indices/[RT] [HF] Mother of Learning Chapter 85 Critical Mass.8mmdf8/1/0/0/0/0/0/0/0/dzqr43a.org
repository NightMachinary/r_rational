  And the third time I can think where Z&Z affected the invasion, and the one I believe you're referring to,

That would be the one, yes. The only one where it was out and out cancelled rather than anemic.

  So in my opinion, it's just not worth it.

At some point QI's going to go "Wait, /I/ taught you these skills." and they'll have the same problem as they had with Alanic. The one they tried to head off with Silverlake. He also remains one of the few things that can actively threaten them, but I will admit that depends on him not feeling like he can walk all over them enough that he'll use soul magic in combat. Or if he doesn't soul-suicide-bomb in a fit of desperation should they somehow end up on the high-end of his threat scale, or if he somehow finds out about the loop from the newly inducted loopers and his rat swarms). Yes, he can teach them a lot, but the risks are very high as of chapter 85.

(Pure speculation: Or he might get curious about why Zorian wants to get his sticky fingers into the stabilization frame around his soul for 'study' because if anybody is going to be mad enough to ask him about it, then try and duplicate that, it's Zorian. I will admit to being disappointed they didn't ask for his disintegrator ray spell (or offer to trade Alanic's golden fire spell for it).)

I appreciate the write-up, I'd forgotten about the demonic problem - perhaps Alanic may be one of those unspecified higher ranks that can call on the aid of Angels. Or put in a 'good word' for them with the church on the topic of maybe having a few very faithful priests nearby to assist on the day - I don't think we know enough about spiritual being capabilities yet on either side except to point it out as 'bad'. That's probably the main hole in my reasoning otherwise.

Ultimately I think this is more of a pure value judgement in risk management on our parts rather than something we could sit down and has out 50 pages of bullshit over and come out with a mathematically perfect solution. One we probably won't come to an agreement on. You see him as worth the risk to keep practicing on and learning from indefinitely/17 restarts, while I don't, and that's from having opposite views on most points and possible contingencies.
