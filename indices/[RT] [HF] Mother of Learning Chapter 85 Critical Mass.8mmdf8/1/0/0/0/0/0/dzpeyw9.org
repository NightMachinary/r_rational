Sure. But they've managed to cancel the invasion at least once with their actions, so they might not need practice fighting him. If they /do/ end up deciding to fight him outside then soulkilling him would be mad. Otherwise they're just removing an enormous threat.

It is a trade off, but I just can't see QI as anything but their biggest threat and one that they might not be able to overcome safely so close to the restart limit. Zach has already mentioned soloing other liches; he managed to kill Old Oganj pre-ZZ era. QI? It took an over-engineered battlefield and what seems like one of the world's pre-eminent telepaths smacking around his brain. And even that wasn't permanent. But YMMV, since if they cancel it this time, while the military will be on guard they won't know when the next will come.
