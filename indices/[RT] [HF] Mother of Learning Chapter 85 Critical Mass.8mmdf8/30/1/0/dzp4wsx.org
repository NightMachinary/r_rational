That was my thought, too. If QI can do 8 simulacra, for instance, then instead of having 24 hours a day (no need for sleep I would suppose), he'd have 192 hours a day, 2 of which would only constitute a bit more than 1% of his time. QI is a master soul mage, so 8 or more wouldn't be surprising at all.
