QI never gave off a sense of fairness given the fact that his entire being he built to be as powerful as possible. He only wants to make sure a far away superpower wins the next war. He believes the best way to do it is by weakening the 2 closest superpowers to his country. For him the best option after the failed invasion would be to wait until the start of the next war, show ZZ that they didn't stop anything by stopping the invasion, and if I were him try to recruit ZZ to help them weaken Eldemar in exchange for not targeting their friend, families, and allies. It just seems to be the most beneficial thing for him to do if the invasion fails.
