Well if you think about it QI doesn't seem the type to do that. Ultimately he doesn't want to destroy Cyoria, he wants to play kingmaker in the next Splinter Wars. Even if the invasion fails he could just wait for when Eldemar dedicates most of it's troops than attack the capital. The only reason he's even there is because of the Cult of the Dragon Below giving him extra muscle.

He doesn't seem the type to get angry over something ultimately pointless, plus he would recognize people as strong as Zach and Zorian would be too costly to assassinate thus being to much trouble for their worth.

And all of this is assuming he even finds out about ZZ. Remember that when the Cyoria Web and Aope family stopped the invasion, Zorian was actively going out and killing cranium rats, and QI never paid him any mind when he attacked the dance hall. My guess is he probably only thought Zorian was a prodigy that the aranea contracted for help. (aka some cheap mercenary)
