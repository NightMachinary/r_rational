Well they don't need to be strong enough to win, just strong enough to stop the invasion. Hell chapter 25 Zorian straight up stopped the invasion from happening in the first place with the Cyoria Web. If Zorian can prove that he's friendly with the real Cyoria Web, introduce them to Tinami, and gather information about people high up in the invasion, then they could stop it from happening. At that point they would just have to fight Red Robe.
