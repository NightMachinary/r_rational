  If Alanic was teaching self defense, would he have helped Zorian by only ever attacking him with abilities he knew wouldn't be lethal even if Zorian didn't block them, when real opponents wouldn't do so?

He would have /told/ Zorian he could heal him from burns, that way Zorian might not have shot him in the head in retaliation. It's also a /basic rule of sparring/ that both sides are aware of what is and is not allowed. This is ridiculously irresponsible.
