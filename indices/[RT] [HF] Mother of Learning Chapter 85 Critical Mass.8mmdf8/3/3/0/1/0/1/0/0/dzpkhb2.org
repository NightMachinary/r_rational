That's the thing, Alanic wasn't teaching self-defense there. It was purely a test to see how long it would take Zorian to respond with lethal force when presented with apparently lethal force in an enemy. (Besides Alanic's divine artifact to heal burns, he also is able to control his flames such that they don't burn something.) For the purpose of Alanic's test, that last bit didn't even matter, it was more to assuage Zorian after the fact.

The main thing was that he didn't know that Zorian's method of attack (mental blasts that knocked the assailants unconscious) from that fight was purely practical and not overly merciful/naive.
