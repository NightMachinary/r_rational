If Alanic was teaching self defense, would he have helped Zorian by only ever attacking him with abilities he knew wouldn't be lethal even if Zorian didn't block them, when real opponents wouldn't do so? Wouldn't this set Zorian up for failure the moment he faced an opponent that was truly trying to kill him, and Zorian didn't have the correct reflexes due to always relying on his instructor using weak spells that wouldnt have harmed him anyways?
