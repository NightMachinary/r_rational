True true, but only soul mages will be able to tell if Zorian made any soul enchantments, the same for mind mages and mind enchantment, and that's only if they were good enough to tell (eg natural or extremely skilled mind mages). Finally he could just claim the blood enchantments are from his witch ancestry. I know he had issues (moral or practical) with experimenting with these magics, but now he can finally get the superpowers we always wanted him to.
