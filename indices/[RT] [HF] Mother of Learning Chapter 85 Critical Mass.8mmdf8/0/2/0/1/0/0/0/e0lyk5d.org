Cool. It would be really interesting to see how Zorian and Zach grow once they get out of the time loop. I know on some level they are growing mentally, even if they are not aging, but physical aging does impact cognitive development - most men's brains don't finish developing until the age of 25. I will be watching to see if his thinking starts to change as he gets older.
