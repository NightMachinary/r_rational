Everyone keeps talking about the artifacts I like to point out the other big thing that happened this chapter. Zorian is finally throwing himself into learning mental enchantments, soul magic, and blood magic. Zorian truly the most evil resume, but now he can gain even better mind powers. Plus didn't Tinami want a way to become psychic. The Tinami ship is still here.
