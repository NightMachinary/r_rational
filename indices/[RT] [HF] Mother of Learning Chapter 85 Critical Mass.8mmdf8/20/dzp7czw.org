Some of the loose ends got tied up. We know that crown has fixed capacity (not a multiplier) for sure now. I would bet that divine blessing is not a multiplier as well (it would more than double Zorians mana, but it wouldn't reach the amount Zach possesses)

Now I'm curious if they can make gate large enough for a ship to fly through. The size was never specified and depending on that there might be some easier/harder options for Blantyrre exploration. Looking how the local lizard king they've met had held a staff as regalia - looks like the divine staff ended up owned by some local king (and one of the strongest/largest kingdoms most likely).

I think Zorians plan is to created dimension anchored on soul bond he and Zach will make and he will hide his soul or himself in that pocket dimension to fool the controller.

I think Damien will be the first one to ask for soul mark. And I'm not sure what is the plan (what the involved parties will do after markers will be close to expiring). This is going to be a huge mess.
