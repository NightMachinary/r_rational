The lich being Zorian's ideal teacher made me laugh.

Then I realized this might be more of Xvim's mentor plots: by teaching his students in such an absolutely horrible manner, he makes them accustomed to terrible teachers, to the point where they are willing to accept teaching from literally anyone. Giant spiders. Manipulative witches. Terrifying liches. Zorian just keeps going for more because he's totally used to Xvim.
