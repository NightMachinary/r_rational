So something rather important to note that we got confirmation of today, Red Robe used the dagger to wipe out all the spiders, which means he's capable of breaking into the royal vault. Perhaps stealthily/legally which would indicate he's someone pretty high up, or at least connected. (since neither Zach or Zorian noticed a breaking news about the vault being broken into he would have had to do it stealthily, but there might not even be news in the first place since the govt would want to keep that quiet)

Also I'm not sure if I'm recalling this correctly but RR was worried that there were multiple people running around with the marker. Which tells me he probably originally got the crown from the Lich and then got Zach to put a temp marker on RR.

Also i seem to recall that the temp marker only lasts 6 months thats worth noting.

From there RR either compelled Zach to keep reapplying the marker (which would indicate he can reliably get the crown from the Lich) or he figured out a way to sabotage the marker in such a way that it would be a permanent marker.

For this to work though RR would have had to be an extremely competent soul mage before the time loop started. (likely came to know about Zach because Zach came to him for soul magic training) Presumably RR developed his unshaped mind magic skills because he needed to fool Zach's marker so it's unlikely he had unshaped mind magic skills before the time loop.

So RR is

- Capable of learning enough unshaped mind magic within 6 months to fool a divine tool
- An extremely competent soul mage before the time loop
- Capable of getting his hands on the royal dagger within a single month, perhaps with help
- Capable of getting the crown from the lich
- Not important enough that his disappearance would cause a big disturbance in the country, unless there are extenuating circumstances
- Capable of breaking/avoiding the connection with the divine tool that tracks everyone in the royal vault
- Enhancements such that he can withstand getting shot without too much trouble, probably acquired in the time loop

Am I missing/wrong about anything? Best fit I can think of is that he's a corrupt priest of some form.
