So, each artifact has two functions. One that is the actual divine function of the artifact, and a time loop related function that you only have to physically have it one time (though the globe does not work like this for some reason).

The only reason to now have them all physically together is to unlock the sovereign gate to leave.

The knife unlocked their ability to “cast” soulkill. Now that they have presented it to the entity they do not need the knife anymore to use soulkill. Now the knife's actual divine artifact ability is to be able to physically effect the spiritual and cut it.

They ring unlocked their ability to cast a tracking spell on anyone. The divine artifact property of the ring provides the ability to have a soul sense.

The crown unlocked their ability to cast the temporary soul marker ability on people. The divine artifact of the crown is the mana battery that they discuss.

The globe has the divine ability of being a memory storage device. It does not ‘unlock' any ability like the other artifacts but the information they store in the globe stays throughout their time in the sovereign gate. The divine artifact ability of the globe is the pocket dimension itself.

Now as for what the staff does or unlocks I haven't the foggiest idea. I would be interested in what everyone thinks about that.

EDIT: I was wrong. After looking into it more it looks like they DO need to have physical control of the artifact to use is sovereign ability.
