In chapter 55 the Guardian states that the controller can access the abilities of the keys, but doesn't state that they necessarily need the keys to use them. Each marker ability they have used (manual restart, track keys, and how many resets they have left) they activated through switches in the marker. They just haven't experimented with the switches. Plus in Soulkill there was no mention of Red Robe using the dagger when all the other keys required them to be on hand to be ysed.
