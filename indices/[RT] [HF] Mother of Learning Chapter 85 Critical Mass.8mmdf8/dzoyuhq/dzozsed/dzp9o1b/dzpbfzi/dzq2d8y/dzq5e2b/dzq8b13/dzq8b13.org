it's still a leap in logic to assume that you can use the Artifacts' Loop abilities strictly with the switches in their marker. there's no evidence suggesting such. on the other hand, I presented /two/ of the artifacts requiring (or at least heavily implied) to require the artifacts on hand. Red Robe doesn't need to wave the dagger to use the abilities either so we can just as easily assume he had it on his person when he used the purple beams.

another point to consider, if they can use these abilities without the presence of said artifacts, why even tie these abilities to said artifacts when they have plenty of other abilities (like the ones you listed) already on the marker
