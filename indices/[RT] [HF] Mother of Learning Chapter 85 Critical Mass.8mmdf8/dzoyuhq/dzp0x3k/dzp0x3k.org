Err, he could just be Veyers like the story implies. If he's got ties to cultists and then QI can do nearly all of the work and all issues evaporate.

- Instead of getting the crown from QI, he just asks.
- We know QI can break in to steal the dagger (or Veyers just groundhog attacked the Royal Family until he found a way for them to give him the dagger).
- QI knows how to break the dagger tracking.\\
- He can have QI experiment on his soul to match Zach's marker.
- QI is the extremely competent soul mage he has access to before the loop.
- Veyers /does/ go missing after RR disappears.
- QI gives/teaches him enhancements.

The mundane scenario is that Zach is spending a loop hanging out with Veyers and realizes he can talk to QI on friendly terms for once, via Veyers' contacts. QI lets Zach use the crown under extremely controlled conditions to set a temporary marker on Veyers (after who knows how many ground-hog attempts). Then sometime within the next 6 resets, QI copies Zach's marker onto the (presumably loyal) Veyers. Zach thinks they'll go and be reset-buddies (like Z+Z are now), while QI thinks Veyers will come and help him escape the Sovereign Gate. They both get double crossed. Veyers has QI carefully fuck up everything he can with Zach's mind triggering a reset, then Veyers reneges on his deal with QI and instead of helping him uses him as a tutor over countless resets. Sometimes he lets QI know, which is how he gets perfect plans to steal the dagger.
