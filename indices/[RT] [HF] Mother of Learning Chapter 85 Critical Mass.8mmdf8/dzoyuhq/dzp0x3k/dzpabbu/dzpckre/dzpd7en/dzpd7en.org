  then he eventually gets an audience with QI to convince him

And why would he want /that/? Convincing Veyers, I get. Well, maybe, given that Veyers is an unstable cunt. Convincing QI? For what gain? Most importantly, in this scenario I find it highly improbable that anyone but QI walks out alive. The instant QI learns about the loop he becomes extremely dangerous (as seen just not so long ago).

Probabilistically there is a better consequence of the "Zach has been trying to convince everyone" MO. Zach tries to convince (let's say) the mayor of Cyoria about the upcoming invasion. The mayor is a red robe (a high-ranking cultist, one of ~10). We know that high-level cultists have infiltrated the government (i.e. Sudomir is the mayor of KD). Once Zach tells about the invasion to one of the cultists, he is fucked. Then a red robe becomes The Red Robe.

Is it possible that Veyers is a high-level cultist? I'd say no. His behavior before the loop is not corroborating this. The cult doesn't need him (teenager, super shitty mage, no soul/mind magic lineage)
