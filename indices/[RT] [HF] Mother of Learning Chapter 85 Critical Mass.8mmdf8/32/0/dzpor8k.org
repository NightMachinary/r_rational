The loop annihilates every one each month, you know. It has some flimsy reasoning about souls not diverging too much, but it's an /extremely/ poor excuse.

Giving out temp markers doesn't place a moral obligation on ZnZ, if anything they have decreased the number of souls annihilated by a loop a bit. It's not a total victory, but placing temp marker is a morally good thing.
