it's the same questions that Zorian has to answer. are they going to push out/kill the originals to save these copies? will they make a new body for them? and if so, how will they live in society where they don't actually have an identity? it's far worse with increasing number of people. you can't expect to kill 100 originals for 100 copies nor can you integrate 100 copies into a society (or force them to live elsewhere separate from their original lives?)

I'm referring to the /copies/ that each new loop creates. say there are 100m people on the planet. if they exit the loop with 5 loops to spare, they "saved" 500m lives. if they exit the loop with 0 loops to spare, there goes 500m lives
