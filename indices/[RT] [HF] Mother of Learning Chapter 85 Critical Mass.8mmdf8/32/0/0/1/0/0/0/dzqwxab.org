To save a life implies that you are preventing someone from dying. But once the loop ends people don't die - they just lose a few months of memories. And because each loop is the same, the number of loops doesn't matter.

By not saving the marked, on the other hand, you're taking years of memories away from them accumulated throughout the restarts.
