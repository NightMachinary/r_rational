Saying their entire existance is destroyed is only technically true. Realistically, you just miss out on a couple months spent in the loop.

You're making a distinction between copies (soul in loop and soul outside) when they are virtually identical. There is technically a difference but it does not matter. For example, let's say you write up an essay, then re-write it word-for-word 100 times. Technically they are all different essays with slightly different typos in each but they are all basically the same thing.

It is different for marked people because they remember their loops. Like I said before, if the marked people are not saved they lose years worth of memories, as opposed to just a few months.
