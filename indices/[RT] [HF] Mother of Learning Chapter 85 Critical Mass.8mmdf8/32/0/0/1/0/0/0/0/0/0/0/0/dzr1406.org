the loops lasts one month each. even says so in the synopsis, nvm tons of reminders throughout the story =P how'd you forget

/shrug/ very different philosophy. even the Guardian doesn't wholly agree. accepts killing a month divergence but doesn't disagree to swapping non-diverged (after hesitation) but would still refuse to do so (implying it does think there's an intrinsic difference but has to hand-wave it away to justify the system's existence morally). nevermind that this is on a whole other scale (life)

what's the difference between a 1 month diverged copy with an original and a laptop that's been used for one hour and a fresh one of the same model?

or, back-tracking back to the very first comment I replied to,

#+begin_quote
  They can't save the normal people whose soul resets each loop
#+end_quote

you, yourself, imply they are savable and you said

#+begin_quote
  To save a life implies that you are preventing someone from dying.
#+end_quote

so, unless I'm totally wrong in what I think you meant by save in that first comment, your comment implies there is a difference, morally
