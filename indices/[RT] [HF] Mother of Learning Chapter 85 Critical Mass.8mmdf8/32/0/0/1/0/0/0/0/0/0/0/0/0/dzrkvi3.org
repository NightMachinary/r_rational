  the loops lasts one month each. even says so in the synopsis, nvm tons of reminders throughout the story =P how'd you forget

I read fast, so my reading comprehension suffers at times :/ Thanks for the catch.

  /shrug/ very different philosophy. even the Guardian doesn't wholly agree. accepts killing a month divergence but doesn't disagree to swapping non-diverged (after hesitation) but would still refuse to do so (implying it does think there's an intrinsic difference but has to hand-wave it away to justify the system's existence morally). nevermind that this is on a whole other scale (life)

I think we both agree that the marked are different then their non-loop counterparts. Hence why they should try to save them.

The normal people are technically different too, but you can't save all of them so it's not worth debating over.
