#+begin_quote
  not really. that argument falls down the pit reaaaaal fast. for one, even if they got out of the loop, how will the extras survive? or the original, depending?
#+end_quote

If they figure out a way to get themselves out of the loop it might be able to be extended to to others. Or maybe not, but it's worth looking into.

#+begin_quote
  there's also the fact that they can "save" many, many lives by exiting the Gate ASAP because doing so will mean less copies are made and destroyed, no?
#+end_quote

The vast majority of people's lives are virtually identical throughout the restarts. Exiting earlier or exiting later; no difference. And you could argue that exiting later would be better because it would give ZnZ more prep time for the real battle.

#+begin_quote
  then there's also the argument that if they can mark and then can save them, why not "everyone"
#+end_quote

In a ideal world they /would/ save everyone. But that is simply not feasible. And saving just the marked may not be feasible either, but it's worth a shot.
