it is going to be different. While they know that they are being killed/recreated each restart, the experience of six cumulative restarts disappearing/just getting some memories / notes instead is going to have much larger psychological burden. There may be some workarounds like crafting memory packets and transferring them (or asking Zorian for a stuff like he did for Damien/Fortov).

I do think it is going to complicate things instead of making it more simple.
