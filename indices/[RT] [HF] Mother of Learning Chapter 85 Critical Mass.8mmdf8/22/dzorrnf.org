Typo thread? Well, I'm not really typo spotter kind of guy. But this is unwieldy

  Kirma's divination flower thingy and the spell formula crafters she referred him to +after he had spoken with her+ were especially useful +to him in this regard+.

I think this chapter has more unwieldy sentences. Will add more later.

Decision upon marking a whole lot of people sounds more impactful, is this the rationale of putting the chapter in non-chronological manner? I think I paused about 5 seconds before I realized this.

There's no mention of Alanic, Xvim, and Silverlake when the duo fought the lich. Were they so capable in combat magic now?
