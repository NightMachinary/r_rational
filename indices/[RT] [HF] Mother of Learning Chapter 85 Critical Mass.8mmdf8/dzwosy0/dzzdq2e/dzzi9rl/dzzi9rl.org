Maybe. Recreating is going to be a copy-construction either way, so it probably takes the same amount of energy with any (non-null) input. And destroying seems like something that wouldn't take energy--no need to wipe things clean if you're going to overwrite every part of it, after all. And in any case, from Zorian's description about anchoring dimensions to bags, it sounds like pocket dimensions might be unstable configurations anyway, and energy could even be harvested from their destruction.

I was sort of figuring a situation where the end of loop just plucks out all marked individuals, destroys the old pocket universe, creates a new one, and moves the old souls into the new one. It is weird that transferring the souls would be a non-negligible operation in all that, but nevertheless I have a vague inkilng that something like that was mentioned.
