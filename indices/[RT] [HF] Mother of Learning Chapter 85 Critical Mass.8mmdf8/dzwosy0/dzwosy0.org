Wait, I thought that having more people in the time loop was one contributing reason to why they had a much shorter total in-loop time than the Ikosian Emperors used to have. In that case, bringing in a bunch of additional loopers would mean a large reduction in their remaining time, wouldn't it? Or maybe I'm just not remembering that right.
