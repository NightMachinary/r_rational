I am with you on the rituals; even if he was busy, he could at least have practiced on himself in any restart where he didn't expect a fight. But on mind magic, I think you are understating the danger.

We know the main character won't go mad or cripple himself, but he doesn't. And this is akin to doing a lobotomy on yourself because you know you can /probably/ fix it when it goes wrong, then repeat it a hundred times until you get the desired result, and so on. Even if you fob it off to a simulacrum, he'll go through the same thought process and will probably feel that "because it would be nice being smarter" is a weak argument in hindsight.

He could force them to do it, but then they'll resent him and that's another can of worms.
