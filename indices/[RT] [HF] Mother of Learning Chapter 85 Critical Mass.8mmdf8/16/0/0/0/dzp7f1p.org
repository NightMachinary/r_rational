iirc, zorian went the aranea immediately after waking up and suicided after his confrontation with RR so he would not have heard about an uproar about a break in.

i'm leaning towards some sort of prince or high up priest/adviser of the royal family that humored zach and finagled himself into the loop because of the speed at which RR got the dagger to start soul killing.
