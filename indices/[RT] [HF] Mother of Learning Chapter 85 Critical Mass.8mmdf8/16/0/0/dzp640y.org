Break in is unlikely, since there was no huge uproar about it. Instead

- the dagger is fairly useless (as we know now) and is a matter of royal family prestige, rather then national security, same as Sovereign Gate

- just like Gate, getting it is probably a matter of jumping some bureaucratic hoops and pulling some favors up above

- freaking head of Cyorian Mage's Guild is a cultist and maybe one of red robe mages

As such, RR "just asks" for it after getting in on the invasion. It's just not QI he asks.
