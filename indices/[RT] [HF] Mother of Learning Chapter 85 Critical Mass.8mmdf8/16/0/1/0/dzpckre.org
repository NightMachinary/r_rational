Zach has been trying to convince everyone of the time loop for as long as he can remember. If he successfully convinces Veyers, then he eventually gets an audience with QI to convince him. Considering that Zach thought he was invincible back then, he might have just told QI and tried to talk him into a peaceful resolution. Worst case scenario he just resets, right?

The reasoning for Zach using the crown is that he's literally the only one that can use it. Zach wants to use it because he is aware (pre-memory-wipe) that he interacts with those artifacts uniquely and this would be his first chance to try it out, and QI wants to see it's true power used. It's not like Zach can steal it or destroy it.

Veyers gets picked as the target because he'd be the only 'neutral' person in the room.
