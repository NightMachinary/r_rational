#+begin_quote
  Capable of getting his hands on the royal dagger within a single month, perhaps with help

  Enhancements such that he can withstand getting shot without too much trouble, probably acquired in the time loop
#+end_quote

These two, yes. We have evidence.

#+begin_quote
  An extremely competent soul mage before the time loop
#+end_quote

Probably, yes. The marker is soul magic, so some soulfuckery was required.

#+begin_quote
  Capable of breaking/avoiding the connection with the divine tool that tracks everyone in the royal vault
#+end_quote

No, not necessary. You mention the obvious scenario: RR is fully authorized to use the dagger, so he doesn't need to break the connection, so it's either the heist or the legal way, but your list is not structured to reflect this OR.

#+begin_quote
  Not important enough that his disappearance would cause a big disturbance in the country, unless there are extenuating circumstances
#+end_quote

Or important enough that his disappearance is swept under the rug. Another possibility is that you are reading the loop mechanics completely wrong, and he doesn't "disappear". He is replaced with his pre-loop copy.

#+begin_quote
  Capable of learning enough unshaped mind magic within 6 months to fool a divine tool

  Capable of getting the crown from the lich
#+end_quote

No. You're making a commitment to tempmarker->permarker theory without pretty much any evidence, or even against some evidence.

Red Robe is a shitty mind mage, getting mind blasted by a barely trained Open (Zorian).

Red Robe being worried about multiple passenger loopers only indicates his method of inclusion was reproducible. Nothing more about the specifics. But it's a possibility, sure.

I think this points to the head of the Cult, as RR. High-level cultists are also high up in the Eldemarian power structure and on good terms with the lich.
