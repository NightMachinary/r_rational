  I think this points to the head of the Cult, as RR. High-level cultists are also high up in the Eldemarian power structure and on good terms with the lich.

This seems likely from the evidence you listed, but the conversation between RR and QI in Ch 26 makes this feel unlikely. He calls him "little whelp" and talks about just getting rid of him because he's becoming more of a hinderance than a help.

"little whelp" /could/ be something a thousand year old lich says about a grown (and probably rather old) man, but it's still weak evidence in favor of RR being rather young.

As for the "more trouble than he's worth" and "i'll kill him later" comments, that's probably not something you'd say about the person who's in charge of a huge portion of the invasion plan.
