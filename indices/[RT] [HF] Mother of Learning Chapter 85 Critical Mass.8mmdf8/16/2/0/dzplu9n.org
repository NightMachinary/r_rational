Actually, there's no indication that RR had the dagger when he was attacking Zorian at the beginning of that restart. He soul killed the vast majority (maybe even the entirety) the web on the night of the invasion. All that Zorian encounters after that are males, and they're still around several restarts later in chapter 41. And if there were any female aranea survivors, RR could have just killed them after Zorian died in that restart where they confronted each other.
