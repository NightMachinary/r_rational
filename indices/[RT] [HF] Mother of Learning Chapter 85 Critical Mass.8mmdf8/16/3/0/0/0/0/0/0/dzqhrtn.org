The Guardian says that to get a marker for the gate you need to be given one by the maker, his agents, or with the artifacts. Someone who entered using the artifacts wouldn't have been told how to use their marker, so it would make sense for them to still have a way to use the powers.

As for the 2 artifacts you mentioned it's simply that they didn't need to know how to use their markers for those powers. They conclude that it's useless because the divinations they know is already better than what they get from the ring. As for the orb, getting it is so trivial we basically just assume they have it now.
