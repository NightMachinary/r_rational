to even use the Artifacts' loop abilities, you /must/ use the marker. so there's still absolutely no reason for the abilities to be tied to the Artifacts under the assumption you didn't need them on hand to use them. Z&Z had to talk to their markers to interact with the orb. they're effectively the same as an unaware that got brought in via Key. if the intent was for such a person to be able to use it, then Z&Z should've been able to do that as well. except this is not the case since it was /not/ at all obvious to them, which defeats the entire point. also, it /doesn't/ make sense to still allow a person that got in via Key to be able to use because that allows almost anyone to get in and abuse, including people the Maker and its Agents did not intend to bring in or want to bring in

"Or at least that's the effect they would have had if Zach and Zorian had started the restart with the ring. Since they hadn't, the value of the tracking markers was greatly reduced."

this sentence is /before/ mention of them being too good for the ring. so as I said before, this implies very heavily they need the Ring on hand

"Aside from soul magic, the two of them also worked on their basic shaping skills and tinkered rather heavily with alchemy, since this was the one magical discipline that hadn't been affected by their injuries in the slightest.

They didn't try to inform anyone of the time loop during this time. Most of the notebooks and other gathered information had been stored in the palace orb, which they couldn't actually access at the moment."

they /cannot/ retrieve the Orb when this line was mentioned. they're still incapacitated. meaning they cannot access the notebooks without the Orb. they're also relaxing and recovering so there's no reason to go on a journey to collect the orb, even if capable

and again, you still need to provide evidence in favor of them being able to use the abilities without the Artifacts on hand. there has been none, considering the orb was always on their person, and they only just got the Dagger and Crown, and the Ring's tracking not being shown in use, and the Staff still at large
