I think this is the best chapter in quite a while. I've felt that the story was dragging a bit lately, with lots of time devoted to "and then we trained and got better at things" (which I do enjoy but it was getting a bit old), but this is a great payoff for all that work. Learning high level pocket dimension creation, mental enhancements, using the coin trick thing, getting the crown and dagger simultaneously, almost having the staff, fighting and beating QI with previously established mechanics, possibly getting a pet Hydra, characters persisting across restarts, etc. Things are really ramping up, and I love it.
