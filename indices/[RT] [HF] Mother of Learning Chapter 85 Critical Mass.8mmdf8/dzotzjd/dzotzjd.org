Hmm, now that they mention having to worry about Quatach coming back for revenge, I wonder how they plan to deal with him outside the loop? Yes, they can banish him, but once he's up and running, he'll be sure to think of counters. Plus, since the month won't reset anymore, they'll basically have to look over their shoulder for the rest of their lives.
