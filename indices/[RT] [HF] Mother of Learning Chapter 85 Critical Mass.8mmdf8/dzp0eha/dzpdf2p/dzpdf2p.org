I ðŸ’¯ agree. Zorian was distracted, so QI had the time to cast soul magic. QI knew soul magic affected them due to the scars on their souls. The beam that hits Zorian didn't hit Zach which would trigger a reset. The beam that hit Zorian was mentioned distinctly from the disintegration beams. QI has excellent aim with his disintegration beams so it makes sense that if his aim was a little off it's a different attack. It was QIs last attack before he abandoned his body and those have been soul attacks in the past.

Narratively, it kicks QIs threat level up a notch since he would be able to permanently kill Zorian and maybe Zach. Additionally it's such a esoteric attack that it might be unique to QI and he will be much more interested in ZZ next time the meet.

Zorian is going to be very sad when he wakes up and his arm doesn't work.
