I've said it before but the simulcrums are insanely powerful at leveraging the time he has to work with. Making 9 of them means in those 2 years he can get essentially 20 years worth of work done. If his mental enhancements say, doubles his thinking effectiveness, that's 40 years of certain types of work. It's not useful for pursuing most types of goals, but imagine golems, spell formula, potions, wards and divinations 40 years ahead of the curve. That's monstrous.
