A version 0.1 of such a battery could be a simulacrum stuck inside a pocket dimension with enough mana crystals to oversaturate the dimension with mana, and constantly meditating to absorb it in the most efficient manner. Though that is only going to boost his mana regeneration somewhat (I think a figure of 30% was mentioned at some point in the book, minus however much it takes to keep the simulacrum functioning), so it's not quite the same as the capacitor QI has.
