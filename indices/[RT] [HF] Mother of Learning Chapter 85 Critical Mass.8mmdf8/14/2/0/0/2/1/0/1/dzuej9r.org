  Uh, Zorian's simulacrums don't help him recover mana faster. Quite the opposite, they slow his recover down. Looking at the earlier comment, I'm guessing your relying on the idea of simulacrums speeding up ambient mana assimilation, but this doesn't work. A person's ability to assimilate ambient mana is limited to what their soul can process, no matter how many simulacrums they have. A single simulacrums focusing on mana assimilation is enough to max Zorian's recovery rate.
