Simulacrums share a soul with the original, so yes they can absorb mana, just as they can cast magic (unlike actual soul-less entities like golems). However it is still one single shared soul, so there is a limit to how much ambient mana it can handle (so no maxing regen by having all the copies absorb mana).
