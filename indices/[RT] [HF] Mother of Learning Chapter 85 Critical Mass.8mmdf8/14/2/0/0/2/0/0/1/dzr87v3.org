That's not really necessarily the case. Maybe the mana drain from simulacra increases faster than linearly(because your soul gets more and more stretched across different bodies, or some such), making it too costly to make additional simulacra even if those just sit meditating in cyoria.

Alternatively, mana absorbed by the soul is the maximum of mana absorbed by any particular simulacra, meaning that if you have two bodies trying to absorb 1 mana per second, soul absorbs 1 mana per second, but if you have one absorbing 1 and one absorbing 1.3, you get 1.3 mana per second.
