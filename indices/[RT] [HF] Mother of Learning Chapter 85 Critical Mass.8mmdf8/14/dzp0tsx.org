Would it be possible for Zorian to reverse engineer the Crown?

In Chapter 85 we saw Zach and Zorian obtain the crown.

As we have previously learned, one of the crown's abilities is to be a "mana battery" of sorts.

All of the divine artifacts have had abilities that non-soulmarked people can use. To my knowledge, the abilities these other objects have can be reproduced with magic.

The Orb contains a pocket dimension, Zach and Zorian are learning how to make their own pocket dimensions.

The Ring has the ability of soul-sight, which Zorian has already acquired and we know it is possible for a magic user to obtain this on their own.

So, from this we know that the abilities of other pieces of the key can be reproduced, do you think it would be possible for Zorian to create a "mana battery" of his own?
