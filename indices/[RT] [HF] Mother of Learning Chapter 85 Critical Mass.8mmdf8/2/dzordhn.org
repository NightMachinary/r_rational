Ooh. I wonder what his escape plan is? Make himself a nice pocket dimension inside Zach's soul maybe and pop out that way? Or just tunnel out as a soul. The first one will need some doing to avoid setting off the marker.

I like seeing how blase they are about things. How the ability to control a god touched hydra is merely a bit of a giggle. And that they've come so far they can stand against QI as long as they're ridiculously prepared. Given how he was at the start of MoL, it's a great illustrator of just how horrifying the old bugger is. And it's great to see a part explanation for the Cranium Rats - bothering me for a while.

And approaching QI was ballsy. Since he developed teaching in addition to his other skills, maybe that is an endgame for Zorian if he doesn't merge with his old self. Run off to Ulquaan Ibasa to learn from the terrifying murder wizard.
