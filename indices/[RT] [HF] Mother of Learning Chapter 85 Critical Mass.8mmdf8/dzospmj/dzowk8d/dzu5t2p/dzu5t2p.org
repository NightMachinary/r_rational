Whenever Zorian thinks about the Cyoria aranean he tends to mention how he misses Novelty specifically... I am not trying to say there's anything there for sure, but Zorian is kinda petty and the Matriarch has betrayed him before, then there's the whole thing with Taiven. I wouldn't be surprised if his bad experiences with uhhh older women (basically most of them, but specially silverlake) made him develop a preference for younger, inexperienced and kinda naive girls.

Just joking and grasping at straws here, but I wouldn't mind if he ended up with an Aranean, hopefully it's not a variant that eats the male after mating lol.
