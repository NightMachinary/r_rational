I'm curious how powerful Zorian will be if he can utilize the crown's mana battery ability to its fullest. His main problem throughout the entire story has been his low level of mana. He developed his skill with magic to the extent that he is extremely efficient in his mana use with all/most of his spells, even to be point of improving on the simulacrum spell by adding golem bodies to make it more mana efficient.

This makes me wonder how he would compare to a fight against Zach, if Zorian had similar high levels of mana. To my knowledge Zach hasn't bothered trying to be efficent with his mana because he has always had a monstrous amount of it. It makes me think that if Zorian had the same amount of mana as Zach, he might be able to do twice as much with it.
