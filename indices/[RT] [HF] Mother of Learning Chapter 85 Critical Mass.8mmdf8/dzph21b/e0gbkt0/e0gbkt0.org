durr, just noticed this was pretty much already answered in the text:

" he provided them with the names and locations of two secretive mages that also knew a thing or two about pocket dimension magic -- information that was almost as priceless as Quatach-Ichl's own lessons, as far as Zach and Zorian were concerned"

so they have other people to go to

(at least for dimensional magic, we'll see about soul magic)
