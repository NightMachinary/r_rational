Honestly my only problen with this fantastic story is that zorian has only been doing this for around 6 years. If 6 years of hard work is all it takes to become an archmage, why aren't there more archmages? Admittedly it's 6 years with nigh unlimited resources, and the ability to take stupid risks over and over, but from the first problem I'd expect any rich kid to be super strong.
