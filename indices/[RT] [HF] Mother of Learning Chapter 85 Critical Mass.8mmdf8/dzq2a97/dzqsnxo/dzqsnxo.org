Not really missed, but it's worth noting that each loop ZZ spend a lot of time interacting with all these people, getting the Bakora gates online and their Koth initiative online and all the other stuff. This not only improves how much those groups can help out, but it also saves them so much time on those fronts, which in turn allows them to be more productive during each loop.
