With all of the people that Z&Z may have recruited for 6 loops, there is a lot now that can be delegated.

With Alanic's group, we can see a better assault on Sudomir & progress on stopping the kidnappings of shifter children.

With Xvim & the teachers, we can see a better response on aiding the city with the upsurge in monster attacks & planning on countering the invasion.

With Daimen's group, we can see the orb being hunted without Z&Z's aid hunting the orb is much quicker. Also, we may finally have progress on Daimen's magic gathering initiative in Koth.

With the various aranea, we can see a deeper analysis into Bakora Gates (perhaps by destroying one) as well as discovering more Bakora Gates (such as on Blantyrre).

Zorian may find more opportunities to learn from these sources as they understand his situation better. The Filigree Sages in particular may be willing to help Zorian finally complete his learning of aranea spell formula "webcraft".

All of these groups will definitely have a an effect on the status quo. I expect that the invasion will be completely exposed. Quatach-Ichl will definitely have Z&Z on his radar & may even kidnap one of the new "time travelers". I expect any further tutoring from Quatach-Ichl will be difficult to achieve.

Edit: Did I miss anything?
