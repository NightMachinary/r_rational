Man it's really funny to me that Quatach-Ichl is the best teacher they've ever had.

Aw, sweet, we finally get to see Blantyre. Sad that the part that we saw was so short though. I wanted to read more about the king and angry priest.

And we got the crown! The mana pool and the temp markers! This is a game changer, especially if Zorian can get any of them to learn enough mind magic to put their memories in the orb. Then he can just remove the memories after the temporary marker runs out and put them back in his poor friends brains.

Also, that arm. Brutal.
