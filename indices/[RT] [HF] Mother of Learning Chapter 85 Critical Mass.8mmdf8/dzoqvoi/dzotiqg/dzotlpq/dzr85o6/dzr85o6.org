  Did I mention that was supposed to be a normal spar?

Says who? I quote from chapter 33, "Being dragged into the courtyard for a 'test of his combat skills' sounded suspiciously like punishment to his ears."

Nothing about that sentence says that it has to be a normal spar. Alanic later stated, "The point was seeing how long it would take before you started resorting to lethal moves." It was specifically in response to Zorian mind-blasting the soldiers who ambushed him; for him it was a cheap, invisible, ranged takedown, but Alanic misinterpreted it as a soft approach.

Zorian referred to the test as a spar, but Alanic didn't.
