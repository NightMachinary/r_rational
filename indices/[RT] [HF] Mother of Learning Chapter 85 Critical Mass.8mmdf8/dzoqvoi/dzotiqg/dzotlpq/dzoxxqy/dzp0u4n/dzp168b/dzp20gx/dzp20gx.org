Except Zorian /already knew that lesson/. He explicitly already knew that lesson and told Alanic that he did. Even if he didn't know that lesson, /you don't bring in lethal force when the other side isn't prepared for it when sparring/. It's like having a martial-arts self defense class and then kneecapping someone. It's ridiculous and would get anyone fired for trying it.

Fortunately Zorian's immortal and Alanic doesn't have a boss.
