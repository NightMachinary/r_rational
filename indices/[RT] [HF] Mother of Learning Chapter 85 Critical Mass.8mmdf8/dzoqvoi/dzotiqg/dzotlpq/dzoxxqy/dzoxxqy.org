Alanic knew that he could control his fires, so I don't think it was a concern for him.

Also, I really think that if they had payed QI to teach them anything related to combat, Alanic would look like a kitten made of cotton candy in comparison. QI is honorable, but honorable from centuries ago. He has no problem with torturing captured foes, or civilians, and his "I can barely keep up with this course schedule" approach is unlikely to be unique to dimensionalism. I don't think QI would have bothered with attacks that he knew he could stop if Zorian wasn't able to block them.
