Yeah, which is enough to push me in the Tesen Zveri as RR direction a little bit, since he had influence with the crown.

Sneaking in to the treasury get the dagger seems near impossible, and breaking in to get it draws a whole lot of attention that didn't seem to happen during the soulkill chapter. Of the named characters, he's the closest to the crown and has some of the requisite magic skills for RR. Still not my favorite choice for RR, because at this point he feels like he would be ... "boring" maybe?

The other poster's comment about using mind magic to get a royal to give them the dagger opens up more possibilities, but we've got no idea how well defended they are.
