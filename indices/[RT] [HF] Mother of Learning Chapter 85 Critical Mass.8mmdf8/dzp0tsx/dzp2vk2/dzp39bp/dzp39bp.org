But, doesn't Zorian excel in Spell Formula? If anyone in the story would be able to create a personal mana battery, I think it would be him and it would make up for his low mana.

If it is possible for him to somehow merge the mana battery theory with pocket dimensional creation (which is a huge stretch, I know) then he could create an impressive mana battery.

I know that it is unlikely that he will create one but, I would like to think it's possible for Zorian, with a lot of effort.
