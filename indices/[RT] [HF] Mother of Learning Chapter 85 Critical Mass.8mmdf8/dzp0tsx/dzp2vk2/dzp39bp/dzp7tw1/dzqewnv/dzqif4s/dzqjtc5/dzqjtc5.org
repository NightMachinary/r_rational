From chapter 62:

#+begin_quote
  The copy was fully autonomous, could think and act on its own judgement, and even cast its own spells. However, it had no soul and no mana reserves of its own. Instead, both of these were shared with the caster who made it. That meant that aside from the initial cost of creation for the simulacrum, as well as the running cost of maintaining its existence, the caster also had to pay for every single spell the simulacrum decided to cast.
#+end_quote

If simulacrums could passively absorb mana, there would be no real limit to how many Zorian could have. He could just stick dozens in Cyoria, and have them passively convert the ambient mana into personal mana (A la Naruto).

If it was at all possible for them to do that, he'd already be doing it. For big fights when he needs mana, or even for tasks they don't need to use mana for, like research.
