Incredibly unlikely. Didn't they say that no divine artifacts have been reverse-engineered when talking about the dagger? The knife is something Zorian has been destructively experimenting with for a long time now, and he still didn't have any clue what it was even supposed to do until the aranea told him.

I severely doubt that Zorian would be able to make more progress on the crown, especially when he benefits immensely from having it on his person intact.
