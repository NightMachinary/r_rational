it's highly unlikely. QI did /not/ have that much luxury to cast a slow attack like a soul attack while being assaulted heavily by mind magic. disintegration beam attacks have been described as simply "jagged red beams" (CH60, Ch24, etc) (or Ch4 when Zach had to dodge a red ray). a millenium old lich with proficiency in a multitude of magics to the highest degree is going to have bad aim, especially with soul magic when he's a necromancer?

souls are also not suffused and directly inhabiting different parts of the body. and Zorian would /know/ and feel that it was a soul attack

and QI has no reason to be using a slow Soul attack vs a quicker normal attack in this loop. just because Z&Z have soul scars doesn't make it a better option. who /doesn't/ soul magic work on? and normal magic would work just as well with the information he has this time
