Confession time: I am a shipping piece of trash. In act 1 (I don't remember the chapter) the Matriarch tells Zorian that aranean tend to leave memory packets in their mates. In my mind this was an out of nowhere fact, so to rationalize it I though the Matriarch was coming onto Zorian. Yes I thought the giant spider was trying to get with a human... and I thought it was sort of cute how this was like a sort of confession. I didn't think they were gonna die.
