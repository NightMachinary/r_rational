I can see it.

“Machine Learning” = ML

“Mother of Learning” = ML

The time loop is an analogy for how AI can use machine learning to become disgustingly proficient in a skill or set of skills. Computers are capable of running hundreds and thousands of simulations in the time it takes for us to do one iteration of that event. This operates much like the story's time loop as an extreme time dilation field.

AI can easily gain the experience equivalent to thousands of human hours through this method. Example: [[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=92tn67YDXg0]]

In a way, machine learning is the mother of learning.
