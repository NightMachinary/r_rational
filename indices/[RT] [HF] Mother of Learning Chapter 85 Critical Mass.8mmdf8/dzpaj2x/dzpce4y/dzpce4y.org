Silverlake got caught because she specifically went after information on QI and was skilled. If some nobody went looking than they're a non-threat, plus they now know everything about QI that Silverlake discovered the first time around so they would need to anymore. Finally I think it's safe to say that the people they brought in would realize the situation and fall in line with the people who invited them. (Those people being a fairly high ranking warrior priest, their co-worker who is a known archmage, and their boss/husband who is a famous prodigy mage) (The aranea don't operate in Cyoria and Silverlake didn't bring anyone)
