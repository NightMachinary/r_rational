i'll throw some bch your way if you accept that. But the btc fees are outrageous and not worth using for small transactions like this ([[https://bitcoinfees.info/]])

you don't theoretically need a separate address to accept them both, but if you don't know how to access that it'd make sense just to set up a separate bch wallet.
