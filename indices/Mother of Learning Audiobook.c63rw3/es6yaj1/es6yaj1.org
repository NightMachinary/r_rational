I havent used patreon before. Is per creation a monthly thing or every time you put out a chapter?

As someone that wants to get into voice acting/narrating, how do you modulate your voice for different characters/accents? Especially for the opposite gender. Ive been thinking of getting singing lessons to help but am unsure if that would be applicable.
