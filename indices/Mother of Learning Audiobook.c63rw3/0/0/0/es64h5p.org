My best friend is dyslexic and is a big fan of audiobooks, last weekend he listened to all your chapters, cursed me for getting him into an incomplete audiobook, and started reading it. I am a service mechanic and have been listening through your chapters as I drive the last day or two. Long story short, thanks for the great audiobook. You do great voices.
