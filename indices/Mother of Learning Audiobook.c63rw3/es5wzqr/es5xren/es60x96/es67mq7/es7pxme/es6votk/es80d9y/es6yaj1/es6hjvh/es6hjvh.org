When you do Xvim in the future, please don't have him be the not understandable Asian teacher stereotype. Every other character has been okay so far, but Xvim (though I'd think Zach would have more of a city accent; and the female characters aren't done as well as the male characters).

My favorite voice acting was Quatach Ichl. Now that was cool and immersive.
