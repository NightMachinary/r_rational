I think I must have been misunderstanding what quantum immortality was saying for a long time. I thought that it was essentially saying "some version of you will always survive". That's all well and good.

What I don't understand is this argument that you will always subjectively survive; I must clearly be missing something, because it seems obviously false to me. I mean ... we fall asleep every night, so we know what the subjective experience of slipping away from consciousness is like, and we know that we /can/ lose consciousness. Why wouldn't that be the same for death regardless of MWI or not? If you're going to argue that we never subjectively fall asleep, then I don't think it seems to matter whether MWI is true or not for the purposes of that argument.
