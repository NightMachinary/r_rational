  I mean ... we fall asleep every night, so we know what the subjective experience of slipping away from consciousness is like, and we know that we can lose consciousness.

Well, maybe not...

Say there is something called Quantum Insomnia in addition to Quantum Immortality. We are all oblivious to it because we are copies made this morning, but tonight we each get to (in our own separate extremely rare universe branch) experience eternal sleeplessness in addition to immortality.

Hopefully the pain of sleep deprivation doesn't last forever. I suppose at some point it becomes probable enough that they develop a comprehensive cure for sleepiness to outweigh the chance of remaining awake naturally.
