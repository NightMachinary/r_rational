I believed in this interpretation of sleep at first (it was intuitive to me as a child) but deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind sleep lead me to believe that sleep is not a /cessation/ of consciousness, just a /dulling/ of it. The only dreams you remember are the last ones before you wake up - and I think this hints at the idea that consciousness persists through sleep, but we don't perceive it as similar to "ordinary" consciousness because memory formation is impaired.
