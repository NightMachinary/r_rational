  I mean ... we fall asleep every night, so we know what the subjective experience of slipping away from consciousness is like, and we know that we can lose consciousness.

Pet peeve / nitpick / possibly not getting the point, but the fact that sleep and passing out are subjectively distinct leaves me perplexed by the common equating of sleep and death. If I suddenly lost consciousness where I'm currently sitting, I probably wouldn't even know it had happened when everything started up again. (For that matter, it's entirely possible I've lost consciousness in a more benign form than the few incidents I know about--those usually happened around people and there was only one where I had to figure it out for myself because the other person didn't notice.)

On the other hand, sleep is obvious. It doesn't seem like unconsciousness, IME, so much as reduced consciousness. I suppose the question is, is death more like falling asleep until consciousness eventually ends, or is it more like fainting and not coming back? I suspect this depends on the nature of the death.
