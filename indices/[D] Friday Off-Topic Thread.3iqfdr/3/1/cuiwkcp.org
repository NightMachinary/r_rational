It may help to insert a short time delay between when the 6 is rolled and when the apparatus kills you, such as 10 seconds; and then to consider two separate questions:

- What is the probability that, 5 seconds after the roll, you will be able to look back 5 seconds in your memory and find that a "6" was rolled?
- What is the probability that, 60 seconds after the roll, you will be able to look back 60 seconds in your memory and find that a "6" was rolled?
