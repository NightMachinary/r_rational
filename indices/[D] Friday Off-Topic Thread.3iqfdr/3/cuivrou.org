(I nearly forgot that this board does off-topic threads and was planning on posting this as a regular topic. What lucky timing!)

So. Quantum immortality. It's the idea that, provided that death is the end of existence and the many worlds interpretation holds true, you will always subjectively experience survival, no matter how improbable it becomes. Let's say that the assumptions behind quantum immortality are valid, for this thought experiment.

You are placed in an apparatus that, when activated, rolls a six-sided dice, shows you the result, and kills you if it comes up six; there is some tiny chance of mechanical failure that could prevent it from functioning properly. What probability tree accurately conveys what you should subjectively expect to experience? I have two different models for this scenario:

1) All possibilities that end in your death are preemptively eliminated. You should expect to see a six a tiny percentage of the time, in which case the machine will fail.

2) Probability proceeds exactly as expected from your perspective, except that in the moment when you would otherwise die, something like a mechanical failure will stop it. You should expect a one-in-six chance of seeing a six, and if you see a six, you should expect the normal tiny odds of mechanical failure, but /something/ is always going to happen to save you in the actual moment of death - probably something crazy and improbable like the machine spontaneously vanishing because the right matter in it ceases to exist all at once, or aliens passing by, or everything suddenly turns out to be a bad dream, or something like that.

The first model seems a lot more elegant to me, but feels deeply unsettling - it indicates that I'm essentially alive by the anthropic principle. The second model, on the other hand, feels more out of line with everyday experience and more in line with the idea of an afterlife, which tells me that it's probably a misunderstanding of quantum immortality. IDK how much of this makes sense; just hoping it's thought-provoking to someone. Is quantum immortality a rationally valid idea? It sounds provable to me, though only by an individual being and not by a civilization.
