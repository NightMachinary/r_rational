  Of course, it helps that I've only read a few Naruto fanfictions, and thus am still enjoying the limited supply of "best of the best" that the community has produced.

  While I'm talking about reading Naruto for the sake of fanfictions; is it worth watching the filler episodes? Will it improve my fanfic comprehension?

Generally, it's not very often that filler-based material is integral to the story of a fanfiction, and quite rare that material from any of the /Naruto/ movies is used--though the first movie, /Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow/, seems relatively popular, with its high-tech locomotives and chakra armor, and there seems to be a post-timeskip movie that involves time travel to Minato's lifetime and back, though I haven't seen it. Still, I found several filler arcs and episodes to be enjoyable on their own merits, myself.

The Bikouchuu Beetle arc (episodes 148-151) in particular is pretty much a must-watch--in the final episode of that arc, Hinata's original technique is presented, and it's one of the few filler-based items to more or less migrate into semi-canon status, having been featured in many of the video games and even in the spin-off /Rock Lee/ series, though never in the manga itself. Even /Time Braid/ made reference to it. The Kurosuki arc (episodes 152-157) is also somewhat important, as its main villain (along with his weapon) is the only actual [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant][Canon Immigrant]] of the entire series. Post-timeskip, I'd say the Three-Tails arc (episodes 89-112) is probably the only good one; its main villain is also somewhat popular among fanfiction writers, I think. /Revenge of the Shadow Clones/ (episode 230) is also rather hilarious.
