MacGyver is /sometimes/ rational, depending on the episode. A lot of the environments are "just so" environments which are set up with all the pieces necessary to solve a problem in a contrived way. Sometimes the inventions wouldn't actually work. But the show does have a basic respect for science and engineering that I think is admirable.

Like Sherlock Holmes, I think it's a character that naturally lends itself to rationality in some sense; the base is already there. But is it actually rational? Not really. There are too many plot holes, implausibilities, and outright fabrications in service of plot.
