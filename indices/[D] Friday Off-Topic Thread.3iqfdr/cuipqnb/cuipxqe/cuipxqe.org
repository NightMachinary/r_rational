It's likely that none of the parts that make you up - your cells, organs, tissues, and whatnot - have goals in common with your overall self. As nearly meaningless as the phrase might be, it's the sort of situation that the term "emergent behaviour" tries to describe. Trying to work out the goals of an overall corporation based on the goals of its individual members seems to be almost exactly the same sort of thing.
