I've been reading a self-help/psychotherapy book which talks about [[http://nlpdocs.com/Richard%20Bandler%20Reframing.pdf][reframing]]. It occurs to me that framing is a big part of applied rationality, as depending on how a situation is described it will trigger different biases, subgoals, adaptations, etc.
