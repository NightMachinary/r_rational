  Facts don't need to be peer reviewed.

I believe that facts do need to be peer reviewed. If I say "X and Y are positively coorelated" ... then yeah, that needs to be peer reviewed. If I say "I did X, then Y happened" then I do think we need peer review in order to make sure that I properly did X and that Y really did happen. Peer review is not just for explanations.
