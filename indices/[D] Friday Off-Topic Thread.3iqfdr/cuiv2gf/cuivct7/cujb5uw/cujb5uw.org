  Is neuro-linguistic programming a reasonable thing in any way?
#+end_quote

Given that (best I can tell) [[http://nlpdocs.com/][NLP]] was only ever a pretentious marketing term that meant whatever the authors wanted it to mean (at least, along the lines of "use of words and logic to affect the brain in some way"), well sure, sort of.

I would describe it as a dated, formerly trademarked variation on terms like "mind hacking" or "brain hacking". Maybe taboo the actual term it if it distracts people (edited original comment).

The thing I mentioned, reframing things to produce more advantageous reaction, is what many people would call common sense. (Or politics, or marketing, or journalism, or comedy, or education, etc.) The authors of the book I linked to decided to classify it as a form of NLP. Maybe someone else has written something better on the topic and called it something else less pretentious, but I'm not familiar with it off the top of my head so perhaps we can conclude that the marketing was successful.

Regarding the WP article, one name I noticed in the discussion and edit history is David Gerard. His edits seem fairly benign, but from past experience I know he's one of the ringleaders of a cohort of particularly arrogant knuckleheads calling itself RationalWiki. I suspect the hostility bled over from there (or somewhere similar), rather than representing the opinion of most experts actually familiar with the topic (maybe to some degree representing the opinions of neurologists, linguists, and programmers though, as the term appears calculated to offend all three of these specialties).

Here is an older [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuro-linguistic_programming&oldid=675553343][version]] of the quoted section:

#+begin_quote
  It has been claimed that the balance of scientific evidence reveals NLP to be a largely discredited pseudoscience.[16] Scientific reviews show it contains numerous factual errors,[14][17] and fails to produce the results asserted by Bandler & Grinder.[18][19] However, Steve Andreas has called the relevance of much of the research into question and claimed that more recent research supports NLP methods, albeit indirectly.[20]

The reference (which looks to have been lost in the shuffle, not removed for any particular reason) is [[http://realpeoplepress.com/blog/research-in-nlp-neurolinguistic-programming-science-evidence][this article]] which says the debunkery is focused on one particular non-central point suggested by the authors early on as a learning tool, which they soon afterwards corrected, called primary representational system (PRS).

PRS was the idea of people having a specific primary way of representing their memories such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. So if you are a kinesthetic type of person you would learn better by doing an exercise physically, whereas a more auditory or visual person would learn faster from listening to an audiotape or videotape respectively. (YouTube, what's that? This was the 80's.) It was an appealing notion for educators seeking to educate more effectively, but the studies apparently didn't pan out.

The article goes on to discuss evidence in support of various other topics also published under the NLP moniker, including the treatment of PTSD.

I'm not sure that's the whole story. Bandler seems to also make some pretty grandiose claims (the wikipedia article talks about claims of curing schizophrenia) . But it definitely seems more complicated than "NLP is a debunked pseudoscience".

In the talk section on WP, a hypnotherapist also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Neuro-linguistic_programming#Neutrality][discusses]] NLP as being a general body of knowledge -- not a specific model of the brain, not uniquely classifiable under to that term, etc.

  Actually, no one has ever sought me out for NLP services, and I expect no one ever will. People always see me for hypnotherapy. But I found many of the concepts presented in NLP (a) helpful and (b) not unique to NLP -- for example, cognitive reframing, operant conditioning, the "parts" metaphor, ideomotor response, imaginary rehearsal, therapeutic metaphor, and so on. I've found this lack-of-uniqueness useful when bridging modalities, but it makes the vitriol a bit startling!

A useful comparison might be CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) which probably uses a lot of the same techniques, although I haven't read up on it yet. Given the fact that it has a name that doesn't sound like it is trying to usurp three entire academic specialties (neuroscience, linguistics, and programming), my prediction would be that it is more popular among academics all else equal (i.e. assuming equally valid theoretical grounding and equal efficacy). On the other hand, due to being a far less /memorable/ term (because it doesn't paint a fantastical picture of reprogramming the brain like a computer), it would tend to be less well known or widely discussed among the general public.
