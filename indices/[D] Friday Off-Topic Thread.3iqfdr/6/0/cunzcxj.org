Whenever I see it, I find it confusing and annoying. If it's no longer politically correct to use =he= or =she= to mean a person of indeterminate gender, why can't =it= or even =ze= be used, rather than a word that's /normally/ plural? I like the meaning of a word to be unambiguous, so that I'm not forced to figure out /which/ meaning is being used at any given moment--repurposing =they= to mean =it= is just as bad as repurposing =comprise= to mean =compose= or repurposing =literally= to mean =figuratively=, and I find that seeing a plural noun where a singular noun should be is much more jarring than seeing a masculine (or feminine) noun where a neuter-gender noun should be.
