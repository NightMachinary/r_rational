I've been assembling background and worldbuilding ideas for the next portion of "S.I." in the 'spoilers' document at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bLSApEUTSzms90BtlaUUuHyQxh5PS7apDNj4mwlSMs/edit]] , starting a few pages from the end of it (at the comment highlighting 'Aug 11'). I could use some feedback on that, on any issues I haven't thought of or logical consequences I should take into account, before I start locking those details into the narrative proper.

I'm bringing it up now because I've finally gotten to a core point of how I've been trying to make the story rational: laying out the main motivations of the prominent characters, which will be what I use to determine how the events of the plot proceed. As long as those motives make sense, given the worldbuilding involved, then everything should work out; so I would most appreciate constructive commentary that affects that part of the notes.
