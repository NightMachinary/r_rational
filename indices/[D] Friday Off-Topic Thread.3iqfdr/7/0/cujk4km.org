The only thing I can think to ask is, where is the Hive located and why did they choose that spot?

If they live underground, then knowing what they look for in a potential living site can help Bunny to check for any other possible Hives. I'd be very surprised if there is only the one Hive, since why wouldn't the Hive try to create other Hives?

I'd recommend reading [[http://www.amazon.com/Coalescent-Stephen-Baxter/dp/0345457854/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8][Coalescence]] by Stephen Baxter. It does a great job of showing how on a slightly different evolutionary track, humans can form a more social, hive-like society with some personality traits in common with insects such as sacrificing the individual for the good of the hive and rigidly defined castes.
