  I think it might be better to say that organizations in general are existence-maximizing and that profit is only one tool in the utility belt.

Organizations maybe, but probably not corporations individually considering how many mergers and subsuming happens. I'm not even sure you can argue for any of that. If the guys in charge find it personally beneficial to run the business into the ground then they probably will. Also most businesses have a fairly large element of risk which wouldn't exist if they were existence maximising either.

I don't think you can paint corporations like that because it's too broad a brush for a vessel that's used in too many ways.

Probably just like AI too, you will have AI that kills itself.
