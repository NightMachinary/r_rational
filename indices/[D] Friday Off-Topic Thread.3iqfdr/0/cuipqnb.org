Charles Stross joked that we created artificial intelligence fifty years ago, it's just that we call them "corporations" instead of AI. This isn't really a new thought at all; "bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of an expanding bureaucracy" has been around for a while, and of course there's Scott Alexander's [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/]["Meditations on Moloch"]]. But it's got me thinking about the extent to which organizational entities like governments, governmental institutions, corporations, etc. resemble entities with their own goals and behavioral patterns.

It's tempting to say that corporations are profit-maximizing entities, but I don't think that's true. A corporation is made up of people, very few of whom are (in my experience) trying to maximize profits. A corporation is also made up of processes, very few of which are (in my experience) trying to maximize profits. You can make the argument corporations are in competition with each other and that "fitness" is determined by profit, which in turn means that corporations as a whole will be profit-maximizing, but I think if that's true, it's only one aspect (and just the most obvious one). I think it might be better to say that organizations in general are existence-maximizing and that profit is only one tool in the utility belt.

I've naturally been trying to find a story somewhere in there, but haven't had much success so far.
