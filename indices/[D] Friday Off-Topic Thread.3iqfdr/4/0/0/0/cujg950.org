Well, I guess I have another reason to keep going through Naruto now, since I loved the shit out of Time Braid with nothing but some Googling and reading the Chunin Exam Arc synopsis to go on.

It's weird; Naruto is the first media I've seen where I enjoy every fanfic I read more than the source material. Probably because it tends to be faster-paced, and almost never has the infuriating "fighting" which consists of about five parts talking to one part actually doing things. The only fight I've seen with major talking between opposing parties is the final battle of The Waves Arisen, and there was a very good reason for that one. (And it STILL has a higher fighting-to-talking ratio than the anime)

Of course, it helps that I've only read a few Naruto fanfictions, and thus am still enjoying the limited supply of "best of the best" that the community has produced.

While I'm talking about reading Naruto for the sake of fanfictions; is it worth watching the filler episodes? Will it improve my fanfic comprehension? In the near term, I'm specifically talking about the very large filler arc at the end of the original Naruto, before Naruto Shippuden starts.
