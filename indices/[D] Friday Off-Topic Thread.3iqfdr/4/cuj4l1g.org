I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715][an excellent 800,000-word /Naruto/ story]]. I'm not even halfway through it, but it already stands a very good chance of replacing /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ as my favorite book! It feels like a calmer counterpoint to the action of /Time Braid/, just as /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3494886][Eden]]/ seemed like a calmer counterpoint to the action of /Methods of Rationality/ in the /Harry Potter/ fandom.

(It doesn't feel particularly rational, though--though I am /by no means/ an expert in such judgments.)

--------------

Update: I absolutely loved the vast majority of /In the Blood/--so many twists!--but wasn't satisfied /at all/ with how the author chose to end the Uchiha half of the plot. ([[#s][Spoilered opinion]]) Still, this is definitely my second-favorite /Naruto/ fanfiction, displacing /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099][People Lie]]/. It's harder to say whether or not it's my second-favorite /book/ of all time; for now, I'll err on the side of "no".
