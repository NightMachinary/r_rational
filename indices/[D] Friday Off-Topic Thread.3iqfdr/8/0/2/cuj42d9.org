Errr... from the wiki definition,

#+begin_quote
  Its creators claim a connection between the neurological processes ("neuro"), language ("linguistic") and behavioral patterns learned through experience ("programming") and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life.

Which seems pretty obvious based on related research. And it's surprising to see anyone from this subreddit say it's pseudoscience when much of it is based off of well-established concepts like priming, biases, etc. and using those human patterns constructively. Personally I think, much like hypnosis, this is a topic that's been either over-hyped or given a false reputation because of stage magicians when really it's just something that's not well-understood yet but can have some positive uses- although lately the only time I've heard it mentioned have been in reference to politicians and business.
