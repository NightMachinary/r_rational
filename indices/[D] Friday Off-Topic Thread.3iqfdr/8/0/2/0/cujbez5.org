  Personally I think, much like hypnosis, this is a topic that's been either over-hyped or given a false reputation because of stage magicians when really it's just something that's not well-understood yet but can have some positive uses- although lately the only time I've heard it mentioned have been in reference to politicians and business.

Agree that it's over hyped. In fact I think the term "NLP" was ill advised as terminology, but is the kind of ill-advised thing that marketing positively selects for because the picture it paints in your mind is a memorable one.

Compare to CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), which I would guess fewer people have heard from but has seemingly a higher standing among academics. Since that term does not contain an implied claim on three different specialties that aren't even therapy related (neuroscience, linguistics, and programming) I would expect this to be the case even if NLP and CBT are exactly as effective as each other.
