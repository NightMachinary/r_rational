Well in the most original sense a D&D munchkin carries a 10 foot pole and a coil of rope because he knows it will be useful eventually.

More generally, taking every advantage offered and make the best of what you have to achieve a goal. Ignoring vague feelings and judging distasteful things purely on their cost and utility. Not being satisfied with good enough, and instead continuing to grow and improve until the original problem is trivial compared to ones skill.
