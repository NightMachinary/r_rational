There now exist socks with secret zippered pockets, to hold emergency cash, a spare key, a microSD card with enough capacity to hold the equivalent to multiple copies of the full Wikileaks dump, and so forth. There also exist customized replacement aglets for the ends of shoelaces, with rubbery coatings to look normal, such as a firestarter or a handcuff key.

Would you feel that someone who uses such devices in the ways they were designed for, thus resulting in footgear that may be more capable than the contents of most peoples' pockets, counts as real-world munchkining?
