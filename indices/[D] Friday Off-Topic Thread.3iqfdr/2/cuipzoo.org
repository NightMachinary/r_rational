I don't know if this is necessarily off topic, but I felt I'd just play it safe. Sherlock holmes is, as EY's pointed out many times, not rational/solvable(instead, its a story about someone pulling answers from thin air). However, a comment I saw got me thinking--is MacGyver rational? Or, failing that, is it a good example of munchkinism?
