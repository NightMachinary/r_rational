From what Uriel says, it's basically impossible (for normal humans) to distinguish a person from a p-zombie. Other than, maybe, if they use a Name and it doesn't work. And according to Uriel, such a p-zombie would emphatically insist on having a soul and even exhibit existential dread at finding out otherwise, but not actually be conscious.

/shudder/

Should p-zombies have human rights? Assuming that you can experimentally verify somebody not having a soul, and you have an archangel's word for them not having conscious experience but being complex automatons, should you value them the same as a human with a soul? How would this affect the Trolley Problem?
