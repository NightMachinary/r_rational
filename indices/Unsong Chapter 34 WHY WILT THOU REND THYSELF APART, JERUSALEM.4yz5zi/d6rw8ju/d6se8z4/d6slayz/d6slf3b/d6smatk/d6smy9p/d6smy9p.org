  In the context of the story, it's clear that Uriel operates on a level that is actualy beyond human comprehension. He's essentially the only person on the planet qualified to speak on the matter, so his word can be taken as the next best thing to the word of god.

On one hand. On the other hand, it's been pretty clearly demonstrated that Uriel is an unreliable narrator of sorts because he's really bad at seeing the world the way humans see it. So Uriel seeing no value in the soulless might be because they intrinsically hold no value or maybe because it's just Uriel being Uriel and misunderstanding something.

  Or perhaps more credibly, if Thamiel lacks any desire to torture p-zombies then that's some damn good evidence p-zombies don't have any genuince capacity for suffering. Of course, that's if Thamiel isn't just acting that way to inflame racism.

If this is true then I agree but I don't see anything pointing to this so it sounds like empty conjecture.
