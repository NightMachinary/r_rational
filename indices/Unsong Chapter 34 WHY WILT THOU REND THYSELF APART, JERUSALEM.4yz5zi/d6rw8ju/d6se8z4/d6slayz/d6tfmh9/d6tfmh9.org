I think a more sensible interpretation is that the angelic utility function treats souls differently from the human one, at least that is how angels think before angels acquire whatever cynical knowledge causes them to become fallen angels (which, note, Uriel is not as yet).

Thamiel's utility function is inverse of the angelic ones, so his not caring about souls means either he really doesn't care about the soulless just as angels don't, or he too doesn't realize the philosophical issue.

The human response to this would be to remove their souls so Thamiel doesn't take them (although it then turns into Thamiel's interest to take them regardless for game theory reasons)
