In the context of the story, it's clear that Uriel operates on a level that is actualy beyond human comprehension. He's essentially the only person on the planet qualified to speak on the matter, so his word can be taken as the next best thing to the word of god. So if Uriel says that consciousness is non-material and certain people aren't actually conscious and have no moral value, that deserves some serious consideration whether it fits with our understanding of neuroscience or not.

Or perhaps more credibly, if Thamiel lacks any desire to torture p-zombies then that's some damn good evidence p-zombies don't have any genuince capacity for suffering. Of course, that's if Thamiel isn't just acting that way to inflame racism.
