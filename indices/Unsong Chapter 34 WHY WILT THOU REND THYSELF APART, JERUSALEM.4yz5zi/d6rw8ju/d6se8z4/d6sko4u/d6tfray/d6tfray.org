(Good) moral philosophy is an attempt to describe the internal preference function and does not respond to external evidence. Either souls are necessary in order to morally matter, or souls aren't necessarily in order to matter. Whether or not souls exist is irrelevant to moral philosophy - if they don't exist and you believe they are necessary than you have to admit you live in an empty world. If they do exist and you believe they aren't necessarily before, learning of their existence doesn't change anything.
