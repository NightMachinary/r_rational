I agree at the pragmatic level that treating those Uriel claims do not have souls as beings(non-beings?) with zero moral value would be a mistake, even if one's own understanding of the way things work suggests that should be the case. Unless you're Uriel yourself, there is always the possibility of being mistaken about what Uriel meant.

With objective knowledge about the metaphysics of the universe, the issue of soulless' rights doesn't seem complicated to me, but any given individual in-universe is going to lack that important piece of objective knowledge. So I guess there's an important distinction of the issue from the viewpoint of the reader who has this knowledge, and the individuals in-story who do not.

Certainly in the real world, time and again whole swathes of the population have been dehumanized and abused by others, so we know it is a real risk not to have in place a default policy of humanizing others.

The rarest stance in the world seems to be one of "I don't know."
