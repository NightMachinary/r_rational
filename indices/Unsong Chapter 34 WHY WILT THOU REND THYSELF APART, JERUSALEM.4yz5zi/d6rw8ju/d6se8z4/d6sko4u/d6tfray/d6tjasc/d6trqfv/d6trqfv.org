Ah, I guess I'll go with "moral philosophy is vastly different" then: my moral philosophy doesn't have "qualia" as a factor to whether a being is morally relevant because I've already determined that it's incoherent (in all possible universes) to speak of qualia other than to refer to your own self as the experiencer of things, and whatever Uriel may believe retracting a soul eliminates, it's not eliminating that which matters in my moral philosophy.

As in, if the real me was this story observing events as they unfold and knowing everything the reader knows, I'd still believe Uriel was either philosophically mistaken about what counts as a person (he's not infallible) or had a morality not perfectly aligned to mine. Even if the sky cracked and a bunch of propositions I previously believed required questioning, that belief wouldn't be one of them. At least not enough to play it safe and give rights to the behaviorally conscious.
