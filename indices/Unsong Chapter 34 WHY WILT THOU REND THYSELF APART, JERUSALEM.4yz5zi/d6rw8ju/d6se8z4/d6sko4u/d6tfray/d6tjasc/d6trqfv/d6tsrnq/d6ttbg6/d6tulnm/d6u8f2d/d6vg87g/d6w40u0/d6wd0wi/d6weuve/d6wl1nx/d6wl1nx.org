Because my best understanding of reality is that if various quantum measurements had resolved differently, I wouldn't exist at all in it, and that that doesn't change anything about the fundamental truths of the universe. Even that aside, since I haven't always existed and the universe has(*), whatever those truths are, their axioms cannot include that I exist.

I think we may be quibbling over what constitutes "the nature of the universe." If not though, then I think it's the difference between what the starting points are for assembling evidence for one theory about things, versus what that theory happens to be. For the former, yes my existence is a basic component. For the latter, it is not (though the existence of consciousness as a phenomena is made part of its subject matter).
