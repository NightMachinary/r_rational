I'm really confused as to what your point is. Let me clarify what I said and see if you still have an objection.

  Maybe your moral philosophy differs vastly from mine, but if objective knowledge of who has souls is available in world, whyever would you grant the soulless rights?

If your moral philosophy entails that suffering is bad, and that suffering is only a possible state of "entities" which "experience things", then objective knowledge that the soulless do not experience anything and thus cannot suffer is relevant to your application of that philosophy.

Of course, [[/u/appropriate-username]] claims that indeed, the subject matter of morality to him deals fundamentally with living* things, such as, I presume, the computers used in computer-factories iff connected to the internet for signalling and installed with auto-updating quality anti-virus software, or Mother Gaia ... so long as one properly interprets "cells", I suppose. Or perhaps this whole debate confuses me.

*living:
