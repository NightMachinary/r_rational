#+begin_quote
  Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate

It very much looks like the soulless in the story are signaling and self-sustaining.

#+begin_quote
  organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce
#+end_quote

I think it's pretty safe to assume that the soulless do all these as well. This is the definition of life I'm using, I don't see what's meaningless or vague about it.
