Then you're missing the point. /Conciousness. Qualia/. These were key words which, if you were not already familiar with the concept of a philosophical zombie, were there to cue you in to the idea that the soulless in Unsong do not experience existence. They are no more "real people" than are rocks, very incredibly high definition 5-senses HD videotapes of real people, or vividly described characters in books. If there is nothing there to experience suffering, there is no suffering to alleviate. In Unsong, any ensouled who are subsequently de-ensouled at that time meet oblivion, even if the rest of the world cannot observe it.

Maybe your moral philosophy differs vastly from mine, but if objective knowledge of who has souls is available in world, whyever would you grant the soulless rights?
