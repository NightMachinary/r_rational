  The fact that consciousness is the thing by which we measure stuff like a fairly clear bridge between consciousness and measurable stuff right?

Is it? It's not even controversial to claim that there is no way to prove anyone else is "conscious" (i.e. to /disprove/ solipsism). The best we could ever hope to do is to understand reality so well that we can describe what kinds of physical interactions result in the physical state which we hypothesize is behind a conscious being's existing as a conscious being. And that's assuming that there is such a thing. Maybe all matter is "conscious", but most lives a very boring, mindless, memoryless, senseless life.

This is the fundamental point of difference. I am claiming a distinction between the underlying "syntactics", the abstract rules describing what is going on physically, and the way they are "realized" in the universe ("semantics", I'll refer to it as).

To avoid confusion more than that it's necessarily natural to say here, my viewpoint will jettison free-will, various aspects of identity such as a link between your "thoughts" and the thing doing the observing (i.e. that minds != consciousness), etc. Not that I am particular attached to abandoning these things or happen to know that it is necessary, but they appear problematic and are beside the main thesis.

Given that context. Our conscious experience seems like it interacts, but it is a mainstream observation that the outside world gets no information about whether I am "conscious" or not. The presence of "consciousness", in this sense, does appear to be "independent" of what's going on outside. Is a "consciousness", whatever that is, /impacted/ by what's going on outside? Maybe, but as I said, I think it's a mistake to conflate a "mind" that has thoughts with the "consciousness" that hears them. Maybe in the grand unified viewpoint these two concepts are equivalent, but then that's some theorem nobody's yet written the definitions to even state. So maybe not.

Now the prevalent materialist view is that consciousness is an "emergent property of matter", whatever that means. End of mystery. But my claim is that it is not a mathematical necessity that the rest of the abstract "rules" of matter and their semantics within the universe - physics - should entail that consciousness as the thing I claim I have should accompany the rest of physics. "It's an emergent property of +matter+the rest of physics" is just false. Syntactics does not imply semantics. Absent a bate-and-switch, consciousness as I experience it is not /by necessity/ the consequence of having "matter" obeying the other laws of physics, even if that is the way that it happens to play out in this reality. That the particles moving the way they move should /mean/ that I have consciousness rather than merely instantiating a false shell which interfaces with everything else as though there were is the question at hand, and the source of all dualism.

Maybe the stuff which makes up reality has some rule about consciousness attached to it and is fundamental in some way that it wouldn't make sense to talk about other realities existing which weren't made of that very same stuff with that very same rule ... but this is far away from a discussion of what the physics entails, and into metaphysics, and ultimately sounds like an explanation by fiat - matter has consciousness because matter has consciousness. /-- Alright, but why?/ Or at the very least, /-- well isn't that interesting?/ Certainly not "well it all makes sense consciousness is an emergent property and consciousness is just an illusion, man," which, sadly, seems also to be the prevalent mainstream viewpoint.

This isn't any greater mystery than any other metaphysics. But, the mysteries of metaphysics are the greatest mysteries of all.
