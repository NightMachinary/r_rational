I wasn't clear on you being of the anti-philosophical zombie bent, but I figured that what I wrote was not quite what you believed. I do think it is the extent of overlap in what we'd agree to though.

I personally am of the strong opinion that there is no such thing as a consistent "strictly materialist" stance which believes the universe is governed by certain physical/metaphysical laws and that those laws do not directly have anything to say about consciousness. In other words, I do not believe that the whole "consciousness is an emergent property of matter" shtick is sound. It'd be a long post or two to get into that so I won't here.

Unfortunately there's nothing I can do for those unwilling to admit to the meaningfulness of consciousness as a concept outside of working definitions.

I'd argue with your definition insofar as it's not the thing we usually refer to when we talk about consciousness, except my stance is that you can't define consciousness anymore than you can define the epiphenomena we associate with "volume" or "the passage of time", or better yet, the idea of "physical existence" itself. (With access to the mathematics/physical law we attach to the associated physical phenomena you can talk about the abstraction, but the idea that some tree or electron or ensemble of particles composing the sun "exists" is a completely different notion of "existence" than that used in mathematics, and I do not believe it to be formalizeable. Without formalizeability, you don't have definitions. And in the case of consciousness, we don't even have whatever physical law it presumably obeys, so discussion outside of presupposing that consciousness is a thing, like volume, and aside from being part of the rules of the universe it further has a certain physically semantic interpretation, like volume, is difficult.)

If you'll give me that consciousness like the inner-thing we conscious beings experience is some actual meaningful-though-not-definable thing itself, and suppose in the usual modern way that it is governed by some physical laws which are expressible via mathematics, then I'd say that the point of philosophical zombies is in the claimed /non-(mathematical)uniqueness/ of the universes' interpreter which reads off the particles/whatnot obeying those equations, and which says that there will be consciousness expressed in this particular way, or even that consciousness is physically realized, as opposed to, say, the case of the phase of the wave equation (which is not). Or shorter, that it is not mathematically or logically necessary that a given consistent set of symbols possess one semantics over another, and the mystery is that the universe chose this particular one. Syntatics does not imply a unique semantics. Which is all just a fancy way of saying and justifying that under these assumptions, the /experience/ of consciousness is entirely independent of anything external or measurable, and even more strongly, its "existence" is logically independent of the rest of the set up. But I recognize that it is consistent of you not to grant nearly so many assumptions about things.
