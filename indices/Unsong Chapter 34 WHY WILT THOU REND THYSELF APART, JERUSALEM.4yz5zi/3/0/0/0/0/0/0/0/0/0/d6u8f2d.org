The experience of consciousness is that by which "you" have access to things which are external or measurable in the first place. It's not "independent" of those things at all! No subjective consciousness = no one there to take the "objective" measurement.

The fact that consciousness is the thing by which we measure stuff like a fairly clear bridge between consciousness and measurable stuff right? (don't worries about the subject of other people's qualia yet, just assume solopsism for now)
