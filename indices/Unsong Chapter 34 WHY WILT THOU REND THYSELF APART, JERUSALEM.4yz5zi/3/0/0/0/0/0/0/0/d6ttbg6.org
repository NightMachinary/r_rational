I'm making a bolder statement than that actually: I mean even if we in principle know /exactly/ what /Uriel/ means, he's still probably wrong. Uriel does not understand humans and human values, this is canonically well established. An algorithm which behaves consciously is /self evidently, tautologically/ conscious and there is no such thing as evidence that can contradict that even in principle. Philosophical zombies /can't/ exist, any more than 2=3, without switching definitions around.
