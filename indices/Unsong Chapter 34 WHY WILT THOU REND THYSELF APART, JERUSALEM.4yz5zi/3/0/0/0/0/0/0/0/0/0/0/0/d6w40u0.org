I think you are thinking backwards.

Not everything has an explanation rooted in something else. At bottom, some things are /given/.There are axioms you assume, and then move forward from there. Your perceptions are sort of like an axiomatic starting point. You logically figure out what the physical laws of the universe you live in are from that axiomatic starting point. It's hard to explain but the question you are posing, "why do we have perceptions in the first place", isn't sensible. It's like I'm saying 1+1=2, and you're asking "why is there a 1+1".

Also when we say consciousness emerges from matter, we're talking about conscious behavior, not qualia. Qualia doesn't emerge from anything, it's the starting point from which other constructs emerge.
