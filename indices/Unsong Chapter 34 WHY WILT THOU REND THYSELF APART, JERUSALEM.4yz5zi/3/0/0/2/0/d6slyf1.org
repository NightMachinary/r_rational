You're using a meaningless word "alive" here. I'm sure there's a great link on LessWrong for using words which aren't the referents for anything.

In-universe, one doesn't have to use nebulous terms such as "alive", since the mystery of consciousness is solved - it's a physically/metaphysically colloquial-use!logically independent of everything else presence of a "soul." In Unsong, conciousness is something with a real metaphysical existence, and it does not exist in the soulless.

In the real world, you are not concerned with the well-being of rocks. I am fairly confidant making this assumption about you. Let me further assume that you are typical enough that one of the reasons that the suffering of abused animals weighs on you more than the rocks ground for ore is that, in real life, you do not believe that rocks experience anything at all, so there is no "suffering" to be concerned about. In Unsong, ... well, you fill in the blank. I feel like I'm using a lot of words in a hopeless attempt to try to attack a basic difference in both priors and methods of reasoning, so I'll just shut up now.
