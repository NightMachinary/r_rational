Well, pain is just feedback. It's your body's way of saying "don't do that" or "take it easy" or "keep this spot safe while it heals." A p-zombie avoiding things that bring it "pain" is like Google's Go-playing neural network avoiding moves that have given it negative reinforcement values in the past. In neither case does this feedback indicate an experience of pain, or of suffering; it only results in the outwardly observable and behavioral effects that we normally associate with such experience. While I think that animals do experience pain in real life, it's logically necessary that they don't if they lack souls in a world where only souls experience anything. (Which, though likely, is not really certain in Unsong yet. Offhand, I'd put the chance that Uriel messed up and humans without souls have consciousness at ~30%.)

As for the animal abuse laws, there could be any number of reasons for that. Maybe they have been rescinded but it wasn't worth noting. It could be that people don't like seeing things that look like suffering but really aren't, as with watching torture in a movie. Or, seeing the suffering-like behavior of abused animals (who aren't actually suffering) might make people less sensitive to the suffering-like behavior of abused humans (who actually are suffering), and so outlawing cruelty to animals actually decreases cruelty to humans. Or, it could just be that people haven't thought things through, as usual. Point is, there are valid reasons to not legalize animal abuse, even if animals have no experience, just like there are valid reasons not to legalize p-zombie murder, even though p-zombies have no consciousness.
