It's not missing the point. It may well be the case that in real life, consciousness can occur in animals or machines or other entities purely as a consequence of how they are built. You are conscious, in other words, because you have a brain organized in such a way that it hosts consciousness. (Call this the view that consciousness is a physical property of systems.) If you then further suppose that souls exist, then you're right: Whether you have a soul, given that consciousness is physical property, has no bearing on whether you have consciousness.

However, if you believe that consciousness is something that ensouled beings have and non-ensouled beings lack--no matter how much they insist they experience things and no matter that their brains seem to light up in the same places under an MRI under the same conditions as to an ensouled being's--then the talk about p-zombies is terribly relevant.

Your point seems to boil down to the fact that p-zombies don't exist; displaying the behaviors expected of conscious beings is identical to being conscious. That may well be the case in real life--I happen to believe it is. There is little evidence for the existence of souls, so if we are to conclude that we ourselves are conscious, we must conclude that consciousness is possible without souls. However, in Unsong, souls do exist. They seem to be very important, they possibly have a place in some Divine Plan, and the Archangel Uriel (who is more knowledgeable about these things than most) says that beings without souls don't suffer, even when they appear to, and accuses several apparently normal humans of lacking souls. This seems like strong evidence that p-zombies do exist in Unsong.

It may turn out that Uriel is wrong in this case. He is bad at understanding humans, sometimes. But the rules in Unsong are different than those in real life, and it might be (and seems to be) the case in the story that physical mechanisms are not sufficient to produce conscious experience, and no soul = no consciousness.
