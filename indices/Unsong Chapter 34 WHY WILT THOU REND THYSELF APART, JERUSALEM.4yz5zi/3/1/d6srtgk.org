Actually, I think this whole p-zombie thing is entirely missing the point. in my opinion, souls and consciousness are orthogonal qualities: someone can have a soul and not be conscious, and someone can have no soul and be conscious. This is based on the fact that a soul is completely optional, and whether you have one can change over your lifetime, apparently with no observable side effects.

I think that having a soul is sort of like having the right to vote. You still exist independent of your rights, but when you have them the world tends to work differently for you. In this case, having a soul lets you use names, let's you move on to heaven or hell, and plugs you in to the api holy beings like angels and Uriel have access to, which tracks suffering, happyness, sin, etc.

It has to be emphasized that you exist independently of this system. Even if it does noticeably change your behavior, it would just be added to a massive list of environmental variables that control you, including things like sun exposure, air quality, exposure to nature in your enviroment, trace minerals such as lithium or lead in your enviroment, smog, pollution, food quality, etc etc etc etc.
