Despite what appears to be a majority opinion that chapters like this make the story too slow, these world building chapters are inevitably my favorite. This is in large part because they are always carefully constructed to support jokes and clever connections in addition to interesting worldbuilding. Today's installment was no exception. I hope to see many more in the future.
