One thing which certainly doesn't help rational fiction is using rational fiction to sell Lesswrong-style ideas like cryonics, AI danger, etc. It often amounts to "rational people come to agree with me", and to audience members who don't agree, comes across as preachy protagonists who think they are rational but have big blind spots. Saying "if you're rational, you must believe in cryonics" gives an entirely wrong idea of what rationality is that will turn many people off.

Another thing to avoid is to have the rational character seemingly not need to know how to defer to authority or otherwise deal with people because his rationality makes everyone listen to him. That comes across as wish fulfillment of the "I wish I didn't need to have social skills in addition to being smart" type. (And I see some of that in HPMOR.)
