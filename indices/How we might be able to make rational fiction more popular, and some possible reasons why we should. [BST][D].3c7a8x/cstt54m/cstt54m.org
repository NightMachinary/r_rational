When you write "rational fiction" do you mean rationalist? because rational fiction in itself should not be something people will avoid. In a lot of ways rational fiction is just fiction where the author needed to do more heavy lifting in the background. There are some things which people like in regular fiction that I suppose will not be possible, or at least not reasonably so, in rational fiction. But otherwise there is nothing particular in rational fiction that will make it more difficult for the reader.

Any difficulties i can think of at least are essentially just styles that writers use which might distance "casual" readers, rather then inherent hurdles to rational fiction in getting ration fiction read more..

If you mean rationalist fiction specifically then I think it will be fairly difficult to keep rationalist fiction both generally accessible and interesting, because one of the aspects of it is teaching, and in teaching. So the best that could be done would be a story which is interesting as a rationalist fiction for people who have less background, but for people that already know the principles etc. it will just fallback into "regular" rational fiction.. Though that would be difficult in my opinion and most writers will have hard time pulling that off, so i think it would work better if writers will target the demographics seperately..
