A lot of what you have said sounds right. I think that current examples of rational literature are rather complex. If you want to get more readers, start simple and work your way up SLOWLY.

For example, most people have not been trained to think logically. So having a character think through problems logically and explain their thoughts would be a simple example of this. As the story progresses, the problems that they have available should increase in difficulty. At the same time, the problems should NOT be ordinary. They should draw attention. Also, if you are showing logical thinking, then you should avoid math. (The reason for this is that math often seems difficult and will turn people off.)

If the problem-solving and the story are integrated, then you can build confidence in the reader that they can solve these problems. This would be rationalist fiction that is accessible to ordinary people.

The problem with the current batch of rationalist fiction is that everyone is too intellectual. Your average people knows no statistics, little math and almost no logic. Your average rationalist fiction assumes knowledge in these subjects. So write your fiction assuming that readers really do know nothing about this. Your average person rarely makes decisions based on abstract factors. More often emotional and relational reasons are primary. Your average person is not aware of the reasons behind their own decisions. So start with a character in the same position as the average person and let them learn this. (Coming-of-age fiction is a particularly good way to do this.)

I have more suggestions, but I lack the ability to write any of these works.
