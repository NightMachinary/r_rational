Absolutely. Another, possibly better approach is to disguise it so people learn it without realising that's what they're doing. If you do it right, they won't ever realise that what they were doing was maths unless it's pointed out, because it has none of the things they associate with maths. (numbers, the notation, difficulty, tediousness, irrelevance to anything practical...)
