There's no way to tell which people are subscribed to a subreddit. You can scrape for people who have set their flair, or scrape for people who have ever made a comment or post, but there's no way that I know of to see all the lurkers, who far outnumber the commenters. This sub, for example, has nearly 2,000 subscribers but the highest number of comments we've had on a single post is in the low +double+ triple digits (and most of that is the same handful of people talking with each other).

See [[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1uk9uc/tribes_of_reddit_and_a_new_subreddit_recommender/][this post]] in [[/r/TheoryOfReddit]] about the "Tribes of Reddit" for some analysis along those lines.
