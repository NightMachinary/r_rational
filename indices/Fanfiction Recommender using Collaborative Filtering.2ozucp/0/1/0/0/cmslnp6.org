Ok, here is a feature I would like FFN to add: the ability to link to a specific review.

And here's a a feature I would *REALLY* like FFN to add: the ability to block particular users from leaving reviews or PMing me. (Yes, I realize it wouldn't be a perfect solution as they could leave the reviews anonymously.)

I've had one guy who didn't pay attention / frequently misunderstood what he was reading, then left foul-mouthed trollish comments telling me all the ways he felt that I'd screwed up. That was annoying, but manageable.

I now have a guy posting reviews who, after several exchanges via PM, I honestly believe is out of touch with reality. He does not curse, but his comments are starting to make me uncomfortable; for example, the one that is currently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9669819/0/1/][first on this page]] which starts with "So close and yet so far," He's commenting on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/53/The-Two-Year-Emperor][this chapter]] in which the characters are making sacrifices and [[#s][the]] determines the color of the resulting flames. The reviewer is proceeding to tell me that I got it wrong and what the colors should mean. Here's a couple of excerpts:

  The color of Morality which you mistakenly call Lawful Good is NOT gold, it's goldEN. It's specifically the color of the SUN, not the color of filthy metal.

  Red is the color of human blood. The blood of life, the blood flowing in your veins, the blood you shed for humanity. NOT the color of purity.

Personally, I find this creepifying.
