As far as I can tell, FFN wrote a system 10ish (?) years ago that satisfied its needs and hasn't really kept up since then. There are a lot of very obvious features missing -- one simple example is that there is a Document Manager where I upload and possibly edit chapters, and then there is a Manage Stories where I post / update story chapters. Wouldn't it make sense it, when I edit a document and then save it, the chapter automatically updates to use the new content? Or, at least, if there were a 'Save and Update' button that would do that.
