One of my favorite authors over there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3092366/ebfiddler][ebfiddler]] who does some really good Firefly fiction. She has 12 stories which together constitute a "book length" work, but they are 12 different URLs. The first half-dozen are about 12-20,000 words, then they start getting longer, going from 50k to 80k.

Actually, given that a novel is generally considered anything from 40k - 120k (depending on genre) there is well more than one book here. Still, the question stands.

How would / could these be listed on GoodReads?
