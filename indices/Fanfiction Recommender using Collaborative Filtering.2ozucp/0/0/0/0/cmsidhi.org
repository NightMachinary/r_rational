For that matter, I think I should mention that Goodreads does allow fanfiction to be listed. The only conditions are:

- Must be complete
- Should be "book length"
- Can't use a screenshot from the source material as a cover image

Those rules are kinda flexible, too, I suspect they're only there so that they can clean up stuff at their discretion. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10016013-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality][Methods of Rationality]] has an extensive entry despite still being in progress, for example.

I'm actually a Librarian over there, so if anyone has favourite fanfics they'd like to see listed or that have incomplete listings, let me know and I'll do what I can to fill them out nicely. :)
