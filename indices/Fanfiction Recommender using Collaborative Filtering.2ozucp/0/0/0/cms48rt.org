Netflix and Goodreads both do it. It should be far simpler for ff.net because it's just a simple "favorite" binary instead of seven choices like Netflix, or six like Goodreads (though Goodreads has a multilevel system that's a bit more complex). I closely followed a lot of the discussion that surrounded the Netflix Prize, and it really isn't /that/ expensive depending on which methods you use (and there are a ton of ways to get around any expensive parts).
