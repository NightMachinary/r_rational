Personally, I'd say that the stories are "eh, close enough" to book length and just put them all in, and then link them together into a series.

I happen to have a system already set up to do this sort of thing quickly, so here you go: [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/142514-a-lion-s-mouth][ebfiddler's Firefly series is on Goodreads now]] (didn't know what to name the series so I used the first story's name as the series name. Easily edited if you know what it should be called instead). And as a side effect of the process, [[http://www.mediafire.com/download/j86q1smweianm9q/ebfiddler's_Firefly_series.zip][here's a zip containing epub versions of them all]]. I downloaded them all into a Calibre library using the FanfictionDownloader plugin, then exported a CSV file with all the relevant metadata from the library, and then used the iMacros firefox plugin to automate data entry putting them all into Goodreads.
