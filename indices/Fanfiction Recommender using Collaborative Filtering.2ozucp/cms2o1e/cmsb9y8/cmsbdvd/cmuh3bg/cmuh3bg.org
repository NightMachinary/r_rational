  Right?! Man, that site sucks. We're stuck in some dumb coordination game where everyone has to use ffn because everyone uses ffn.

There is a site with /much/ better features: its own editor /and/ Google Docs integration, a story manager, various groups with folder arrangements to provide for specific interests, and a Feature Box with autogenerated recommendations based on click/like/vote/favorite trends. It just turns out that their idea for solving the coordination problem was to say "Friendship is magic" and leave it at that.
