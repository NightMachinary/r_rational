I've often wondered why ff.net doesn't do this themselves. They already make the list of favorite stories public for every user, so it doesn't seem like too much work to code something up that would do a better job at recommendation than what's available on the site now (which is basically crap at finding good stuff).

I'll be interested to see what the author recommender turns up.
