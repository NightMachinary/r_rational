My scattered thoughts on this chapter:

Being Hinata is suffering.

Fun chapter. I always love it when people being possessed realize that they are being possessed, feel like they are still consciously in control, and then go do horrible things. It's a much more interesting way of handling the whole possession idea.

So, it looks like if Naruto can just keep the fox's chakra from reaching his brain, he can access it's power without going crazy AND possibly still use the magic eyeball. Fox chakra everywhere but his head could have some very, very interesting implications. His world domination plan is looking better and better by the day.

Things the fox chakra does to your brain: Gives user urge to kill ninja. Sounds like it holds a grudge. Reduces thought clarity Naruto turned off his magic eyeball. Which is actually a serious power loss. Has an urge to eat people. Total lack of empathy.
