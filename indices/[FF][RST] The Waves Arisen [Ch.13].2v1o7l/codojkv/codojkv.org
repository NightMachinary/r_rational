Excellent chapter. Your Kyuubi mode was very original-flavored, and I love it. He's not stupid or mindless; he just has different values!

And, of course, Orochimaru just died. Kinda surprised he didn't stick around for longer, but at this point there's no real guarantee for /anyone/, so I wasn't /too/ surprised.
