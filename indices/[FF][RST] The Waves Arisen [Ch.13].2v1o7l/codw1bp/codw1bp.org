Prediction: Kabuto dies next chapter but only after Karin appears and gets killed off too. Then we'll see a time skip of a few weeks or so to jump over the team's learning to manage the Sound village. Where they'll learn about Pein where he is either attacking Konoha (bet they'll be happy to have Konoha off their backs) or approaching them to make a partnership deal.

Is it just me that finds it funny that it's SASUKE who is the Kage of Sound instead of Naruto?

  This story has some of the highest concentration of plot per sentence I've ever seen. Well done.

I cannot agree enough! Every chapter is cramming in more and more plot than the one before it! I sincerely believe this story will die of plot toxicity. Let's see if we can get an overdose of plot. ;)
