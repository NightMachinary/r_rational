  - How does Shadow Clone interact with Kyuubi mode? Maybe a shadow clone could hold onto his original values? Bet this comes up later.
#+end_quote

Shadow clones split the chakra of the caster, and the beast's chakra overwhelms Naruto's chakra, so I would bet shadow clones cast by the beast would have the same utility function it does.

  - Anyone else think Kabuto is just playing for time until Orochimaru can respawn again? No way he has really just surrendered like that. This way he can keep Sasuke around to use the seal to help revive him.

If Kabuto thinks Naruto can just kill Orochimaru normally, then there'd be no reason for Kabuto to think resurrecting Orochimaru would help and he would comply with Naruto just to survive. On the other hand, if Kabuto's been eavesdropping on the latter part of the group's conversation, he'd almost certainly be plotting against them knowing that Naruto wouldn't call on the beast again.
