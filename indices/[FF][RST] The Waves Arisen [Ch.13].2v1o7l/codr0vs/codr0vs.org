So a few predictions:

- How does Shadow Clone interact with Kyuubi mode? Maybe a shadow clone could hold onto his original values? Bet this comes up later.

- Anyone else think Kabuto is just playing for time until Orochimaru can respawn again? No way he has really just surrendered like that. This way he can keep Sasuke around to use the seal to help revive him.

And once again, Naruto is oblivious to Hinata's feelings! I'm sure he'll figure it out eventually...

Kyuubi Naruto is hilarious. Evil and horrific, but hilarious.
