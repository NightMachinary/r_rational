  And, of course, Orochimaru just died. Kinda surprised he didn't stick around for longer, but at this point there's no real guarantee for anyone, so I wasn't too surprised.

Canon Orochimaru has multiple methods of immortality and reviving himself, so I bet rational Orochimaru is going to be even tougher to kill.
