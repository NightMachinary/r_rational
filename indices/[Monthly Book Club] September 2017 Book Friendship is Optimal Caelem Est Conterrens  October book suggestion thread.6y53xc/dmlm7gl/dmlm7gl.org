*Title:* /Foucault's Pendulum/ by Umberto Eco

*Ebook cost:* [[https://www.amazon.com/Foucaults-Pendulum-Umberto-Eco-ebook/dp/B003WUYPI8/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=][$9.43 USD]]

*Word count:* 215k

*Genre:* Mystery

*Synopsis:* A group of vanity publishers, increasingly exasperated by absurd conspiracy theories they're presented with on a daily basis, decide to entertain themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory to end all conspiracy theories. Events go downhill from here.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* This book could be considered a self-aware commentary on conspiracy theories, and deconstruction of conspiracy fiction. By its very nature, it shows a pretty rational approach to its themes.

One may also find it reminiscent of /Unsong/ (or vice versa): it's full of clever wordplay and references to obscure occult topics, combining that with several surprisingly modern ideas.
