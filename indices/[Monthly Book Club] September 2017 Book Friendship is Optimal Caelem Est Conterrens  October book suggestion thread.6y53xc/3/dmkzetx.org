*Title*: The Martian by Andy Weir

*Ebook cost:* $9.99 USD

*Word count*: 120k

*Genre:* Sci-fi

*Synopsis:* Astronaut Mark Watney gets left behind on Mars because of a freak dust storm, and must use nothing but his wits, knowledge of botany and engineering, and the limited resources he has available to him in order to survive long enough to return home. Features a movie adaptation directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* It was originally written as a web serial, and is one of the most grounded and realistic mainstream science-fiction books ever written. My only worry in recommending it here is that most people on this sub will have already read it---it's a perfect fit otherwise. Also, I think following it up with a discussion of the movie would be interesting, as it's one of the few pieces of real rational fiction that has a movie adaptation (only other one I can name now is Arrival).
