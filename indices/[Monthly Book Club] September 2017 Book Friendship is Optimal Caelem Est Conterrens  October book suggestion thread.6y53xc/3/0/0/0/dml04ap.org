I think having a variety of "meatiness" from month to month is great, or perhaps putting something like The Martian during December when people are busier (or would it be better to put something meatier during December when people have more free time?).

In any event we'll see how much of a hit these threads are. Ultimately six months from now I'd love to be discovering new novels that I wouldn't have thought to read or have been meaning to read but didn't (e.g. I've been meaning to read A Mote in God's Eye forever), but if people only end up discussing books they'd already read - so months with Ender's Game and The Martian get good play, and The Three Body Problem gets crickets - then that might say we'd be better off doing a weekly "discussion series" where each week we select a new book that is considered "required rationalist reading" that most people "should" already have read. We'd publish the list a month out so people can "catch up" and read what they haven't already read in time for the discussion. So that could work, as an alternative?
