I've never heard of Cordyceps, for what it's worth!

I'm glad you are planning on suggesting something! I'm a little worried whether I'm going to get many suggestions at all - maybe I made the example form too onerous or something? - but I'm glad you're just thinking about it. Also, I think my time zone is opposite to the English-speaking internet's most populated time zone (despite being the world's most populated time zone), so that no doubt accounts for some.
