Well, the books are rather good, but I think I should post only one suggestion myself, and I'm still deliberating whether I find something more obscure. Blindsight, Crystal Society and Greg Egan in general were recommended to me by [[/u/Noumero][u/Noumero]], which is why I thought they were already pretty well-known around here.

I'll think about it for a day or so. If I don't have any great ideas, Blindsight would probably be my recommendation.

EDIT: Also, you said you want to avoid Sci-Fi, AI and Transhumanism, so all of my suggestions here are a no-go. Currently thinking about nominating Cordyceps, despite [[/r/rational][r/rational]] being familiar with it.
