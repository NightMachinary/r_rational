Thanks for making a suggestion! It's such a great book! I think I've read it about 3 times. Is number 4 on the horizon? We'll see!

Comparing it with the other suggestion I made (The Three Body Problem) The Martian was a very, very easy read: you can just devour it in a few hours and you wouldn't want to put it down, whereas The Three Body Problem required a lot more attention/careful reading and you were sometimes happy to take a break.
