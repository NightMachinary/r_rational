Title: Book of Matthew, King James Version Ebook cost: free Genre: Religious, Fantasy, Historical Second most popular book of the bible, I would like the rational community to begin to look at religious books and their history, monthly, perhaps as an extra side project? There is culture value, and empathy value, and if allows us to discuss in a safe space without too many objections. What I would like is to get peoples opinion of the book without having the book interpreted to them. Maybe a bad idea. I would also be interested in doing this with other religions more notable scriptures.
