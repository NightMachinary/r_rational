I think for now, I'll probably do a 3 or 4 month "pilot" with a new book each month, and then have a meta thread for people to give feedback to work out how to go forward.

I'd like the threads to be well-organised, you know? I've prepared some, for wont of a better word, "discussion points" to put in the FiO:CeC discussion thread that I'll be posting in the next few days, and I am not sure I'd (personally) be willing to do that more often than once a month. (This would be moot if I wasn't the sole czar though.)
