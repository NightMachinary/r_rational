Title: The 48 Laws of Power, audio and print, and ebook Word count: 140k Genre: self-Help, historical, rational guide to irrational scenarios. Synopsis: The 48 Laws of Power Summary. In direct contrast to the compassion-oriented management books that dominate today's business bestseller lists is The 48 Laws of Power, a Machiavellian treatise for the modern age. Cost: 15.00-22.00, also available in audiobook, free on audible trial. This should be a required, listed work of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]. I do have one paperback copy to loan by mail, if chosen.
