Thanks!

I'm not sure if the complicated subjective process will ultimately become a good thing (allows me complete control to ensure we get a variety of genres rather than whatever is popular in general) or a bad thing (my tyranny knows no bounds?). But I figure I'll be sick of curating in six months and someone else can have a go so it'll all shake out in the wash.
