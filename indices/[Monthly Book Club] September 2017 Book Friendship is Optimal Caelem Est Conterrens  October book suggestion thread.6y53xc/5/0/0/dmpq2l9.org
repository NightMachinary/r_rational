Ah, gotcha. I must've skimmed over the "complicated subjective process" paragraph, but to be fair, I haven't had the ability to access the internet at home for a few weeks (or maybe only like a week, but it feels like a /really/ long time) and I've got other stuff to do while I've got it.

But yeah, Contest Mode is mostly just a deterrent for making sure people who casually look at the first 3 or 5 out of 50 entries don't bias the vote in favor of either newest posts or posts that are already getting upvoted, probably not as important if it's your own personal thing where you're planning on looking at every suggestion.

Also, excellent choice of book for the month. I'm one of the (apparently) minority who kinda prefers the first one, but still a pretty awesome story.
