That's a great suggestion!

That said, this won't run on upvotes, since I think those would bias in favour of people voting books they've already read. It's purely on my own personal criterea - and I will try not to let upvotes influence the selection (though in practise it isn't possible to remove their influence on my subconscious since I'm sadly not a robot or anything).

So I'm not sure if it's as important?

Also given the volume of suggestions, I think it might be best to only take them every three months or so? (Or just leave the thread open for the six months you can still comment to it, and provide a link in each month's bookclub thread - that's probably the best way)
