This is an "announcement" thread so people know which book to read now, and a suggestion thread for next time.

I'll put the discussion thread for CeC up around the 14th/15th of the month depending on a complicated venn diagram of my own personal schedule and not stepping on e.g. the worldbuilding wednesday thread.
