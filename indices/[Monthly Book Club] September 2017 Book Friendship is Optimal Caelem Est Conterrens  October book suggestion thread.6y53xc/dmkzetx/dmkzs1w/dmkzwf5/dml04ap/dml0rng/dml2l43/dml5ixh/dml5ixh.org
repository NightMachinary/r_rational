Those all sound great, particularly Blindsight! Would you be willing to post one of those as a suggestion for October? It looks like Blindsight is available for free on goodreads and a site called "manybooks" which has free ebooks, so it could be a great option.

(then again given this whole book club thing is my supreme domain, I can just say we're watching Blindsight and to hell with anyone else.)
