There should be a bot that responds to that phrase with book recommendations, but there isn't, so let me take its role.

Based on you recommending The Martian, you seem to like hard sci-fi with an emphasis on clearly illustrated thought processes. Off the top of my head, you might like:

Peter Watts - Blindsight. Featuring both some extremely alien aliens and a species of Vampires who are human-like, yet mentally quite different, this book excels as hard, yet colourful sci-fi. In the afterword, the author cites over a hundred papers to substantiate the technologies and alien biologies he speculates about.

Greg Egan - Reasons to be Cheerful. A meditation on what it means to be happy, enabled by some interesting innovations in medical technology.

Vernor Vinge - A Fire Upon the Deep. Less hard scifi, but with some very interesting thought processes, as a race of aliens is introduced whose minds are conglomerates formed by a group of individual bodies. The exact combination of those bodies changes how the individual mind works, which has some interesting effects on individuals.

EDIT: How could I forget Crystal Society? It features an artificial intelligence whose mind is occupied by several different personality threads. They use a betting market to figure out what the body should do.
