/Blindsight/, /Crystal Society/ and Greg Egan are indeed popular, but I'm not sure that /Reasons to be Cheerful/ in particular is.

Regarding submissions: /Foucault's Pendulum/? It's not sci-fi, AI, or transhumanism; it's quite self-aware, and has some ideas that might interest this subreddit (Abulafia). It's also pretty /Unsong/ (or vice versa, as it happens).
