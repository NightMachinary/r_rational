(this is purely an example to show you how much detail to give. Unless nobody else has anything to suggest in which case it wins by default?)

(EDIT: Hijacking my own top post to say the below book will not be selected, it was just an example, and that upvotes will only be a minor consideration in the choice of book, which will otherwise be done entirely based on my own personal whim)

*Title*: The Three Body Problem by Liu Cixin

*Ebook cost:* $5.33 USD

*Word count:* 128k

*Genre*: Sci-fi

*Synopsis*: 1967: Ye Wenjie witnesses Red Guards beat her father to death during China's Cultural Revolution. This singular event will shape not only the rest of her life but also the future of mankind.

Four decades later, Beijing police ask nanotech engineer Wang Miao to infiltrate a secretive cabal of scientists after a spate of inexplicable suicides. Wang's investigation will lead him to a mysterious online game and immerse him in a virtual world ruled by the intractable and unpredicatable interaction of its three suns.

This is the Three-Body Problem and it is the key to everything: the key to the scientists' deaths, the key to a conspiracy that spans light-years and the key to the extinction-level threat humanity now faces.

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it*: It's a hugely acclaimed sci-fi novel that is the first of a trilogy. It was originally written in Chinese by a Chinese author and has a lot of content that is related to that, the cultural revolution, etc. The translator's notes in my edition provided a lot of interesting context. Added to that, it's a science fiction story that has a lot of mystery. I wasn't reading it through a rational lens when I read it the first time, but it seemed really well-grounded.

*Any content warnings*: Some violence in parts, but nothing too graphic
