Glad you enjoyed it!

Which two sequels? Friendship is Optimal is an entire universe of its own with dozens and dozens of fics of various quality, mostly written by different authors. Caelem Est Conterrens is one such story set in the original FiO universe!

I think I read just about everything FiO I could get my hooves on already, but if there's anything you recommend that I haven't read I'd be very keen to read them!
