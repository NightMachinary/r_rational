I just finished reading this and its two sequels after seeing this post! They were pretty good.

If you liked the content and types of ideas in the sequels, then you might like Manifold: Time and its sequel Manifold: Space. Not perfect books, but they scratch the same itches. (One recommendation though: skip the last one, Manifold: Origin. They're each pretty self-contained so you're not missing much.)
