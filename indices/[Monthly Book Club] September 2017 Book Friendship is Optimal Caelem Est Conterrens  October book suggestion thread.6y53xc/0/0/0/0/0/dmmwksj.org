Hm. So you say. Then,

--------------

*Title:* /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ by Eliezer Yudkowsky

*Availability:* [[http://www.hpmor.com][Free]]

*Word count:* 662k

*Genre:* Adventure, Drama, Humor

*Synopsis:* Harry Potter's aunt married an Oxford professor instead of some schmuck, and Harry was raised in an environment of books, science and rationality, instead of in a cupboard. When the Wizarding World, in a fit of extremely poor decision-making, reveals itself to him, he is gleeful: magic allows him to accelerate his plans for World +Domination+ Optimization by quite a lot!

*Why [[/r/rational]] would like it:* Explicitly written as a rational fanfiction, it checks off all boxes, deconstructing /Harry Potter/'s entire story, upping the intelligence of not only Harry but all characters, weaving an intricate web of plots, and preaching the wisdom of Big Yud (instead of Big Resh's).

*Content warnings:* discussion of rape and torture, involvement of happiness-sucking literally evil entities, psychological and emotional manipulations, politics, bullying, heartbreaks, The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You-heartbreaks, character death, dismemberment, mass murder, blasphemy, discussion and explicit depiction of moral and philosophical dilemmas, dreams of necromancy, gross violation of the laws of physics, existential horror, cosmic horror, social horror, pranks, snarks, mindrape, spiders (probably).

(Only mostly joking.)

To be more serious, would any of Wildbow's stories do, then?
