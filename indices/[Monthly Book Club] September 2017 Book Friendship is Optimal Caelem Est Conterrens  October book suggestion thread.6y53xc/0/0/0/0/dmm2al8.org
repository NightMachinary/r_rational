Well, I think /Three-Body Problem/ is "standard" fiction (in that it doesn't attempt to be particularly rational or irrational), which we could then view through the lens of rationality; whereas it sounds like /Cordyceps/ starts as rational, but then specifically tries to *subvert* rationality as the optimal approach.

But generally I'd agree, that at least the first 2-3 works examined should be clearly rational or rationalist fiction. That gives us our "baseline", so when we start branching out into less rational works, we have a proper lens of rationality to view them through (in what ways is this work rational? in what ways isn't it? what would a more rational character do in this scenario? is the story overall helped or hindered by being less rational? etc). In that way, /3BP/ probably isn't a great choice for the next story either.
