Supervillain claims to reform and makes friends with the ex-superhero main character; despite being a Large Brick, her powers are basically never relevant to the actual challenges she faces except in flashbacks. Primarily deals with 'how would superheroes affect the world, and what would it take to change it in a real way?'

People talk about a rationalist story with a main character who isn't very rational. This is pretty much exactly that.
