Oh boy, I don't know if I could do it justice.

/Worm/ is a rational superhero web serial. It was written by [[/u/wildbow]], and just finished a few months ago. It was recommended by Eliezer Yudkowsky (the author of HPMOR), which is how a lot of people in this community first found it.

The main character is a girl named Taylor who has the ability to control bugs, and how she rationally uses her power in the setting, which features a rational take on superpowers (which are actually explained by the end, so not just deus ex). And all the superheroes (and villains) use their powers rationally and have very clear motivations. Its subtitle is "Doing the wrong things for the right reasons."

Easily one of the best free pieces of web fiction I've read, and that kinda says something. Highly recommended by basically everyone.
