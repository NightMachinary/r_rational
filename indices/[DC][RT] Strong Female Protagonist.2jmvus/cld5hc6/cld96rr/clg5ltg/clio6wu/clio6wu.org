  Worm is intense. It is like looking into the sun, if the sun, if the sun was made of Cerberus Syndrome instead of plasma.

  It is a story that you have to take breaks from, because the emotional experience is too taxing.

  It is a story that absolutely refuses anyone a good time. It has major character deaths with believable consequences, post traumatic stress for everyone and their dog, an apocalyptic society, and denies anyone emotional closure.

  It is heartbreaking. It is the most amazing piece of fiction I have read to date. It is a never ending stream of disasters, interspersed with waiting for the other shoe to drop.

  I drips with unease. Every problem is solved by a liberal application of intelligence. Every impassable obstacle is circumvented by sacrificing a little humanity.

  Every fanfic I have read has been one wherein the characters can be happy, get a breather, and fall in love. Simply because canon studiously denies them simple pleasures of security, humanity and justice.

  Read it. You'll be thankful.

I'm currently a little over halfway through and I don't quite agree with that endorsement, but it is a good piece of fiction that has made me think and laugh and be tense.

Also, I love the portrayal of Kid Win. (Despite that cheesy name.)
