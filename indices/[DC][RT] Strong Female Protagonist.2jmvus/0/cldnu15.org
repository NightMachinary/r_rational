I read this from start to end, and I my one problem is that it is not finished yet. It has a lot of stuff to like. There is this theme that heroes should change the whole world, but they cannot fix all the problems. They don't know how. They need to get smarter, better. Figure out the answer. But while they are busy getting smarter, there is actual suffering in the world that they need help with. So, what do you do? Do you use your power to make enough food to save 100 people from starvation every day, or do you spend years and years to finally end world hunger completely. How do you justify that to the 100 people who die that day because you are thinking long-term?

It doens't have answers yet, but I am really curious what it will come up with.
