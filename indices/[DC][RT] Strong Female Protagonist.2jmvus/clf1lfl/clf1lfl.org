I've been reading this +since before it was cool+ for a while now. About two weeks ago, it suddenly stopped rendering in Firefox -- the image just doesn't appear. I can read it fine in Chrome or Safari, though. I've emailed the author about the issue with no response.

Does anyone else have this issue?
