  the human brain doesn't have enough power to simulate it's own body and its share of the communal environment let alone have anything left over to harvest.

Multiple human brains have identical structure and input. As in, thousands or tens of thousands. Brains that deviate are liquidated. Only one simulated reality for all those brains.

To expand on some ideas: animals don't sleep in reality. The machines lie and trick human minds into accepting fifty percent apparent unconsciousness. The ratio isn't skewed further because human brains that go without a simulated existence for a greater fraction of time degrade from not exercising the parts irrelevant to the machines computations.
