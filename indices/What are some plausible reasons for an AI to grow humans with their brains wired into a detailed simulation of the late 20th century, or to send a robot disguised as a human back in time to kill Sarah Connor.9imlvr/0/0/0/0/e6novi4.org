  They only appear to be as intelligent as us because a large chunk of their capabilities are used to maintain The Matrix while they're plugged into it, and unplugged humans are all geniuses.

What if time in the Matrix passes a lot slower than it does in the real world, so that part of a bluepill's brain can live in the Matrix at a normal intelligence but a slower rate of experience, while the rest is used to feed the CPU pool? This also allows someone to potentially hack the Matrix so that they retain their brainpower and experience the Matrix at a slower rate? (giving you better reflexes in the Matrix, but not the ability to dodge bullets unless the time difference were extreme enough.)
