The Matrix was explicitly lobotomized because the money people thought the actual script was too hard for the stupid masses to understand. Originally, the humans were processor farms. The machines didn't care about the people as people, other than that they had to do something with the consciousnesses of the bodies or they died. That's the bit in the 2nd movie that the Architect is talking about, how the first Matrix failed. But the point is that after the humans blocked out the sky, the machines had power but not enough resources to make more machines. So the body farms are actually /running/ the Matrix simulation and all the machines' other processing needs.

The power idea is literally the dumbest way they could have replaced that though, considering that you'd get more energy out of just burning whatever it is you feed to the humans.

This idea was used in the later books of the Hyperion Cantos by Dan Simmons. (spoiler It wasn't that humans were specifically good processors, but that they were creative in ways that the machines couldn't replicate. )

As for Skynet, it's paradox. Had Skynet not sent the Terminator back, John Connor would never have become the leader of the resistance, and thus never sent Kyle Reese back, and thus never been born. But had he NOT, then Cyberdyne would never have found the remains of the first T800, which they reverse engineered in to the chips that became Skynet in the first place. Even after adjusting the loop by destroying the chips and arm and Arnie in T2, the data was still existing as we found in the 3rd movie.

So the rational reason Skynet sends the T800 back in time in the first place is not to kill John Connor specifically, but to keep the loop going. The original instance could be as described by Kyle, with Skynet gaining sentience based only on 1980s technology, but after that it becomes much more streamlined and powerful with the iterative access to the future. Send a T800 back, watch the timelines, Cyberdine refines the tech which increases Skynet's power from its inception. Every time Skynet loops, the tech it is founded on gets incrementally better.
