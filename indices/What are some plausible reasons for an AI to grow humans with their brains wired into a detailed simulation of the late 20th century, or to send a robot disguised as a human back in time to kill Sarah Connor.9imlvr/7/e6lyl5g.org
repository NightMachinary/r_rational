A human addicted to a smartphone cookie-clicker is about the closest thing we have to a paperclip maximizer today...between VR wearables, haptics, and voice-activated smart assistants, we're investing trillions each year in our accidental quest to become cyborgs.

If you make the small leap of adding a direct brain interface to the screens, cameras, audio, and touch interfaces of future computing devices, the incentive to provide more dopamine rushes and get more money can easily lead to devices and software that share 'computation' power with the human brain to which they are attached. Developers are already using procedurally-generated content, deep-learning-augmented NPCs and opponents, and other AI-like tools to keep people addicted. It could only take one runaway success to turn the human race into a pile of computronium collectively trying to make some imaginary numbers go up (see also OP's edit).

Malevolent machines didn't decide to put people into a 20th-century simulation. An existing industry, following existing incentives, eventually built a hyperstimulating self-improving version of The Sims and everybody went there willingly.

In other news completely unrelated to evil industries bent on extracting money from addicts, EA's CEO had a fascinating [[https://www.theverge.com/a/verge-2021/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-interview-virtual-video-games][interview with The Verge]] from 2016 regarding the future of gaming. This particular bit seems like a statement that they're pretty nearly trying to create this very situation:

  /Now fast-forward that to the future... it's really easy to imagine that games would permeate our lives ... From the minute I get up in the morning, everything I do has an impact on my gaming life... The amount of eggs I have in my internet-enabled fridge might mean my Sims are better off in my game.... If I go to soccer practice in the afternoon, by virtue of internet-enabled soccer boots, that might give me juice or new cards in my FIFA product. This world where games and life start to blend I think really comes into play in the not-too-distant future, and almost certainly by 2021./

Regarding your second (unrelated?) question, John Connor was somehow pivotal in destroying the incentive structure, instituting regulations against, and/or preventing the implementation of this system.
