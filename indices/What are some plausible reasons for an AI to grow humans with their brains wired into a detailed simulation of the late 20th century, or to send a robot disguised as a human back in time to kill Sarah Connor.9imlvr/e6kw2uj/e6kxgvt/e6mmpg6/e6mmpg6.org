This implies that human brains are much more powerful than what we're used to in the real world. They only appear to be as intelligent as us because a large chunk of their capabilities are used to maintain The Matrix while they're plugged into it, and unplugged humans are all geniuses. From there I'd suggest that the original late 20th century was a utopia, and uploading people into it was intended to permanently maintain that utopia, but it doesn't function properly with everyone distracted by maintaining the simulation. The AI that maintains it is tasked with maintaining the plan, not maximizing happiness.

This is consistent with observations (if we assume the reader is already in The Matrix instead of being one of the people who eventually builds it), and gives us an excuse for a cast of hyper-intelligent characters.
