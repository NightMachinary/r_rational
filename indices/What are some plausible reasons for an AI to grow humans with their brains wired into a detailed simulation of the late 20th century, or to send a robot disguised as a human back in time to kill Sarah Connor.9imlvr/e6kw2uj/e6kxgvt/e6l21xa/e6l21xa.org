  [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU][The original proposal for The Matrix had]] the machines keep humans in the matrix in order for their brains to act as a great neural network. (Without taking the brains out of their bodies, note: the rest of the film would have been the same as what we got.) This of course makes far more sense than the physics-defying "power generation" explanation given in the completed film, but it was apparently changed because the studio thought the original reason would be too hard to understand.
