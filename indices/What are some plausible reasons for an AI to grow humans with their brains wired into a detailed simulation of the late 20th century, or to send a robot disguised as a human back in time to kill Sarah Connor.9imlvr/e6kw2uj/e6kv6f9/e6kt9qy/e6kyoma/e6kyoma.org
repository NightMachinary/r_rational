This rational Terminator story wouldn't have a Kyle Reese to save her, the only thing saving her is that Skynet due to lack of information expected only 1 Sarah Connor in the city, but there are 3. The Terminator kills 2 of them in alphabetic order, the 3rd Sarah realizes the pattern and begins fighting for her life.

Thank you for the fic recommendation! I will look it up on the interwebs.
