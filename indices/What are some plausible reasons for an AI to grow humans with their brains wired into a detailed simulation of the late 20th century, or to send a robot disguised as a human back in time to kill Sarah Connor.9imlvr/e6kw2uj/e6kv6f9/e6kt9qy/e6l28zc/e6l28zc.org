  it pseudorandomly picks Sarah Connor from a list of names and sends a robot back in time to kill her, for the simple purpose of experimenting with time travel

This seems like a really bad way to experiment with time travel. Skynet would surely realize that depending on the outcome of the experiment, it might completely wipe away the timeline where Skynet exists. It makes a lot more sense to set up small-scale experiments between two times, where it is in control and prepared for the experiment at both times.
