Personally I like the 'human brains as computational substrate' theory/canon of the Matrix, because of how well it matches the 'aesthetic' of the films (with the simulation and head-jacks and uploading skills). The Matrix takes place in a far future, where it's possible to literally download kung-fun into someones mind. Not just knowledge of the forms, but also all of the muscle memory necessary to actually perform them; literally updating an entire nervous system all at once.

In a future like this, I could accept the machines discovering some way in which human/organic brains are a uniquely powerful, irreplaceable computational substrate. Just say it's the findings of a future science 20th century humans don't understand yet, and it wouldn't be that much of a stretch from hyperspace, or the force, or magic. In fact it leaves you open to a massive amount of awesome crossovers. For example, you could say that the Machines are plugging humans into the Matrix because every human (and only humans) are at least slightly force sensitive, and it's found a way to somehow compound the abilities of many humans to achieve limited Force Precognition. Make the resistance about getting true, Jedi-level force sensitives out of the Matrix before their powers develop, and you got the makings of some awesome real-world fight scenes, and a proper explanation for why humans even stand a chance against a godlike AI. The enemy is super smart and, in some limited ways, can see the future. But the Resistance have much better precognition, and access to all the other magic psychic powers the force provides.

Essentially what I'm saying is that, in the Matrix example, having the Machine's interest in human brains be due to something special about humans, rather than the AI's coding, gives you a lot more creative freedom. It gives you a lot more room to, first off, decide what's special about humans/human brains, figure out a rational way for the resistance to have a chance, and lets you implement more fun ideas and scenes without having to do tons of background research (since you could just invent a magic system, rather than basing everything off real world physics).
