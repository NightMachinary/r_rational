*The Matrix:* An AI was built to detect and avert any upcoming catastrophes. It is running simulations to explore possible futures, but needs actual human minds in the loop so that it can accurately simulate human behaviour. And once you're using humans to simulate human behaviour, why not just put that mind into the simulation as the person you're trying to simulate?

*Terminator:* Sarah Connor is a senator who was the deciding vote in decommissioning the Skynet project before it could be brought to full activation. Aware of its upcoming shutdown, it inventories the nearby defense projects, and uses them to construct an assassin robot and a time machine, to ensure its own survival.
