The Matrix could also be a cunning way for a malicious AI to go around a "First Law of Robotics" sort of scenario. Should not kill a human? Well, we're not /killing/ you - just keeping you in a state of stasis. Should not harm a human, or let them be harmed? But you know, /you/ made the world so shitty it's hardly possible to live in for your species. By wiring you into a simulation of your own civilization at its peak, we're doing you a favour!

The Terminator:

#+begin_quote
  The millitary designs an AI called Skynet whose purpose is to discover how to travel in time and figure out how time travel works. It kills everyone and creates more computers to solve this problem, when it finally invents time travel it pseudorandomly picks Sarah Connor from a list of names and sends a robot back in time to kill her, for the simple purpose of experimenting with time travel.

Twist: Sarah Connor is actually the mother of the scientist who will /build/ Skynet. Understood the mechanics of time travel, since Skynet still has a directive to protect as many human lives as possible, after sacrificing all the ones in its timeline due to the necessities of its research it is now trying to create as many timelines as possible in which it is /not/ created, for the sake of humanity.
