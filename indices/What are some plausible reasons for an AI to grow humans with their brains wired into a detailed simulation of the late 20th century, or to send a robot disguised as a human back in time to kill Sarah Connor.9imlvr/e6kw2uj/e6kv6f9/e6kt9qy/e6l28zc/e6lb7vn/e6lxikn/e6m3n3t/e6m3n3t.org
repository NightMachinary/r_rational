I really like this idea. An AI that is trying to model humans but is aware that any flaws in its assumptions of them could blow up into large measurement errors would be incentivized to grow actual humans where it doesn't have to make any of those assumptions and just let physics and biology take care of it. And then it attempts to raise them in a "natural" environment so they develop psychologically similar to the humans it's trying to model.
