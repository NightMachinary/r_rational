Matrix:

1. Art, creativity, and other qualities human brains may possess that the limited AI running everything don't possess themselves.
2. The AI are unsure about whether there are other AI in the universe. The Matrix AI want all humans imprisoned but fear hypothetical alien AI that attack AIs that treat AI-creators unkindly.
3. The movie very similar to The Matrix was created in the past of the Matrix universe. It is the favorite movie of the AIs that were created in said universe and they thought it would be badass to recreate. (This is kinda the plot of Illium except with the Trojan War)
4. The true AI leaders of the Matrix are actually cylon-like androids that are indistinguishable from humans. The cast of the Matrix are all cylons that decided it would be hilarious to stage a revolution against their own system.

Terminator:

1. Skynet suspects that there is an extremely small but non-zero percent chance that Sarah Connor may have set up plans or safeguards to destroy Skynet at some point in the far future even after the entire rebellion has been wiped out. Skynet has simulated every possible method it can think of, but knows that it can't necessarily think if every method Sarrah Connor alongside her comrades could think of. It therefore sends a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah Connor before any hypothetical plan could be carried out.

2. Skynet won but it isn't happy with the full outcome of the situation. Nuclear bombs went off all over the place, all sorts of things it cares about were destroyed, and the humans used burnt land tactics so often that half the planet is ruined. Skynet wants to get its cake and eat it too so it sends a Terminator into the past to ensure a more fruitful victory this time around.
