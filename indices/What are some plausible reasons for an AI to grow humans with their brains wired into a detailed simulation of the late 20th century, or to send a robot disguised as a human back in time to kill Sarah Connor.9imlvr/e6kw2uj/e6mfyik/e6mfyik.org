Doesn't actually work any better than the energy idea however, as the human brain doesn't have enough power to simulate it's own body and its share of the communal environment let alone have anything left over to harvest.

Brains are also highly specialized so unless your task is "operate a human" a human brain isn't very efficient at performing it as it either has a lot of wasted wetware (if your problem is say image recognition, all that motor control stuff is eating calories for no gain) or lacks native support for the task (massive floating point matrix calculations). A hypothetical human brain trained for some other task from birth would possibly be good at that task but it'd be unable to operate a human (because you trained it on some otehr task instead of connecting it to a human body as that was the point of the exercise) so you wouldn't get it participating in the matrix simulation.
