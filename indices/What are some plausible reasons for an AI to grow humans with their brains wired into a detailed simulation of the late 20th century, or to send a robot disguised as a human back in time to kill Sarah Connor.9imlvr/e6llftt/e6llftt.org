There's honestly very few instrumental reasons to keep vegetative humans in a simulation like that. Generating power is obvious nonsense, and so is "using the human brain for processing power" - there's almost no way that that would be a sensible path realistically.

We can only conclude that the AI was programmed to to maximize a function which the creators did not fully intend, which involves making humans experience the late 20th century...which is to say, that the AI forces the humans to experience that not because it can then exploit the humans for some personal gain to put towards another goal, but because it inherently /wants/ the humans to be experiencing that, as a terminal value.

One might imagine a backstory in which the AI is programmed and something goes wrong in the process of teaching it which values it is meant to maximize. For instance maybe the AI was "trained" in the 20th century and they tried to teach to maximize for human achieving the fulfillment of their values via observing its surroundings but instead they accidentally selected for "maximizing for humans experiencing the 20th century".
