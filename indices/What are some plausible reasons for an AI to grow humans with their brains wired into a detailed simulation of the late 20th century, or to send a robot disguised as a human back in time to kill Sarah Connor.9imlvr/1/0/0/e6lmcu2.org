They are neither of them, especially Terminator, good enough to treat any other way. Very few, vanishingly few, "science fiction" movies are. Even if the scriptwriter is competent, there are too many other fingers in the pot.

Even "The Martian", possibly the only actual "hard SF" movie ever, has problems. It should have cut out everything from Watney's launch from Mars to the epilogue.
