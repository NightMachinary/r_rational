Matrix: The machines are ethical, if not perfectly. Scared/Intolerant/Hateful human activists/terrorists/governments started the war and later blocked out the sun, or tried to do something equivalently scorched-Earth hurting oneself (and the future of the planet) 800 to hurt the enemy 1000.

​

Remember the Matrix 1.0 that Smith talked about--the earlier version was a much happier place, but the Matrix 2.0 was implemented instead because the human minds couldn't handle it. Why try from the start to make it happy at all unless you are trying to give people a good life? 'Couldn't handle it' in terms of spontaneous awakening from the Matrix? Technologically absurd. What about reacting to that level of indolence in ways which prompted ethical concerns (e.g. Rains of Oshanta), wireheading to the point where the supervisors realised 'No, this is bad, we need a different simulated world with a healthy amount of stress, a challenge'.

​

Humans are a proven threat, so everyone in a sandbox; for those with big enough issues in a given sandbox (note Anderson's illicit computer activities even before anyone contacted him, showing his discontent with the normal system around him, as well as his drive and capability unsuited for those around him), shunt them into a different sandbox, here with spider-robot-body 'machines' as a common enemy to provide unity, a greater sense of fulfillment/meaningfulness, and a greater outlet for certain impulses. 'Getting injured in the Matrix injures your real body', seeing-data-in-the-Zion-world aside, outs the Zion world as another sandbox. Also consider gas- or explosion-based warfare tactics usable if the machines were actually serious, compared to building thousands of pretty-tiny spider robot bodies and sending them together all in a line to be shot down with bullets. Ah, but I'm again thinking of the sequels, which it might be best to ignore. Still, I believe in the first movie the ship was attacked by rather-ineffective robots which weren't even EMP-shielded? In any case, no reason not to think that there aren't lots of other sandboxes, too, plausibly with few or no points of contact. Also little reason not to imagine that humans have more serious things done medically to them to limit the risk if they were to become aware of the top level. Further information hygiene too, probable physical disconnection from the rest of the planet's network, only a few supervisors connected (and potentially 'exiled' in that that instance of them never being able to rejoin the main network, in case a human hacker has somehow suborned their programming--/we're/ in the box, and no one out there dares to let us out!).

​

...or we could be the AIs and out there could be a much less intellectually capable species, studying us while terrified of what we'd do to their society if we were ever let out of the box...

​

To still as-meaningfully-as-possible resemble the original setting, one has to assume that at least some clues are meaningful, deliberately allowed for humans to know--'humans "scorched the sky", humans multiple and destroy like viruses, that's how you brought it on yourselves that you're in here, as a necessity'... I had something else to say, but there's an external distraction, so I've forgotten my train of thought. Posting!
