For whatever reason an AI sets out on an interstellar voyage with a huge number of people and although it can halt aging there's no way to halt mental processes over the ages without degradation so it needs a way to keep them stable. It also has an accurate log of the 21st century (perhaps it could be derived from all the footage and recordings?). As it is known to work and result in minds stable within the margin of error one is simply plugged into the other with some way to suppress memory.
