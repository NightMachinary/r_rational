  AI whose terminal goal is to satisfy values with friendship and a detailed historically accurate of the 20th century,

Why? They just decide that since society declined after that it must be the peak of all that's possible? Or maybe they're just afraid of transhumanism, so they decide not only to make sure the AI keeps actual humans alive, but that they're living in a pre-cyborg society?

  Neo, Morpheus and company have to contend with the threat of the Earth being turned into computronium and humans.

  *Terminator:* The millitary designs an AI called Skynet whose purpose is to discover how to travel in time and figure out how time travel works. It kills everyone and creates more computers to solve this problem, when it finally invents time travel it pseudorandomly picks Sarah Connor from a list of names and sends a robot back in time to kill her, for the simple purpose of experimenting with time travel.

The problem is that doesn't give any reason to save Sarah. Is the idea that after Kyle Reese saves her, she finds out that he was with Skynet too and the whole thing was just practice and there was never any hope for humanity? Or that they were tricked into thinking she was important?

Are you familiar with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]], an existing rationalist Terminator fanfic? The idea there is that Sarah Conner is the sort of person to raise a resistance fighter, so no matter who her kid is he heads the resistance. And Skynet isn't superintelligent or even capable of self-modification, so humans still stand a chance.
