A scientist rarely can beat many people with his personal invention. Gun builders and gun users are often different people. Scientists also need tonnes of resources and someone to feed them while they spend time doing science. Magic on the other hand is as if most (if not every) technological advance can only be used by people who understand exactly how it works, while also being dirt cheap and having low hanging fruits galore (or at least I think it is supposed to be easier for an isolated mage to learn how to fly than it is for an isolated human to build a plane without ever having been near one).

Still maybe not enough for a revolution but you can't just compare it to science.
