Let me try a thought experiment and do a find/replace here...

#+begin_quote
  Let's assume an Effective Science/tech exists in a technologically medieval or below setting. The exact efficiency of science/tech may differ, but follows these laws:

  1) Science/tech can be worked to do wide range of desired effects. Not everything is possible, but a lot of things are, and with training you can get exactly those results you wanted. Also, unlike special powers, science/tech can (and need to) be trained.

  2) Science/tech can be worked with minor gestures/words/thoughts on the spot. Long expensive studies with thousands scientists helps to achieve something grand, but is by no means necessary for everyday, relatively minor stuff.

  3) Science/tech is very combat-efficient, especially in the hands of trained scientist. Experienced scientists/tech can beat at least tens of soldiers.

  4) There are no significant drawbacks to science/tech, and no "artificial" limiting mechanics (like constant total power for Nasuverse or other stuff forcing Masquerade).

  5) Science/tech is rare talent showing randomly and isn't inheritable (otherwise normal humans would be outcompeted in reproduction very fast, I think).

  With these conditions, is there any way for society to NOT be ruled by scientists? In my opinion, even if science/tech gets discovered in established society, things will go down like that:

  1) Science/tech users start to stir up society. They show feats on the battlefields and in common life. Fireballs/Guns/Grenades/Atomic Bombs start flying around, and they're reproducible. In 10 years max rulers are bound to notice that and start to be doing something much.

  2) Wise leaders will invite scientists in their power structure. Science/tech Guilds will rise and quickly (several decades) gain power. Societies not recognizing or persecuting scientists will be at significant disadvantage in any military or even business (if science/tech is applicable) conflict.

  3) Second-generation scientists, less loyal to King and more to the Guild of peers take charge. Conflicts of interests are bound to arise. I think scientists will have significant advantage with all their extra abilities and relative unity (less amount of agents means easier to cooperate)

  4) Soon some scientist will stage a rebellion, or assassination, or coup d'etat. Even if it fails, next attempt will come soon, and is bound to succeed with all extra abilities in possession of scientists.

  Voila, scientocracy! In my opinion, it won't even take 100 years for scientists to overtake most of the world.

  TL;DR: I think Efficient Scientists will overtake most of the world in less than 100 years. Do you (dis)agree and why?

No, I don't think it follows. Scientists have a lot of pull and influence, but it takes more than a special skillset of knowledge, I.Q., or ingenuity to become a "scientocracy"
