It depends on the specifics of the magic; many magic systems have gamebreakers that just completely warp the world around them to the point where it almost doesn't matter who's using the magic or how. Assuming that this is /not/ the case, and trained mages are roughly equivalent to heavily armed special forces or artillery weapons ...

My first thought is that we already have non-heritable power structures in the real world. A historical analog might be the Catholic Church, which was composed entirely of men and women who were not born into it.

Here's the basic problem that's going to face any Guild of Mages: where does unity come from? There is certainly the threat of violence from brother mages, but that's negative reinforcement, which is enough to sustain an organization but generally doesn't tend to be enough to make an organization flourish, especially not to the point where it might attempt some large coordinated effort like a coup.

One of the big variables is how efficient mage detection is. If mages can be swept from their homes as infants, indoctrination into the Guild can be done effectively, but if it doesn't present until the late teens, there's time for bonds with family, country, established power structures, etc. which weaken the bond to the Guild.

Because magic is not heritable, you also run into the problem of mages working against their legacy. Mages are going to have children and those children are not going to be mages. If a mage participates in a coup which favors mages, he's making a strictly temporary play for power which does nothing for his legacy. In other words, he has to care more about the legacy of mages than the legacy of his own bloodline. From a basic medieval start, that seems unlikely (or like something that a clever mage would have to craft a narrative around so other mages would care about magedom).

If I were king, I would likely head off rebellion by intermarriage with the mages. Assuming that I have any spare heirs, I can marry them off to mages in order to tighten ties to the Mage's Guild and make thoughts of a coup more complicated. I also keep the Mage's Guild physically close to me and involved in decision-making, similar to the way a medieval king might have a bishop as an adviser.
