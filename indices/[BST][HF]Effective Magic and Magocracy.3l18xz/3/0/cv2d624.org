If magic items can be created, they are based on rare resource and not easily available. There are orders of magnitude more magic performed by mages than by magic items.

Mind Control is optional. I think if it exists, Kings would be first victims because they lack magic protection. I'd say mental magic is difficult and while mages can read emotions and affect moods and may be use "suggestion", strong mind control isn't available.

I usually operate on assumption of 1 mage out of 1000 population. Let's say average mage power is in tens of soldiers, so hundred regiment led by proper commander can zerg-rush mage, break his defence and take him down with low casualties. Will Magocracy come to fruition in this conditions? Will it change if total magi firepower would be greater than non-magical one (1 mage can defeat 1000 humans)?
