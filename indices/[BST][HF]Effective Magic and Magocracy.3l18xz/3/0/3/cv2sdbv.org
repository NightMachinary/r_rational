If we are talking medieval population levels, local lords won't have that kind of fire power. It's going to take a middling lord to even rule over 1000 people. Depending on what exact time period and where on the European continent, towns/cities are going to have almost all of the magi. And they are going to belong to the fledging middle class. So they are going to be merchants, and also they are not going to be under lordly control. That's why cities were so novel. They had their own walls, and weren't owned by lords. In some cases they paid lump sums to the king to get out of future taxes.
