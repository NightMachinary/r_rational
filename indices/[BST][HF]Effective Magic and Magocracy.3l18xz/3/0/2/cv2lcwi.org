And royalty and the rich will gather those rare magical items for themselves to give themselves a tactical advantage.

I imagine mages would be able to give kings magical protection, and loyal mages would be hired to do so.

If mages can be zerg rushed than that means that any town they terrorize can be disabled, any wizard monarch can be slain if a culture doesn't want a mage lord. If they can defeat 1000 population then they can, with hit and run attacks, disable any military force. If any mages want to win, and some will, there's nothing mundanes can do to stop them.

So it depends on the balance of power. Is the mightiest nation the one with the most mages? The one with the most troops? If more mages= more power always then mages are going to have the dominant voice in society. What they want goes.

Until, say, something like what happened in MoL happens, and guns are invented which can cheaply slay mages.
