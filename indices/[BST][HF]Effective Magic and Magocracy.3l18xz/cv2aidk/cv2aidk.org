It depends on the durability of enchantments. If magi can set up invincibility charms and have them on 24/7/365 then you have a different world as opposed to one where magic needs to be sustained.

In a world that needs things to be sustained, people will assassinate magi who get too uppity. "No matter how powerful the wizard, a knife between the shoulder blades will really cramp his style."

On the other hand, I suspect that magi have the same distribution of interests as humans, meaning that the vast majority won't be interested in ruling. When one of them starts a revolution, other magi can be hired to put it down.

So, if you want a world not ruled by magi, here are some ways it could happen:

1. Mage conquerors get shot in the head with a crossbow while sitting on the loo.
2. Mage conquerors get taken down by other magi hired by the conquered people.
3. Magi are rare enough that the entire spectrum of human employment desires is not represented and "go into politics" is one of the things that isn't.
4. Many magi don't like the idea of magi being in charge because it sets up an environment that's bad for research, or it turns normals against magi and makes it hard to have a quiet drink at your local, or etc. As a result, if any mage tries to steal power, others show up to stop him.

Probably others, but that's what I get offhand.
