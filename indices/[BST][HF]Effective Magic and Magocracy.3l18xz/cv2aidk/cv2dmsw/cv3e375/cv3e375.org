Here's where I don't fully agree. In many ancient cultures and/or smaller fiefdoms strength of arms and the ability to fight were still a factor important enough to not be eclipsed by wealth alone. Yet there have been many warriors more loyal to their crippled/infirm/child lord than to some disloyal warrior who wanted to take over. Magic capabilities seem just like a more extreme version of that to me. So that Archmage could quickly find himself magically shackled and get a magic missile pushed down his throat in the town square in front of the totally mundane king Wilfred II, grandson of the conqueror Merlin I the Everburning or whatever.
