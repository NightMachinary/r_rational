I do not want the world not ruled by magi. I do not want the world ruled by them either. There are tons of excuses for any position, they are anywhere. I want to know people opinion on how would world look like, if some people are granted this power while staying human otherwise.

As an experiment, imagine if you're playing RPG game against [[/u/alexanderwales]] . He's a King, interested in building strong kingdom and eventually leaving power to your heir. You're the Archmage, influental in the Guild (perhaps not the leader, but on the High Council). You seriously disagree with the King on several domestic and international policies, and consider successful rebellion worthy endeavor. What are your chances of rising to power, against the chances of getting executed for treason?

Some additional thoughts:

1) I'd say other members of a Council are willing to listen. They have their own worries (would prefer lower rates on magical ore and less community work) and consider you a peer, while King is kinda "outsider".

2) While current Dynasty ruled for several generations, change of ruling family isn't uncommon in the world. Preventing your rise to power isn't terminal utility function for anyone besides Royal Family.
