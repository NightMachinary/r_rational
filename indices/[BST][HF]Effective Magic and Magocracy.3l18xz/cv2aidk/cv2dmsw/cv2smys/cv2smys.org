The simple answer? If I am patient, I enchant his heir at birth and/or replace it with a magical homoculus that acts as a person. Then wait. This also assumes that I have life enhancing abilities. If there are no defenses against it, just plain old mind control the king and subtly move towards my positions while publicly going against me so that the other members of the council don't notice. That can also be accomplished with a suggestion spell. The reason I don't mention trying to replace the king entirely is that it seems impossible that there would be /no/ defenses against that whatsoever. Replacing him (a la polyjuice and the like) would lead to issues of Clark/Superman. Having a cloned body do so might be possible. Politic-ing the council into staging a coup is the way it works in real life, and well that sometimes works rather well. Something like an unbreakable vow to keep everyone from defecting, perhaps with a subtle trick in the wording to enslave the others might help.
