How is this not an x-men situation, except without the random crazy power differentials (and power creep because comics)? "Witches" were already persecuted in medieval times when they didn't even exist.

Like with x-men, whether or not you'd get a proper revolution/war/whatever depends on the ratios. Too few in the population and they'll never meet, recognize each other, and organize anything. Somewhat more and they'll still lose to feudal lords who view them as a threat. Lots and they'll succeed, sure, but it wouldn't be an easy rule. People don't like people who are different, especially if they have abilities they don't understand. Any mage ruling openly would likely need to exercise extreme control through fear and violence. If someone did it successfully, it would more likely be with a puppet ruler. But that's inconvenient in a lot of ways, and makes mages "taking over the world" in some kind of conspiracy when the fastest means of communication is horse very unlikely.

I think it'd make an interesting setting for a solid if mostly derivative story, but no magocracy.
