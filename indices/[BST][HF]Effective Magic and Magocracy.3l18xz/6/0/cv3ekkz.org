The difference is that witches /didn't/ exist. If there had actually been people who can reliably and predictably fly, curse cattle, heal or cause diseases, speak with spirits or mind control people I bet you that someone would have made very good use of that and that over time the pro-witch people would dominate history compared to the anti-witch ones. Not to mention that crusaders would have had a much harder time conquering and converting witch-based pagan areas.
