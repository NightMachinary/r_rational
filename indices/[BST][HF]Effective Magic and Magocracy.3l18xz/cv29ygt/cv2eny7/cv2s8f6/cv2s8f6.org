Perhaps, like Worm magic users will be the targets of assassinations and early deaths? Personally I agree, one of the first jobs of a reasonable magic user is to secure their own life and limb,through shields, teleports, necromancy, whathaveyou etc. But it is possible depending on the system that magical assassinations become easier than hiding/protecting oneself. It's not like a middling mage can hire mages, nor can human body guards always suffice, and you have to sleep.
