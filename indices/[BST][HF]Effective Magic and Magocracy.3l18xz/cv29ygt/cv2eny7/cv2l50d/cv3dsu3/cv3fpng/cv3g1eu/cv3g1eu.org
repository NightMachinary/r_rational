That would either be overcome or make mages go extinct pretty quickly, no? I mean incompatibility would also plague two copulating quasi-mages of the wrong kind, thus making the chance of the magic gene propagating at all that much smaller.

Maybe you would get something like area-bound magic "races". but I'm pretty sure that two different magic complexes wouldn't ever dominate the same area except after mass migrations. Oh and racism would probably be high as fuck.

Hmm, maybe if you make a gene that gives you a (small) chance of having magical /offspring/ but make the actual mages themselves sterile due to effects of magic on puberty or something.
