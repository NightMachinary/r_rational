It's a reasonable concern, and if it were dependent on merely a single recessive gene even the most dense people would figure it out in a hurry.

On the other hand, if it were to depend on a particular complex of genes all being in one of a few specific configurations for it to work, it would be essentially random unless you had the right theories and some heavy math to tease the pattern out.

That still allows for a slight degree of heritability, but no guarantees even if both parents are mages, and also opens up interesting possibilities for "near mages" that have incomplete or ["broken mages" that have] incompatible magic complexes.
