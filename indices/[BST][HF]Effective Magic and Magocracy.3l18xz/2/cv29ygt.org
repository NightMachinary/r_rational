I have my doubts about the "non-inheritability", though it could be a combination of gene mutations which would make it look that way to a low tech society for many generations.

That would also mean that it would take thousands of years for the survival benefits to significantly increase the rate of mages, which gives us your scenario for long enough to be interesting.
