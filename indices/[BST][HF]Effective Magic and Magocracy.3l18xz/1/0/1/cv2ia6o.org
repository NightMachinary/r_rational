90% confident that my descendants maintain real power in the face of mages. Of course, there are other internal and external threats to the monarchy which significantly lower the chance that they'll be ruling monarchs.

The thing is, I can keep my finger on the pulse of the mages. /Most of the time/ they're going to come to me or my children with requests or demands instead of just jumping straight to a coup. And if I'm marrying mages into the royal line from time to time (especially the really ambitious ones) then I'm already granting them a certain level of power. Most of my uncertainty comes from the risk of my descendants doing something stupid, which has historically been the cause of bloodlines ending.

To add to that, if the mages /do/ successfully stage a coup, I'm not at all confident that /they'll/ be around in another two or three generations, because I think a non-hereditary power structure (especially a medieval one) is going to be more fragile than a hereditary one.

Edit: Just to back this up, here's a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_coups_d%27%C3%A9tat_and_coup_attempts#1000.E2.80.931699][list of coups in the medieval era]] and a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revolutions_and_rebellions#1000.E2.80.931499][list of revolutions and rebellions]]. They weren't very common; I suspect that the existence of mages would raise the odds, but not by that much, since many of the same pressures would apply.
