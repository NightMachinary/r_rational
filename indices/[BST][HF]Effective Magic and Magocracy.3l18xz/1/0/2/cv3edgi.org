  About the unity - medieval people united heavily around their crafts, and Effective Magic certainly qualifies for that.
#+end_quote

That unity would probably exist. But did it really outweigh allegiance to religion, family /and/ monarch all that often.

  several competing Guilds sounds like a possibility, but wouldn't they have a strong incentive to form a syndicate of sorts?
#+end_quote

An incentive yes. But nowhere is it guaranteed that said incentive outweighs the very reasons there are separate mage guilds in the first place. Things like ideology, familial ties, loyalty to bloodlines and/or real estate and what have you.

Also keep in mind that being a mage doesn't necessarily make you any more educated or rational. If there isn't an Owl's Wisdom or Fox's Cunning spell then they won't be much more coherent than knights from different regions in the same kingdom were.

Regarding the comparison to craftsmen I want to ask: Is magic this unified whole that you train as one or would a master combat pyromancer require a wholly different training than a city stoneshaper, an agricultural weathermage or a court diviner? Because in that case mage guilds and disciplines may not even feel like they have that much in common. Not to mention that the rarity and typical guild secrecy would probably lead to various areas having very different types of mages at first.
