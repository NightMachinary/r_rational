Just a quick note about guilds:

Guilds existed for a lot of the same reason that unions and cartels do.

- If you and I are both glassworkers, it makes sense for us to engage in some price-fixing so that we can drive prices up.
- If we hold a bunch of instructional capital, it makes sense for us to agree to extort hopeful apprentices into taking a raw deal.
- It makes sense for us to make it prohibitively expensive for glassworker number three to set up shop; we can accomplish this by talking to the people we buy raw materials from and threatening a loss of business if they don't go along with freezing out the newcomer.
- Alternately, we can just extort glassworker number three by coughing and mumbling something about guild dues (otherwise we do the above freeze-out). This makes our guild grow by one, which gives us more weight.
- Together we can go to the mayor and say, "Hey, you should pass a law that lets only the two of us do glasswork in the city, look at all this value we provide by working in harmony with each other and keeping up standards, etc."

This all makes us allies, but not friends. Once our guild has grown, it exists partially so that we can keep each other in line. A glassworker breaks ranks? We bash his fucking face in! ... or at least impose severe sanctions to the point where he's going to have to leave town or find a new trade, which we can do because either our guild has kingly authority, or we have economic muscle, or both.

Now, this is a rather pessimistic view of guilds/cartels/unions. They also do other things, like allowing for cumulative funds for larger projects that benefit everyone (guildhalls) and allow the guild members to lean on each other in various ways (pension/widow funds). But I would still argue that one of the primary functions of the guild, even at its most positive, is to provide stability and stasis, which is more or less the opposite of what a coup attempt is.

(There are some differences between artisans and mages that are probably relevant. Mages don't require raw materials, large spaces, or special tools, which reduces some of the benefit that the guild might provide. Mages are born into the trade, which means that control of the instructional capital is more difficult. If a mage without guild training can still make more money with magic than doing anything else, she's going to do magic without the guild's involvement, which weakens the guild or requires an expenditure of their resources. Quite a bit of the outcome depends on the specifics of the guild and its laws.)
