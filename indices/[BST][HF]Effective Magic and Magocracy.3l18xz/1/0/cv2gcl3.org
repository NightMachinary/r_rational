Let's suppose that magic is mostly detectable in early teens, about 12-14 years old. About the unity - medieval people united heavily around their crafts, and Effective Magic certainly qualifies for that. Granted, there were a LOT of competing guilds, but I suppose there are much less Magi than artisans. Still, several competing Guilds sounds like a possibility, but wouldn't they have a strong incentive to form a syndicate of sorts?

Your measures are sound, but I'd like to hear your opinion on end result. How confident are you that your descendants after 2-3 generations will hold any real power in the kingdom? Percentile probability estimate could be very helpful, however inaccurate that is.
