  where does unity come from?
#+end_quote

I've got two quick answers:

1. Training, libraries and schools, guilds that hold skill share workshops on a regular basis.

#+begin_quote
  Not everything is possible, but a lot of things are, and with training you can get exactly those results you wanted. Also, unlike special powers, magic can (and need to) be trained.
#+end_quote

It really depends on how essential training is, what form it takes, and how much you can get done without it. If mage vs. mage combat is common, /no one/ wants to be the guy who didn't go to mage school.

2. Then there's this:

#+begin_quote
  Long expensive rituals with thousands casters chanting helps to achieve something grand
#+end_quote

If any of these grand projects would be both beneficial to all users and not something that could be achieved with less people, then that's an incentive to group up.

--------------

I have no idea if these would be /enough/ incentive, or what kinds of institutions would form, but those could be your positive incentives for mages to unite.

And once united, you get ingroup/outgroup dynamics. And someone will come up with the idea that having magic is better for a person than not, therefore mages are literally better than everyone else, therefore /we/ ought to be running things, not the muggles.
