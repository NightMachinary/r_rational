I didn't mean total unity, just relative compared to general population. If there's 5 million people in a kingdom, and 1 out of 1000 can be a mage, there are only 5000 potential mages. These guys theoretically can hold a meeting, and each of them can be acquaintances with like 10% of other magi. There is no need for all of them to be focused on getting power. Several hundred may be interested in power, half of the others may want something out of potential Magocracy, and the rest could very well be left to their own devices. On the contrary, magi don't really get anything out of opposing other magi.
