On the other hand, let's consider some actual medieval demography for a moment. Spain and Portugal in 1350 had a population of about 5 million people, with roughly the same borders as they have today. Those 5,000 mages are /probably/ going to be distributed in accordance with a map of population density.

Our 5,000 mages will probably be intelligible to each other, but they're going to speak different languages, or different dialects of the same language. If we're looking at the Iberian peninsula in the 1300s, that's Galician, Portuguese, Asturo-Leonese, Castilian, Aragonese, Catalan, and Basque (also Arabic, but that's because of the Muslims, who I'm not counting). They're probably going to eat similar foods, but there are going to be variations within the region. There are going to be differences in fashion and culture within even a single kingdom, owing to the difficulties involved in travel.

Mages have unity only in that they can all do magic. In most other respects, those 5,000 mages are going to be strangers to each other. They will almost certainly not be related by blood. There are two things that unify mages; their trade and their king. In my opinion, that doesn't start out as being enough to make them into a unified force, especially one that's out to kick out one of those supporting legs. They might evolve as an institution over time, but every new mage that gets added into magedom is a stranger with no previous connections to the guild, except in a few rare circumstances.

Edit: Also, half of them will be female. Depending on the social assumptions, that would be an important factor.
