  I think magi will have significant advantage with relative unity (less amount of agents means easier to cooperate) ... Voila, magocracy!

I'm not sure how much of this is me thinking with tropes, but a unified magocracy seems pretty unlikely to me. Assuming you don't have any particularly Orwellian mage-detection or mage-compulsion systems, which must be out of scope for the question to make sense, mages who don't want power or attention can hide fairly effectively at this tech level.

Among those who are prominent or powerful... why would they be unified? If a mage betrays her ruler and seizes the throne, what's to stop the lieutenant doing the same? Maybe this is just a squabbling mages trope, but I would expect if they had no reason to hide you would find mages at or near the top of many power structures, not dominating a single superpower.

On the other hand... while I can't find it now, ^{^{deliberate}} ^{^{challenge}} there was a great lesswrong post about coordination between highly motivated people as a superpower. In real life, if there was a one in ten thousand genetic trait for selfless cooperation among carriers and lust for (collective) power, those people would absolutely rule the world.
