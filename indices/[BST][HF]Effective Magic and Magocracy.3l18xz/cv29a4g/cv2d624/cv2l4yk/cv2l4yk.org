Magic breaks rules, that's why that "tens of soldiers" rule falls apart. Choose the proper tactic and the number of enemy soldiers doesn't matter. No bows? Fly spell. Open plane? Invisibility. Maybe just turn into a cloud of smoke, or teleport away, or make a shell of stone around yourself (or hard crystal for some line-of-sight magic).
