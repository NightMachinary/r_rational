  I think if it exists, Kings would be first victims because they lack magic protection.

That would require there to be no loyalist mages. If magi occurring is relatively new (a few generations) there is no reason for that to be the case. Other than that humans tend to be wired to have their children be off as well as possible. So even a mage king would want his non-mage children to be in a position of power and would support the old structure of blood over skill by creating a loyal order of knight-magi or something.
