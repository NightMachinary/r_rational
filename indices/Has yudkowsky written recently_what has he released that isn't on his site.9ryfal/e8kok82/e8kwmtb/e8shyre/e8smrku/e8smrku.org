Honestly, if Yudowsky was serious about working on real world problems, then he at least has a perception problem and probably actually has a real problem. He doesn't have a PhD, and he's not working at a university. He's a genius, yes, but to have an impact in the academic world, and to have respect in his field outside of it... you kinda do at the very damn least have to have a PhD.
