I don't know what Yudowsky has been doing lately, which is somewhat saddening. I'd love to read more work by him, would buy any novels he wrote, etc. I'd be grateful if he even wrote up a "fantasy I've recently enjoyed, things I'm currently reading" - blogpost every so often. He's got a superior degree of reading taste.
