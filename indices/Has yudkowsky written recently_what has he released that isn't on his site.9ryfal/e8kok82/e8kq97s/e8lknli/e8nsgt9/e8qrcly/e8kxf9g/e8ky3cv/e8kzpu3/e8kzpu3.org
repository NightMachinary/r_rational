I seriously doubt it. Whoever wrote Waves Arisen is indeed a capable writer, but it's not Yudowsky. The writing style is very different. More technical, more mathematical, and utterly devoid of humor. I really don't think it's him. Yudowsky, in that reply, just seems to be entertained by the general situation, not being coy about that one story in particular.
