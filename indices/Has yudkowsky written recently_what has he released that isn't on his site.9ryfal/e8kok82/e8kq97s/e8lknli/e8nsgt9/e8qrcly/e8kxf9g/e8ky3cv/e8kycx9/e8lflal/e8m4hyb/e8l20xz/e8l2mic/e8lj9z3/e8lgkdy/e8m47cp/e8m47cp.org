I am of this opinion. There are sections of the Waves Arisen that, to me, are blatantly written by Eliezer. It's not even a question. But, these sections do not so much match the tone of the rest of the story. It's possible that Elizer wrote the whole thing, and only changed his tone for some parts, but it seems more likely that he just contributed to a work with someone else.
