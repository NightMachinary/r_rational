The style seems similar to me, and Yudowsky and write in more than one way. His Japanese light-novel style stories are pretty different from HPMOR for example. And what really makes it seem likely to me is that Wertifloke has not revealed anything about themself, I don't think many people would write a significantly popular online story and not take any credit for it. But that is something Yudowsky would do to see whether people think it's him.
