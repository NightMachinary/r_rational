I think this is a good point if you take Eliezer's comment at face value, but I thought he was being extravagent on purpose. I found Eliezer's response absolutely hilarious. Compare what he wrote to just saying "No I didn't write it". Way less fun.

For the note, I disagree with [[/u/Copiz][u/Copiz]], I'm pretty sure Eliezer put that in HPMOR as a "This is how to act slytherin". I see him acting this way in his comment because it doesn't really matter if people find it or not, and I don't expect him to act the same way in important situations such as in personal interactions or his occupation.
