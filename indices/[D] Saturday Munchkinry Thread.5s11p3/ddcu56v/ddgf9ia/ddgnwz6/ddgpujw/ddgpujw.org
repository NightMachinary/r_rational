A lot of time would be spent on figuring out the exact details of that boundary. In particular, there needs to be testing on what sort of intelligence sits on the other end of the "voice recognition". Is this a humanlike GM that might be annoyed if I try to munchkin this aspect of the power, and express it by giving less and less helpful information? If so, I might want to make this an interesting story and produce queries that lead to more interesting stories if they work. If it is based on simple rules, it can probably be munchkined in some way since [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/km6/why_the_tails_come_apart/][the tails diverge]].

Sample queries:

- JFK murderer, 10 minutes before he murders JFK, for 5 minutes.

- Last viewable olympic champion and the event that most demonstrates this ("V(last olympic champion)")

- V(fastest runner)

- V(smartest person)

- V(person most qualified for FAI, had they modern knowledge)

Perhaps try to insert clauses about not causing psychological harm to me.
