Meta question... what is the optimal level of Munchkinability? When is it most fun to munchkin? For example, I find when it is too easy to find a path to reality warping/omnipotence in a CYOA it is boring. When the powers are all super strictly limited though, it also makes things boring. When there are missions/drawbacks that make the path to omnipotence risky in an interesting way I find this funner. Or when you have to be really clever about exploiting and combining quirks of different powers to get a good combination that requires a bunch of conditions to take advantage of.
