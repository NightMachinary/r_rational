I think it's similar to humor, in that it's a feeling which is difficult to describe exactly, but unexpected and clever things are relevant. "An anonymous donor deposits one thousand dollars into your bank account every week, what do you do with this money?" is about as interesting a munchkinry as "A man hits another man on the head with a baseball bat" is as a joke.

It's the unexpected and nonobvious exploitations that are interesting and entertaining both for you to think of, and for other people to read about. Also, ones you haven't seen before. Using teleportation to earn money by shipping goods to far places quickly isn't interesting because we've already heard of it and/or thought of it, as it's one of the exploits that comes to mind immediately. But it could be more interesting if there are specific ideas like illegal goods, espionage, or emergency care (could you set up a 911 emergency base where you teleport people to the hospital and save lives? Would the millitary pay to rescue wounded soldiers by teleporting them?) For that matter, would the millitary pay you to teleport bombs to target locations?

More specific details that people haven't necessarily thought of before are more interesting, and it's also interesting when people who have specific knowledge about, say, the economics of these actions and how much value they could provide based on the actual mechanics of the power. You can learn something interesting about the real world in the context of a thought experiment.
