Well this isn't the optimum, more of a fun thing. I'd be tempted to search people who famously hid a treasure that was never found. The hard part would be fining a timestamp of when they hid it. I could at least look for any lost spanish treasure galleons that are still undiscovered, since we know the basic time period when they went missing. Of course I might end up having to experience drowning, which wouldn't be fun.

Obviously I could recover many historical documents and solve historical mysteries, but then I'd have to explain how I did it. I'd also go back and see what religious figures actually said, and if it is anywhere close to what they are attributed as saying.

I could solve murders / crimes but that would not be a fun experience...

Also I could track anybody in the world and quickly accumulate passwords and bank account information, with all the benefits / problems that would cause me. Might get me in trouble fast if I acted on it, though. I would need preparation. Actually nevermind on this, thanks to copyright protection. Rats...
