Ashkatic Records Access: You have limited access to the lifelogs the computational substrate of the universe keeps on humanity.

Specifically, you can experience as super vivid dreams the first hand experiences of everyone who's life record is out of copyright, as per the berne convention.

You need the following things: To uniquely identify the person you wish to "stream" and the timestamps of the chunks of time you want to experience. You cannot fast forward, nor can you experience a longer period of time in one setting than you normally sleep. Replay does not interfere with rest - you wake up like from normal sleep, but you also cannot control the experience while it's happening - if you pick someone that got burned alive on the time chosen, you will have a really bad night. You don't get the internal monologue of the people you ride, but you do get a full sensory feed.

What do you do with this?
