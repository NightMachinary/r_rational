It's not time travel, so no, you can't mess with the playback by lucid dreaming. The interface is mental which is the real limit on how complicated a playback list you can make - you have to have it in your head when you go to sleep. The parsing system is a part of an arbritarily powerful computer but it is only helpful within certain boundries - you can't ask for "The playback sequence that would be most helpful to the end goal of x" or similar, or try to get it to crack an encryption key to pick a target. "Chief architect of the Kheops pyramid"? Not a problem.
