Confirm lucid dreaming does not work. Be careful not to make public that you exist, for someone might want you dead. Perhaps acquire anonymity and open an internet service, this could be worth a lot of money, more than I would guess you could gain from finding treasures. Sleep seconds at a time to search important times. Make sure you don't die, for your existence allows future AGIs to resurrect everyone who ever died depending on how identity works. Maybe also depending on your interface to the power: Can you say "the last person to die before 1950", "the second last person to die before 1950", etc.? Can you say "the nth last person to die before 1950" where n is defined using uncomputable functions, solving ludicrously beyond the halting problem?
