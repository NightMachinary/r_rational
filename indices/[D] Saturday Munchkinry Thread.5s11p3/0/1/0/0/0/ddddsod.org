  Set the portal's location relative to a pencil, but place it at a distance of 95,000 km (about 1/3rd of a light second) from the pencil. If you rotate the pencil at 1 revolution per second, the portal will move at 99.5% of the speed of light. You would then don a space suit, step through your portal and end up however many minutes or hours in the past. You would then make a new portal to return to Earth.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but - for both this and your previous portal timetravel strategy - I think you can't go back to /before/ portals A and B were created. Right?
