  I Am Not A Physicist, but I think that kills your time travel exploit as well.

It's not a problem. As it was specified, you select the reference frame for the portals, and again, it did not specify an inertial reference frame. The power as specified is the easy case, since you control exactly where the portals are and can move them around as you please.

But let's try the hard case, where we have to do this in an inertial reference frame where the portal's location is fixed relative to an object's mass, and the portal rotates as the object rotates. If you make a portal in your bathtub and fix it to Earth's reference frame, the portal will stay in your bathtub. This approach may seem harder to abuse, but it's actually pretty easy.

Set the portal's location relative to a pencil, but place it at a distance of 95,000 km (about 1/3rd of a light second) from the pencil. If you rotate the pencil at 1 revolution per second, the portal will move at 99.5% of the speed of light. You would then don a space suit, step through your portal and end up however many minutes or hours in the past. You would then make a new portal to return to Earth.

  Also for the underwater breathing exploit, you don't really need the oxygen tank, just "10 stories above the surface of the Atlantic Ocean at least 100 meters away from any clouds" to "the roof of your mouth"

That may not do you any good, actually. To be able to breathe when deep underwater, you need pressurized air. Your chest cavity has to be able to expand against the water pressure, and that's surprisingly difficult if you're breathing low-pressure air. This is why [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorkeling][snorkels]] are not typically made any longer than 16 inches.
