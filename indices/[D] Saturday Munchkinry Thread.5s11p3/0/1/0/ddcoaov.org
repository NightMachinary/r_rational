Point of order the portals have a volume of 0 (as mentioned in the dimensional distortion entry, they are flat circles) so they should have a mass of 0. Even in an inertial reference frame they wouldn't be affected by gravity. I Am Not A Physicist, but I think that kills your time travel exploit as well. On the upside if you /can/ move your portals this means you don't need to fight inertia.

Also for the underwater breathing exploit, you don't really need the oxygen tank, just "10 stories above the surface of the Atlantic Ocean at least 100 meters away from any clouds" to "the roof of your mouth"
