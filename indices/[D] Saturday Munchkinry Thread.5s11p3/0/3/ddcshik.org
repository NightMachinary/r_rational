Wow I feel kind of stupid because there's a really obvious way to send arbitrarily large amounts of information using *Byte Sized Time Travel*. Like I spent all that time figuring out how to encode information into the time the info was sent from in my previous answer, but failed to see the obvious exploit. /Even though I was already committed to sending the information back post singularity./\\
There's no limit on how far back you can send, the only limit is the cooldown. So in the future simply send the info back, then just keep sending it back because in this simulated future you're /at/ the time the info is being sent from so there's no cooldown.

Like seriously /it's so obvious how did I miss it!/
