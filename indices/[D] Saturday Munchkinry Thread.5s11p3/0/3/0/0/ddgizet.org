  What no obviously sending back information ends the simulation, waits for the cooldown to end, then starts a new simulation from that time. The "you" in that timeline knows it did not receive information and may or may not experience existential angst.

It says the entities in the simulation aren't conscious, though I'm not sure how that's supposed to work, what with P-zombies being nonsensical and whatnot. Anyway even if that simulated me never gets any messages, they won't exactly be beaten up about it because they are still living in a post singularity utopia, so i'm sure I would be fine with expending a minimal amount of effort in order to help some alternate version of me.\\
Also remember there's no cooldown from the perspectives of simulated me, sure it may create many iteration of simulation loop, but they still send the info from the designated time as expected, not experiencing those other iterations.
