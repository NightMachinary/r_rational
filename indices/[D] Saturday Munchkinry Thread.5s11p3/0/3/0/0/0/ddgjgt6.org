I imagine the "they aren't conscious" line doesn't have any non-epiphenomenal impact, it just means that OP scores your strategy disregarding what happens in a simulation.

I still think the total time simulated equals the time that has passed in the real world after each time the cooldown ends in the real world.

But for another thing, why do you think the post-singularity world is an utopia? You just let whatever AGI first appears in the simulation do its Simurgh's Song in the real world, assuming it doesn't care about the simulation continuing.
