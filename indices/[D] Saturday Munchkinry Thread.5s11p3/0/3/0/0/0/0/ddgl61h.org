  But for another thing, why do you think the post-singularity world is an utopia? You just let whatever AGI first appears in the simulation do its Simurgh's Song in the real world, assuming it doesn't care about the simulation continuing.

Well I expect that I would maximize the chances of superintelligence being friendly and developed in my lifetime using my world domination scheme using pinhole portal that I mentioned in my original answer, so my odds are still better than they would otherwise be.\\
However even if it wasn't friendly I would realistically only accept info that was info on GAI generally so my researchers could create it themselves once they were extremely confident, and not just run any code I got back. So any unfriendly AI wouldn't bother sending info back because I'm not actually going to instantiate it, though it may still send the info back hoping for the off chance we make a dumb mistake.\\
Plus the powers grant you a supernatural foresight for catastrophic events, but i'm not exactly counting on that, since I can't know what kind of bizarre methods GAI could use to gain insight about the purple gods.

  I still think the total time simulated equals the time that has passed in the real world after each time the cooldown ends in the real world.

See i'm not sure how what you said works, I see no reason you can't get a message from a million years in the future, then simply commit to send another message back to a second in your (current) future right after the cooldown wears out in a million years plus a fraction of a second. However my idea is to simply precommit to doing that plan but set the target for the same point in time so it's /as though/ you did that strategy, or I could actually stagger things by a second or whatever, it makes little difference.\\
Point is since there's no limit on how far back you can send info, and the cooldown always expires in finite time (whereas the pinhole portal lets you get infinite energy so the future singularity could last indefinitely). So it seems like a mathematical proof that at the very least my plan's theoretically possible. But since the cooldown doesn't ballon exponentially I hardly need arbitrarily large time anyway.
