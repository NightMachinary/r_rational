  since I can't know what kind of bizarre methods GAI could use to gain insight about the purple gods.

It could read your brain and not kill people for a year after it comes out. Assuming that it can send back arbitrary amounts of information through your scheme, if you read the info it sends back, it has already won - see the AI box experiment.

Even if it couldn't convince you outright, surely there is some info AGI experts wouldn't figure out is nefarious - see the underhanded C contest. That's probably not the part where this fails, though - with any luck, AGI experts do not accept text sent from an arbitrary future AGI. They might run screaming in little circles that suddenly the Simurgh is real and has already sung. Perhaps it could convince you of this fact and to not contact them.

Did you reconsider after the last paragraph, just a little? The AGI could find something pretty close to the optimal version of that paragraph, to any end.

Here's how I think the timelinery works: [[http://sketchtoy.com/67872359]]
