Focusing on one of the ones that wasn't looked at too much.

What counts as a computing system? Particularly when we get into biological systems, because Less Minor Computational Duplication has some even bigger potential there. Notably, brains, but it applies elsewhere. While you prevent brains that occurred due to evolution, well we've got the most powerful computer in the world by a huge amount, so how much is needed before you can call a living creature designed and developed by humans? Genetic engineering is a thing after all, so a creature that has been designed to be better, and then grown artificially, could count as designed and developed by humans. Not even discarding the less strict ways of genetic engineering that takes the form of just breeding programs, happens all the time with plants and animals, over many generations humans work towards creating the best possible animal/plant. Most domesticated animals could potentially count as designed.

There's also inheritance, once you've got your designed creature, if it breeds with another designed creature, does the offspring count as a designed creature? What if you breed it with a "natural" creature it is compatible with, does the offspring count as designed in that case? In both cases it still clearly uses the work designed and developed by humanity to produce a result.

The other big part of the question is can you control what kind of computing system it emulates? Not all computing systems in the world, even being super strict with things designed and artificially constructed specifically for "computing" we've got multiple incompatible types of computers including the common binary electronic ones, mechanical computers, and quantum computers. If you can choose what kind of computer it emulates in architecture it gives you some extra options. Being able to take all the conventional computing power and just seamlessly convert it over to a quantum computer would do wonders there as they're much better for some kinds of problems than conventional computers.
