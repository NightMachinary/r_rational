The first thing that springs to mind is something like /"no polity or organised group may act contrary to [eg the UN Declaration of Human Rights], negotiate in ill faith, or [insert other clauses here]; except where this veto would do more harm than good"/.

Boom, most of the world's problems solved. Unless you can't use multi-clause or refer to external documents or conditionals. And assuming that we don't run into non-polity or disorganized existential threats. Etc, etc, etc; I still think we'd be better off.
