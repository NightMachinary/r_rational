You have a one shot conceptual veto. It's effects are absolute in the scope that it's used. If you use it to overrule a local town from passing a law requiring dogs to wear leashes in the park, that town will never pass a law requiring dogs to wear a leash in the park. If you stop the US congress from outlawing gay marriage, gay marriage will never be illegal in the United States, etc.

It's supernatural in effect, and the world works it in (in the least disturbance causing way possible. WW3 isn't going to pop up to stop a recycling bill). Enough constituents get worked up every time it comes up to convince their representative to vote it down, etc.

It's also a conceptual veto. It can't be used to force something into reality, only to stop something from becoming reality.

Is it a power you'd ever use? Is there a lower threshold you'd save it for, never using it if that threshold was ever crossed? Is there an easy way to abuse an already very strong power?
