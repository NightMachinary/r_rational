  Alternatively, disguise yourself as a fake Occultist, (IRL, people already believe magic) but give enough hints of real knowledge that your online followers have a decent chance of discovering magic themselves

Pretending to be a false positive, /just/ false enough to pass scrutiny? Interesting idea, and one I hadn't thought of myself.

Somewhat similar to [[/u/captainNematode][u/captainNematode]]'s 'encrypted packages scavenger hunt', with the cult's leader releasing the 'package' and then letting the followers figure out the 'key' for themselves, except the Masquerade's knowledge of magic would play against them here: they wouldn't be able to tell if an uninformed person is capable of figuring out magic from your teachings, since they themselves know it and all necessary insights already. And I think that tactic might be esoteric enough for the Masquerade to not have a preplanned countermeasure against. Neat.
