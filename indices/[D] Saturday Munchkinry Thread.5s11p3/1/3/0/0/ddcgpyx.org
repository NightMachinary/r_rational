  And I think that tactic might be esoteric enough for the Masquerade to not have a preplanned countermeasure against

Well, I would add the caveat that if there is magic in your world you should think about how real life Occult teachings interact with it historically. Like for example, in Nasuverse/Type-Moon (the setting of Fate/Stay Night and Fate/Grand Order) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus][Paracelsus]] (a real life alchemist) run into trouble with the Magus assocation. I think [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky][Helena Blavatsky]] also ran into issues with them. My head-canon is that the techniques to open magic circuits stayed secret, so the most that anyone could reverse engineer out of their writings would be really weak formalcraft rituals. Anyway, you need to decide whether real life occultist don't exist in your setting, or if they are totally wrong to the point of being ignored by the masquerade, or if the have some traces of technique but were still somehow allowed to release knowledge into the public (maybe the most key secrets were removed or obfuscated). Or maybe they were powerful magic users who struggled to release bits of knowledge here and there even as the Masquerade ran a disinformation campaign against them to discredit them as frauds and charlatans.
