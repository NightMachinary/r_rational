How did this masquerade of hypothetical waterbenders get so powerful as to have intelligent machines infiltrated into a dozen different email providers, in addition to having intelligent machines to begin with?

They can spin all the convincing tale that they want. There's a sad number of people that believe in 9/11 and sandyhook deniers, and both of those are pretty crazy. For something that's true with a fuckton of very visible evidence? Even if I'm wildly off base and only a minority buy it, it's going to be a large enough minority to be seriously inconvenient.

Like "Noticeable % of the World that saw X event and started talking about / trying similar things die in mass" situation.

My suspension of disbelief is sitting on a precarious line, here.
