  Hammer like water bending as opposed to scalpel like precog?
#+end_quote

Something like this, except it's possible it could be made into a scalpel --- or a microscope, or a computer, or something else, like waterbending could be made into bloodbending, or [[http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Specialized_bending_techniques][apparently]] healing and spiritbending. At your current level of knowledge, you see a few possibilities for munchkinery, but you don't know which of them, if any, are workable.

Therefore, you suspect that the Masquerade, /if/ it exists, possesses one or more of these 'refined tools', but you don't know what they are.

  1: Set up a chain / spam that details whatever you can
#+end_quote

What if the Masquerade monitors the Internet for these kinds of breaches in secrecy --- possibly even authomatically, using intilligent search machines --- and silences these kinds of spammers before they could affects too many people?

  2: Go somewhere highly publicized like a presidential press conference or something. Unleash your fantastic water bending powers / insert other power here in a dazzling display.
#+end_quote

What would you do to prevent the following scenario: after the security guards seize you, the Masquerade has you killed, then spins a convincing tale about you being an insane but brilliant stage magician/hacker?

If you manage to /teach/ magic to people during your 'performance', how would you counter a Masquerade that's willing to commit a mass murder to contain the secret (which it would then cover up as a terrorist attack)?
