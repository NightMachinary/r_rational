Hmm, I guess I wouldn't give the Masquerade any reason to suspect anything about the encrypted files, and if they're not aware of its contents and decide to try to open them anyway, upon failing I don't really know why they'd bother.

As to stopping their spread and deleting the ones already released, good luck -- wielding my minor celebrity like a cudgel, the files are now all on the personal computers of ~10% of my million instagram/facebook/twitter/etc. followers.

Releasing the key would be a bit more compromising, but hopefully I'd be enough beneath the masquerade's notice that sufficiently many thousands of people would get it without their zoning in (and then, I'm not sure if the masquerade is strong enough to take on the internet).

If the key doesn't get out, the encryption would hopefully be strong enough to dissuade the masquerade, but weak enough to yield after sufficient efforts by the public.

I could potentially even establish an innocuous pattern -- regularly release encrypted files and later release keys, make it a scavenger hunt with FABULOUS PRIZES. Then when I release the magic info, everybody knows what do but nobody suspects anything.

I'd also be curious how and why the masquerade arose to protect knowledge of (something like) Avatar waterbending. I guess bloodbending would be really useful in controlling world leaders and CEOs/directors and such, if you could develop more subtle control.
