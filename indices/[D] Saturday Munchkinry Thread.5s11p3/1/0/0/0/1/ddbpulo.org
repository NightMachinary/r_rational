  Hmm, I guess I wouldn't give the Masquerade any reason to suspect anything about the encrypted files, and if they're not aware of its contents and decide to try to open them anyway, upon failing I don't really know why they'd bother.

What if the Masquerade is extremely paranoid as well, and attempts to seek/decode/supress unfamiliar encrypted files simply on principle? What if it prioritized finding a way to utilize the magic in a way that gives it quantum computations, so there's no encryption that's safe from it?

  Releasing the key would be a bit more compromising, but hopefully I'd be enough beneath the masquerade's notice that enough thousands of people would get it without their zoning in

What if your sudden success would /tip off/ the Masquerade instead, since it's paranoid about these things and tries to find magic in any sudden celebrity it notices?

#+begin_quote
  I could potentially even establish an innocuous pattern -- regularly release encrypted files and later release keys, make it a scavenger hunt with FABULOUS PRIZES. Then when I release the magic info, everybody knows what do but nobody suspects anything.

Are you confident in your ability to become famous under close scrutiny of the Masquerade without giving it a reason to suspect magic use?

  I'd also be curious how and why the masquerade arose to protect knowledge of (something like) Avatar waterbending. I guess bloodbending would be really useful in controlling world leaders and CEOs/directors and such, if you could develop more subtle control.

It's not actually, in general, 'something like waterbending'. It's 'something like waterbending for the purposes of this exercise'.
