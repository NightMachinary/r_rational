FYI, quantum computing has problems that are known to be hard for it, so you could create and publicize algorithms to beat it, which would automatically give you celebrity status of at least some kind.

As for finding and decrypting all encrypted packages, that seems kind of unlikely. Enough encrypted packages are exchanged every day that it seems unlikely for them to truly be able to do that kind of thing. Practically every computer on earth would have to be compromised for them to be able to do it effectively.
