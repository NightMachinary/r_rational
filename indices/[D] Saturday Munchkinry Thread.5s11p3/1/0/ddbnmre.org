I think it depends on the scope of the abilities granted by the magic. If any of it focuses on divination, you're probably boned either way.

There are also plenty of other possibilities besides a global masquerade, IMO. It might be that you genuinely are the first to discover it for some special reason (not too great a stretch to go from one of a few billion to one of a hundred billion). It might be that historically a handful have discovered it, and it was observed and recorded, but those recordings were dismissed as false by later scholars as legerdemain. It might be that the few who discovered it kept it secret themselves, either for fear of their own safety (from the local religious or governing body), or out of greed (e.g. they could more effectively manipulate people in secret). It might be there's some filter at play -- exposure to magical particles gives you super cancer and you're actually about to die. It might be that other forms of /magic/ have been discovered in the past, but that knowledge /was/ widely disseminated and is now in popular use (e.g. electricity magic by the likes of Maxwell, Faraday, and others, disease magic by the wizards Jenner and Pasteur, etc.).

Anyway, assuming the masquerade is real and has powers not far beyond the levels of a world government (and not, say, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a2ooz/rt_the_randi_prize_short/][James Randi]]), I'd probably want to take extensive, incontrovertible documentation as to my ability to perform magic (preferably with an eye toward anonymity), encrypt it really well (maybe not /too/ well), spread those documents far and wide, preferably to millions (with subtle uses of magic, I might be able to get really, really popular), and then have some simultaneous global release of the decryption key.
