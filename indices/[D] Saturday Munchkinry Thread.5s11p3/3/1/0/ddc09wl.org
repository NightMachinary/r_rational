Wouldn't work. First, someone with authority over humanity (of which no such government body exists) would have to attempt to pass a law declaring that you aren't the emperor of humanity. And even at that point, all vetoing it does is stop anyone from ever declaring a law that you're not the emperor of humanity, it doesn't make it so. It could be as simple any time that such a proposal (to refuse your claim as God Emperor comes up) the person that proposes it gets laughed out and it never gets voted on.

It's a veto power in the sense of "If I veto something that's trying to become a law, said thing will never be passed within whatever level of authority it's being attempted on." It doesn't re-write reality to make the opposing true.
