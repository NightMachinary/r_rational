If I am interpreting it correctly, I think the "supernatural" effect only applies to peoples' perceptions and acceptance of it as law. Everyone will agree that this is a law and the law enforcement will enforce it, but people are still capable of breaking it as a crime. The supernatural force isn't going to come in and prevent or punish people who break it.

And anything difficult to measure such as "more harm than good" would be open to interpretation. If it's not a crime to negotiate in ill faith whenever the greater good is at stake, there would have to be some sort of committee or standards for measuring this when prosecuting violators of this law.

It could work, it would probably be better a world without this law but it's not a cut and dry solution to all the words problems.
