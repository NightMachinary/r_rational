Yes, it is a power I would use. No, I don't know what for yet.

Possibilities include vetoing the deliberate causing of the death of any person by any person (taking down murder, abortion, suicide and the death penalty in one fell swoop) or vetoing any attempts (worldwide) to repeal a basic income grant. But I'd have to give this a lot more thought and seek a lot more opinions before I decide.
