I made [[https://i.imgur.com/NUw68i4.jpg][a CYOA]] for [[/r/makeyourchoice][r/makeyourchoice]] this past week and would be interested in hearing both which of the options people here would choose, and how they would apply those powers to accomplish their goals (whatever those might be).

You can see previous discussion of the CYOA [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5qwwi5/][here]], though I updated it to clarify a few things in light of feedback and responses received, so the image above is not quite the same as in that thread. Same caveats from over there apply here, too: I'm not a physicist, so apologies for any factual or conceptual inaccuracies! Special thanks to all the artists whose images I stole off google images. Please forgive any compression artifacts; when I exported from PS everything looked clear but IMGUR compressed it pretty dramatically.

edit: Applications which read the text literally to great effect are strongly encouraged, but would also appreciate suggestions for how to improve my specification of the powers such that their intent/spirit is properly observed.
