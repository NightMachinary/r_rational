Thanks for your response! I did [[https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/comments/5qwwi5/prodigious_puny_purple_powers_oc_first_time/dd489fd/][struggle a bit]] with figuring out a good way to delimit which computers qualify for the power, especially given self-imposed space limitations. I /did/ explicitly say cranial fleshbags were excluded, and was hoping the previous phrase "only computers designed and developed within the last millenium onwards" might be interpreted in light of that. I would say that modern genetic engineering -- especially through breeding -- is just a /modification/ of pre-existing "design", and not novel in itself (can clarify for V3 though!). BUT I didn't want to /necessarily/ exclude stuff like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_computer][this]], so I included the caveat. I guess if someone either printed out neurons in specified locations themselves, or designed from the ground-up some self-replicating bacterium (with artificial gene synthesis or w/e) that would link up into some super-organism, that would be totally legit.

I also tried not to exclude /evolved/ systems, since chip design could easily make use of e.g. evolutionary algorithms.

  There's also inheritance, once you've got your designed creature, if it breeds with another designed creature, does the offspring count as a designed creature? What if you breed it with a "natural" creature it is compatible with, does the offspring count as designed in that case? In both cases it still clearly uses the work designed and developed by humanity to produce a result.

I'd say no, given my interpretation of develop/design. And if we're constructing artificial organisms that can viably reproduce with existing ones, I'd suspect we have far more awesome computer available anyway.

  The other big part of the question is can you control what kind of computing system it emulates? Not all computing systems in the world, even being super strict with things designed and artificially constructed specifically for "computing" we've got multiple incompatible types of computers including the common binary electronic ones, mechanical computers, and quantum computers. If you can choose what kind of computer it emulates in architecture it gives you some extra options. Being able to take all the conventional computing power and just seamlessly convert it over to a quantum computer would do wonders there as they're much better for some kinds of problems than conventional computers.

I'd say the standard mechanisms for I/O are there, but done in such a way as to work seamlessly with (any computer terminal, your own thoughts, etc.). Maybe they power creates a really intuitive GUI for you to use or something. So if the strongest computer around were something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchant_calculator][this]], you could enter in a series of button presses either through some written script, or by pressing buttons on a GUI, or by reading -- and thinking -- a particular sequence, or w/e.

I'm not really sure how feasible it would be to convert from one sort of computer to another (much as I'm no physicist, IANA hardware engineer), or how one might even go "summing" across all existing computers. Maybe for the less minor form it can take the general form of the most powerful computer, but with a lot of extra "oomph"? IDK.

I'd be curious to hear what applications you think there might be to a "human brain"-like computer, though. Any programs you ran would need to be massively parallelizable, right?

Also, the "are brains computers or no?" thing might be irrelevant within some relatively small number of decades, depending on how optimistic your timeline for superhuman AI is. And that's when this power would really kick off IMO.
