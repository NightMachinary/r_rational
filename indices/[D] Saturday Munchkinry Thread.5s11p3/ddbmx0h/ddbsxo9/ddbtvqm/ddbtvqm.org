Breaking a single bond between carbon atoms takes [[http://www.picotwist.com/index.php?content=smb&option=odg][1.6x10^{-9} N]]. The diameter of a carbon atom is 0.3 nm, giving the bond a surface area of about 1 x10^{-19} m^{2} , meaning you need 20,000,000 kPa to break a carbon bond. The limit on telekenetic force is 10 kPa, or two million times too weak. No nanofactory for you.
