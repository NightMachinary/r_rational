Thanks for the response!

  Serendipity is only limited by maximum force, not maximum precision. Hi, any nanofactory I can visualize appearing from raw materials within 10 meters of me. Nice to meet you. Transmutation can do the same thing at major.

I didn't go too much into depth on how exactly it would work, but I don't think you could do this within the limits of the definition I provided. For one, atomic bonds typically require far greater pressures (not /forces/ for this power) than the ones TS is capable of -- see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magntude_(pressure][here]]. It's why no major reactions occur when I rest my hand on the table (AFAIK -- I'm sure /some/ occur). For another, the MC approach to how the power works ensures that any precise series of nudges is highly improbable if a lot of them are needed. I threw out a rough order of magnitude number ("untold trillions"), of which there might only be a small handful of viable combinations of minute-long-series of nudges (lets say you can have some uniform random number between 1-1E5 (roughly?) series of nudges over that minute, of any exponentially distributed area up to the maximum, in any uniformly distributed position within your sphere of influence, across any uniformly distributed duration within the minute -- all with some appropriate scaling for the less minor form. I'd have clarified this in text but didn't have enough space).

And I forgot to specify, but let's also say that the drawing happens at the start of each minute, rather than continuously. Hell, I'm not even sure /any/ series would be guaranteed to actually help you, since the overwhelming majority would primarily include stuff like a gentle breeze wafting up your nostrils and 4 ft. in from of you or whatever, so let's say the null set is automatically included (you /could/ easily use it to win the Randi prize, but at the cost of attracting a ton of attention, depending on if that tradeoff is consistent with your values). I chose trillions since it seemed like a nice amount, but I guess you could tune as appropriate for it to be consistent with my description of the power. I'd say the real draw here is the precise quantification of your preferences (and action in accord with that quantification), but you can't access it directly.

Additionally, if you can conceptualize energetically/thermodynamically viable nanotechnology, and can hold its image in your mind all at once, you'd better be working in the appropriate field!

  Time travel doesn't have a 'no recursion' clause, and so there's probably a way to make at least the major version more or less infinitely powerful. 2kb one time isn't that much, but you have infinite lifetimes to figure out how to cram shit into it efficiently, in a form you've been proven by rigorous research to be able to unpack.

There is a cool down, though, equivalent to however long "you" send information back. So you only have the equivalent of one lifetime, and that's with perfectly aligned backwards transmission (barring other time-travel shenanigans involving traveling really fast or living near really big things, maybe). And the information is just whatever you decide to send back (using whatever encoding scheme you like/precommit to) -- usefulness isn't guaranteed (and it's a bit risky if "you" send something really far back). Hell, at that, "you" can only really send info as far back as you would be able to decrypt it! If "you" try to send the "optimal" 2kb message back 50 years (having decided on your encryption/compression 50 years prior), then you have that message and 50 years to wait before being able to use your power again.

(edit: I also didn't say TS was using /MCMC/, which would certain sample from some nice neighborhood far more efficiently)
