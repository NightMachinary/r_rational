For time travel, the other part of the problem. How do you get the information?

Say you resolve to send information back to one minute after you got the power in a week, and you do that a million times. What does it look like then? As you'd be getting back 2MB worth of data in 2B blocks, how do you get that information? It'd be 2GB of info with Less Minor, and if you just see a million different data sequences of ones and zeroes for examples there's no way you'd be able to handle that. A lot of people would struggle with handling just one depending on how quick they come at you.
