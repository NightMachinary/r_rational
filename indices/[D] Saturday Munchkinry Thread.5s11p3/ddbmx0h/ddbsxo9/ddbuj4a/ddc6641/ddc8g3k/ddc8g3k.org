I think the exact mechanism isn't too important -- they could appear as floating numbers in your mind, or you could use a 0/1 ouija board where the sequence shows up with non-informative timing, or you could have a magical .txt document on your computer that glows with arcane power and pulls new sequences where appropriate, or w/e. For the less minor form, you'd probably want something like that last one in the interests of convenience (the time-in-the-future part would pop into your mind as a confident sureness, though).

For the second part, I'd say you'd receive the message one minute after getting the power, and then you wouldn't receive anything else for a week, as per the specified cooldown. I'm not really sure I understand how you'd resolve to do it a million times, though. Also implicit in this is a sort of strong determinism (but still sensitivity to initial conditions -- so the future that would play out would be distinct from the simulated one that sent back information, since that one never received any information) with that "lazy evaluation" line.

So I think it would be something like:

1. Receive the power.
2. Simulation starts.
3. Simulate until information is sent back.
4. Allow reality to proceed until the point at which the reception of simulation was specified (identical to the simulated version, given determinism and magic purple power).
5. At that point, receive information.
6. Start a new simulation, repeating 2-5, but not allowing any new transmission until the point in 3 is reached.
7. Hmm, and check to see if in any subsequent simulations are sent back further than the point in 5, and if so, 2-7 occur in a "higher level" simulation.

Now, how this can all occur without generating "sentience" I'll leave to our hyperintelligent purple "benefactor" (I included that in case people would be uncomfortable with allowing the creation and destruction of simulated universes).
