Just gonna knock the obvious stuff out.

Serendipity is only limited by maximum /force/, not maximum /precision/. Hi, any nanofactory I can visualize appearing from raw materials within 10 meters of me. Nice to meet you. Transmutation can do the same thing at major.

Time travel doesn't have a 'no recursion' clause, and so there's /probably/ a way to make at least the major version more or less infinitely powerful. 2kb one time isn't that much, but you have infinite lifetimes to figure out how to cram shit into it efficiently, in a form you've been proven by rigorous research to be able to unpack.

Basically, your choice is between minor serendipity (to which major is an irrelevant upgrade) with minor time travel on the one hand, and major time travel on the other. It really comes down to how much you value 16000 bits worth of the most useful possible information versus a more used-as-intended, short-term oracle and nanotech. But I could only write the latter story in anything resembling a satisfying way, so I know what I'd pick.
