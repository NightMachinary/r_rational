  The AI knows to read your mind because there are magic portals. It can read people's minds because we can almost already do that, remember that dream recording stuff? Aliens are much less likely as a fact than as a cover story, or at least enough so that it should bother seeing who thinks they caused them, then invest a minuscule amount of ressources into testing each of these beliefs, where that's possible. Also, people have read Death Note, even law enforcement or the internet might find you. If it even just watches everyone from nanomachinery for a few days, it should be obvious you are the hidden power. And these are both lower bounds on the quality of the plan it'll find.

See I still don't think me being the cause of the portals seems a very likely option, even if it only requires minimal effort to test via nanotech brain scanning I just think the priors would still be so utterly low it wouldn't consider it. After all it would need to calculate expected utility from that, since unlike a human it doesn't do things without good reason, and I just don't see that being plausible. It seems far more likely that the existence of the portals causes it to think it's in some sort of simulation, but thinking a human in the simulation is responsible just seems unlikely. Still i'm not exactly counting on that thus all the other precautions.\\
As for people finding out I am responsible for the portals: having already read that article I don't think it seems likely I would leave enough evidence to trace back to me. Remember I'm not doing anything that directly benefits me others could trace back. I'm not sure how a portal that pulses morse code messages and destroys massive areas of value, if governments don't do what it tells them could be traced back to me, of course I would make sure I didn't avoid targets that might be slightly disadvantageous to me to hit (for instance no withdrawing investments from a country before I attack it in retaliation for it not following my orders).

  It knows your scheme to contain the message because you apparently thought it up before the split.

Yes I have to assume that's the case, but nonetheless I have to try anyway, after all what's the alternative?. Of course even the scheme I thought of would probably not be what I would ultimately go with, since I would be able to draw upon the best geniuses in the world at this sort of thing in order to find the optimal human conceivable solution. Still I think the solution would probably contain all the elements I had already elaborated on, such as passing the info through a crude computer first that changes as much as possible while still letting it keep enough meaning to be useful, and tossing out any message that isn't exclusively a dry description of facts.\\
Still I have a fair degree of confidence that this would vet out most hostile superintelligences, since I don't think GAI is just magic and I think it would need more interaction with people to control them than these precautions would allow. Plus I wouldn't be sending back enough info for someone to get a source code from, I would purposely limit myself to maybe a megabyte of extremely compressed info. After all looking at the size of my ebooks that would be sufficient to contain all the info I need (with extreme compression).

Anyway given the coercive power of the portals I would probably just make sure I developed ems first. That way I could just copy myself and then solve the presumably easier problem of maintaining values as you increase intelligence. After all it seems a terrible idea to risk any moral structure that might diverge from my own, especially since I don't think human morality converges and that socially liberal values are not somehow at the core of human moral instincts. I have this terrible fear that at the core of human ethics is horrifyingly authoritarian tribalism and that liberal values are not what a FAI would see as optimal for "human flourishing", hell even the vast majority of liberals seem to be fine with bans on extremely harmful drugs and other laws meant to take away people's right's "for their own good".
