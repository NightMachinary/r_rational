The AI knows to read your mind because /there are magic portals/. It can read people's minds because we can almost already do that, remember that dream recording stuff? Aliens are much less likely as a fact than as a cover story, or at least enough so that it should bother seeing who thinks they caused them, then invest a minuscule amount of ressources into testing each of these beliefs, where that's possible. Also, people have read Death Note, [[https://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity][even law enforcement or the internet might find you]]. If it even just watches everyone from nanomachinery for a few days, it should be obvious you are the hidden power. And these are both lower bounds on the quality of the plan it'll find.

It knows your scheme to contain the message because you apparently thought it up before the split.

Schneier's law: Any person can invent a security system so clever that he or she can't imagine a way of breaking it.

Also known as "Don't roll your own crypto.".

One reason EY doesn't publish the AI box experiment logs is that it'll lead people to believe the arguments he found aren't a problem. Apparently he thinks being able to defend against those additional hazards doesn't make enough of a difference. Defending against only the hazards you know is more futile!

But I'll grant that embedding it in a universe-size VM in the first place has some merit. Also the fact that you can conquer the simulation (if it didn't work, send back zeroes and retry), in a world where ethics do not apply, then tear apart the stars in heaven for a billion years to find a solution to FAI without ever developing AGI, gives us a much better shot than we originally had. Just hope that you'll be loyal to the real you!
