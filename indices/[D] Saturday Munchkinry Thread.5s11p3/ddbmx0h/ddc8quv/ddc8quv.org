Dimensional distortion and pinhole portals seem to be the most useful combination. Example uses:

- *Teleportation:* Make a portal from A to B, with portal A nearby on a hard and flat surface (and place B near your destination on a hard and flat surface). Step next to portal A, warp the space you're standing in, and the space where you'll step out of to become very tiny. You're now small enough to step through the portal and expand on the other side.

- *Fusion reactor:* Connect a portal between the core of the sun and the inside of your power plant. Plasma which is compressed to a density of 150 times that of water rushes out of the 1 mm portal under a force of 26.5 petapascals, emerging at an initial temperature of 15 million degrees, though it will cool as it expands. Run a power plant, or just place it at the center of a large rocket nozzle to have your very own [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchship][torchship]]. Need less power, e.g. for a jetpack? Connect your portal to somewhere higher up in the sun, like its convective zone.

- *Fire juggling:* Suppose you want to blow something up but don't want to wait for a portal to connect to the sun. You are in arbitrary control of the frame of reference for the portals (and it was not specified as an /inertial/ frame of reference - if it were, the portals would immediately fall down a gravity well), which means you can make them move. You can move your sun portal from the sun's core to space in a little under a second, so you can rapidly switch from small flame to terrifying explosion. Similarly, you can move your portal on Earth's side to any point on the planet in less than 1/100th of a second.

- *Underwater breathing:* Just know where you can reliably find an oxygen tank, somewhere in the world. Connect a portal from the inside of that tank to the area right in front of your face.

- *Starshot:* You can complete the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starshot#Breakthrough_Starshot][Breakthrough Starshot]] project from your own backyard. Build or buy the probes you want to use, and launch them by creating a small portal near Earth which is moving away from Earth at 99% of the speed of light. Shrink the probes down, put them in a vacuum chamber with a funnel leading to the portal, and tip them into the funnel when ready.

- *Time travel:* Create portal A and B. Move portal B's frame of reference at 99% of the speed of light relative to Earth for a few minutes and then bring it back to Earth. Portal B is now a few minutes behind portal A. Use the teleportation trick to step through portal A and go a few minutes into the past, or portal B and go a few minutes into the future.

Not quite God-level powers there, but certainly god-level powers.
