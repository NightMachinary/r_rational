Suppose you've discovered magic. It wasn't hard, merely unlikely: by all rights, a few people around the world should have discovered it last year, not to mention the thousands of years of mankind's history. And yet, our civilization as a whole remains unaware of the phenomenon.

An obvious conlcusion is that an unknown and powerful entity prevents the knowledge from spreading.

You do not know who or what runs [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade][the Masquerade]], what purposes it pursues, by what means it is maintained.

You want to make magic publically known, even if that will cost you your life: it could be /that/ useful to humanity.

What is the best possible course of actions?
