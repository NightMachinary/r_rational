  I could potentially even establish an innocuous pattern -- regularly release encrypted files and later release keys, make it a scavenger hunt with FABULOUS PRIZES. Then when I release the magic info, everybody knows what do but nobody suspects anything.

Now that sounds like it would make a fun story concept... mind if I steal it for a CYOA on [[/r/makeyourchoice]]? It will be a while before I get around to using it, I have a project I am in the middle of now, but I think it could be a fun theme with a bunch of fun choices and options.

  I'd also be curious how and why the masquerade arose to protect knowledge of (something like) Avatar waterbending.

Yeah this is a problem with the OP's backstory I am seeing now. I would say at minimum the Masquerade needs at least one of several capabilities to explain the secrecy:

- Near immortality: Older powerful members conventionally leverage wealth and resources to maintain the masquerade. Extremely wealthy non-magical people might get let in, in exchange for their wealth and influence and helping maintain the masquerade.

- Mind Manipulation: The members use memory erasure or manipulation to maintain the masquerade. The advantage of being able to manipulate the non-magicals explains why they both keep secret to maintain their power and how the solve issues with the masquerade that memory erasure doesn't.

- Precognition: To prevent leaks of the masquerade before they happen.

- Some inherent power to their secrecy. Like if magic gets weaker the more power that use or if the magic gets stronger the rarer it is used. Any magic user that learns this rule will be at least partly motivated to restrict its spread.
