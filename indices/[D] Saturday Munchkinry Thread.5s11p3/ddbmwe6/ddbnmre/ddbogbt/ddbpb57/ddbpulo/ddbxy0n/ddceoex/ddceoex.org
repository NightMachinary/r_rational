  As for finding and decrypting all encrypted packages, that seems kind of unlikely. Enough encrypted packages are exchanged every day that it seems unlikely for them to truly be able to do that kind of thing. Practically every computer on earth would have to be compromised for them to be able to do it effectively.

Yes, but in [[/u/captainNematode][u/captainNematode]]'s proposed scenario, these packages would originate from one place, and be distributed to millions of people. I suggested that the Masquerade may be paranoid about that particular scenario, so it would keep a close eye on the celebrity responsible.
