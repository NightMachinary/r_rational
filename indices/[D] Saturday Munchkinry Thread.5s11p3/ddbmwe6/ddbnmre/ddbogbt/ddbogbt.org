  I mean, it depends on the scope of the abilities granted by the magic
#+end_quote

I don't want to give any detailed descriptions (I don't have them, too), but let's say it's a moderately powerful magic of a 'physical' variety (think waterbending from [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender][Avatar]]) without direct focus on 'esoteric' abilities (akin to mind-reading or precognition), but potentially, at higher levels of skill, very versatile.

  There are also plenty of other possibilities besides a global masquerade, IMO
#+end_quote

Yes, there could be. But I think a malevolent Masquerade is the most dangerous possibility, for the world if not for you personally, while still being fairly probable, so the proposed scenario has you /a priori/ assuming the worst.

#+begin_quote
  Also see related discussions here and here.
#+end_quote

I read those, but thank you nonetheless.

  Anyway, assuming the masquerade is real and has powers not far beyond the levels of a world government (and not, say, James Randi), I'd probably want to take extensive, incontrovertible documentation as to my ability to perform magic (preferably with an eye toward anonymity), encrypt it really well (maybe not too well), spread those documents far and wide, preferably to millions (with subtle uses of magic, I might be able to get really, really popular), and then have some simultaneous global release of the decryption key.
#+end_quote

How are you going to ensure that those millions know what to use the key on, while still keeping the ones who run the Masquerade from noticing the encrypted files? How are you going to prevent this scenario: The Masquerade notices the encrypted files, attempts to crack the encryption, either fails or succeeds, then proceeds to stop their spread, delete the ones you've already released, then find you and kill you?
