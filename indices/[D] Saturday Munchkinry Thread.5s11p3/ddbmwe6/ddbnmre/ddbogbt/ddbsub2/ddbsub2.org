Hammer like water bending as opposed to scalpel like precog?

I'd honestly have a hard time reasoning out how it managed to stay a secret. There's nothing inherent about brute force type abilities that lend themselves to secret society.

Unless I'm drastically underestimating the situation;

1: Set up a chain / spam that details whatever you can. Enough people are going to be curious regardless of spam filters (those penis enlargement spam still get tons of clicks, and at least some small % that go for it, I'd imagine. Not a stretch that "Be a real life waterbender / whatever super power here" would as well) that you've got a masquerade breach on your hands right there. Unless they control google (so maybe send the spam from a bunch of different email hosts) you're in good shape.

2: Go somewhere highly publicized like a presidential press conference or something. Unleash your fantastic water bending powers / insert other power here in a dazzling display. A lot of people will likely dismiss it, but a whole lot more aren't going to.

A combination of the above also upticks the number of people that check your spam email by a good margin.
