  How are you going to ensure that those millions know what to use the key on, while still keeping the ones who run the Masquerade from noticing the encrypted files? How are you going to prevent this scenario: The Masquerade notices the encrypted files, attempts to crack the encryption, either fails or succeeds, then proceeds to stop their spread, delete the ones you've already released, then find you and kill you?

Send the encrypted files (anonymously) to Wikileaks. Claim it's stuff that certain large companies don't want spread around. Hint that it may bring one or more of them down. Send it to several other archives as well.

Use an encryption key that's slightly weaker than I should be using (about two months to brute-force decrypt it, given fairly powerful computing hardware).

About two months after releasing the files, release the key. (This last step may not actually be necessary).
