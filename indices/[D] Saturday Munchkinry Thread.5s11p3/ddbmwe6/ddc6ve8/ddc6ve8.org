The Filter must stop the following tactic of dissemination, since it has been possible in the past and so the last guy already thought of it:

Write a book that teaches the reader about magic and tells them to duplicate this tactic. Use, in increasing order of paranoia, a printer, a typewriter, or newspaper cutouts. Leave it where someone might discover it eventually, go far away, and repeat.

In particular, this is discovered and rendered extinct before the mutations to this tactic introduced at each step evolve into a form immune to the Filter.

...which eliminates all of my mundane hypotheses. Leaving the default candidates that explain anything: Magic allows for bullshit divination/probability warping/reality warping. For example, every time magic goes public, a backup is loaded. A hypothesis in this class with low complexity penalty is that magic destroys most worlds it's used in, invoking the anthropic principle.
