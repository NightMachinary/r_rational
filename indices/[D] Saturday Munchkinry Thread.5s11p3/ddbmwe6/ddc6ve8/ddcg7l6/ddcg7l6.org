Hmm. The number of books increases nearly exponentially. The idiots who ignore warnings and start using magic in public get killed, but the Masquerade cannot find the rest through them. Traveling to a different city and leaving a book somewhere is trivial enough, any remotely sane person would do that, once the book explains the situation thoroughly and provides evidence.

...

I have a feeling I'm missing something, that there should be an easy counter, but I can't think of anything short of the Masquerade declaring a planet-wide emergency and closing off all borders.
