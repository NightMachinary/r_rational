  An obvious conclusion is that an unknown and powerful entity prevents the knowledge from spreading.

  You do not know who or what runs the Masquerade, what purposes it pursues, by what means it is maintained.

  You want to make magic publically known, even if that will cost you your life: it could be that useful to humanity.

  What is the best possible course of actions?

The best possible course of action? Find out why the masquerade has been maintained for so long and at such great probable cost and inconvenience.

Before you go disseminating this knowledge it might be a very good idea to rule out such possible explanations as:

Certain higher dimensional entities can sense the use of magic, and find that sensation intensely irritating. Having more than about ten thousand magic users living at any one time is enough to give Yog-Sothoth a headache (hypersphereache?), a circumstance which will shortly after result in the extinction of all life on Earth. See Case Nightmare Green, Nightmare Pink, and Nightmare Chartreuse for more information. See summery file "We're All Going To Die Horribly" for a discussion of the most promising ideas on how to fight or hide from Yog-Sothoth. See companion file "And It's All Your Fault, You Monster," for a discussion of the most positive possible outcomes of making magic public. See file "Burial Arrangements After Researcher Suicide Epidemic" for contact information and current locations of the research team that worked on these reports.
