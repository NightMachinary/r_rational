The other alternative to the Masquerade is that some hidden variable, like say the background level of magic available or the accessibility of the astral plane, and that this variable has changed very recently by a significant amount. You can confirm or rule out this possibility just by waiting a year or two and seeing if anything changes with your magic or other people come out with magic.

  You want to make magic publically known, even if that will cost you your life: it could be that useful to humanity.

How easily can magic be awakened/activated in a person? Viral YouTube video hitting just the right audience to rapidly spread could catch the Masquerade off guard. Alternatively, disguise yourself as a fake Occultist, (IRL, people already believe magic) but give enough hints of real knowledge that your online followers have a decent chance of discovering magic themselves.

Things to check before you go full out spreading magic: how likely is it that magic can allow precognition? How easy is it for magic users to detect other magic users? I think these two questions heavily alter the strategy you want to try.
