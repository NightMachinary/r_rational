Since the masquerade hasn't yet been broken, it follows that other people's attempts to disseminate magic have been suppressed. Anything /you/ can think up is something that one of those other people would have thought up, and therefore would be suppressed too. There's nothing you can do that works.

Most questions of this sort assume you have some special ability or are in some special position, and ask what you can do based on that. This question /sounds/ like it's putting you in a special position, but since the point of comparison is "other people who have found out that magic exists", it really isn't.
