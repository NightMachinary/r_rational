While content starved, I searched WormStorySearch a bunch but found the ratings had an inconsistent relationship with story quality. Searching [[/r/WormFanfic]] I found the following thread, about a year old, which seems like a better metric:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/dtqf7v/im_just_gonna_be_blunt_rec_your_favorite_worm]]

A lot to read there. Not all rational, but at least living up to a community expectation of quality.
