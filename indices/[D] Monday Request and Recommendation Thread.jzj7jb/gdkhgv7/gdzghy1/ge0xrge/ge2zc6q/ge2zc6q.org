The grammar is fine, it's just that the actual sentences themselves sound off.

#+begin_quote
  “But the thing I am even more happy about is obtaining over two hundred thousand terror claw horses. With these horses, uncle can greatly raise his horse group's scale and increase my Ma tribe's supreme might in the coming heroes assembly!”
#+end_quote

It /sounds/ weird because they're translating. Supreme might is probably a word in Chinese, just doesn't transfer so well.
