  I've heard good things about The Power Of Ten: Sama Rantha.
#+end_quote

Sama Rantha /sounds/ good, but in execution it's incredibly irritating and annoying.

Like, the idea of a tabletop munchkin - someone who lives and breathes broken character builds - getting isekai'd into their game of choice, and suddenly being able to put those broken builds into practice would be amazing if done well.

But it's not. The TTRPG system in Sama Rantha appears to be some heavily customized version of D&D 3.5, to the point where it's basically unrecognizable.

Which is fine for a normal story (see Metaworld Chronicles), but with a story about munchkinry it's the first unforgivable mistake the author makes.

See, the fun of a story about build munchkinry is that /you can follow along/. If you're familiar with the system and have access to some of the materials, you too can look up the broken build the author's come up with so far and marvel at it. With a heavily customized system like in Sama Rantha, it just feels like the author is pulling things out their ass. It's totally unclear what rules they're actually adhering to, which makes the munchkin part of the story feel terrible.

The next mistake is with the homebrewed system itself. The fun of munchkining something is directly related to the difficulty of, you know, character optimization. What crazy nonsense do you have to pull to get a normal PC [[http://dictummortuum.blogspot.com/2011/12/lordofprocrastinations-dirty-tricks.html][the beholder mage class?]] What weird contortions do you have to pull to get a Wizard with a starting age of 16?

In Sama Ratha, /the system is trivial to optimize/. For some godforsaken reason the homebrew DM has decided to allow characters to, upon gaining a level, choose to instead /gestalt in a new class/. If you're unaware of the gestalt mechanics in D&D 3.5, they effectively let you gain (say) level 1 in both Fighter and Rogue *at the same time*, taking the attributes of /both/ classes, and picking the better of the two where they conflict (e.g, hit points).

The gestalt mechanics are explicitly noted as being overpowered in the chapter that introduces them, and are suggested only for high-power level games. Not only that, but this homebrewed mechanic makes them /even more powerful/, because it allows you to arbitrarily gestalt /every/ class onto your base class (the standard gestalt rules only let you pick two classes to combine per level, and three is right out)

This means that there's basically zero work that goes in to optimizing a character in the Sama Rantha system. You don't have to choose anything. You can just take everything.

There is a (very minor) limit to this - the game seems to be running on an E6 variant, except in this case it's more like E10. For the uninitiated, D&D eventually goes from "adventuring party fighting against evil" to "optimized magic users kill everything before it can see them". E6 caps character progression at level 6, which is about when fighters are kinda powerful (it's when they get the Leadership feat, and can have a squad of followers) and magic users aren't totally overpowered (they don't have their key "I win" spells yet). E10 would exist in a really awkward spot, where magic users are dominating encounters and fighters are just kinda there.

The last mistake the author makes is "then" / "than" confusion. I don't think there was a single correct usage of then or than in the chapters I read. It was infuriating.
