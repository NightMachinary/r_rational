You might want to start branching out into published lit if this drew you to Worm, etc. I'd say Joe Abercrombie's books tend to revolve arounda theme and have something to say about it, and they're pretty entertaining. I say to start with Best Served Cold, a standalone novel, and give it a full three chapters or so as the first chapter and change are a little slow. You'll know when you hit the part that isn't slow :0
