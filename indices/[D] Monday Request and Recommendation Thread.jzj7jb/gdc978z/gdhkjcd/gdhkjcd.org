You might enjoy /To Be Taught, if Fortunate/ by Becky Chambers. It's about some genetically adapted humans exploring other planets using the "slow way" of space travel where they're in hibernation for decades. Well written, mostly "rational", and asks some big questions. I highly recommend the audiobook version.
