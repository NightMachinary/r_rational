I am looking for stories that have the protagonist end up competent but not op.

To describe it using a metaphor, in some rpg games, you level up your character enough and you'll obliterate most anything low level with little to no effort. I don't want to read stories that have protagonists progress to that level of power.

Instead, I would want them to have Witcher/Dark souls levels of power: you get ultra skilled yes, but even the lowest level creature will murder the crap out of you if you aren't careful, even at higher levels. I put down the Witcher 3 some time ago after gaining quite some proficieny and when I picked it up again, and I find myself dying in comparatively low-level encounters. That's what I want to see in progression for protagonists.

Gilded Hero is a good example.
