So if you look at fiction thats taught in school, you can find things about those books that you can argue the author believes about real life. So when reading Charles Dicken's Great Expectations you can argue that Charles Dickens believes that the best way to be happy is to get along with family and friends. Wildbow's works (thinking of worm and ward here) had alot to do say about trauma and overcoming it. I really enjoyed this aspect of the work in that had a deeper meaning. PGTE and the wandering inn while really interesting have much weaker themes, with PGTE's metaness undercutting them and the wandering inn is more like popcorn then real food. I wanted to know if there are other web based serials out there that have strong themes like worm and ward.
