I counter the rec for Mayor of Noobtown. The first book has promise, but every subsequent book becomes more and more centered around puerile potty humor, culminating in the fourth book, where where the author feels the need to make the MC appear to all his followers as a tiny dick impotent premature ejaculator who rubs gallons of medicine every night on his little floppy worm.

Take a 10 year old's conception of humor, dial it up to eleven, *make it integral to the plot*, and that's this series in a *nut*shell(heh).
