Have you read Ar'Kendrythist? It's a long one, and imo really good one. It's pretty divisive here though.

Savage Divinity is another long one, but not so good one. Like a sine wave of bad and good storytelling, but really long, like 2 million words so far.

I've heard good things about The Power Of Ten: Sama Rantha.

Zombie Knight Saga is really good if you haven't read it.

Honestly there aren't many good progression fantasies that are longer than 300k words that also aren't popular. Here's a few more stories that aren't strictly progression fantasy:

The Demon Lord's Lover is really sweet romance. Think generic isekai world. The mentor of the last generation of heroes falls in love with the demon lord. The worldbuilding and magic is surprisingly good too, and pretty deep.

The Featherlight Transmission is a far future biopunk dystopic murder mystery, with a snarky protagonist like in Dresden Files (but less annoying imo). That should tell you enough. It lives up to expectations too.
