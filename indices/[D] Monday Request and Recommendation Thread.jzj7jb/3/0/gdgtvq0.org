Try Ace of Diamond/Major(This is some giga progression through japanese baseball) for sports.

Chihayafuru and March comes in like a lion are also different takes on progression in Karuta and Shogi respectively.

Honestly Bakuman is my go to recommendation for things like this but you already know about that.
