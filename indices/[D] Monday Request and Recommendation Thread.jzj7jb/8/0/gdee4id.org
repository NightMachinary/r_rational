Game Theory and its sequel Power Games have some really good magitech IMO. They're Nanoha fanfics, but should be reasonably understandable without the source material (though looking up pictures of the characters could be useful). It should be noted that Nanoha itself is a pretty good magitech series itself, though to a lesser degree.

Here's the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/71228][A03 series page]], but there's a ton of background worldbuilding explanations that are collected on the forum [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/power-games-nanoha-fanfic.1294/][here]].

I'll just leave the TvTropes' quote from the author here:

  Oh, Gamesverse. So many collapses. They're standing on the shoulders of so many giants that their heads are brushing the upper atmosphere. Or would be, had most of the giants not tripped one another up, stabbed each other in the kidney and generally fallen over in various different ways, in ages past. So what they're really standing on is a pile of giants' skeletons, some of which have still-spiky bits of ribcage and femur sticking out to gore whoever's currently on top in the ankle.

  ... basically, the Gamesverse has a history of collapses for a very good reason. Which can roughly be summed up with the word "mages".
