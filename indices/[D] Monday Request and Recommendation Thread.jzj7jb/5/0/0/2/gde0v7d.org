That was mostly hyperbole, but it certainly seems that way? I haven't explored enough to be sure. Perhaps not if you constrain to harem novels specifically, but trashy romance novels in general, almost certainly. I got a couple KU-available recommendations from this sub that turned out to be relatively sex-heavy, and my Kindle recommendations very rapidly populated with more of the same, which led me to believe that there was lots out there.
