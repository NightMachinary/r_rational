Even mediocre authors on Kindle Unlimited can make a respectable of money if they can write decent smut/romance, it pays well:

KU pays authors ~$0.005 per page read, so a 60,000 word novel comes out to ~$1 per person who reads (or pages through!) the whole thing. A decent author puts down, say, 1000 words per hour. This means, to meet a $10/hr wage and "break even", only 600 people need to read your novel cover to cover and after that it's pure profit forever since the novel is already written. Add that to the fact that a dedicated reader can chew through that in an afternoon and that series can have very high retention if written with proper cliffhangers and you have a good recipe for making money.
