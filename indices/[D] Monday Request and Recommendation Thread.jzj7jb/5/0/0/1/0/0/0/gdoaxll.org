I have been considering if writing a story about a romance with a shapeshifter might scratch the same preference for variety without attempting to give depth to an impossible number of romances.

The numbers game is inherently the problem. The graph of relationships that matter go up exponentially with the number of people involved, and this becomes unmanageable beyond 3 people - I have read a fair few good triad romances, and heck, many harems are also good.. until girl number 3 shows up, and the author just gives up on having the members of the harem interact with one another, and things get puddle shallow.

OT3s can have all the relationships be meaningful, if the book is not overly short. Beyond that, it just does not work.
