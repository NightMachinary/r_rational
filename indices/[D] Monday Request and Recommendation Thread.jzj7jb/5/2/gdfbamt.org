One of my all-time favorite series, [[https://www.amazon.com/Unsouled-Cradle-Book-Will-Wight-ebook/dp/B01H1CYBS6][Cradle]], is on Kindle Unlimited. It's a progression fantasy where the main character basically spends his time learning magic martial arts, despite starting out crippled. There's lots of slow-burn character development and some damn impressive foreshadowing at times (it was just revealed that certain details from book freaking 1 were foreshadowing twists all the way in book 8).

If you try it, I'd recommend reading at least halfway through book 1 (Unsouled).
