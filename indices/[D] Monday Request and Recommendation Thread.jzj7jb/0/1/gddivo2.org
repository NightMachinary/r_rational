I'm pretty sure it was a Facebook post by Yudkowsky, I've found a line that seems to refer to it:

"You know that hoary old plot, "The elegant vampire, the strong werewolf, and the woman who just can't make up her mind"? I think those stories should just keep going: Introduce the secretive wizard, the innocent catboy, the stonehearted assassin, the shy half-demon, the pirate, the ninja... This is /almost/ the plot of the Anita Blake novels but for some reason Laurell K. Hamilton just sticks to adding more and more lycanthropes and undead to the harem instead of branching out."

It's from [[https://github.com/algroznykh/lw-bot/blob/master/data/fb.txt]] which seems to be various bits of text mined from the LW sphere on Facebook, but I've had no luck searching for that further.
