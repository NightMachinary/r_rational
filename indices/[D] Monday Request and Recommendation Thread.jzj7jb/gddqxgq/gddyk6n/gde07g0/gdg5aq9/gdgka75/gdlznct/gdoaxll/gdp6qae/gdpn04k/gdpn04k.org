The reason you can attach a fair number of significant friends to a romance without running into the same problem is that the relationship between Eves mentor and Sams childhood friend is not important, and can be left out without that being a glaring omission, or included as space permits.

But every edge on the graph of relationships in a poly cluster matters. (even if it is a very unequal one where people only sleep with the protagonist) If Bob, Eva and River are all sleeping with Denver, it is going to seem odd if Bob has no opinions on Eva and River

In a threesome, no problem, 3 bi directional edges, you can explore that without writing the lord of the rings. 4, it is 8. which is "wrist breaking tome" territory.
