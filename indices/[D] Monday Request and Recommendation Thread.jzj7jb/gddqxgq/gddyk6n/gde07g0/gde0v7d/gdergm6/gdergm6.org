Fascinating. Kindle recommendations mostly just throw milSF at me, despite the fact that I probably read more (fantasy/paranormal) romance novels than MilSF (especially if we count stuff like Seanan McGuire's InCrypted series as romance). Maybe it's because I've been reading MilSF on Kindle for longer?
