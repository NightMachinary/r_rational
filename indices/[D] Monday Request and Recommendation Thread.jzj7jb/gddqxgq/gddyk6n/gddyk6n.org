I had Kindle Unlimited for a while. The quality-to-garbage ratio is unfortunately really really low. So if you have some way of searching through it, it can be really great. I found enough good stuff to last me a few months, and then was unable to find more. Not that there wasn't more stuff worth reading out there, I just couldn't find it. I believe the entire Cradle series is on KU, which is very popular on this sub, so I'd recommend starting with that. The author has a couple other series as well that seem well received, but I never got into them.

In my personal experience, unless you like trashy harem romances (no judgement), you'll probably get at most a month or two of value out of KU, then I'd cancel it. If you /do/ like trashy harem romances, well then you are in luck. You will literally never run out of material. I'm pretty sure that books in that genre are being written faster than you could read them, even if it's all you read.

Other than that, I use Kindle as my primary novel reading format these days. If I want to read it, I usually get it on Kindle, both because it's usually cheaper and a lot more convenient to carry around.

Also, if you have a library card, I'm pretty sure that overdrive and other library ebook checkout apps will allow you to download to your kindle.

I personally also don't have an ethical problem with downloading ebook versions of books that I have a physical copy of (either bought in the pre-ebook era or have been gifted), but that's up to you and your personal ethical beliefs I guess.
