[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36983/tower-of-somnus][Tower of Somnus]] by CoCop.

The story is set in a corporate dystopia with a VRMMO added. The premise is that aliens came to Earth to invite humanity into a galactic federation, but were so disappointed by humans they instead left and put an embargo on Earth. Before they left, they gave humanity limited subscriptions into The Tower of Somnus, a VRMMO that would allow for them to improve themselves and interact with other aliens.

The MC is a "runner" which basically entails delivering packages while running away from the cops or gangs. She manages to get a subscription into the Tower of Somnus and is one of the few people who actually meets aliens (mainly because subscriptions are hoarded by the rich who build their own team so they don't have to share), and joins an alien team to climb the Tower. She isn't OP and has to work with limited resources to survive. If she does better than other people, it's largely because she trains hard and gets advice from her alien teammates, who know about the Tower and can giver her advice other people aren't privy to.

The worldbuilding is decent. It's split between cyberpunk (the corporate dystopia the MC lives in) and a more fantasy-ish world of the Tower. Neither are especially unique, but they're consistent and they do feel real enough and lived-in. The alien races are pretty well described, but since we only see them in the game it's a bit limited on what we learn about them.

The writing style is pretty good. I've notice a few grammatical mistakes, but they're fairly rare and nothing major.

If you interested in a story that mixes sci-fi and cyberpunk with fantasy and RPG mechanics, I'd recommend giving this a shot.

A heroine and a villainess get caught up in a transporter accident and isekaied into a fantasy world with and RPG system that likes making puns. The need to learn to survive in their new world using their new powers and whatever knowledge they know from the modern world. The heroine takes the route of a do-gooder. The villainess decides to jumpstart the industrial revolution.

Both MCs are pretty well-written, but the story focuses on the villainess. There's only 16 chapters so far, but we see a fair bit of their character. The heroine who goes out and tries to help people finds out after her first shakedown that doing good is all well and good, but in a broken system (in terms of society) it really doesn't mean much Meanwhile the villainess sets up shop in a poor part of town. She gets some underlings, and while she isn't a stranger to violence to achieve her goals, she starts to value and take care of “her” people.

The world is decent but fairly generic. It's a fantasy world with monsters. Kill some and get experience points. Get XP and improve stats or get abilities.

The writing style is pretty good. Kinda lightehearted, in a "doesn't really take anything seriously" way. I don't remember coming across typos while reading.

All in all it's a pretty fun story. I'm a fan of pragmatic MCs who know how to take stock of what's around them, set goals that aren't ridiculous, and use brain instead of brawn, which is where the story really shines.
