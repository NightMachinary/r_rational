I just go down the list at SV and SB. Most of them are bad but some are decent. None of them I would recommend here as the ones I like are crack and satirical. Nothing rational or realistic takes on the work.

They also have a tendency to die within a month. But that's life reading fanfics. Assume all fics are dead and every time an author posts, it's a pleasant surprise.
