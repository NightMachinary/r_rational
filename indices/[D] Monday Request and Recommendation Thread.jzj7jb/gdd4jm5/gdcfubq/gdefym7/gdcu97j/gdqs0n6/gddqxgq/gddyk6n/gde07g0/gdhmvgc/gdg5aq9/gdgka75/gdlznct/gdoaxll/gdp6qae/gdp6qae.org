I'd have to agree the only place I've seen something beyond an OT3 work has been in some Harry Potter Fanfics where the characters are already well established, and even then I wouldn't call it very good. I'm drawing a blank on the name at the moment, and their are likely a few examples given the pervasiveness of the trope in the fandom.

In any case, the best examples of things near the harem trope I've seen have been a relationship between two characters with a lot of close friendships that never go beyond that. You could conceivably just change a few things to have that be a Harem, but then the authors doing the work for that kind of interpersonal dynamics don't go beyond the traditional relationships. Writing a romance that's good between even two characters is difficult beyond that...

Hmm, I might plug that into the requests next Monday, good Harem story's with emotional development. Rational on top of that might be too narrow. I'd be interested to see it.
