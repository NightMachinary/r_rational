Sleeping with the Girls ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality][Vol. 1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6052381/1/Sleeping-With-The-Girls-Vol-II-Chaos-Theory][Vol. 2]]) is a very solid instance of this. It takes a premise which seems tailor-made for harem shenanigans (self-insert appears in the bed of a different one of his favorite anime characters each time he goes to sleep), but manages to turn it into a survival-focused story instead through the power of Thinking Through The Implications. Elaboration below, if you're okay with the spoileriness inherent in said elaboration.

He keeps on being physically threatened due to the characters in question and those around him very reasonably interpreting his appearance as a result of deliberate action rather than involuntary sleep-teleportation, and the characters doing the threatening are often violence-inclined or Ridiculously Overpowered or both. He keeps on ending up in particularly-lethal anime settings where normal squishy humans are at high risk of being killed. And his favorite characters are generally tsunderes, and sometimes villains, which makes both of the aforementioned factors a whole lot more dangerous.

(And there aren't any particular harem activities, either, aside from those already present in the canons he visits. Or any main-character-centric romance at all, as far as I recall from last time I read it through (which was admittedly a while ago). Which makes sense, given that he's only able to be in a given world for a few days at most before falling asleep and getting yoinked elsewhere, and that's not really much time for relationship-building.)
