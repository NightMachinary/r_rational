A kinda neat one IMO is [[https://dreamsofjianghu.ca/%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-world-of-cultivation/table-of-contents/][World of Cultivation]], which doesn't really have "magitech" so much as it has "xianxia-tech".

It's built in to the world, too - for example, the standard xianxia trope of sound transmission tablets have been turned into a public radio service you can tune in to by running your Qi (termed "lianqi" in the translation) through the appropriate talisman.

Later on, there's even a xianxia-tech MMO that's been running for thousands of years.

The main downside is that, like I said the last time I recommended it, the translation tends to be very "keikaku means plan" - there's perfectly serviceable translations for a lot of the things the translator leaves untranslated, though you can get used to it if you persist.
