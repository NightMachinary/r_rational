"Harem" and "reverse harem" fantasy/science fiction books have been very popular lately. An Amazon Kindle search on "reverse harem" finds over 10,000 matches. Spot-checking suggests that roughly half of them have SF/F elements. A quick check of the ISFDB robot's internal database finds over 4,700 books with the word "harem" in the title, including over 2,500 "reverse harem" titles. And that's just the stuff that /hasn't/ been added to the main ISFDB database (yet).
