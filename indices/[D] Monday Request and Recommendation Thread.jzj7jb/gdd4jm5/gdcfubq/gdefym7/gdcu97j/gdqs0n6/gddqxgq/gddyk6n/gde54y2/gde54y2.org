I also had Kindle Unlimited for a while. I concur that the quality to chaff ratio if pretty terrible, and Amazon's interface makes it near impossible to find things that would fit the user's preferences. I gave up on Kindle Unlimited when I realized that fanfiction websites such as fanfiction.net and archiveofourown.org had a much better selection of amateur works - for free.

That said, I did find a few series on Kindle Unlimited that were worthwhile. For example, Edward W. Robertson's fantasy series are all pretty great (i.e. [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NS88E3G/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i6][The Cycle of Arawn]] and its sequels). Not necessarily rational, but a very enjoyable read nonetheless.

I also thoroughly enjoyed [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LY1S4O0/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0][Icon-Violet]], which is a dystopian scifi story that examines interesting concepts related to AI, ethics, and problems of personal identity. I think it would appeal to people on this sub who like Greg Egan's novels.
