It's really odd, a few of the older ones have a spark of creativity, and the interconnected Universe of [[https://www.amazon.com/Otherlife-Omnibus-Selfless-Trilogy-Books-ebook/dp/B01N23IB1P][Otherlife]] and the other books by the same author were alright for $0.99 at the start.

I've since dropped the series which is a shame, it had a fairly interesting meta-story across all of the different characters worlds with hints towards the larger conflict only resolving if everything was put together.

Each one is the same formula. Protagonist gets power, protagonist (sometimes) protests about the ethics of collecting a harem and perhaps even killing if the world isn't set up to accept killing as a daily thing. Protagonist gets over reservations, gets harem, hint about the Runner Norwood conflict, protagonist kills a bunch of people and perhaps takes some women as conquest, who are not slaves? Somehow.

Drop the harem aspect, combine a bunch of the harem characters into one or two to get the correct story beats, and have emotional bonding actually take time, leave the meta-story in place and it would actually be pretty good. I was really hoping the author would break from the formula once the worlds started crossing over, but nope. So dropped it.

Keep in mind this is one of the better authors for the genre. It's making money so I can't really fault it, but it's pulp fiction.
