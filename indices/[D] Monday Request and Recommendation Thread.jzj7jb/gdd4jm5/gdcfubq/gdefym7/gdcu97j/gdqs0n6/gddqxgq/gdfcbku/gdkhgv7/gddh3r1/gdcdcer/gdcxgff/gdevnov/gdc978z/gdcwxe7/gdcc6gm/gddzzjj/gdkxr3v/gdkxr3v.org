[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26818/god-of-eyes][God of Eyes]] has an atheist reincarnate into a local god in another world, and he slowly comes to grips with his godliness and purpose. I thought the beginning was great, but the ending slowed down a lot.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/][Purple Days]] is a Joffrey time loop fanfic. What I really liked was the exploration of the world rather than focusing on Solving The Conflict. Joffrey gets exposed to many walks of life as he explores the world of GoT in his loops, with each journey teaching him different things. Less focused on the human experience imo, but enjoyable nonetheless.

Maybe Worth the Candle too now that I think about it, although you might have already read that. It's very popular in this subreddit.
