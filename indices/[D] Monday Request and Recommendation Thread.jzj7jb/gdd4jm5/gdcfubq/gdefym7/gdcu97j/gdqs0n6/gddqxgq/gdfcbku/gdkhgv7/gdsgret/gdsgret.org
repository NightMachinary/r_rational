I don't know if it's exactly rational, but I've been following a litrpg type story called the many lives of Candace Lee. It seems to do the reincarnation into another world thing in an interesting manner, and there's definitely a slow progression of power. It only has 40 chapters atm, more with patreon, but I don't know the actual word count.
