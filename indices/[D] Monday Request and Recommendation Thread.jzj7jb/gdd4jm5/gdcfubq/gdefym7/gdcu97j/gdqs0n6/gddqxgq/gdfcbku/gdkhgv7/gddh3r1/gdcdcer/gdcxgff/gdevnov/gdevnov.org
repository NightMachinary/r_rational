It's been a long while since I've recommended anything here. The quality of what I read has slowly edged to a cliff and fallen off.

However, there still are good stories out there. Here's one that I'm happy to share.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16304576/chapters/38136218][Dogs of War (Completed)]]

Fullmetal Alchemist, Roy Mustang, and co along with an army are called to duty for a war none of them wanted.

A bit of spoilers follow. However, if you read this it becomes fairly obvious far before it occurs.

No fuckery with Truth or even focus on alchemy. It's there alchemy and transmutation of the environment yes but it rather used like a tool. Instead, it explores how fast can responsiblity and its consequences age boys into men and beyond. There is no happy ending all around.
