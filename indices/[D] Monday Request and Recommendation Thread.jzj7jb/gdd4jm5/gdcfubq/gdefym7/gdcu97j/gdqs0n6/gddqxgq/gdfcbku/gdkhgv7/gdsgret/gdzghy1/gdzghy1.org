Reverend Insanity fits all of your requirements.

Wuxia cultivation story with an irredeemably evil MC (acts like HPMOR Voldemort to a tee, immortality is his sole goal). Premise is that he transmigrates from Earth, slowly and painfully cultivates to a high level, then manages to reincarnate just before he's killed by everyone he pissed off. Armed with foreknowledge and centuries of experience, he uses a genuinely weak starting hand to progress faster than in his previous life. People look down on him because of his weak aptitude, he has little money and no friends or trustworthy family.

No idiot ball, everyone's scheming. The intellectual agility of it is impressive: even I miss some of the traps they lay for eachother. If something seems odd, it's probably because there's something yet to be revealed.

Also, it's incredibly long. 2000+ chapters and many millions of words. Downsides are that it can get hard to remember all the characters because the Chinese names blur (at least for me). The translation can also get slightly unwieldy at times.
