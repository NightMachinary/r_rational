I'm looking for stories that scratch the progression fantasy itch, but not in a combat based setting. Similar stories would be the mangas "Baby Steps", "Bakuman" and "Hikaru no Go" or the audiobook "quartershare" and its sequels. This progression could be in career, skill, money or whatever, but I'm looking for series where the protagonists make an effort to improve in their field and learn more and become better over time. One aspect that these stories seem to share is some way of measuring the skill of the protagonist whether that is how successful their manga is in sales and reader surveys (Bakuman), the ranking in go (hikaru no go), performance in tennis tournaments (Baby Steps) or education certifications and salary (quartershare). Thanks!
