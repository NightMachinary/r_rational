Does anyone have a link to / remember the name of that short story (it's based on a tumblr writing prompt) where a high school girl juggles a massive number of different supernatural lovers, beginning with the classic vampire and werewolf but also including an angel, demon, pirate, catboy, assassin, wizard, and superintelligence?

Can't find it.
