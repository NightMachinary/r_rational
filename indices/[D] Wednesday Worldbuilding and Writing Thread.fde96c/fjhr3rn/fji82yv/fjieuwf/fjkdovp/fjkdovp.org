If the absorption of ambient magic is itself magical, all you need to do is enchant an object that draws in magic faster/harder than the snakes do, and is capable of drawing down and depleting or disrupting the innate magic of the snakes.

Maybe this is just impossible or prohibitively expensive, but if you produced a bunch of these and toss them somewhere in the ocean, it should draw and starve snakes to death passively. If it draws snakes fast enough, the object could even sustain its own enchantments for a long time on snake income.

Has the interesting side effect of producing large (floating? sunken?) sea serpent graveyards/famine zones/hunting grounds as the magic of the object and its collection of dead and dying snakes starts drawing more and larger serpents.
