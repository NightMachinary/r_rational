Even HP prose is aimlessly and vaguely in theme of British novelist humor, mostly early on. There are moments in which the voice is completely in narration like Dahl or Tolkien or especially Lewis, and not Harry's point of view at all.

It really falls flat with the contrast of the contemporary verisimilitude. Rowling tries to be both cartoonish and realistic, and it always comes off as underdeveloped milquetoast.
