This is an aspect I see too seldom when people discuss the Harry Potter books and certain 'mistakes' JK Rowling made, like the quidditch points system, how ridiculous the teachers treat the children etc. It is because especially in the first book, she was still finding her voice as an author and was very much going into a Roald Dahlesqe direction. So many things are playfully over the top and extreme just to be funny. The ridiculous money system, the quirky way to get into Diagon Alley, the oversized giant Hagrid who lets Dudley grow a pig tail etc etc. She didn't take her own story seriously at this point. And Hogwarts was clearly very much influenced by Roald Dahl's portrayal of schools.
