The only thing I like about the imperial system is that it's easy to divide 12 by 4,3,and 2. Inches are sometimes seems easier to me to use for carpentry than centimeters. Dealing with ratios of 3 and 4 and the fact that 3^{2} +4^{2} =5^{2,} working with triangular shapes can be easier with a 12 inch foot too.

Don't get me wrong though, metric is the superior system. Everything above is just what I noticed about working with the number 12.
