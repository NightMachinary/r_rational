The proper strategy would be for the seeker to prevent the other teams seeker from getting the snitch without actually getting it himself. While one bludger protected both chasers who are all three close together then the second bludger disrupting the other teams two chasers as the huddled together chasers and bludger score goals. Get a larger that 15 goal lead and /then/ go for the snitch.
