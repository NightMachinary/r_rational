I mean there are issues when your matches takes five days to play and can end inconclusively don't you think. The way draws happen is more a consequence of other structural issues rather than the root of them. Similar to issues with snitch scoring.

Edit: also I'm not suggesting cricket is a bad sport, just gave it as an example of a popular sport that gets along just fine and is enjoyable for a lot of people to play and watch but has rules that aren't particularly sensical all the time. That new Zealand England draw was the easiest example I could think of in any sport that had the same issues as the commenter outlined. Sort of saying "you think this is an issue with fiction writing but here's a real world sport that is watched by billions that has similar propensity for silliness"
