Some of my favorite seemingly non logical numerical measurements are quite anthropocentric. Take for example, the mile. The mile is a thousand paces, on average, of a typical Roman Centurion. Nowadays people are taller, and a mile is less than a thousand paces for an average American male. But it but it shows exactly how humanistic some measurement systems are.
