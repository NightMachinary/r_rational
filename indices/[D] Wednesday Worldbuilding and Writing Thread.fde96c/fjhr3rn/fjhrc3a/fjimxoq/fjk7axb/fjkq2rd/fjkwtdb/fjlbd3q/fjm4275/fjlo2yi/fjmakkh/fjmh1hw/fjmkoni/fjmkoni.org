There are pros and cons to imperial units.

One foot for example. A base 12 inches is divisible 2, 3, 4, and 6 whereas metric base 10 is divisible by 2, and 5. Being able to do simple and easy division with crude implements makes for a really robust system. And by crude implements, think a piece of string and chalk or a compass to build ships that can circumnavigate the globe.

It is still almost universal to use non-decimal time keeping. Base 60 for minutes and seconds. Divisible 2, 4, 5, 6, 12, 15, 30. Base 24 (which is base 12 again) hours. Months and such get messy because of lunar calenders and/or religious bickering over the centuries.

Sorry its a bit of a fun thing for me. Star Trek is fun and interesting, but even when you grant that *all* the aliens out there are bilaterally symmetrical (basically human), they all use base 10... when even here on Earth we don't all use base 10 still!
