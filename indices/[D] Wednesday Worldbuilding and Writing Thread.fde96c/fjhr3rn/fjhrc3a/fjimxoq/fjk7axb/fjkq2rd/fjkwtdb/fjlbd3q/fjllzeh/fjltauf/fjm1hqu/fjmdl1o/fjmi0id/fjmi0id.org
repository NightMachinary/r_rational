Draws make more sense in test cricket. If it was sinply based off who scored the most runs over the 5 days the team batting second would be at a huge disadvantage as the team batting first could stall for time and leave insufficient time left for the opposition to challenge their target. That's winning by stalling for time without getting the other team out, completing two innings when their opponents didn't get to. I think in this situation the wider allowance for draws is better than devaluing wins. It's important to acknowledge that in this case a draw isn't solely scores being level, it's essentially a stalemate - no conclusion after 5 days.
