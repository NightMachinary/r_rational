  The thing about the imperial measurement system is that you rarely mix units. It doesn't matter that a mile is a goofy number of feet, because you're never going to measure something more than a few hundred feet long in feet.

I'm an American surveyor. We use state plane coordinate systems. They get into the hundreds of thousands, even millions of feet. This isn't usually a problem, except that there are different feet! The US Survey foot is 1200 / 3937 meters long. The International foot is 0.3048 m long, I think. A difference of 2 ppm. It's never an issue, until you get coordinates that you think are in ift, but are actually in USft. Then your building ends up 0.5' this way or 4' that way.

Oh, we use northings and eastings, too.

Luckily, the NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology I think, is abandoning the US Survey foot in 2022. The International foot will become known as the foot. Except, since surveyors are part field engineer and part historian, we'll never truly get rid of the US survey foot.

Man, if only we made it all the way to metric back in the 90s... We'd probably have universal healthcare by now.
