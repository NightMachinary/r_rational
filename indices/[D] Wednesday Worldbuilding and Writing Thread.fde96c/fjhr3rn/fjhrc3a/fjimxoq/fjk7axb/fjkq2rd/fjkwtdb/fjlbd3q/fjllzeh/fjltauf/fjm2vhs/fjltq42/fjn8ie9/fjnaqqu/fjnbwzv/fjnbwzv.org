Thanks - I was obviously mis-remembering wherever I read it. The absurdity of the scoring system used to be one of the gaping plot absurdities critics pointed out in the books / films. Some of which were deliberate absurdities by Rowling - others retconned afterwards with varying degrees of success.

Presumably because some people just don't want to hear "it's fiction" as an explanation...
