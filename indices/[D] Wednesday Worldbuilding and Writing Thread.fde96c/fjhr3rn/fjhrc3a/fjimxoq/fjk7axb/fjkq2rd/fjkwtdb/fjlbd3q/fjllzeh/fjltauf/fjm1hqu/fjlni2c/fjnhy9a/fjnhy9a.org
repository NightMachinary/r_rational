I think the problem is that in terms of game design, it's not well balanced. The snitch is worth not just more but /exponentially/ more than the quaffle-points, so after awhile why would any team bother with any strategy that did anything but maximize their seeker? and the audience would know too so why would they watch the regular gameplay?

Also I don't know if I agree with your argument that the specific points go into season-long standings, I remember a lot of times where the kids talked about one house having to beat another to change the rankings but I don't remember any point where they talked about a house having to win/lose by X amount.
