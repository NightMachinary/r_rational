Sorry to be rude, but as a teacher myself, you really have drunk the koolaid with some of these. Professional growth plans are not, never have been, and never will be about professional growth. Likewise, observations are not about feedback, they are about ammunition. I know blah blah â€˜I feel sorry that you have a bad administration but mine aren't like that'. But really it's the same for you, you are just unaware of it.

Average supported kids from a small community like magical Britain actually don't need explicit reading instruction at a middle school age. They can pick it up naturally through the extensive reading and writing practice they get in normal course work. Like, outside of the ridiculous nightmare scenario that are many schools now, normal kids don't need a reading class. Average kids don't fail a reading test that is 4 levels below their age 8 times in a row. And you'll see it - every single one of them fucking swims, even longbottom.

I would also say it's ridiculous to say that there aren't practical assignments since they are constantly making potions and practicing charms in class. They just get theory for homework.

Spot on with the trauma and vulnerability to assault though. Wealth disparity ain't to bad though - the Weasley's are doing rather well imo considering they own a big house on a nice plot of land and they are the absolute poorest.
