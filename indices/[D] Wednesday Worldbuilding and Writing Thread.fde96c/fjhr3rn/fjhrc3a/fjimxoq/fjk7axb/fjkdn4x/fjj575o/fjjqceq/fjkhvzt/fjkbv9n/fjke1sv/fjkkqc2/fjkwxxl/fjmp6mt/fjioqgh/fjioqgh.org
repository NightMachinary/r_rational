Holy shit, this was awesome, funny, and kind of depressing all at once. The things that must have happened in Hogwarts that we never saw. I almost want to steal this as a giant list of things Charity would insult Dumbeldore with. Thanks for the feedback as it has been a long time since I've been in a classroom.
