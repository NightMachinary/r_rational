Agreed. I went to British boarding schools for most of my education, and Hogwarts is just a 'delightfully' eccentric version of the very old ones - right down to the ancient disused bathrooms that no one goes in because they're probably haunted.

Check out the Prince Phillip and Prince Charles go to Gordonstoun episodes of The Crown for more background on the 'sink or swim', Lord of the Flies atmosphere of some of the more harsh boarding schools.
