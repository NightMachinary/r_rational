Again- in the sort of pre-70's British education system Rowling is riffing on, university was still not the norm (just 4% of school leavers went to university in the UK in the early 1960s), even for people who did go on to A Levels after O levels. The expectation was that many of these would go into white collar jobs that didn't require a degree which in the 60s would have been most of them. I'd point out that even the contemporary UK doesn't have a real equivalent to the community college concept.

Hermione and the like will be expected to learn on the job as apprentice aurors or what have you, much as your average new professional circa 1965 would. Or even to look at my system here in Singapore- the majority of teens (80%) don't go on to a pre university course after their O levels at 16. They go to a polytechnic to get an industry related diploma (eg in IT or mechanical engineering or industrial design or what have you) and only the top 20% of that group will go on to university. For most of them it's a 3 year diploma and entry into the workforce at 19/20.

You're right that the /complete/ absence of any tertiary education is weird but the wizard community is tiny and presumably your learning and performance on the job are judged informally by /everyone/ in your field. You don't necessarily need accredited degree courses when the fifty people in the country who specialize in your field will all likely be acquainted with you. They're also longer lived than muggles which presumably allows for a much longer on the job apprenticeship.

And besides a university implies a society which is developing and engaging actively with the world around it where the wizarding world is a stagnant, complacent and racist dystopia. They don't care about new ideas. Harry gets to live out his smug self centred life of privilege. Hermione is likely on track for crippling depression as she ages.
