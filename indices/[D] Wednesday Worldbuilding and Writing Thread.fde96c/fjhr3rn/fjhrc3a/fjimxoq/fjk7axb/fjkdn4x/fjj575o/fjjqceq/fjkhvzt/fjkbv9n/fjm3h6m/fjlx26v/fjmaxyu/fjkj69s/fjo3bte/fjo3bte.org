I can't speak for how things were 50+ years ago (where most of the tropes JKR references came from) but certainly not in the modern system. I went to one of the 'old' British boarding schools and there were no problems along those lines. The dorm environment is not a "nightmare scenario"; at least these days teachers (and prefects) take their responsibilities of care very seriously. If something like that happened it would make it's way around the grapevine very quickly and I can't imagine anyone (least of all the other pupils) treating it lightly.
