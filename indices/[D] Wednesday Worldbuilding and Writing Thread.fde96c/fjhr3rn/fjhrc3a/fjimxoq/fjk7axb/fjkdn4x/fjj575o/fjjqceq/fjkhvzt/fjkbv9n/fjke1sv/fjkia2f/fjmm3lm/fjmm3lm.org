Bellwork was a new concept for me as a Canadian, so were rubrics, pertaining to school work.

Lots of what OP wrote was strange and unknown to me, partly due to not being part of the education system, partly due to being educated in the 80s. But I think of my dad's education, and it was even more barebones and entirely sufficient, and my grandmother, who even went to a one room school house. One upside for her: it was on their farm, and she could run home for a hot lunch. My eldest aunt went to a boarding school, not sure why.

Part of what was written also struck me as being based in particular American obsessions with control and bureaucracy breathing down on teacher's necks. Its like the school board is disciplinarian to teachers as teachers are to students. They never let the work force grow up.
