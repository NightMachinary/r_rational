Where I teach there are perhaps 28-30 per class. The differentiation would be more in how the students access the material.\\
For example if you had a lesson on x,y,&z you would have your 3 basic levels; higher, middle and lower. The extra would be the personalised sentence starter for one student. Perhaps a key word list for another. A step by step check list. A selection of small tasks for students who have short attention spans and are likely to disrupt the lesson. Yes you would build this material over a few years but being an outstanding teacher is about tailoring the material to the students needs and helping them access it. I would also hope that you would want to refresh your material every (I chose to review and refresh each year) few years to keep it up to date and relevant.

Do you have experience teaching? If so in what context and country. I understand there might be cultural and subject differences.
