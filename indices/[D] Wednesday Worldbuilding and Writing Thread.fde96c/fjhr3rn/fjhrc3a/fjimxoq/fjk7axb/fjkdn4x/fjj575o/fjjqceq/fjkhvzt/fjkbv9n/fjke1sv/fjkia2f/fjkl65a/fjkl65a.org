Yup. Wizarding Britain is tiny, but has a lot of old money and a lot of power politics, and Hogwarts is something of a chokepoint for the education of up-and-coming wizards and witches, and thus a notable national asset to have influence over. I'm not surprised that the Board of Governors might have set all kinds of horrible requirements and policies over the centuries, interfering with the actual process of education and making sure any actual teachers certainly had no power to change or improve anything.
