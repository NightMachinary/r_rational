Sure, and I applaud that. In the same way we tweak our courses year by year. For example now we deliver a lot of our content and analytical skills instruction through 15 min videos which frees up class time for group discussion and writing skills- flipped classroom as you say.

Maybe it's just a different way of looking at things- when you said you spend an hour planning for every two hours of class time it just struck me as an awful lot. I guess if I sat down and looked at how much time it took my department to work on the materials we use every year I might come up with a startling total. Of course every three years when the texts change we go into overdrive writing and recording new material.

But from the impression I get of American timetables I suspect we may have more free periods than y'all do. On an average day I might have two to three hours of classes and my colleagues at secondary and primary level might have five or so hours.
