Okay, so name anther job where the starting salary is "closer to $40k" that requires post grad work?

And you don't get paid for the months you aren't working. Teachers also work, on average, 50+hours a week. Take those extra hours every week and most teachers are working the same number of hours per year that other professions do, WITHOUT extra pay.
