100% agree with this. I spent some time in a boarding school in the 2000s and it fits /many/ of the Hogwarts "problems". Hell, even the state schools in the 1990s/2000s did. There were no PTAs, notetaking/written work was a huge part of schooling, you literally did pick a life path at age 14 when you decided what GCSEs you were going to take (and your A Levels after that). None of the American "well, we'll teach you these extra subjects too just because," I only studied four subjects for my last two years of school and good luck to you if you change your mind on your future degree once you've started that. I've never even /heard/ of bellwork. And as for lessons on study skills and how to learn, lol.
