I have five and a half hours of classes in two subjects and an hour and a half of planning time, which is used for meetings two days a week. We have very little in the way of resources, though that has drastically improved in the time I've been there. In the time I've been teaching, standards have changed or the subject I've been teaching has changed. This is context not a complaint, I could always get another job.
