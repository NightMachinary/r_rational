  What do you mean by "my staff?" Are you a teacher, administrator, or both?
#+end_quote

Both. I'm a subject head- I still teach but am also in charge of the administration of my subject. For example when we set an examination, I ultimately have to sign off on it. On a level beyond the school, it's ny responsibility to liaise with the Ministry of Education for matters pertaining to my subject.

It also means I have certain other responsibilities in the administration of the school (eg chairing or assisting to chair specific committees) and in managing the staff in my academic department.

  And as for pre-university, does this mean students of 14-18 years old who are put in a specific track? Or do they choose the track? How does that work?
#+end_quote

17-18 year olds actually. The rule of thumb here in Singapore is that everything boils down to competitive national examinations. So after primary education at age 12 the entire cohort sits for a national examination. They're accepted into secondary schools based on their results. Other factors may play a part- sports or other co curricular prowess but the nain factor is the examination.

Secondary school is four years (there are other permutations but let's keep it simple) and at age 16 the cohort sits another national examination known as the O level. This basically splits them into three tracks

10% of the cohort go into vocational education.

About 70% of the cohort will go to polytechnics for a three year diploma that's career focused, for example in a specific branch of engineering, business, design, nursing. The course focuses heavily on preparing students for the workforce and the bulk of them will enter the workforce at 19 after their diploma. The top 20% or so of the polytechnic cohort are likely to be accepted into university to continue their specific field of study.

The remaining 20% of the O level cohort go into pre university. They get an education that isn't industry focused but us classically academic, studying three or four subjects fron the sciences or arts- physics, maths, literature, history etc. This is a two year course which culminates in another national examination called the A level which is intensely high pressure and serves as a university entrance exam. Unlike the polytechnic diploma an A level cert has little value in the workplace- pre university students are expected to go to university. The tradeoff is that A levels give you a broader base. A polytechnic student may have studied mechanical engineering and is prepped for that specific major at uni but a pre university student has taken a variety of academic subjects that allow entrance into a variety of majors. I've taught literature to students who have gone on to law, engineering, business, drama, the humanities, science degrees, medicine and so forth.
