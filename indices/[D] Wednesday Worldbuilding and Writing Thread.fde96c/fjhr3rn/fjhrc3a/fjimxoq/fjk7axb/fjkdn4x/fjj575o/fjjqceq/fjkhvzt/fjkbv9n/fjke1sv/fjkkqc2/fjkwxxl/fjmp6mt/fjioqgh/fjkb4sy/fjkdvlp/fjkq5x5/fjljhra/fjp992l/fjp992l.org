  level 3DazzlerPlus4 points · 1 day agoSorry to be rude, but as a teacher myself, you really have drunk the koolaid with some of these. Professional growth plans are not, never have been, and never will be about professional growth. Likewise, observations are not about feedback, they are about ammunition. I know blah blah ‘I feel sorry that you have a bad administration but mine aren't like that'. But really it's the same for you, you are just unaware of it.Average supported kids from a small community like magical Britain actually don't need explicit reading instruction at a middle school age. They can pick it up naturally through the extensive reading and writing practice they get in normal course work. Like, outside of the ridiculous nightmare scenario that are many schools now, normal kids don't need a reading class. Average kids don't fail a reading test that is 4 levels below their age 8 times in a row. And you'll see it - every single one of them fucking swims, even longbottom.I would also say it's ridiculous to say that there aren't practical assignments since they are constantly making potions and practicing charms in class. They just get theory for homework.

I think you misread my post. I explicitly said I have a professional growth plan (which is largely paperwork) then a personal one that I actually follow because I want to try new things, learn, and grow. Maybe you don't or something. So I spent one year on making groupwork more effective, another on making class more fun, etc. I was talking more about mentoring and lead teacher stuff, rather than admin stuff. This year I started teaching an entirely new subject; I asked the Assistant Principal to come in and show me some new ways of doing things because it wasn't working. The class is going much, much better now and I'm starting to see some critical thinking progress. Hogwarts will knowingly let teachers flounder for years, like Trelawney or Lockheart.

I said nothing about a reading test, and I'm not talking about early literacy like being able to sound out words. I'm talking about knowing what subheadings do, picking out key details, guessing word meanings from roots, the difference between a narrative and an article, evaluating sources, understanding the way paragraphs are organized etc. Literacy as a tool rather than a practice. Some will pick it up themselves, many won't without explicit instruction. Remember that 16% of kids have an IQ below 85; that's not a small fraction. I think you mean normal and average mean like yourself rather than any established or mathematical definition of the word.

Furthermore, a lot of these kids /aren't/ supported well. A lot of them have crummy home lives because their parents are dead or in jail. We know that stress has an impact on IQ. Harry's class is probably full of worse readers than the average British school child.

They probably pick up the skills they do because the skills they're required to learn aren't that hard. Even then, isn't a little weird that they don't seem to practice meditation even though there's a direct emotional component to some spells?

Speaking of reading skills, I said Hogwarts /did/ practical assignments and groupwork. However, we see precious few long-term assignments and little of their practical education results in something durable. Writing a quick page long essay requires a different set of skills than writing a 7 page paper, which requires different skills from a 20 page one. I learned far more writing one 20 page paper in high school then I did from ten 2 page papers.
