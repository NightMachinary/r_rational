1 day prepping, go back for 1 day teaching, go back twice for 2 days relaxing. Only 50% workdays.

Then again, you age at 3-4 times the normal rate. Start teaching in 1990 at 20y/o, and 40y of teaching would leave you retiring in 2000 at 60y/o. Instead of living to 2050, you only get until 2020. (Worse if wizards and witches live longer, as more time is spent repeating the same day).
