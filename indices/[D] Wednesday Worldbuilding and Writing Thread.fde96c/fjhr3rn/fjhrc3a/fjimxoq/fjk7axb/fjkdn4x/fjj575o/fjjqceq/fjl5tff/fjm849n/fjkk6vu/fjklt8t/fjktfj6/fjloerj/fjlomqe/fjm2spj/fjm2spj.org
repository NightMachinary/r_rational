That happens in the UK system now, the NEWTS and OWLS system in the books is basically the GCSE and A-Levels system in the UK at the moment, at the age of about 14/15 you pick GCSE's, you have to do the core ones at a basic level, but if you don't pick certain ones you're kind of fucked if you want to do them later.
