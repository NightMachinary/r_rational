I'll add a few:

- Other than "don't use unforgivable curses" there's not a single hint of Magical Ethics training. About the closest you've got is Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration which basically handwaves creating money from nothing thus obviating magical ethics vis a vis the economy.
- As [[http://hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] rightly points out, Hogwarts basically completely neglects every mundane subject. The first time we hear about math, for example, is the third year *elective* Arithmancy. At that age, they should be doing ALGEBRAmancy
- I thought standardized testing in the US was high stakes, but dang those OWLs. While the SAT does play into college admissions, no employers anywhere ask about it.
- Even setting aside mundane electives, where's the MAGICAL electives for magic photography or talking paintings? I guess there's the school choir, but is that really a class or basically just show choir?
