I do wonder how much of the prepping, marking, and other administrative work could be semi-automated with magic. There are not only house-elves for anything physical that needs acquiring and prepping, there are automatic quills and, most likely, branches of library magic dealing with automatic analysis of writing. Not to mention it doesn't need to go through a digitisation process first. The kids hand their essays in, they all float into a pile, and an analysis spell or artifact pre-grades them, magically marks the relevant parts for your perusal, then parades them in front of your face at your choice of speed. You make any fine-tuning corrections to 80% of the essays and their marks with a finger-twitch of your wand, then go back and put a little more time into the top and bottom 10%. And that's assuming you don't have access to mental magics which can speed up and improve the accuracy of your marking/assessment.

Some of it, too, I imagine, might be solely due to the books being set in the 1990s. I went through school in the late eighties, and a lot of the things you mention never existed. I never saw a rubric until I hit university. Disability access plans were crude or nonexistent (we didn't even have wheelchair ramps to access half the school, let alone anything for neurodivergent students. And yes, there was a kid in a wheelchair). Career counselling consisted of a handful of posters at the back of some of the classrooms with the names of various jobs related to that classroom's subject. The first I've ever even heard of bellwork was literally your post. If there were any student clubs at all, I never encountered hide nor hair of them. And barring P.E., non-paper subjects, where they existed at all, were options and decidedly non-core.

This was in a first-world Commonwealth country, in a school generally considered to be quite progressive and financially secure. And somehow, I would imagine that Magical Britain is not necessarily entirely devoted to following the changes in Muggle educational standards from year to year.

And, of course, as with practically all adult institutions in childrens'/YA novels, it's deliberately bizarre and weird and at least partly incomprehensible, with little in the way of explanation for anything. As well as being a pastiche of British boarding school cliches (and magical-school cliches) from decades, if not centuries, of childrens' literature.
