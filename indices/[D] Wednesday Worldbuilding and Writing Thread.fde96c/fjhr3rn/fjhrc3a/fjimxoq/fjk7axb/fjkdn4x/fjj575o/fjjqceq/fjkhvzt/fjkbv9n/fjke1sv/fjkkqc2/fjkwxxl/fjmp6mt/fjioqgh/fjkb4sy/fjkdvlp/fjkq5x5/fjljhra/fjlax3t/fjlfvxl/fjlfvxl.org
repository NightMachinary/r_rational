Others have mentioned the fact that a lot of your criticisms are actually down to Rowling parodying boarding school stories. I'm going to comment on some of the systems structures which you note.

I teach in a system based on the pre-Comprehensive English system (Singapore, though we've further developed that system) which is another aspect of Rowling's parody and I'd just note a couple of other things.

Your assumptions about regimented lesson planning and the like are very much an American thing (and are frankly a bit of a stereotype about the crippling bureaucracy of the American variant of the profession).

We tend to have rigorous planning as student teachers and beginning teachers but after that this is by no means standard. As a department head in a high school equivalent I don't really expect my teachers to document lesson plans. We have a scheme of work showing everyone where we need to be (shared with the students as well with the admin details left off) and we get on with it.

As for choosing your path at 14, yes rhe system is much more differentiated than the American system. OWLS and NEWTS are basically O and A levels. O levels (at 10th grade) determine what sort of institution you go into next (here in Singapore a polytechnic for career specific education, a technical school for vocational education or a pre-university for A-levels which prep you for university). This is again quite similar to the pre 1970s English system (with the difference being that in that system most people would leave school after O levels). Most people do have to choose their broad path at age 16- here most of them are going to polytechnics so they're going to have to decide between business ed, electrical engineering etc. Even the 10% who qualify for the pre university course are going to have to specialise in either Arts or Sciences at A level.

Hogwarts exaggerates but systemically it's based on a different educational structure than the American one.
