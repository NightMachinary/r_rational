  The dormrooms are a nightmare scenario. Rape, especially homosexual rape, would happen. These kids are extremely poorly supervised. Prefects in general could make the lives of their charges hell. Similarly, the position would attract magic pedophiles.

Is rape even a thing in the magic world? Love potions no one brought up rape. Don't think rape or assault in general are things in the Wizarding World

Also remember that Hogwarts is basically a 1920s boarding school complete with culture so comparisons should lie between then and there. I'd be surprised if parents would allow stuff like sex ed as they wouldn't have back then.

Agreed that PTAs would not help, don't allow the parents to keep the school backwards

  On a great day, prepping for each class takes 45 minutes. Average day, an hour, busy day two.

I was an English teacher and I did not spend that long prepping for each class. I dunno if that's foreign language classes but still how would you have time for classes?

  There's no mentoring for teachers, no observations from senior staff, and no feedback how you're doing as a teacher. Dumbledore should get off his ass and go room to room at least once a week.

The Hogwarts is in the 90s, I don't know about your experience but my school certainly never had another teacher observing any classes. I speak as someone who was educated in Scotland though not in a boarding school up north

  There are no inclusion plans for students with disabilities, magical or otherwise. Hogwarts' attitude towards neurodifferences seems to be fuck off cripple.
#+end_quote

Again this is the 90s a muggle public teacher isn't coming from the future

  There is no formalized discipline system. Classroom discipline is barbaric and frankly illegal sometimes
#+end_quote

??? Illegal? What access do you have to the wizarding world laws that would make you think it's illegal?

Corporal punishment in the UK was banned in 1999. You're applying modern sensibilities, and apparently modern laws, to 30 years ago and a different legal system. I'd love some quotes from JK on what at Hogwarts was illegal, I'd be surprised if there's anything
