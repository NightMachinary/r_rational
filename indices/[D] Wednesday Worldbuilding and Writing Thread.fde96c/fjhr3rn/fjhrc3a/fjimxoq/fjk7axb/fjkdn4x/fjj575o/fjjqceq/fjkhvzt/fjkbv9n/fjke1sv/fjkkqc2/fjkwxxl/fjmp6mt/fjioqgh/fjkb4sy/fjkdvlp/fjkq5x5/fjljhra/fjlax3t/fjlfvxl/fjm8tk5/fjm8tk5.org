I didn't downvote you, but I have to disagree with you here. My issue is that for the vast majority of students, their degree from Hogwarts is a terminal one. The only profession that I remember getting more training was doctors. The problem is there seems to be no magical equivalent of community college. High school should be a terminal /option/, but a kid like Hermione is not going to reach her full growth in two years.
