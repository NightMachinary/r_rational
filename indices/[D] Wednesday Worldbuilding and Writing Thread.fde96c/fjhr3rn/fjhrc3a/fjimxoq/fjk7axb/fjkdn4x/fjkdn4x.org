Harry Potter books lack a lot in some areas, and I'll be honest I stopped bothering after that tri wizard cup thing. But I do feel it is important to note that the audience is children and from what I recall as a child in school, this seemed fairly accurate portrayal of how middle school FELT.

Let me be clear, all the points above are valid. But as a kid, it never really felt like there was proper supervision, it never felt like class expectations were clear, we never knew the teachers had prep time, grading time, that there were teachers beyond the ones we interacted with, or that they would have their own growth plans, etc.

Much of this is not in the books because kids themselves are entirely blind to them.
