While this sounds great it is a really impractical way of killing wizards, see bubble charm. Nobody in their right minds has reagents for really deadly gases at home, and the common Chlorine gas doesn't incapacitate wizards fast enough. Maybe go with a fat splash of hydroflouric acid? But then you have the problem that everyone has been taught potions at Hogwarts so they take potion splashes seriously. (see dragonskin gauntlets in shopping lists).
