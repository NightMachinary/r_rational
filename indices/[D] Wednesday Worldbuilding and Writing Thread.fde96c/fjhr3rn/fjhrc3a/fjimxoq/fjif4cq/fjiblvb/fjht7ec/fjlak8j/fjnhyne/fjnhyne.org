I wrote a fan fic as a teen about the idea of summer school to catch people up actually! It was not good of course but still a fun idea!

I would add to [[https://www.reddit.com/user/somerando11/][somerando1]]'s list:

â€‹

- Field trips. Kids like Harry are totally clueless about the magical world. Why do they not visit the Ministry? They could shadow wizards at work even!
- Student exchanges - the Triwizard should not be the only way to learn about other schools
- Parent teacher meetings - it seems like parents only find out what is going on when there is a huge problem and then they send a howler. Parents from each house should visit for a weekend, talk with teachers and make sure kids are eating right and cleaning up after themselves and doing their HW... maybe even attend the supposedly super important Quidditch matches
- More health focus - yes there are a lot of stairs but I would definitely have gotten fat eating Hogwarts food. There needs to be exercise and a salad bar!
- Peer tutoring/mentoring system - the older students should be matched with the younger ones to explain things like sorting, clubs and help with homework troubles
