Ah, well the issue was how much she can realistically expect to change with the wizard government at the moment. The plan was to start with small things that no one will object to and seem like common sense. Perhaps coloring it as a way to push back against dumbledore to gain some pureblood support as she makes no secret that she does not particularly like or trust his competancy at anything but magic all that much. I imagine that the changes will have to be small and very gradual throughout the years Harry is there.
