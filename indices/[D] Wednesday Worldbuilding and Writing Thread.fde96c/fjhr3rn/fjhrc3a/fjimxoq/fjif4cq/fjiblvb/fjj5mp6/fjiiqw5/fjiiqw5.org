Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, there wasn't a lot about the Hogwarts board of governors and how certain things work. Well, this is supposed to be a rational fic so Charity learns a lot about logic, the importance of research, and looking for new avenues to succeed. She is actually not a very powerful or skilled witch but she is intelligent, willing to learn/hire experts, and unlike everyone else brainwashed through Hogwarts to never interact with the muggle world, actually prefers how muggles do things. The magical world has no idea that she is the wealthiest witch in Britain by a huge amount and she arrives back into the magical society like a bomb going off.

The catalyst for this wealth is Margaret Thatcher ending the free school milk program in 1971. Charity teaches at a very poor school at the start of the story as she feels bad about messing with the minds of muggles and the only place she can really find a job is a place desperate enough to hire her. She starts using magic constantly to improve and repair things for her students when she realizes just how harder it is for muggles who are poor. After Thatcher, she becomes determined to figure out a way to finance and improve her school so she starts studying economics, taxes, and funding.

She does a few of the usual tricks fanfics do for earning money using magic. After she gets a rude reception in Gringotts, she gets high-interest loans from muggle banks then buys up old homes and properties then using magic to repair/sell them and figures out that there are more valuable materials than gold that the wizarding world does not track. Then she discovers that Gringotts doesn't seem to have savings or investment accounts and sees an opportunity.

She hires two teenage squibs from pureblood families who know nothing of the muggle world and pays for a magic vow to be performed. She will support/pay for their education in economics and business in return for loyalty and agreeing to work for/advise her. The squibs grow up, earn degrees in business and use magic to create a competitor to Gringotts with ties to muggle banks in other countries with more lenient laws with muggles.

So she is a rational problem-solver with very, very, deep pockets when she is hired by at Hogwarts. She finances a modern political campaign to get preferred candidates in the ministry of magic, hires squibs in mass as they have more rights than muggles do/have pureblood relatives, creates a rival newspaper/radio network to push her viewpoints, and is willing to fight with indirect methods when she sees how little Dumbledore has done to push back against the viewpoints of the death eaters. She has studied history and knows what has and hasn't worked in the muggle world to enact real political change.

Her first act at Hogwarts is paying for more teachers, tutors, and a counselor. Instead of one potion teacher, there are now 3. Snape only has to deal with the advanced students. Hogwarts also offers more classes and alternatives that students are not required to take but it is gradually noticed that kids who are taking basic classes in math or writing become better students and do better than those that don't like the purebloods.
