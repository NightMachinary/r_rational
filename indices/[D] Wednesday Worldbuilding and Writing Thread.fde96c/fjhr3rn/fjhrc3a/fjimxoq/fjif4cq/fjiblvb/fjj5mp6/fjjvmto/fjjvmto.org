Owls for mail and I recall there being a catalog? Though a bookstore full of school essentials I could see being useful.

As for hanging out there's the library, the lake, abandoned classrooms, the cafeteria? Meal hall?, and the quidditch stands.

Thinking about it a Hogwarts general common room would be nice. I imagine a pool table being in it. Oh and house buddies not in your house could happen too I guess but POOL TABLE.
