  I don't actually know how well Hogwarts handles this, and in the real world, having Gifted & Talented programs on the one hand and Special Needs on the other isn't something that all schools have the budget (or size) for.

This was very common in the 90s so I'd be surprised if a Muggle teacher had experience with segmented classes.

Scotland only introduced differentiated classes for the same subject in 1986 for example: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Grade]]

And you'd still share classes with such a small student body size anyway, perhaps not arranging classes by houses but then you run into timetabling issues and numbers.

I don't think there's any testing anyway which could be used to determine where to place a student. Those homeworks they do aren't recorded and databased or anything. Probably tossed away after returned to the student after marking.
