another couple of things that are /super obvious/ but I didn't realize were missing until I read Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy:

- There's no school store. Where do kids get the essentials like quills and parchment and candy from? They can't all stock up during the break, kids forget (or misplace, or destroy) things all the time. They're not allowed into Hogsmeade until like fifth(?) year, and even then it's only weekend trips. Fred and George must make the majority of their money just selling essentials to other kids, nevermind the prank materials.
- There's no official places to hang out, aside from the house-specific common rooms. So students resort to weird (and unsanitary) places like the second-floor girls bathroom.
