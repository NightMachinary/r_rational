- What are the psychological differences between these people? That is to say, what "universal experiences" or "universal emotions" are they missing, if any? I think there's a temptation to make each fantasy species a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats][Planet of Hats]], which can be fine depending on what you're going for, but where I think things can get interesting is where base biochemistry is different in ways that give rise to cultural differences. An example might be a species that has virtually no sense of taste, instead relying on sight to inspect their food, which would have wildly different traditions and cultural associations with foods.
- What are the cultural differences between cultures within the same species? No one is going to expect you to go all out, but adding in two or three major cultures to each species with ways to distinguish between them is neat, and really adds some depth to a species.

More specifically to multiple species:

- How and why do multiple species exist on the same world? I don't particularly think that you need a clever answer to this, but some people get hung up on it, rather than accepting it as a story conceit.
- Where do these species collide with each other, and where are they in agreement? What traits have they shared? Can they interbreed?
- In what ways do these species have to accommodate one another, or fail to do so? If, say, dwarves get sick from inconsistent levels of vitamin K, do restaurants print vitamin K levels for all their food? Are seats generally made to be adjustable, or do most places have booster seats for non-human guests? How high are ceilings? How high is the average step? There are a ton of little things you can add in (or specifically note) which will help sell a multi-species world. (The vitamin K example was something that I had to be aware of in real life, as I was cooking for someone on Warfarin for about six months. For real-world examples, I think the closest we have is either differences in religious observations, or disabilities.)
