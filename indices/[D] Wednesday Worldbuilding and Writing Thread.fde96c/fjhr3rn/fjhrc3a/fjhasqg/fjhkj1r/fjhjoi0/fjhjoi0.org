Questions that are probably important to answer:

1. Why hasn't one race killed off the other race/s? Neanderthals were either killed off or just out-competed in their hunting grounds. Even different geographic preferences didn't really save the Neanderthals.
2. Is there a compelling reason for cohabitation? This fits in with the last question. But if the races compete for similar resources (food, territory, etc) there should probably be a good reason why they are living and working together rather than killing each other off. In different human cultures around the world, successful racial minorities have faced persecution and theft from the dominant local majority (this doesn't only apply to the Jewish people, Han Chinese, Muslims in India, etc have experienced similar problems).
3. What is the power structure that allows for cohabitation? I have to imagine that if any race remotely similar to humans comes into power they will abuse the position to favor their own race.
