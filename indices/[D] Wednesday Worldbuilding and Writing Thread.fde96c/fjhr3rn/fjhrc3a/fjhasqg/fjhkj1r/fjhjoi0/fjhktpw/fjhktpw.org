Can they interbreed? If yes, what cultures do they have that the races haven't melded over the millennia? If no, why haven't they wiped each other out like it seems early humans did to other closely related species?

I'm not saying don't use multiple species, I'm just saying without interbreeding or some kind of necessity to work together earlier, less civilized generations would probably not have gotten along easily if they occupied the same lands. For example, let's say you have an at first healthy city with free trade in peaceful lands. You'll have some rich and skilled human merchants/landlords/business people, and some skilled elven business people. Fifty years later, most or all those skilled human entrepreneurs will be dead, but the elves are still there, still just as talented, and much more experienced. Now, some of the rich humans will have talented children or grandchildren to take over their empire... but what about their kids? And their kids? And their kids? Throughout real world history, wealth tends to concentrate while exceptional people are alive and active, and then a generation or five later the accumulation either stagnates or is lost altogether. Meanwhile, an exceptional elf might still be making savvy business moves and investing in properties that won't be making a profit until 50 years later... The kind of social friction and racial tensions this would generate would almost inevitably lead to, at a minimum, the long lived races choosing to live in gated communities/their own cities because the shorter lived races resent their (at least relative) poverty.

You can solve these issues any number of ways, like for example by having short lived races be militarily stronger and able to force a high degree of wealth redistribution, but the issues should probably at least be acknowledged and resolved.
