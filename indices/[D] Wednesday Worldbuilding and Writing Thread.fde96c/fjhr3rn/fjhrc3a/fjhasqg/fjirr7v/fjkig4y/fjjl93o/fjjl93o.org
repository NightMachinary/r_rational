I have some knee-jerk questions/ramblings. Please take them with a grain of salt.

My biggest concern is that I feel the protagonist is a bit murder-happy. If he can defeat the hirearch why can't he defeat the protégé? Or otherwise counter the antagonist's plan without going straight to murder? The story needs to present a plausible and palatable reason why this is required (both why other methods won't work and why the continued rule of the current hirearch from the shadows would be so bad). And also, why the protagonist is willing to subvert the system by killing the current Hirearch instead of letting a worthy successor take the throne the established way (if he was worthy he could just be smarter and become Hirearch that way).

And isn't it plausible that training/grooming and influencing the hirearch is not a new thing? In such a system, I feel that influential families, guilds and other factions would have their own private schools with the best tutors money can buy in order to put someone on the throne that will benefit them, either by being likeminded or by being groomed to loyalty and/or obedience.

If we look at our own world, and how much wealth and power plays a role in politics, candidates for the throne would almost exclusively be the result of massive amounts of resources.

It is hard for a poor person with a full time job (required to just put food on the table and keep a roof over their head) to compete with people that have never worked a day in their life and have had the best teachers, food, healthcare, etc. from the day they were born.

Influencing the first test would also be a tool of the powerful; putting people in place to slant the results towards their preferred candidates, or just rules and tests that benefit their knowledge base. A little like Supreme Judges in the US are picked to some degree because they favor one political view or another.

I also feel that execution for getting a rule wrong/cheating in a game is a bit harsh. Any hirearch would have to be /very/ careful to never give an order that could be interpreted as a forbidden action and lead to immediate death.

Failure to correct the Hirearch when he makes the illegal move could also be interpreted as an assasination attempt, if it comes to light that the protagonist knew.

Perhaps if the protagonist have extensively studied the way Glass can play in a two-person game, and have found some kind of trap that will put the Hirearch in a losing position but not immediately end the game, and trigger the Hierarch to take some kind of drastic (and obviously illegal) action to avoid losing.

If the game draws out accross multiple days there could be openings for assassination attempts, framing, blackmail, etc. The Hirearch has already planned for this though, having a protégé ready, so we need to know why losing power now would be so bad. Ruling through his protégé is always on the table.

Or, if death by cheating is a core plot point, perhaps the protagonist is aware of, or is responsible for, recent changes to the rules of the game, and knows that the Hirearch has not learned of it (or arranges that they do not). Then the protagonist only needs to put the Hirearch in a position where using a forbidden move is the rational thing to do.

However, a rational Hirearch would not go into any challenge to their rule without studying the contest material at great detail for as long as allowed, so any plot point relying on the Hirearch not knowing the rules is tricky (and arranging for the Hirearch to have a faulty rule book might be considered assassination attempt and punished by death if discovered).

Depending on who the judges are, they may or may not declare it cheating, and if pointed out by the protagonist, it may be considered assassination (he could have just said "actually, you can't make that move" when it happened, but chose not to). Or do the Remnants know the game rules and strike as soon as the move is made?

Sorry if the flood of questions come accross as negative, I found the premise interesting and thinkning about it led to having a lot of questions. I'm sure a lot of this is covered by material that didn't fit in your post, but hopefully you get something out of it.

As a side note, for game inspiration, I recommend Player of Games by Ian M Banks. Great sci fi set in his Culture universe, and extra good if you are a gamer. It features a board game that is important for who holds power (although the premise is very different from yours).
