These comments are really insightful, thanks! I've considered a few of them already, so I'll try to go down the list.

The protagonist is capable of beating the Hierarch outright, but learning of his protege alters the 'win condition' somewhat. You're correct that there are powerful institutions dedicated to maintaining power- the current Hierarch himself is a product of such a process. He's one of the longest-serving in recent memory, and has actively furthered the cause of those interests, such as expanding private schooling (state schools have historically been extremely well-funded, but with more cutbacks under the current Hierarch), and even turning a blind eye to people putting chemicals in the water supply of certain areas, to lower the IQ of inhabitants (think Flint, MI, but intentional). That's why the protagonist wants to remove him from power, and is willing to subvert the system to make it happen.

Again, you're correct that there are distinct advantages that the wealthy have under this system. However, as I mentioned, state schools are well-funded, and other systems are in place to ensure that everyone gets a more-or-less fair shot at the position. Even with the Hierarch trying to cut back funding for these programs, there will still be naturally gifted individuals capable of taking back power, such as the protagonist himself.

The first test is also pseudomagical in the same way as the Remnants are. There is no human involvement in the administration of the test, and the questions can't be changed.

Cheating won't get you instantly killed- declaring victory after having at any point committed an illegal move will. This is why the protagonist has to maneuver his opponent into unknowingly violating the rules, and keep him in the dark until the game is over. You're also correct that it would be a scandal if this came out, but the only witness will be... y'know, dead.

The only judges of the competition are the Remnants themselves, and the populace has a culturally entrenched respect for them, meaning their rulings are almost never questioned.

Stretching the game across multiple days is a good idea, so thanks for that one.

With regards to the rules, I've thought about that a little. Since both the Hierarch and his challenger have to agree on how they'll compete, it might make sense for the protagonist to obfuscate his skill at the game, and pretend that his skill level is on par with the Hierarch (i.e. not much experience with the game). However, this seems like a fairly obvious exploit, something that the creators of the Remnants would have considered when creating them.

Hopefully that makes things a little clearer. Thanks again for your input!
