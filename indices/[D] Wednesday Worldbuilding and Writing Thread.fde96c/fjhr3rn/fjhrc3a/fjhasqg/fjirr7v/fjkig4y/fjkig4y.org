  In practice, this is determined with two 'tests.' One functions as a 'filter,' making sure aspirants meet a basic level of intelligence. It tests for logic, rationality, and practical subjects like mathematics and science.

  The Hierarch can do a great many things, but they cannot become a true dictator. They must allow any challenger who passes the first test to attempt to usurp them. If any attempt to do otherwise is made, the Remnants will cut them down.

What prevents a brute force denial of service attack? Have hundreds or thousands of well educated intelligent people take the first test. Now Hierarch /has/ to personally deal with each person, play a complicated and time consuming game with them. This means you can take up all Hierarch's time and prevent them concentrating on anything else.

  They aren't AI. Instead, they run off of what amounts to an absurdly complex internal decision-tree flowchart-thing, which their creators laid out. If they encounter a situation in which that decision tree has no course of action for them to follow, they are capable of summoning a simulation of their creators, which issue a judgement on the issue, and are then dismissed. This takes place internally, and instantly.

Um. So they /are/ AI. Much of the time they don't perform AI computations, but pressure them with novel situations and suddenly they jump to human level intelligence as a simulation of their creators takes over. And this also means their creators are in a manner of speaking still alive...
