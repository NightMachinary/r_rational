  Killing them out at sea would draw in others to feed on their remains

Perfect. Pack the ship with as much cheap magic (everburning torches?) and poison as you can muster, then watch as each serpent eats the remains of the previous corpse, then dies.

Find an irresponsible individual to create a species of poisonous sea creatures with a (minor, useless?) magic ability and wait a hundred years until the serpents learn by natural selection not to eat them, then leash some to your ships as you cross the sea.
