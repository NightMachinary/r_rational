My first idea would be to fight fire with fire, and create a magical self-replicating creature to counter it. But other people have brought that up.

A bigger question, I think, is how is anyone still alive when a powerful enough mage can create self-replicating magical weapons/creatures which can survive and multiply using ambient magic? What's to stop someone from making magic-seeking hornets with cobra venom or such?
