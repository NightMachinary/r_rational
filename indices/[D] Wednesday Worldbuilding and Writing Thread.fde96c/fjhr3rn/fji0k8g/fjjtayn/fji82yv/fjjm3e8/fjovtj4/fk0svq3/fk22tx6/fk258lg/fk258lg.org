Sadly permanent magic items are pretty rare, and magic fades pretty quickly unless manually fed or erected in one of half a dozen special locations. I simplified a bit for the post, but in reality an assassin going for death by serpent would be another magician who sneaks aboard, creates a magical effect while any other magicians are asleep, and then gets out of dodge before the nearest serpent gets there. Using a genuine magical object to lure a serpent would be like using the British crown jewels. Historians would curse your name for centuries. In DnD terms, there are no magic items, just major artifacts. A magician can manually create a ton of magical effects whenever they want, but it will fade in minutes.

Magic users are valuable, but do make excellent bait for the serpents if you can convince them. Using them as bait as a form of execution would not work well however, because to use magic they have to be able to also control that magic, and if they can control their magic they are not safe to execute. Magic is a lot better suited for destroying than controlling things in my world. It is pretty rare that a magic user is taken down and neutralized in any way other than assassination or battle.
