  A bigger question, I think, is how is anyone still alive when a powerful enough mage can create self-replicating magical weapons/creatures which can survive and multiply using ambient magic?

The serpents are essentially part of the background worldbuilding during my actual story. They are one of a few troubling remnants of the awesome and frightening things magic could do back in the unholy days of magical science during an ever escalating war that very nearly destroyed the world.

  What's to stop someone from making magic-seeking hornets with cobra venom or such?

Yeah, she made homing killer bugs too. They were more easily killed though, because back then almost everyone was a magician, and the population was much higher. The way magic works in my world, killing bugs with magic is fairly easy even at a distance, so they were painstakingly wiped out after their creator was +frozen in time waiting for some idiots to come looking for trouble to advance the plot+ /safely killed although nobody is quite sure where her corpse is but definitely dead because the alternative is too horrible to contemplate/.

Magic did keep escalating in power until one side of the war sacrificed most of their resources and hopes of winning to create a seal that greatly weakened magic in the world. It cost them the war, but they managed to lock away proper mind control, memory manipulation, time bending, space bending, portals, necromancy, resurrection, genetic engineering, soul destruction, soul creation, nuclear weapons, and probably a host of other stuff I don't remember at the moment. The woman who created the serpents did so not too long before the other side decided they had to put a stop to the escalation, and even she had to rely on the resources that came with ruling over millions of slave magicians to be able to pull it off. She also made a lot of other horrible things, but most of them were played out by the time the actual story starts. Plagues, army ants that exude poisons that leave the environment a sterile wasteland where they pass through, narcotic weeds that are addictive but don't cause any issues until you have kids - who all come out with severe birth defects, etc etc. She was an exceptionally creative and unkind individual. Her ultimate goal was to wipe out most of humanity and set herself up as some kind of genetic Eve for a new race of transhumans.
