If assassins plant magical objects to lure them, make a trap with a magic object in the middle, maybe it expands once heated, by say a sea serpents stomach? Or enough magic to melt a ball of metal that they swallow. Or just a eat a big ball of inert metal that poisions them.

How valuable are your magic users? Can someone use them as bait, or maybe as a form of execusion to draw in serpents. It will all depend on the details of your magic system I suppose.
