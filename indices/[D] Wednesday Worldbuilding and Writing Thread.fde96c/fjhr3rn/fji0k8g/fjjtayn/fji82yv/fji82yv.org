How do the serpents feed off of ambient magical energy? Do they just draw it in like xianxia cultivation or do they actually actually need to /eat/ the magic to feed off of it?

Can the serpents get full? Do they get sleepy if you feed them enough magic? Can the serpents be overfed? What happens if you pump them past "full" of magic? Do they explode?

Someone /created/ these serpents, so... can they be trained? Could you teach an adult serpent that if it /doesn't/ eat you, it'll get a tasty treat? I'm imagining the training here being something like: you send an unmanned boat out with a magical doodad onboard that'll fly off on a firework, or become inaccessible in some other way, should the serpent try to eat the boat, but, if the serpent /ignores/ the boat, then it gets tossed a (distinctly different) magical treat. Do this for a whole shipping lane, and now you've got a collection of serpents who "know" that attacking magical boats is no good, but leaving them alone is /great/ because they'll feed you.

[[/u/Badewell]]'s suggestion of using magical bait + lethal payload also work for training here (you don't even need time-delay, so long as you've got some way to control a small unmanned some ways ahead of the main craft, perhaps magic): Always float a couple of bombs or whatever ahead of you, and eventually the serpents will either learn that the magical doodads floating up on the surface are not to be eaten, or they will be dead.

Could you steal a serpent egg and raise a guard-serpent for your boat?

Could magical chaff be a thing? As long as there are /always/ more appetizing targets than the ship, the serpents should ignore it, right? Maybe? I'm imagining like... a ring of magic toy boats that surround the ship, but with a large buffer such that there's a big "no magic" hole in the middle of them

Is it possible to move /faster/ than the serpents (even, or especially with magic)? If so, then magic speedboats are an excellent way to get around, though you do still have to deal with the fact that there may be serpents /ahead/ of you.

Is there some sort of anti-magic that the serpents might find repulsive?

Is there some way to make the magic /irritating/ to the serpents: Tune it to some "frequency" they're not a fan of? Attach a doodad to the serpents in an inconvenient location (back of its head, its tail)?

  Once killed, there is plenty of meat on them but nothing especially valuable unless they very recently swallowed something you want back.

These serpents /eat magic/ surely they've got a higher concentration of mana within them or something, right?
