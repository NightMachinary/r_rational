  How do the serpents feed off of ambient magical energy?
#+end_quote

Their skin slowly drains it from the environment. This is enough to sustain them, but they want more, and so actively seek out anything with more than background levels of magic. They don't have a maximum size. They keep growing as long as they can find food. The biggest ones mostly just eat smaller serpents.

#+begin_quote
  Can the serpents get full? Do they get sleepy if you feed them enough magic? Can the serpents be overfed? What happens if you pump them past "full" of magic?
#+end_quote

They can, but it won't happen without some kind of capture and forcefeeding situation. They don't get sleepy from eating, but they will prioritize safety (Rest and growth) or fighting/breeding when they have excess power to draw on. If force fed beyond reason, they can choose to stop passively feeding. At that point, you can only keep feeding them by using mind control to control them like a puppet. As with human magic users, concentrate too much magic in one body and they will eventually catch on fire and die in horrible pain.

Mind controlling them is not realistic because you would need a lot of exceptionally powerful magic users working together to use forbidden magic, and since they are only useful at sea they would be a giant beacon constantly drawing in more uncontrolled serpents. Also all the other humans would freak out and try to kill you. Technically possible, however, and the original creator would approve.

#+begin_quote
  Someone created these serpents, so... can they be trained? Could you teach an adult serpent that if it doesn't eat you, it'll get a tasty treat?
#+end_quote

Not easily, and they don't teach each other, so... you would have a hard time teaching each one, and it would be nearly impossible to prevent new ones from out at sea from wandering into your region full of tame ones. You would likely never reach a point where it would be safe to use magic at sea. For any individual trip however, I guess you could transport something magical by having a lot of more strongly magical bait in other vessels nearby. Still not safe, but it might be an option.

#+begin_quote
  Could you steal a serpent egg and raise a guard-serpent for your boat?
#+end_quote

This would work, the only problem is that it would eat a /lot/. You would at a minimum need a dozen or so magicians constantly ready to feed it whenever it gets hungry as a baby. When it reached adulthood you would have to either let it out to feed at sea or you would need 100+ magicians channeling magic to feed it. I hadn't thought about this possibility, so I'm not sure how social I would say one is if raised from birth among generous humans. But if someone pulled it off, it would easily be a one snake army.

#+begin_quote
  Is it possible to move faster than the serpents (even, or especially with magic)?
#+end_quote

Not without flying. The right to fly is heavily restricted because of a magical world war 200 years ago that didn't end well for anyone, but royalty can fly, and can potentially transport magical items up in the air, where the serpents can't reach them. Other magicians can learn to fly, but all the big players get /unreasonable/ on the subject.

#+begin_quote
  Is there some sort of anti-magic that the serpents might find repulsive?
#+end_quote

No. There is antimagic, but to the serpents it just smells like magic, and it's energy heavy and not a threat to them.

#+begin_quote
  Is there some way to make the magic irritating to the serpents: Tune it to some "frequency" they're not a fan of?
#+end_quote

Not really. They aren't even turned away by what feels like superior/angry fellow serpents. The creator didn't put in any back doors to make them safe for herself, she decided she wanted to wipe out her enemies' navies and eliminate the threat of any attacks from the sea. And she was quite happy to permanently give up access to the oceans to do it.

#+begin_quote
  Attach a doodad to the serpents in an inconvenient location (back of its head, its tail)?
#+end_quote

That sure would piss one off, but I'm not sure it would accomplish anything long term.

#+begin_quote
  These serpents eat magic surely they've got a higher concentration of mana within them or something, right?
#+end_quote

Their skin can be treated and used as some kind of meth/super caffeine combo, but one dead serpent can supply all the skin the market can absorb for a century. They are big things, and eating the skin will kill you pretty quickly. If you desperately need to be at full strength all day all night for something though, it works. It just leaves you nauseated for a few days afterward and slowly accumulates every time you use it. It's not even addictive, it's just awful. There is some competition to produce less poisonous versions, but there is no shortage of the raw skin, just a lack of experts who manage to refine something useful.

The meat on one is enough to feed most cities for a few days, so there is money there, it just isn't worth creating an industry around it.
