I think that since the problem was caused by the generation of self-propogating magic, there is clearly some promise in using self-propogating magic to fix this issue.

Find some flaw in the serpents -- is there something out there which magically identifies the serpents from other creatures? Produce something that absorbs ambient mana and is not very smart, but only survives if it consumes a serpent egg, say, once per year. It doesn't sound like the serpents are very social creatures, and they might not guard their eggs very aggressively. If you can kill them before, you can stem the problem in a few decades. Afterwords, the old serpents will eat the younger, smaller serpents, and then the old serpents will not have enough magic floating around to sustain themselves and will die on their own after eating each other.

Likewise, you could produce a parasite that is passive when interacting with most life, but requires a sea serpent to reproduce. The parasite enters the sea serpent....somehow, and then feeds on it's guts/brain, producing a huge number of additional parasites. The serpent dies and the bonus parasites go everywhere, infecting subsequent serpents, eventually killing all of them.

Naturally, be smart this time and have some kind of fallback back-door if things go horribly wrong so you can kill off your creation.

Of course, both of these ideas could go horribly wrong if, for instance, the parasite evolves to feed off of /all/ sea life instead of just serpents, for instance.
