  The meat on one is enough to feed most cities for a few days, so there is money there, it just isn't worth creating an industry around it.

I hear that, and my first thought is that the only reason there isn't a industry around that is a lack of investment.

Some quick searching suggests that a large city in the renaissance would be around 100,000 people, though magic could also change this. A low-end estimate for how much the average person spends on food would be 10% of their income (probably higher, historically, but again magic).

So if a average serpent could feed 100,000 people for three days, its value would be around 30,000 average-day-wages, enough to pay 1,000 workers for a month, or a lesser number of above-average workers like magicians.

I would expect that a creature that is this easily lured and this common could probably be farmed a lot faster than 1 per month with hundreds of people working on it. And reliable and cheap sources of food, especially meat, were a big deal in medieval times.

The biggest issues I see are geography, upfront investment, and draining costs. For one, you're probably going to want a bay or something to do this in. Large landmoving projects were not cheap back then, so unless magic helps a lot with that then this is limited to coastal cities with a bay that has a easily dammed entrance. And upfront investment - a thick enough wall of steel ought to be able to stop a dying serpent without taking damage, but it might take excessive amounts of steel. Alternatively, you could use a bay large enough that there's little risk of the serpent damaging the dam or beaching itself and destroying buildings or killing workers, but that raises the draining costs.

I'd want to know more about the magic in the setting before settling on a course of action though.
