Someone raised the possibility of raising one from birth. It would be prohibitively expensive, since you would need a large team of magicians feeding it several times a day, and magicians basically only include nobility, high ranking church people and the very richest merchants and mercenaries in my world. But, if you /did/ go to all that effort, it could be tamed as well as a real life snake, or thereabout. And of course it could be made to completely terrorize specific areas, sink only enemy ships, etc. Nobody in my world will try, but logically it should work.
