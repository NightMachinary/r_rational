Can you set something magical to activate with a time delay? If so you can rig up something with a nasty payload, throw it overboard near known serpent locations and time the magical component to activate once you're long gone. The serpents eat the object and hopefully you put something in there that can kill them (I do not know enough about renaissance tech to give any specifics but thinking bomb or poison in general. (Would poison even work on something that big though?))

This doesn't help any individual ship going out, but depending on your magic system it could be cheap and thinning out numbers can't hurt.

Do humans have ways to detect magic? If not, then killing the serpents that swim into trap dams seems like a waste. They could be used to check for magic on outgoing ships. This wouldn't work on assassination attempts if time delay activation is a thing, but I imagine there's an occasional ship loss to accidentally bringing magic items onto outgoing ships that would be prevented.
