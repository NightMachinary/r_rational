  Can you set something magical to activate with a time delay?
#+end_quote

Nothing that isn't a human being. A magic user is only faintly magical unless they are actively using magic.

  Do humans have ways to detect magic?
#+end_quote

Yes. Anyone who can use magic can also sense it nearby. The stronger the magic felt, the further away they can feel it. The strongest source of magic in my world can be felt from anywhere, basically giving every magician an in built compass. But in general normal levels of magic can be sensed a few feet to a few hundred feet away, depending on if the magician is holding magic themselves at the time. The serpents have more acute senses, and can sense a magician using magic from miles away. Humans can only sense the serpents from about a hundred feet away though, and that's usually just a few seconds before the ship gets bitten in half from below.

  They could be used to check for magic on outgoing ships.

Unfortunately not really practical. They are extremely strong creatures, and keeping them around is not safe. If kept inside a dam, there is a real threat that they might attack and break the dam if not killed quickly. They definitely can't be bound or held still. They need water to breathe and will suffocate in air, but they are quite capable of thrashing around and destroying most manmade things nearby while they are panicking and suffocating.

Poison or explosives could hurt and potentially kill them if they were tricked into eating them. Killing them out at sea would draw in others to feed on their remains, so not /perfect/, but yes, it would make sense for most ships to have a 'lucky' barrel of poison for revenge just in case they get eaten.
