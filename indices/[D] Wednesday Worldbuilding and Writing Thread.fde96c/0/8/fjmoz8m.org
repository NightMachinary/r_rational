A large, barbed, harpoon attached to a long chain which is attached to a large sheet of cloth. Probably fired from a cannon. The goal is to embed the harpoon deep enough that it won't dislodge, attached to something that'll randomly tug at it so the wound doesn't heal, and then eventually the sea serpent dies of blood loss or infection.

This is too slow to defend a ship with, it only makes sense if you're really committed to the long-term extinction of sea serpents.
