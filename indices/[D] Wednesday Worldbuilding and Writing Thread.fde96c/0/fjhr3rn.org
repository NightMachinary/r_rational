In my world, a few hundred years ago some irresponsible individual created a species of sea serpents much larger than real world whales, some of them over 1000 feet long. They are not immortal, but they are very tough to kill. They feed mostly off of ambient magical energy, but they are drawn to anyone using magic or transporting magical objects. If you use magic on a ship on the open sea, chances are that ship will be eaten. With no magic, ships are only rarely attacked near the coast. Further from the coast they are in more danger, but my continents are quite close together, so (relatively) safe routes have been found. Sometimes greedy or desperate people take dangerous shortcuts though.

These serpents are obviously massive obstacles to trade and travel, and everyone hates them quite a lot. Given mostly renaissance level tech + the ability to magically heat any metal to malleability or melting, how might entrepreneurial humans try to kill these things? Using magic while actually out to sea will just attract more of them, so the details of how magic works are probably not very important.

The only methods I presently have people using are A) using magic on land to create things like tungsten harpoons and other mundane weapons, and B) building dams with gates large enough for the serpents to enter, then closing the gates and draining the water inside. They are dangerous animals, but not intelligent, so if they venture close to the coast they can be lured in with magic and then killed this way. This will never be enough to wipe them out, however, because most of them stick to the open seas, especially the older and larger ones.

Once killed, there is plenty of meat on them but nothing especially valuable unless they very recently swallowed something you want back.

So. How else might humans respond to or try to kill these things? The few trap dams that exist are mostly near the largest trading hubs, and are more to make people /feel/ safe than to actually accomplish anything. Also, the occasional assassin will wait for their target to travel somewhere by ship, then plant something magical on it and wait for everyone on the ship to get eaten.
