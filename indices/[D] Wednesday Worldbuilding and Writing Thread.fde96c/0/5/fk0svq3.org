All ships carry loads that make them a poison pill if eaten. Either a literal poison in a hull compartment, or just a bunch of gunpowder and scrap metal. That way, if you get eaten, at least you get to point and laugh at the snake from the afterlife, and there is the hope they might eventually damn well stop.

variant 2 on this: Ships that are at their end of their service life are loaded up with skeleton volunteer crews (Old sailors who dont want to die in bed, the mortally ill, the irrevocably cursed) and sail off with a hull full of powder and a spell on their lips
