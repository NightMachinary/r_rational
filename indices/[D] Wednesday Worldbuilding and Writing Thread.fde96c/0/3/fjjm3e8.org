"Magical flares" may be a countermeasure. You put a spell on a floating barrel and/or a heavy object and toss several overboard (perhaps using catapults) drawing the monsters away from the ship. Extra good if the object is only faintly magical until activated.

Or perhaps countless small magical objects scattered over a wide area (again using catapults) would create a "smoke screen" where the serpents do not know what to attack.

Or, magic attached to poison barrels (or explosives). Or just big tungsten caltrops that mess up the serpents mouths and digestive system.

Using magic to smelt, mix and shape metal could advance technology incredibly, to the point of fully automatic high-calibre cannons would be possible. Not sure how much time serpents spend at the surface though.

Steam power would also be much easier with magically forged metals. No welds or bolted seams needed. Perhaps have massive steam-powered spikes that can be fired down from the hull as soon as something bites down on the ship. The crew start the boilers at the first sign of serpents, and hope for a "good bite" that triggers the spikes but does not damage the ship.

Other than that, hulls shaped and equipped to be as stealthy as possible might be a thing. Perhaps carrying a smaller, more noisy, boat that can be deployed, or dragged after the ship at all times, to be the target of the first attack. At which point the crew on the main ship cuts speed and drifts with as little noise as possible until the serpent leaves. Optional poison and/or bombs on the decoy boat.
