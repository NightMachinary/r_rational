Oddly enough, I think that GeoGuessr has really helped me with this, because you get used to picking out a general geographic location by paying attention to the most prominent features of different places. Some of that is stuff that you wouldn't necessarily want to put into prose (like the differences between street signs), but other stuff is really applicable for prose descriptions, e.g. how wide the streets are, how prevalent different forms of travel are, common features of buildings like, say, white-washed walls and blue rooftops in Greece, or the half-moon terra cotta tiles of Italy, the thatched roofs of rural England (granted, mostly in the touristy areas), different stuff like that which gives you a definite clue to where you are.

I would suggest to focus in particular on 1) materials, which will usually be at least somewhat local 2) colors and color palette (though this is definitely related to 1, as the most common colors are going to be those that can be made locally, or are whatever natural colors the materials are, e.g. the reason that traditional American barns are red is that they mixed in rust, which was readily available and had some protective properties) and 3) architectural features (which will again relate to 1, since there are things that you just can't do well with adobe, and building techniques that are common to brickwork, and if you're doing wattle and daub construction your walls have to be pretty thick, etc.). That last is the only one that you need to do a bit of research on, but not /that much/ research, because you want to keep your vocabulary right for the average reader, who won't know a cornice from frieze.

In terms of giving a description of a city, it really depends on what needs to be set up for the plot, but my instinct is usually to focus on the geography and use that to help inform an understanding of how the city was formed, what it does, and how it works. Sometimes it's just a matter of trying to look at the city from different angles, that of a tourist, a merchant, or someone who lives there, and what they would think is important about it. Like, what would be on the postcards from the city, if they had postcards? And what would people take pride in when they said they were from there? What would make them homesick, what would they think is overrated by foreigners, etc.? And if that can be plot-relevant, or reveal character, then all the better.

Edit: Another good one, if a bit stock, is how a city looks as you approach it.
