writing question here.

anybody have any advice on describing fantasy cities?

Ideally I'd be able to paint a nice visual picture of the city while implying whatever I need to imply about the city's people (wealthy/poor, open/shut-off, etc.) without saying such things outright. But i suck ass at physical descriptions. I had an idea that I would google around about architecture in various cultures and build up a vocabulary for describing buildings, but this didn't seem to help - wikipedia for example described in terms of various styles or movements that I didn't context to understand and which I can't reference anyway.
