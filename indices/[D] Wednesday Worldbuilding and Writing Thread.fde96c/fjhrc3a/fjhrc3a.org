The Vice-Principal of Hogwarts 

Charity Burbage graduates from Hogwarts and instead of being inspired to study Muggle Music or Art becomes inspired to study the Muggle education system. She enrolls at a Muggle University to take a few classes. To her embarrassment she fails every class and realizes how truly unprepared she is to go to a Muggle University, not having basic skills that muggle students take for granted. 

She decides to infiltrate a muggle school as a student teacher to learn how to be a better student. She experiences quite a bit of culture shock at just how different Muggle Schools are and later has to admit that they are superior in many ways. She stays and studies muggle schools for almost two years, pretending to work as a student-teacher and working as a substitute. She later writes a bestselling book for wizards that details her observations. Because she was very open to her opinion of the superiority of muggle schools and was very critical of Hogwarts, two death eaters show up to kill her. She barely defeats them using some chemical knowledge she studied to create a poisonous cloud that suffocates the death eaters. 

Wounded and in fear of more attacks, she decides to go into hiding and live as a Muggle. She goes back to a muggle college under an alias and this time she manages to graduate, becoming a teacher at an elementary school, something she learns to love doing. Over the years becoming close friends with the principal and starts studying to possibly become one.

After several years go by, one of her students is contacted by Hogwarts. She offers advice, information, and reassurance to the parents. She is inspired by their thanks to starting a newsletter and info packet for muggle parents while keeping a normal non-owl post for them to contact.muggle-born She answers questions and offers a place for the muggle-born to practice without issue in her home during the summer. 

She is then contacted by Dumbledore with an offer to become the new professor of Muggle Studies after the old one decided to retire early. To his surprise, she declines and writes him a scathing and lengthy report about how ignorant, condescending, and terrible he is at his job that cites numerous studies and sources about education, personal interviews, and her professional opinion. Before offering him a list of squibs that have lived in both worlds as a teacher. 

To his credit, Dumbeldore takes the criticism to heart and starts to read the books becoming fascinated and admitting that Hogwarts could be better. He makes a personal appearance to her with a new offer to become the Vice Principal to help him modernize and update Hogwarts. She accepts and comes to Hogwarts with big plans to modernize and improve things the same year that Harry Potter starts there.  Hilarity ensues.

My main issue is trying to figure out what changes a modern education professional would suggest as I didn't realize just how much thought goes into modern schools until I started researching what a Vice Principal actually does and the differences between different countries with higher ratings. But I'm not sure how much the wizarding world would really let happen even with Dumbeldore supporting any changes. So some suggestions would be helpful. Proposed Changes:

A summer program for the muggle-born to update them to how the magical world works and to practice some basics so they are not behind the other kids.

Hiring a school counselor squib

Creating a club system that the school can award funding for

Creating a PTA

Creating an agreed-upon lesson plan for defense against the dark arts that is created by experts and will be followed regardless of new teachers

Teacher observations and ongoing training opportunities that the school pays for

A new agreed upon bullying plan that actually works to stop bullying

Some type of change to the house system and points system to encourage inter-house friendships.

Any other suggestions?
