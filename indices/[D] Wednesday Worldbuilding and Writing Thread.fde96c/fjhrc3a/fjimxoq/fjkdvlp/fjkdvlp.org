If I remember the HP lore right, wizarding world and muggle world had a separated development since the late middle ages / Renaissance (caused by witch trials which forced the wizarding world to disguise themselves). It would make sense that the Hogwarts school system has so many flaws if you consider the fact, that HP wizards are a small, highly elitist and isolationist community. Groups like that tend not towards big reforms but try to preserve as much of their tradition as possible - which would explain the school system straight from the 16th century.
