So, I'm actually a teacher. The field is rife with buzzwords, educational research is a minefield of inadequacy, and teaching programs don't really prepare you. We still do much better than Hogwarts.

​

Here are some things I think a teacher would actually try to implement, that are structurally problematic for Hogwarts.

1.  The dormrooms are a nightmare scenario. Rape, especially homosexual rape, /would/ happen. These kids are extremely poorly supervised. Prefects in general could make the lives of their charges hell. Similarly, the position would attract magic pedophiles.
2.  Hogwarts has too few teachers. It's a school with either 280 kids or a thousand. It has 7 core subjects and 5 electives. (Later years may have special electives) My school has about 300 kids and we have 17.5 teachers (one is shared). Our student teacher ratios are lower than usual, but Hogwarts is astronomical. Also, non-teachers don't understand how demanding it is to prep for a class. On a great day, prepping for each class takes 45 minutes. Average day, an hour, busy day two. You have to prepare for your lecture, write what you're going to do on the board, write instructions for the assignment, gather materials (a real time-spender), etc. In your extra time you have to grade and do planning. If you're a shit grader it takes a half hour per week per class. Better teachers take longer, and grading writing, which they do a lot of takes a long, long, time. We see our kids every day, but Hogwarts teachers see their kids twice a week. I seem to remember that most classes combine two houses, which means that they spend 28 hours in the classroom. Maybe a little less. Then about 14 hours grading. Then about 28 hours preparing classroom materials. That's a 70 hour a week job; you can futz around with the hours, but it's unsustainable. It gets more sustainable if you do a shit job grading and preparing. These teachers are ridiculously overworked though. If you use Rowling's number, you can multiply quite a lot of this by 4.
3.  I have not, once, seen mention of a rubric or checklist. Hogwarts assignments are Orwellian, you don't know quite what the teacher wants and get punished by many for asking.
4.  The average kid needs lessons on how to /read/ not how to interpret literature until early high school. Remember that most easy newspaper articles are written at an 8th grade level. Students start Hogwarts at a 5th to 6th grade level.
5.  The teaching methods at Hogwarts are mediocre at best. They do groupwork and lots of practical application. However, they don't explain how to learn at all. They teach no lessons on study skills. They expect you to be able to use the library right away and have no research methods classes. They teach no lessons on note-taking or essay writing. Hogwarts is very much a sink or swim environment to the detriment of students. When they do lecture, there's little class discussion. Student learning has a sizeable improvement if you go from asking individual students questions to telling the class to talk to their neighbor. In Snape's, I think you get punished for class discussion.
6.  There's no teacher growth plan. Every year I do a formal plan on how to improve my teaching methods required by state law. I also do a much more detailed informal plan that I actually follow, starting with an autopsy of last year's plan.
7.  There's no mentoring for teachers, no observations from senior staff, and no feedback how you're doing as a teacher. Dumbledore should get off his ass and go room to room at least once a week.
8.  There are no inclusion plans for students with disabilities, magical or otherwise. Hogwarts' attitude towards neurodifferences seems to be fuck off cripple.
9.  They /do/ have some sort of agreed upon standards, because they have end of year tests. Harry, like most students, doesn't see these standards because they're for teachers, not students.
10. There is no formalized discipline system. Classroom discipline is barbaric and frankly illegal sometimes.
11. Their career counselling is terrible. Students are magically expected to pick a lifetime path when they are 15. You're right on track with the fact that they would need a guidance counselor and a good one.
12. Rowling far underestimates the behavior that would result from Deatheater trauma. You would probably have kids that literally shit themselves to get attention from adults because their parents are dead and grandmother is too dotty to care well. Fights could get lethal really quick.
13. They also do no bellwork. Many teachers have work waiting for students in a stack by the door when they enter the room. This is a great way to have more effective transition time. As students enter, they start doing work instead of talking.
14. The wealth disparity of magical Britain would really, really, really bother most teachers. The idea that there's no school quidditch regulation board making sure there's equal equipment is bullshit.
15. Sports and clubs suck. Most teachers hate them. It's a lot of extra work for no pay that distracts from teaching. I doubt most would bring them back. Debate clubs, chess clubs, and maybe some others might be organized by teachers with a natural love of conflict.
16. PTAs are difficult with a school as small as Hogwarts. Also, parents make things more complicated. PTA would be Lucius vs. Molly every week while everyone else left.
17. There's no ready option for continuing education other than career specific apprenticeship. Magical Britons get a quarter of the training that college educated muggles do. Less so in relevant subjects.
18. The kids do almost no-non-paper projects. This is something fucking /Hagrid/ selfishly blunders into with his skrewts. Note that Harry and his friends do projects in their spare time, like polyjuice potion, and get a huge educational advantage. Fred & George, and Draco are the only other students who make permanent items. Basically they're all trained for service careers in doing spells that wizards can already do for themselves.
19. There's no sex ed in a world where magic roofies exist.

Basically, this is a recipe for churning out endless multitudes of Reg Cattermole.
