That's what defense against the dark arts is supposed to be about.

Because they think magic will solve everything. Mostly because it has.

It's just a different system. They don't ask about your SATs, but they do ask about your degree, and some even ask for a GPA. The magical community in britain just set up around the OWLs.

Probably in the final year we never got to see. That's the problem with most of OPs list, they say 'X doesnt exist' a ton of times, but we don't know that. We just didnt see it in the book with the POV of a child.
