The thing is that Hogwarts isn't based on actual classrooms and teachers - but books written by guys like Anthony Buckeridge and Frank Richards.

In fact, that's kind of the key to the Harry Potter and The... series - it references tropes of "boarding school life" stories that boys would have been reading for at least three generations by the time Rowling had started to read. If you want to read half the source material she cribs from read the "Jennings" novels by Burgess and the Greyfriars books like Richards. Which were written and set in the first half of the 20th century and based on institutions that started prior to World War I.

These learning institutions were not exactly wonderful institutions of learning. Boys tended to learn the rules of the institution by being caned. You'd show up, wide-eyed and eight years old or so in a starchy new uniform with a tie and be unsure what to do. And then someone in a robe and hat with a cane with severe demeanor would hurt you, and as you were responding to the shock of being hit on the behind with a length of bamboo, THAT'S when you were told it was because you were not in Room A like everyone else is, and you're supposed to be in Room A when the bell rings whose import you didn't know because you just got there. A few canings later, each one hurting more than the last because your skin was still healing from the last one - you figured out REALLY quickly the secret to being able to sit down comfortably on a wooden bench for an hour (and if you couldn't come to the front of the class for more hits) was to keep your head down, watch what other people were doing, and just fall in.

These places were organized to suit the needs of Victorian England, which was to produce middle managers who, between them, could act as a small organic library remembering facts and not causing any trouble. So the curriculum was about being told facts and regurgitating facts and if you didn't know those facts, come to the front of the class and bend over. If you were noticed or you failed you hurt. If you kept your head down and didn't cause any trouble and just got things moving as a cog in a larger machine and did everything you were told and figured out what you needed to do without being told, life was somewhat tolerable. You were not surrounded by parents or family - you had freezing cold dorms, dripping taps, a highly regimented life that was about doing things at certain times as opposed to what was in anyone's best interest.

Teachers tended to be old boys of the school or people who'd been somewhere or done something, not necessarily teachers or even particularly caring about teaching - certainly not teachers according to the pedagogy you went through with the aims and goals you were taught. You just read out to the class "AMO! AMAS! AMAT! AMAMUS! AMATIS! AMANT!" and the boy that didn't keep up or was looking out the window was hauled to the front of the class by his ear and caned as an example to others.

As for abuses by prefects or sexual abuse, that's very well documented, The film "If" with Malcolm McDowall (A Clockwork Orange, Halloween) has a particularly sobering scene in which a group of them use their Lord Of The Flies power to literally exact revenge in a particularly gruesome abuse of power. These sorts of scenes weren't put into the books but anyone who'd been to a school like that would have known about them and scenes with prefects taking boys aside or teachers ordering a student to show up to their study had a particular dark menace that's not exactly obvious to a modern reader.

"Students would shit themselves to get attention" - the source material came at a time when trying that manoever would earn you more strikes with a cane on your backside than you could tolerate. As David Niven said in his autobiography, six was bad but tolerable, twelve was something you could kind of endure. Once in his life a teacher took real issue with a discipline problem and hit him with a cane eighteen times and there isn't a day he doesn't remember that pain.

That's why the books based on that source material seem bizarre, barbaric, brutal, completely against what we understand about education, and arbitrary and cruel to modern readers. That was because the institutions that Hogwarts was based on were, yes, indeed, pretty horrible places.
