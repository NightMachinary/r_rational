Also for Americans not clear, British media for children had corporal punishment as a constant theme. There were series of comics like "The Beano", "The Dandy", "Cor!", "Whizzer", "Chips" and so forth that were printed cheaply on cheap newsprint and typically filled with one-page stories involving someone being beaten with a slipper, hand, or cane at the end. But the one that seemed to take the most glee in this was Cor!'s "Whacky". These sorts of things phased out the formula of "kid gets hit with a slipper or cane" around the 80s/90s when mores changed. But she's old enough to have had this sort of comic as a staple.

The formula of these comics was kept alive by adult comics parodying the genre - this one's from "Viz" which instead of having children good at soccer or with special magic powers parodies the genre with a gifted hyperflatulent, a boy whose testicles are large enough to reach the floor, and so forth - and the ones involving child characters parody the "getting slippered at the end" trope. Most of its content isn't safe for work, but this one is, kind of because its only "not worksafe" part is reference to flatulence.
