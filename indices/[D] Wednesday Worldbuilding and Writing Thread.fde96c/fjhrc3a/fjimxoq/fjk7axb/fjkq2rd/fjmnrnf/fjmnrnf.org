/Dead Poet's Society/ comes to mind as well.

/The Secret Glory/ by Arthur Machen is about a school that's horrible even by Dahl's standards. A young man who wants a classical education finally goes "undercover" and becomes a model student until his last term, when he throws over his scholarship and disappears with one of the maids. He sends back a letter written in Rabelaisian French that only one or two of the masters can even read, obscenely trashing the school and staff. He also engineers a scandal that destroys the life and career of his uncle, the Master who beat him one time too many.
