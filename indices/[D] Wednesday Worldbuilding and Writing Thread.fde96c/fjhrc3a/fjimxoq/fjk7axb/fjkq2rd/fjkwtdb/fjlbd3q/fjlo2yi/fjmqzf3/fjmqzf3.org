The thing about the imperial measurement system is that you rarely mix units. It doesn't matter that a mile is a goofy number of feet, because you're never going to measure something more than a few hundred feet long in feet. Cups are a strange fraction of gallons but you use cups for baking, and don't bake by the gallon. There's always a unit that's appropriate for the job you're doing, because it's not actually a system at all, and instead just a collection of all the units people used for various jobs over the ages.

And this shows up again in physics, where everyone is supposedly using metric units, but astronomers actually use AUs, parsecs, and solar masses, while atomic physics uses barns and electron volts.

It'd be nice if someone devised a system with metric-like consistency and units that consistently land in usable ranges. (And also used sane bases like integer multiples of electron volts instead of some random fraction of the speed of light.)
