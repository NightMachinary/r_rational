Why these numbers?

First you smelt sterling (92.5% pure) silver into a bar that is 1lb in weight.

Divide this into a half, the each half into 10 shillings (splits by their etymology) , which you then smelt into a dozen coins. Given the quality controls and common 6 base system it made sense to split things this way.
