No, Napoleon grew up average, middle class or poor, and compared to the English aristocracy he was short, because they had better nutritional value in their diets allowing them to grow taller.

It wasn't that Napoleon was short, it was that when he was an emperor his â€˜peers' were taller than him because they grew up rich, and it's kind of hard to mock a man who put himself in charge of a country so they found things they could mock him for, IE: being shorter than themselves.
