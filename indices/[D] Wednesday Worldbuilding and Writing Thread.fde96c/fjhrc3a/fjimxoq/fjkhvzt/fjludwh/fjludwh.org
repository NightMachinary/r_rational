I'm at an impoverished school where I have no materials, literally not even a textbook for the first 3 years. Assembling material alone takes a significant amount of time. Finding movies, getting supplies for artistic lessons, setting up stations, printing out worksheets and bellwork, differentiating activities, even writing on the blackboard all takes me an ungodly amount of time. It's gone down considerably since my first year, but then I was spending 4 to 5 hours per lesson because I had to write my own materials. (Too poor for teachers pay teachers; the kids reading was too low for online articles.)
