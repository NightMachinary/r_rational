We're in school for assembly by around 7:45. At my level- pre university- Classes run from 8 til about 4:30. This includes a varying number of free periods for students. On an average day I might have three hours of class time with the rest of the time for admin, meetings, department and committee work.

At primary and secondary level there are fewer free periods for teachers (we don't, however, tend to have the six hour back to back blocks that I've seen in other systems) and just two breaks for kids. Ministry staffing guidelines for schools broadly work based on a theoretical minimum of 16 hours of class time per week. There are about 30 students per class at primary level, 40 per class at secondary and at pre university it varies from 20-30ish.

Time spent in school can vary depending on school and department culture- some people have the old fashioned Asian idea that work= presence so they expect staff to sit in the office until the boss leaves. My personal management style involves encouraging my staff to GTFO so long as their work gets done. My school likewise has a generally staff friendly policy so as long as you don't have meetings, classes or co curricular commitments after 2 pm or so you're free to leave. I'd say most days I leave between 2 and 5 unless I have meetings.

I personally try not to take work back home- I have two small boys which makes it difficult to think. Planning and such is done mostly at the beginning of the year and I and my department adapt on the fly- again we can do this because we have older students who are consciously on a pre university track and as such there's a certain level of buy in on their part and less disruption. At secondary and primary level planning is more comprehensive (though again broadly not as cripplingly bureaucratic as I've heard of from the US or England).

Grading assignments takes a lot of time as I teach Lit so it's all essay based. I try to do as much as I can at my desk and only bring grading home during exam grading time three or four times a year when I'm marking to a tighter deadline.
