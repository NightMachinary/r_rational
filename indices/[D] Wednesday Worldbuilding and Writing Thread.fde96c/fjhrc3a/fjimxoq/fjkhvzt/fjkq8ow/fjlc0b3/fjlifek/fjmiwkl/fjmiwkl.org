Basically, what I'm teaching is science and at that level, science doesn't change very much. Newtonian science is basically set. What is changing is the way I'm teaching it. Based on scientific articles and metaanalysis, I went from only lecturing to active learning in a flipped classroom. What will I ask of them next course when I'll meet them? What strategies will help them reach the goals of the course?

Nowadays, we also need to be inclusive toward students with disabilities. So I spent some times reading on UDL and reflecting on my teaching on how to better be inclusive. There's also some articles published in the last few years on what are the value added of science experiments in a science course. It's inspiring me to rethink and reframe the lab portion of the course.

Each year I'm trying to change some thing to be a better teacher.

But of course, some of my colleagues in other departments are just giving the same courses each year without changing anything.
