That's more or less true. That depends on how you teach. After each course, I reflect on how it went and will maybe change it next year. Also, I'm reading scientific articles about teaching in my field and I make changes accordingly. What I will say in class the next day is also tailored on their needs based on what they wrote me or how they reacted last time I saw them. Of course, when I become overwork, I can reuse material from last year. But it's not an overstatement to say at my 9th years of teaching that I'm still using about 45 min to 1 h of prep time for a 2 h course. Depending on what I will do.

What I'm saying is, of course you can teach each year the same way as the year before. But you're not gonna get better this way and it would bore me to death to always do the same thing. I like my job because there's a place for creativity, reflect, get better, apply science to it...
