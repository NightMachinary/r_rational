I'm surprised out of all of the complaints [[/u/somerando11][u/somerando11]] made, this somehow wasn't #1 with a bullet.

It doesn't matter how good you are at making potions, you should still learn science so you know how the natural /non-magical/ world works, as you're bound to interact with it on occasion.

It doesn't matter how good you are at writing spells, you should still learn English so you can effectively communicate ideas more complicated than "expecto patronum" and understand important ideas.

It doesn't matter how good you are at wand-work, if you aren't properly trained in math, you're bound to lose all your knuts and sickles due to poor management.

At least in theory, you could argue that Rowling /does/ at least recognize the importance of teaching history and social studies, as these could be covered in the History of Magic and Muggle Studies classes... though the History of Magic class is pretty much seen by all as a free period since it's taught by a ghost with no interest in ensuring the students learn the material, and after Charity Burbage's death Muggle Studies was... well, "Intelligent Designed" for a year.

Overall, witches and wizards at Hogwarts seem to learn plenty of spells and potions and whatnot, but very little in the way of basic life skills.
