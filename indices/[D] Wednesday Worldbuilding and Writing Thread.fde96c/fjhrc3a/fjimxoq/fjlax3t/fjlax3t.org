No offense but it seems to me like a fair bit of criticisms you have are based on the assumption that magic doesn't exist. If you tried to recreate a hogwarts environment in the real world then of course it would be a nightmare. That's why it's a /magic/ school, not a real one.

For one, hogwarts has a lot of "staff" besides teachers. Namely ghosts, portraits, and house elves. The first two, at least, have some canonical examples of authority within the school and likely help supervise students. We don't see this much in-story because invisibility cloak.

Practically all your complaints about time spent on lesson prep are baseless, namely because A) magic dictation, magic copying and B) literally hundreds of years of lesson plans to draw from AND C) hundreds of years of professor portraits for inspiration.

You see no mention of things like sex ed, how to read, study techniques, etc and assume that means they don't exist. No, it means that books have focus and spending 10000 words meandering about the minutae of boarding school life is something no young adult author will do. Let me ask you this: there is no mention of any kind of shower or bath besides the ones reserved for prefects. Are you going to assume that the rest of the student body just has to go without?

Of course hogwarts has a lot of institutional problems especially from modern sensibilities but half of those bullet points are disingenuous or missing the point.
