One potential answer to this is that humans or human analogues /are not/ on top of the pile, and the species which is has damn good reason to keep the rest around. For example, the dominant species is a bunch smarter than humans, but lacks hands.

I had a campaign setting where the elven species were ageless, and fixed in number (multiple souls, the ka reincarnates, without a spare ka, no new elf, no matter how much you try).. and this inspired the High Elves to repeatedly build empires in which they were a very small minority, which works fantastically when the average elf is north of six hundred, and consequently an arch magus that can cut you to ribbons with a training sword, but tends to fall apart when seven tenths of the elven ruling elite die fighting off a demon invasion or something, and now suddenly the typical elf is 22 and has sort of mastered magic missile.
