Okay, I've been working on plotting out a writing project, and I've got a small problem. It's pretty much impossible to explain without laying out all the context, so buckle up.

The story is set in a 'magical renaissance' sort of era, in terms of tech level. For the most part, it takes place in one nation, as yet unnamed, which has a very unusual system of governance. In accordance with the will of the nation's founders, the smartest citizen rules. In practice, this is determined with two 'tests.' One functions as a 'filter,' making sure aspirants meet a basic level of intelligence. It tests for logic, rationality, and practical subjects like mathematics and science. The real determining factor is not set- it's a contest between the standing ruler (the Hierarch), and the aspirant. They must agree on a contest, typically one in which they have an equivalent level of skill. Whoever wins, rules.

The Hierarch has a great deal of executive power. While there is a government outside of this individual, it mostly still exists because it's built into the fabric of society. If you were to dissolve the government, it would ruin the nation- but the Hierarch could simply choose to dissolve the government if they wished. Now, there are a few obvious problems. If the Hierarch has so much power, what's to stop them from refusing to accept any more challengers? The answer, naturally, is magic.

This nation's founders laid out the essentials of this system, but they were well aware of the issues inherent within it. So they constructed three enchanted automatons, which were tasked to protect the integrity of the system. The Hierarch can do a great many things, but they cannot become a true dictator. They must allow any challenger who passes the first test to attempt to usurp them. If any attempt to do otherwise is made, the Remnants will cut them down.

Now, we get to the actual story. To keep this post from being any longer than it has to be, it'll suffice to say the protagonist wants to become the Hierarch. Here's the problem- the one currently holding that role is clever. He knows that he can't rule forever, and that he might be beaten. So he's got a protege, who he's been training to challenge whoever replaces him. Then, he can rule from the shadows, without risking the wrath of the Remnants. So... the current Hierarch has to die.

The protagonist can't simply kill him, though, because the Remnants will also slay anyone who tries to take power by force. And he can't take power and then kill his rival, because it will be painfully obvious who did it, and public reputation is important even if you have a lot of executive power. So he has a plan- he's going to get the Remnants to do the job for him. Maneuver the Hierarch into breaking their rules, while they're engaged in their duel of wits. That way, he'll become Hierarch, and get rid of his rival, while maintaining deniability.

Now, here's the problem- it's very hard to write a character more clever than yourself. So I've hit a roadblock, when it comes to the question of 'how the protagonist gets the Remnants to kill the Hierarch.' Luckily, I can outsource my thinking to people who are cleverer than me!

Rather than use a preexisting method of competition, and get the rules or details wrong, which I absolutely would, I've opted to come up with my own medium for the two to compete in. It's a board game in the vein of chess, but on a much larger board (the kind where you have to walk around to the other side of the table to move a piece over there), and with four 'armies' instead of two. Instead of black or white, they're divided into metal, glass, stone, and wood. Each 'army' has the same pieces, but there are distinct advantages and disadvantages to each. The game supports two players at minimum, and four at maximum. Glass is considered a viable option in a four-person game, where a strategy of avoiding conflict until only one opponent remains, is appropriate, but choosing to play glass in a two-man game is virtually suicidal.

Naturally, the protagonist is going to play glass. His strategy is to use this unconventional choice to bait his opponent into making an illegal move, which will nullify the results of the game. Thus, he's free to lose, but his opponent will be killed after the match ends, and he'll be free to claim victory.

I don't have a set of rules for this game, and I'm not expecting any responses that attempt to create them (though if anyone feels especially inspired, I would welcome an attempt). What I'm specifically looking for, is a way in which the Hierarch can make an illegal move, not realize that he's done so, and continue the game to completion without realizing his error.

Some notes on what constitutes a 'breaking of the rules' for the Remnants: trying to seize power in an illegitimate manner (i.e. any way other than the system I outlined above), having challengers for the Hierarchy killed, and cheating in the contest of wits. They are not sentient. It's not possible to speak with, or reason with them. You can't exploit a loophole in the rules to 'convince' them that they need to kill your opponent. They aren't AI. Instead, they run off of what amounts to an absurdly complex internal decision-tree flowchart-thing, which their creators laid out. If they encounter a situation in which that decision tree has no course of action for them to follow, they are capable of summoning a simulation of their creators, which issue a judgement on the issue, and are then dismissed. This takes place internally, and instantly.
