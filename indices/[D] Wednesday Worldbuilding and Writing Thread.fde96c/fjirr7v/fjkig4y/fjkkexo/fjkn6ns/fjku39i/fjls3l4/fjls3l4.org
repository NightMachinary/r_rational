In the limit, the decision tree is so non-permissive the simulation is invoked for every change in situation, so they're basically piloted by their creators' simulations directly. From there, you get a sliding scale of how stupid (permissive) you want to allow the ruleset to be before the simulation kicks in.

In the limit case, the whole system is superfluous (just have the automatons do some vague half-simulation of an impression of one of the creators' brains).

Otherwise, I think there's the problem that it seems either pointless or too vague/unrelated to the story. You say it happens 'internally and instantly'. So why do we care? Does anyone in-universe know? Is there any cost to running the simulation? Because if not, why would they not make the ruleset very liable to call them up at any time, so that nobody can trick the automaton into not calling them up? And if there is a cost... well, if we never see the change happen in the story, because it's all internal and instant, then why do we care?

Basically, the rules around when the simulation can show up and how often/long it can operate seem to vague and in-principle powerful to game, and if you can't game it, there's no point in showing it in the story. If you do show it in the story, you'll have to address exactly what causes an escalation and why they can't just run the simulation 24/7 for extra security. And if you start adding in reasons like 'the simulation might start going mad/diverging' or 'power limitations' or whatever- then it becomes something we expect (want) the main character to at least consider gaming/exploiting. If they become aware of this, they'll want to look in to it, and you'll want to elaborate on it.

And if it never shows up, it's worldbuilding guff best left unsaid.

Conservation of detail. In a rational story with solutions, something like this screams out 'systems vulnerability'. If the character isn't going through these guys (or attempting to, before giving up after finding out exactly why it won't work) then you have to make it clear they're so far beyond him that it's out of the question.
