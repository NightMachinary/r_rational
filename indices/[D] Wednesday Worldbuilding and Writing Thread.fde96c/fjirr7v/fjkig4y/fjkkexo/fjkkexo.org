To the first point- the initial test is difficult enough to prevent this from being a real issue.

To the latter- the Remnants themselves don't become human-level intelligent, they use a simulation of a human to get their 'opinion' on a novel problem. It's my answer to the problem of things like the US constitution, which was written by people who had no hope of predicting the complexity of life hundreds of years after they died. Rather than forcing their society to rely on rules that might become obsolete in a few hundred years, they left a failsafe that allows them to update the Remnants' programming if it becomes truly necessary.
