It's an interesting premise, but one that I think would take a fair bit of research, and a lot of worldbuilding for Hogwarts that doesn't appear to exist within the books themselves.

- Many of the teachers at Hogwarts are portrayed within the books as incompetent, with approaches to education that do not work for their students. Snape is caustic and shows way too much favoritism. Trelawney basically doesn't know her subject matter. Binns is a ghost, and fundamentally impaired. The Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers ... yikes. If it's not possible to replace these teachers, then trying to reform them has to be the next obvious step, but I'm not sure that's possible either. A lot of it is just down to concerns that aren't related to schooling at all.
- A lot of students don't really have a place to go for their personal problems, which is especially a concern given that they live at Hogwarts and don't have their parents on hand. Some of this is just down to the heads of house and aforementioned incompetence or personality problems.
- There's no segregation of students by their abilities or ambitions. Everyone takes the same classes, and the students that excel are being given lessons along with the students who require a lot of attention. I don't actually know how well Hogwarts handles this, and in the real world, having Gifted & Talented programs on the one hand and Special Needs on the other isn't something that all schools have the budget (or size) for. Still seems like something to look into, because Hermione is basically being held back by being in the same class as Neville, and even expected to be helping to prop up the other students. There's at least some consideration for differences in aptitude, since Hermione gets a Time Turner in book 3, but I don't know how far that extends.
- From what I gather, there's a testing-based approach to which subjects a student will take, which is combined with teacher advice and intervention. I don't know how well this works in the real world, but it suggests that the Heads of House are simultaneous teachers, counselors, disciplinarians, and altogether have too many hats, especially given how many of them (Snape especially) don't seem well-suited to all those roles. I don't particularly know that this is something you can change, or would necessarily want to if you could have the same system using the right teachers. There's obviously an enormous potential for abuse within the system, either intentionally (again, Snape) or unintentionally, and there don't seem to be a lot of checks and balances.
