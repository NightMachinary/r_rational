With the way wizards are ignorant about...basically anything outside Magical Britain, you could probably get away with having Dumbledore be completely unaware of the fact that Vice-Principal and Deputy Headmistress are basically synonymous terms.

I honestly don't think it would be out of character for Dumbledore to dismiss any objection along the lines of "Isn't that Minerva's job?", since Deputy Headmistress and Vice-Principal are /obviously/ different jobs. Like, Dumbledore might actually know that it's actually the same job, but want to give your character the title/power she needs to make the changes, and most of the rest of the wizards would just buy the logic that they're different jobs pretty easily.
