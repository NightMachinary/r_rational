Teaching does not require post grad work. And when you are on salary you get paid for the years work... so saying "And you don't get paid for the months you aren't working" is kinda irrelevant. In that case you would need to pro-rate the 40k. So it is more like 50k. It seems like you dont actually understand how salaries work. Also you need to factor in retirement benefits
