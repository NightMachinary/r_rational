  the only disabled trait I remember is Moody's peg leg, IIRC? and that is likely rare curse damage judging from his lifestyle.

Hagrid's predecessor Kettleburn lost several limbs because he dealt with the Creatures about as well as Hagrid did. Dumbledore says of him, "By the time I became Headmaster, however, Professor Kettleburn had mellowed considerably, although there were always those who took the cynical view that with only one and a half of his original limbs remaining to him, he was forced to take life at a quieter pace." He retired at the end of H/R/H's second year "to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs." Enter Hagrid stage left.

Other than that, there are a bunch of scars that do not heal, Quirrell stuttered, and Lupin's monthlies couldn't be helped beyond the Wolfsbane potion. As an AIDS metaphor, that definitely counted as a massive handicap in their society.
