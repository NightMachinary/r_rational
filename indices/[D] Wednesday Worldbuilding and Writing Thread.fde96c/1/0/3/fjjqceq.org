  The teaching methods at Hogwarts are mediocre at best. They do groupwork and lots of practical application. However, they don't explain how to learn at all. They teach no lessons on study skills. They expect you to be able to use the library right away and have no research methods classes. They teach no lessons on note-taking or essay writing.

To be fair, it's not like this is standard in the muggle world either, especially in the 1990s.

Regarding disabilities, I think it's pretty likely magic makes up for most of them, there's even cheering charms that seem to outright fix depression (the only disabled trait I remember is Moody's peg leg, IIRC? and that is likely rare curse damage judging from his lifestyle. I guess Luna counts as neurodivergent, now that I think about it.).

And in the books, I remember a pretty long scene where McGonagall guides Harry through the career choice process, that's only abridged because Umbridge was there to ruin the thing for Harry. What's truly inexcusable is having to choose main subjects at age 13. If you decide you want to become a cursebreaker at age 14 and you picked magical creatures and divination, you're fucked.

Excellent post anyway.
