  Some careers require certain subjects to be taken at N.E.W.T. -level and with a passing grade or in some cases top grades. In order to be admitted into a class at N.E.W.T. a student must first achieve an 'Outstanding' or 'Exceeds Expectations' at O.W.L.-level in order to cope with the upcoming course work, which will be much more advanced. Minerva McGonagall would not let Neville Longbottom into her N.E.W.T. Transfiguration class, because he did not achieve a high enough grade, which would limit the type of career Neville would be able to hold in the future.

Harry also thinks he won't be able to be an auror because of his Potions grade. Now imagine if there's any job Harry wanted that requires Arithmancy or Ancient Runes (in my earlier example, though I just learned this isn't confirmed, the latter would be required for getting that job).
