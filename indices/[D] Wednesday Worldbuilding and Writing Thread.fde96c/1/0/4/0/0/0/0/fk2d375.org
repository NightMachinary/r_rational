I have nothing but respect for teachers that take their craft and dig in. You seem to be the type that cares. This is an admission of fault, but please understand, this is not an apology. I'm at fault for maliciously downplaying your professional life, and you're at fault for making assumptions about mine.

My stance was far more malicious. I walk it back to the extent that I can. Teach on. Be the best you can be.
