Your reply irritated me enough that I felt the need to respond in a dead thread. I listed it as a sequence of activities; rather than reply to the entire sequence you cherry-picked two examples that made me sound lazy. Over the past five years, I've written several hundred pages of text; created dozens of worksheets; assembled / edited / and introduced well over a hundred primary sources; built four pieces of classroom furniture; and made three complete games using hours of research and basic probabilistic modeling to design the rules, with many more basic games. I doubt you've done half as much in your professional life, however long that may be.

Furthermore, I said it was time-consuming and sometimes tedious. I did not say it was the most difficult part of my job or least enjoyable part of my job. Nor did I advocate for increased teacher pay. Your reply is actively malicious; you were clearly looking for an excuse to shit on teachers and deliberately misused a description of one section of my day to do so.

Please do not reply to me unless it's an apology. I have no interest in your opinions.
