It's very interesting to hear this. I'm in Singapore and our system is set up very differently. I admit that as a subject head I'm much less regimented than most but I don't expect detailed planning from my teachers. We plan a broad scheme of work at the beginning of each year and tweak it as we go along. I let my teachers get on with it so long as everyone is broadly where they should be.

I teach pre university and at younger levels it is more structured but what I see of American teachers having to spend ungodly amounts ot time planning always shocks me. My subject is Literature and the set texts change every few years so we have to actually write new materials- my colleagues over in the science or maths departments have content which barely changes.
