  I would like to think (even if you re use material) you are tailoring it to your students needs and ability.

There are typically 20 kids per class. That's enough for a bell curve. So whatever you prepped the previous year would apply to the current students. At most there will be a few more better students or a few more worse students but your previous course would have already had content for those extremes so you are already covered.
