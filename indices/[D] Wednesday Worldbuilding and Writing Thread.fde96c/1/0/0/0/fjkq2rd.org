This is a major theme of a lot of Roald Dahl's books as well. Dahl was raised in this system (see his autobiography, “Boy”) and /hated/ it. He hated the system to the point where he faked illness to escape school for as long as possible as a young child and as a young adult was punished for refusing to participate in the system and for refusing to haze younger students. He considered it cruel, barbaric, and evil. It's why so many of his novels (e.g., Matilda) are about children having troubles with terrifyingly crazy school systems and why all those stories involve a clever and fundamentally good child breaking the system, or at least getting revenge against it.
