The guinea used to be 1 pound, but the increased availability of silver meant that people saved up pounds, exchanged it for guineas and then melted the guineas to sell the gold for more pounds than they started with.

Of course, the guinea more or less dissapeared from circulation, causing problems when wanting to do larger transactions, so they reset the value of the guinea to 21 shillings or 1,05 pounds.

The problem soon returned though, as silver continued to drop in value compared to gold, and soon the guinea had to be replaced by the sovereign, which had less gold in it.

This is why if you see people using guineas in older books and movies (such as in Jane Austen's novels and their movie adaptions) they are flexing on people, saying they can afford to pay more for something than regular people do, using currency almost no-one has access to.
