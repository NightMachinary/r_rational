Let me share this with you, friend. I'm an electrical designer and here's how wires are sized.

From smallest to largest commercially available,

* 12, #10, #8, #6, #4, #3, #2, #1, #0, #00, #000, #0000, 250kcmil, 300kcmil, 350kcmil, 400kcmil, 500kcmil, 600kcmil, 750kcmil, 1000kcmil
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: kcmil-300kcmil-350kcmil-400kcmil-500kcmil-600kcmil-750kcmil-1000kcmil

Even outside that, there's weird stuff based on industry standards. Such as the standard, off the shelf breaker box comes in 30A, 60A, 100A, 225A, 400A, 600A... But you can't find a 225A breaker to protect the panel, they go 100A, 200A, 400A... For some unknown reason, the breaker box can handle 25A more than the breaker to protect it at 200A, and only this size. All the others match.

Though it is a little comforting to know that the coffee books are both metric and imperial. My sister is in Canada so I sometimes help her with conversions, but include things like "70 degrees Freedom is 20 degrees Communist" just because it slightly agitates her and I'm an older sibling, it's one of my few job perks.
