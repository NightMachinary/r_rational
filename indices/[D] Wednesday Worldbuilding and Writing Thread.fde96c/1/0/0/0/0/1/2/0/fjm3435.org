I don't remember if points are tiebreakers, but running up the score definitely has value.

I think that they play round Robin and I believe most wins wins, if two teams tie then it comes down to points. They beat slytherin one year by beating another team by 180 or so. They needed Harry to not get the snitch until they were up by 30 points.
