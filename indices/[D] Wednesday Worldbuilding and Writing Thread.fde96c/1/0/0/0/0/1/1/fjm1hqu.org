Quidditch seems like an inherently flawed game. Especially when you bring the fact that the school awards points to the houses of these teams. And since there is no timer, all it takes is a little collusion with the Seekers purposefully avoiding catching the snitch, and draw the game out as long as possible, racking up points for both sides. As many points as they feel like they want, or just exactly enough as they both need to guarantee being the top 2 teams, and then when you've broken the gap, then rush the snitch. Oh and you win the House Cup guaranteed, until Dumbledore gives 6,000 points to someone for giggles.
