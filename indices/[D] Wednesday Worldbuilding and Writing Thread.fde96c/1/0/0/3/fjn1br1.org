this is probably tied into the class system of the time which didn't especially want people to achieve things based on their abilities except in a very limited cases.

Exceptionally bright or talented people could survive and thrive in the school system - especially those talented in sports or just very intelligent. Leaders were valuable, but you don't need very many of them. What you want for the rest of society is people who are somewhat competent, but do what they are told. The school system was brutal - but it largely was designed to teach exactly what was required by society. A few leaders, and a bunch of people who did what they were told and had a gut instinct for what happened to those who tried to act outside normal expectations.
