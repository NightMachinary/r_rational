Feel free! An addendum on the point of too few teachers. I did some more research, and Harry's year is extra small because of the Death Eater war. Most people calculate the size of magical Britain to a little less than 10,000, around 8k or so. That would put the usual Hogwarts population at 720 - 900, which is closer to Rowling's estimate. Hogwarts class sizes must be massive, which explains why the kids are so poorly supervised. I imagine teachers use quick quills or somesuch to grade, which is like using weak AI.
