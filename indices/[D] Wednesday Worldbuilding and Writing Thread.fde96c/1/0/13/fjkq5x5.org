Could it be the books are based off a kids POV where he doesn't really understand the way it works? Also schooling in the UK stops being mandatory around age 16 right? Don't they already have a pretty big blue collar or academic tract setup in their schools?

It's also not stated that there's no adult magic education. Is there some sort of magical community college where post Hogwarts people can try and better themselves?

Additionally, it seems like there has to be some other magical school in the UK, I just always thought Hogwarts was like the Eton of the magical world. They make it seem like you have to get accepted to the school. Where do the pure bloods who don't get accepted go? Or is it guaranteed for pure bloods and chance for mud bloods? I think it's more likely this is the biggest and by far the best school to the point that the other schools are treated almost as if they don't exist which would be amplified in the mind of a kid who knows nothing about the magical world.
