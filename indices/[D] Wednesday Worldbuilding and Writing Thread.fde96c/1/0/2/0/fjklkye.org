The can hang around, but are looked down on. The caretaker was a squib as I recall, or at least rumored to be. Hagrid was banned from magic given his parantige, but masked his wand as an umbrella on and kept it on the DL

My guess is mudbloods just wander away but pure bloods think themselves better off on the low rung than in the muggle world; especially how misinformed they are of muggle life; they likely think of it as living like a Monty Python peasant (Oh, Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here)

Edit: changed Harris to Hagrid, Autocorrect was helping!
