There are quite a few I think. The woman that is a witness at Harry's trial in half blood prince is one. The guy stealing from Sirius's house is another. Filtch from the school is one and even has a magic correspondence course.

There are different degrees of it. Harry's aunt and uncle know about magic, but can't do it. Although his aunt knows more than she lets on. The witness can't do anything but knows about magic life. Mundungus knows enough to make money stealing magical items.

There is an amount of base knowledge the magic users have that isn't explained. It lets harry be the fish out of water, and the reader finds it about it through him finding out. They know what they can, and can't do. Without getting in trouble with the ministry of magic.
