  However, they don't explain how to learn at all. They teach no lessons on study skills. They expect you to be able to use the library right away and have no research methods classes. They teach no lessons on note-taking or essay writing. Hogwarts is very much a sink or swim environment to the detriment of students. When they do lecture, there's little class discussion. Student learning has a sizeable improvement if you go from asking individual students questions to telling the class to talk to their neighbor. In Snape's, I think you get punished for class discussion.

Boy you just described my experience in the finnish school system to a tee.

I'm 27 and not once in my school career did I have a class on note taking. Possibly one or two 2 hour long classes of essay writing in 12 years of school. Nothing about researching subjects, and the only reason I even know how to use a library is because my mom taught me.

To this day whenever I'm in doing a training class for work or whatever, I go by ear and write nothing down. In school I just wrote down random sentences to keep the teachers off me.

Back in school classes were also always purely listening to the teacher or doing assignments. The only talking allowed from students was for answering the teachers questions. The assignments were also almost exclusively solo ones, there were only around 10 group assignments per school year.
