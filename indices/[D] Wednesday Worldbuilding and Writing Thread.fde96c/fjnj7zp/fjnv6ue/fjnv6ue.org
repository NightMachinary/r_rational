One of the things this sub loves to do is taking an existing work of fiction and trying to make it rational.

I.e. ensuring that the magic/scifi obeys coherent rules, that those have sensible consequences on the world's economics and politics, that the characters' motivations and decisions make sense etc.

The joke, such as it is, is that doing it to Alice in Wonderland would be very hard.
