I'm not sure what point the article is trying to make. Putting ideas in categories is a heuristic; saying that a heuristic can usually help you process reality, but sometimes leads you to make mistakes is a bit of a tautology.

Also, I'm hyper-super-really wary of "Here's a cognitive bias I found, it explains why these types of opinion are wrong" types of reasoning. It's really easy to see any given cognitive bias everywhere, even when you're not trying to prove someone wrong and legitimately trying to understand people.
