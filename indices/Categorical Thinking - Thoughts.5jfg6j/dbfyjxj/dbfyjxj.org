[[/r/rational][r/rational]] is a subreddit devoted to the discussion of works of rational and rationalist fiction. This means that nonfiction work like this does not belong here. However, there are other subreddits that some of our users frequent that would be a pretty good place. I know that [[/r/lesswrong][r/lesswrong]] exists, and I believe that there is a community at [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]] that is into rationality (though make sure to read their rules before you post; it's a subreddit related to someone's blog). I hope this helps!
