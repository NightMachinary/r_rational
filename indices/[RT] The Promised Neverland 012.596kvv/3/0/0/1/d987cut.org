I'm thinking Norman told Don and Gilda the rope locations but Don was told privately by Norman about a different location than what Ray heard it was going to be since Norman couldn't be sure it was Ray if Don and Ray were told the same thing. Or maybe it's another bluff unless the next chapter reveals some other line of reasoning.

Three tests for trying to find out who is the snitch, or maybe four in this chapter. Norman questioning Emma about whether she would take a known spy as they escape, he seemed somewhat surprised at first by her answer, either by her naivety or the valuing of the spy's life. I think it's consistent with her character and Norman remarks that as well after she explains herself.
