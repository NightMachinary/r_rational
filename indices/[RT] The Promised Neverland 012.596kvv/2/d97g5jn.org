If they were paranoid enough they would have checked if Ray was an spy a long time ago, especially because he believed them too easily .I don't think he is the spy , although they have reasons to suspect him, he has shown that he is capable of at least try to abandon the other kids and probably the trap was also for Ray, maybe Norman told him something different from what he told the other two so the trap was also for him ( or he didn't do that but is going to bluff and try to get a reaction from Ray .Probably Norman is suspicious of Ray because he thinks Ray is capable of betraying them if he sees their chances Of surviving very low .
