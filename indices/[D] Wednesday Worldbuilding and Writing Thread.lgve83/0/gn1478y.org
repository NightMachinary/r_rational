Most stories about simulated realities have the simulation being done on some kind of supercomputer and/or the people's own dreams. A much more interesting story would be people being emulated on a non computer substrate- for example, [[https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/470007b39d192]] (one of the most underrated stories I've read). Imagine one day, everyone starts having their thoughts jumbled and objects malfunction or disappear from reality, because a ship's engines blowed some plants around.
