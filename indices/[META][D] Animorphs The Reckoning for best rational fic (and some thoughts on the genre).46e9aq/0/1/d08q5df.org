I wish you hadn't let the Chee exist. I like the idea of the Animorphs being totally alone. I also kind of hate the Chee anyways. Maybe you should kill off all the Chee soon? And all dogs on planet Earth too, as deific punishment for the Chee having existed earlier. Remember that being extremely mean to characters for no reason is the best tool of any writer. The Chee are way too OP. The animorphs shouldn't get access to any technology that they don't earn.

Maybe it would be helpful for you to consider the question, if this /were/ going to end up as a futile tragedy, what would happen? Then you can take aspects of the tragedy story and put them into the actual story, regardless of whether or not the real story ends up being entirely tragic. I want the Animorphs to win, but I feel like you have been holding back a bit too much.

I think we arguably need more Yeerk characters other than Visser 3, like a prominent mook or spy chief or something. He feels too much like a one man operation at the moment. He needs advisors or something. If he doesn't interact with anyone besides Alloran, his character becomes predictable and stagnant. I enjoy how smart he is, but he seemingly has almost no personality besides that, which is disappointing.
