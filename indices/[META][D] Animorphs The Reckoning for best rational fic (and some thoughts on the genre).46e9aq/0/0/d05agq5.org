In chapter 1, Elfangor gives a Andalite-Chronicles-compliant timeline for Alloran's capture. In chapter 10, Cassie remembers it as "the yeerks started the war by abducting Alloran", which I guess is an idea you came up with after writing chapter 1.

Also, I had a really long and interesting rant about the way you treated the yeerks' personalities and the way you seemed to be planning ahead for your story, but Ctrl+W ate it. Since I'm too tired to write it all again, I'll sum it up: thinking up all the details of the morphing cube technology and the leeran biology in advance is cool. Doing the same with the yeerk psychology instead of defaulting to the early canon "supervillain henchman" personality would be cool too. Also, it had the word Xx_Ellimist_xX.

And while we're dumping things raw from my sleepy brain: the thing in early canon where Chees abudcted yeerks and submitted then to reverse controlling was super creepy and at odds with them being actual pacifists. Why the hell did you keep it? Actually, why do you draw from early canon that much? A lot of the concepts Applegate introduced became cooler after she revisited them, so working with their first version seems a bit odd.
