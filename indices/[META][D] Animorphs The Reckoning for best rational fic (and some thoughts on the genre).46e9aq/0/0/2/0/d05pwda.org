We know that "Ellimist" is not his real name, but rather a pseudonym he took when playing the local equivalent of Spore. A lot of pseudonyms in the real world of the real reality are not merely composed of an invented word, but instead have added formatting, like Xx_[your name]_xX or [your handle]_42, etc... So I found it amusing to imagine that Toomin's pseudonym would be something like XoOo_Ellimist_oOoX and mention it offhandedly.

I tend to think that the range of books between book 13 (the one with escaped Hork Bajiirs) and the first ghostwritten books (up to book 30, the one where Marco tries to kill Visser 1 on a mountain) are the sweet spot. Before that, Applegate was still figuring things out. After that, the stories really started to become gimmicky and repetitive. Also, the Chronicles. They are all awesome and I'm squeeing every time I see a reference to them in the fic.

Finally, for the first point : I disagree, this is not an error Elfangor would make. This is like someone saying "Yeah, the Nazis started invading Poland in 1941 as part of operation Barbarossa", right after the end of the war. People wouldn't make this confusion, let alone military officers.
