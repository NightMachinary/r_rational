I like that the yeerks get an intelligence upgrade also but if both sides are equally intelligent and one side has far greater resources and there's no plot armor then it's going to be one-sided. One possible solution is a bizarre ethical/religious system the yeerks constrain themselves to, but I haven't thought that idea through. It may or may not make for a good story. There has to be something the good guys have that the bad guys don't or there isn't a story. So far it's been good but if you just faithfully play it out where one side is heavily advantaged then that side will win.

I realize that it's completely possible you thought of this already and it just hasn't been revealed yet. I'm just mentioning it as a concern going forward.
