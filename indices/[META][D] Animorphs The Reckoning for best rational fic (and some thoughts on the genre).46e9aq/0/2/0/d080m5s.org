Yeah, one of the advantage the yeerks would have in your average rational fic is that they're assumed to be the Empire: the leaders are ruthless and evil, the minions are loyal, and there is no bureaucracy or counter-productive rituals slowing them down.

Which leads me to wonder what the counterfactual story would look like: a story where the Yeerks Empire has a massive technological and logistical advantage over the animorphs, but is slowed down by their complex system of government, or their rivaling churches? Food for thought.

EDIT: Before anyone answers "but Visser 1 and Visser 3 do fight", I'd say that doesn't really count: most of the vissers we see are cooperating with the empire and with each other. We don't see V1 sabotaging the shark factory to hinder V4's progresses on Leeran. We don't see the Animorphs winning battles thanks to the disruptive efforts of the Peace Movement. No minion ever goes "Well, I failed this mission. Guess it's time to organize Visser 3's assassination before he figures it out!".
