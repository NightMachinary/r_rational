Visser 1 and 3 were political rivals. They put the job first (ignoring Visser 3's impulsiveness) but other than that they'd jump at the chance to eliminate the other. I could easily imagine human rivals acting the same way.

The only examples I can remember of yeerk vs yeerk are Visser 3's cannibalistic brother-twin and that scene in Visser where the council of 13 killed one of its members off-camera while debating Visser 1's court martial thing. Technically taxxon-controllers do it in feeding frenzies but that's involuntary so it doesn't count.

I remember that better than I would have expected given how long it's been. Huh.
