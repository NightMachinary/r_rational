I disagree. The Reckoning is nicely written, and the worldbuilding looks interesting so far. However, the protagonists just fail too hard at rationality for my tastes. The protagonists are stupid, then the enemy is clever, and then the protagonists get saved by dumb luck / divine intervention.

Consider: The obvious plan of action for the protagonists would be:

1. Recruit smart and mature people into their resistance
2. Whatever they and their new recruits can come up with

Obvious way of recruiting would be to send one (Marco?) to move across the country and probably never return. The recruiter would have free pick among non-prominent sciency people. By demonstrating morphing he could convinve any science-minded rational person that his story is sufficiently plausible and the stakes are sufficiently high. This also solves funding (every recruit will give his full net worth), and moral considerations (nonexisting because of high stakes).

Meh, now I want to read a fic where exactly this happens.
