You're neglecting the fact that these are fourteen-year-olds who've had basically ONE WEEK thus far to adapt to the realities of an alien invasion, much of which was spent under time pressure of one form or another. A story in which they were /that/ on-the-ball from the get-go would be unrealistic and boring, falling square into the ubermensch wish fulfillment fantasy hole that some people are criticizing HPMOR for.

The fact that it strikes you as the obvious move means that it's clearly something that's going to occur to the protagonists before very long unless I'm not doing my job. But personally I think I'm /already/ pushing it on the realism axis, when it comes to how quickly I've let them start breaking their mental boundaries and thinking outside the box.
