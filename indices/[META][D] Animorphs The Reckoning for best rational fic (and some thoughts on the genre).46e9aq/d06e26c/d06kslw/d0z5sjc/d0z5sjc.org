Searching for more competent people to take the weight of responsibility off ones shoulders seems like the most obvious move to me for any kid that didn't grow up with trust issues. Like, why /does/ Jake think that he should even be making the decision whether to inform the Army or not? For Tobias it makes sense because authority has never made his life easier, Cassie seems to have off-loaded decision making more than partially on the others and shouldn't feel as much of an urge to do it further and Rachel characterization is more of a do instead of think anyway. But for reluctant leader Jake and straight man Marco it is rather weird. Especially since not only is "everything is horrible and we need help" a natural reaction but you have already shown Jake, Marco and Cassie think along such lines on screen.

But I'd prefer if you explored Jake and Marco's behavior regarding this more deeply instead of having them just suddenly decide to look for help as if they'd just not thought of it till now.
