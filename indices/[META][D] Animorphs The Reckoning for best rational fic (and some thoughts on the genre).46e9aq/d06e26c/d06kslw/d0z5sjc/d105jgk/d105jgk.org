Eh. May be a bit of a mistake on my part, as a writer. But honestly, I think it's pretty realistic for them to have only now reached the decision. They were reacting-reacting-reacting for the first few days, with no real time to reach out. Then Jake was comatose and Marco was wrecked, while Cassie was PTSD'ing and missing. Now's really the first chance they've had to convince themselves it's a good move.
