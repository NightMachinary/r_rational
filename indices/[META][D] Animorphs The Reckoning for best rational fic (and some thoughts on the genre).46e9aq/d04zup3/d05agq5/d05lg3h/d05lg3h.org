Alloran: Correct, I changed things between Ch. 1 and Ch. 10. I think it makes much, much more sense for Alloran's Fall to have been the opening move of the war, and will clean up the confusion on a later pass. Currently, I think it's actually sort of realistically neat that people get details confused, but it's bad writing and will be clarified so that the /reader/ doesn't get confused (or think /I'm/ confused).

Yeerks' personalities: We've seen extremely little of the Yeerk culture thus far (one open exchange with a Controller, plus Esplin who is a known aberration). I have done the same level of thinking for the Yeerks, and I think you have pleasant surprises ahead of you for the depth and nuance of what's going on with the Yeerk species as a whole. Your complaint is a good reminder that I could have seeded these things sooner, and that I should start including bits of detail ASAP.

The Chee: There's got to be /some/ way for them to interact directly with the Yeerks, or the whole deal about them being worthwhile to the Animorphs by being informants falls apart. It's already curtailed by V3's discovery of their true nature, but---well---tbh, I just didn't question the whole reverse Controller thing? Which is weird, since I was questioning just about everything else. I dunno. Maybe I'm status-quo-biasing myself into this opinion, but I think it's an interesting compromise already. Like, they've got to have some sort of programming loophole which doesn't recognize infestation as violence, or they'd be compelled to put a stop to it, right? Something like, Yeerks maintain their hosts, so their hosts tend to brush their teeth and exercise and eat right, so the Chee involuntarily categorize it as acceptable or something. So there's something screwy with their programming already, and having that allow for them to hold Yeerks in stasis or hypnosis or whatever seems legit. Yell at me if I'm being lame, though.

I generally draw from very early and very late canon because those felt like the parts that were most considered. Like, the ghostwritten books with Atlantis and the starfish and the ant morphing into a human---that stuff's just straight-up insane. Early canon (with reasonable tweaks) is the story I wanted to tell.

Xx_Ellimist_xX? Does that mean "don't include the Ellimist"? If so, sorry---Ellimist is in, and important. I will go ahead and say that I'd like for this to be a story about the Animorphs, and not a story in which none of the characters matter because it's secretly all between God and Satan. This is a hard balance to strike in a rational fic, because Ellimist is ... well, /God/. But I think I've got the right structures into place to make it happen.

Thank you for putting forth actual criticism! I found it useful, and I'm grateful. Summary: 1) Yeah, I screwed up, 2) I agree; look forward to it, 3) Hmm, good point; I'm initially tending to make no changes but I want to mull it over.
