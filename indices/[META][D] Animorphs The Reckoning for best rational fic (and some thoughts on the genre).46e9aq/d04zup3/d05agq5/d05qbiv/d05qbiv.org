  the thing in early canon where Chees abudcted yeerks and submitted then to reverse controlling was super creepy and at odds with them being actual pacifists.

Depends on how you define pacifism, and maybe even aggression. The Chee probably consider pacifism to be nonviolence. Keeping a Yeerk captive but fed probably qualifies as nonviolent for them, especially considering that it might be naive for us to expect that our ethical codes would fully overlap. Maybe the Pemalites had a different theory of looking at things.
