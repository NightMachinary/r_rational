I totally agree that HPMOR is more "awesome". When I say that I expect (even hope) that future ratfic will look more like Metropolitan Man, I don't mean that it will not be awesome (though it may be hard to be as awesome as HPMOR).

Basically my view is that HPMOR created a community/genre, and to do that it basically had to convince (at least some) readers that, for example, death is bad and rationality is important. Because it was meant as an educational work, there's also a lot of references to studies and explicit teaching moments. I think that these things tend to make HPMOR worse as a work of literature.

What future ratfic can do that HPMOR didn't or couldn't include things like:

- Just having a rational character and assuming that the audience is on board

- Showing fun/interesting/rational thought processes but excluding descriptions of specific studies

- Focusing on just one aspect of rationality

- Having a more focused plot / less "fluff'

- Probably more... :/

It isn't that the above things automatically make potential future stuff better than HPMOR, but future stuff will lack a lot of restrictions that HPMOR had as result of the things it was trying to accomplish.
