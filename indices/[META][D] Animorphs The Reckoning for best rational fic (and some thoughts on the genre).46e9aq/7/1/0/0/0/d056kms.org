  But the Watsonian reasons just aren't enough to cover for it.

How so? I havn't known a lot of ten year olds, since having been one, but none of the characters struck me as unbelievable. Harry had another soul in him, and he was home-schooled by intelligent people. Hermione was schooled in a similar way, and she seemed to show the childishness one should expect from an ordinary soul. Draco's development was accelerated in exactly the way I'd expect the ideological and political antigens in his environment to have pushed him - humans have always had innate talents for callousness and deceit, and he had a very good teacher.

And the other kids seemed about as dull as they should.

So what's the problem?
