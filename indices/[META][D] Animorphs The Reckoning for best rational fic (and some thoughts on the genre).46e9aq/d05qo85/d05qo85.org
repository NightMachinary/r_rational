I really agree with the part about the "standard rationalist hero". A common point in a lot of SI fics and rational fics is that the world feels warped because they treat 'being right' the way most stories treat 'winning fights': you're only allowed to do it if you're a protagonist. HP:MoR had this problem (the only one who consistently gets things right is Tom Riddle, and characters like Amelia Bones or Hermione are only allowed to compensate in their own domain of expertise). With this Ring also has something similar, where the protagonist notices at some point that he started to think of himself as the only person who can possibly take a good initiative in the whole universe.

On the other hand, the Metropolitain Man is really balanced: Lex Luthor, Lois Lane and (briefly) Superman are all allowed to have different, opposed opinions and argue them in compelling ways. This is something that MoR also does, but MM goes one step further and allows these three characters (as well as side characters like the cops or Mercy) to have insights of their own, being level 2 intelligent instead of level 1, using Yudowsky's words. Luthor can imagine compelling arguments to stop Superman (the last BvS trailer gives me hope we might see something similar with Batman's motivations), Lois Lane can think about the ways Superman should do more for other people, Superman can understand these critics and point out the hypocrisy in people demanding he saves the world instead of doing it themselves.

Anyway, my point was, The Reckoning does something even more awesome: it gives us 5+ separate viewpoint characters, all with level 2 intelligence, all with both common sense and imagination, and their own domain of expertise. And then, they bicker. All. The. Friggin. Time. Awesome.

EDIT FROM 7 MONTHS LATER: Boy was I wrong about Batman V Superman.
