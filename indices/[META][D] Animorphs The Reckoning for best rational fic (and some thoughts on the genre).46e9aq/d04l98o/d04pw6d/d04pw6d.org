HPMOR was really, /really/ preachy, and that turns a lot of people off. It also can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or serious. I mean, comedies can be serious, and serious stories can be comedic, but HPMOR took this to extremes. There's also the fact that none of the children are believable as children.
