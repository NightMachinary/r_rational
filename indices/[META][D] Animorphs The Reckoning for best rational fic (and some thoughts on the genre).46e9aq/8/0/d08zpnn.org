I write a cycle of 6 or 7 chapters spaced two weeks apart, and then I take a break for a month or so. Once I start updating on March 1, it'll be a solid 3 months of updates, and then a break for the summer.

That being said, feel free to wait until it's all over. Currently I think it'll take at least 5 rotations (we're about to start the third), and certainly well fewer than 15.
