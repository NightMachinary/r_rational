Personally, I really like 'Animorphs; the Reckoning' to, particularly the characterizations of Marco and Jake and how they think. I just like in a different way than HPMOR. I think people liked HPMOR because it was written about a fandom where the average reader could spot a thousand little things in canon that, if properly explored, could have ended the plot. Animorphs was something I read and didn't really have any misgivings about logic wise (unlike Harry Potter), so this fic didn't really give me the joy of seeing some of my criticisms of canon fulfilled like HPMOR did. Instead it simply made more the story more realistic, and gave every character a fully functioning brain and personality- exactly what rational fiction should do.
