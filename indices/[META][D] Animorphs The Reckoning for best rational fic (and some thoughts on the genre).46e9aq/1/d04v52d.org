One specific thing I would like to remark upon regarding the Reckoning is that I really enjoy seeing the viewpoints, on both sides, of people thinking through a situation in what appears to be a rather logical, reasonable way... and ending up with totally wrong conclusions. And then we have people who are actually smart who are shown not just somehow magically reaching the correct conclusions, but instead detecting that something is wrong with their wrong conclusions, picking at the problem and coming up with better options.
