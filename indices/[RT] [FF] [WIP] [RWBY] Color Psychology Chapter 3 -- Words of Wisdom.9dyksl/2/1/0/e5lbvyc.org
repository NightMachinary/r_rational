  Chapter 2. Very long infodump at the beginning.
#+end_quote

Damn, and here I thought I was being so clever disguising my infodump as a character moment. Ah well :P

Do you think it's salvageable with a bit of trimming and a more natural segue at the beginning of the chapter, or does it just need to get cut and the same information worked in somewhere else?

(Also, if anyone else is reading this deep into the thread, I'm curious how it came across to other people.)

#+begin_quote
  "She did a quick calculation in her head": Nobody does that.
#+end_quote

Good point; it came across pretty bad to me too on a re-read. I'll fix that.
