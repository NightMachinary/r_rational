If you're looking for a differing opinion, I felt the past few chapters read fine. I noticed the beginning of chapter two as an infodump but it felt tastefully done. Ruby's character as someone who likes to focus on the conceptual parts of the world stood out, and it also left me wondering what part of Jaune's past would cause him not to know about this.

At the same time, part of the intrigue of world building comes from its mysteries. There's this urge as a writer to display everything about your world upfront which can lead to infodumps. Having it woven in bit by bit into characterization and the events of the story would leave enough room for speculation while still giving readers new information to work with.
