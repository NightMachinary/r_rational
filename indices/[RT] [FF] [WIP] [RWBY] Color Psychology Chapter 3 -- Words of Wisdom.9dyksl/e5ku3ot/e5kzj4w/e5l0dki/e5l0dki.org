Thanks!

  Be careful with publishing several fics at once. Or are you dropping the Naruto one?

I have no idea what I'm going to do with that fic. I started it when I was much younger (I wrote the first chapter way before the publish date on FF), and I've sort of lost the ability to naturally write in that voice, so writing new chapters that aren't jarringly different in tone is like pulling teeth.

I don't want to just abandon it, but I also wasn't really producing chapters at any sort of reasonable rate, so it's on a very intermittent update schedule right now.

  Perhaps stop writing "End" at the end of every chapter? Freaks me out every time that it's the end of the fic.

Interesting; I'll stop doing that.

  unless you plan the plot to be a relatively peaceful or at least catastrophe-free school life

That would be a hell of a troll -- just hang a bunch of guns on the wall, and instead of firing them the whole fic is spent giving classroom infodumps and dealing with normal school stuff. :P
