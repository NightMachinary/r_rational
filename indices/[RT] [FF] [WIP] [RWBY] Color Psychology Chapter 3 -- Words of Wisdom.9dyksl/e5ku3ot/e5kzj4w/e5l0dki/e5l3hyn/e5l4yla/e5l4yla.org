  I'm not asking for RWBY-Chibi style ratfic ... screw that, I am asking for RWBY-Chibi style ratfic. I just know that will never happen.

A RWBY Chibi style of ratfic would be an interesting challenge. Part of that aesthetic is a feeling of low stakes (nobody will die, nothing will change too drastically, Jaune will never learn how Pyrrha feels, etc. etc.). Low stakes means you need to use different tools than most ratfics to keep people interested. Humor is one option, like RWBY Chibi itself. Cranking the mystery component up to 11 is another; even if you know everything will be fine, trying to figure out what's going on can be interesting.

I think you could probably do it. Fanfiction is also unusually well-suited to this kind of thing, because people already care about the characters, which is normally hard to accomplish in a low-stakes setting. (I think this is why RWBY Chibi works so well, actually. You get to bring Pyrrha back, and everyone is super excited precisely because of what happened in the main continuity.)

  But I do think that the style of Volume 1 is better suited for exploring psychological profiles of the cast than the style of Volume 3. Do you?
#+end_quote

Volume 1 was definitely more character-driven, and Volume 3 more plot-driven. I think you could probably use either style to explore people's psychology; the first style would focus more on their everyday psychology, and the second on how they handle and respond to big or stressful events.

In general, though, I think character-driven writing works better for fanfiction. People are reading fanfiction in the first place because they want to read about their favorite characters.
