Be careful with publishing several fics at once. Or are you dropping the Naruto one?

Perhaps stop writing "End" at the end of every chapter? Freaks me out every time that it's the end of the /fic/.

Besides that, I don't have anything particularly negative to say, /yet/. I might, however, when the actual plot starts (unless you plan the plot to be a relatively peaceful or at least catastrophe-free school life. Which would be awesome by me).

P.S. Applying makeup must be hell for huntresses XD
