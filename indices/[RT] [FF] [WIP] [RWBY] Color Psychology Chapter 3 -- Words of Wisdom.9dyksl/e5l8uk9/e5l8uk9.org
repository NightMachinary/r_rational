In most online fiction, you will get mainly positive feedback, but I don't think that's especially true for posts on this sub, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/895oxt/rtwip_aeromancer_chapter_1/][eg]]. which got mixed responses, especially negative to begin with. I genuinely like the style of your writing which is easy to like and has little to complain about. But since you asked for criticism...

I showed this to my friend and he took the expectation of consistency in rational fics quite far:

Chapter 1. Why does Yang need to wear Ember Celica while Ruby runs her diagnostics? -> Maybe it requires aura to be run, but it should be explained at some point. "tangle of wires of wires connecting Ruby's scroll to Ember Celica": Why are there multiple wires when there are only two devices being connected? Why does Ruby actually stop after checking only one gauntlet; testing one device doesn't check for flaws in the other? -> Maybe she wasn't checking for device faults, but design faults, in which case one gauntlet would suffice. My friend has a gripe with authors using big words where simpler words would suffice, since often times the audience wouldn't be familiar with them and it would slow down the reading or go over their heads. Eg. "proprioception" where 'perception' would make more sense and is a word that more people would understand. "washing into her brain, down her spinal cord, through her whole central nervous system" appears to be a tautology, though it does get the right feeling across -> maybe replace CNS with just 'nervous system', or something else that fits. My friend knows all the words himself and gets that, since it's targeted to rational-fic readers, the audience will understand more technical vocabulary, but he doesn't feel that it's necessary. "armor that covered your ribcage but not your stomach.. should be the opposite": The opposite doesn't make much sense either. At least the former looks cool. + if this was an issue for yourself (not just ignorant Ruby), then you can also change it so he gets a full chestplate. "it was so heavy. So inefficient, but so cool": Why is it inefficient? A sword is meant to be heavy to impart more momentum, and I'm not sure how you're meant to make it more efficient. "Why did you decide to forge your weapon": Second friend interrupts, quoting a generic engineering response - maintains grainflow parallel to the surface to prevent shear planes and elongates the grains to increase hardness. Forging is expensive for each part, but in a single-part object like Jaune's sword, it is /the best/. "middle of a civilian craft": This is a craft with only students headed for beacon, where you've clearly said that every student has their weapon on them. She was swinging around Jaune's sword before anyways and [as far as we know] that didn't kick up a fuss, so just /holding/ a big weapon shouldn't be that much of a concern.
