I would prefer if it was cut, and into many pieces, but I don't know how hard that is to do since you'd have to rewrite quite a bit. I do feel like the colour psychology theory is not something that needs exposition to explain, until maybe later when there is an important detail. Thinking about it, this could be a spot to add worldbuilding details to show how Ruby is different from canon, and show Ruby's character by talking about what she's interested in. Of course, I have have no idea what you could put there, but that's why I suck at writing.
