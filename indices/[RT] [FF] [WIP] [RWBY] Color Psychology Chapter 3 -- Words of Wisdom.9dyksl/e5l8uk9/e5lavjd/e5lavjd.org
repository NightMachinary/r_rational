Now, I'll try and give some negative feedback of my own.

Chapter 2. Very long infodump at the beginning. It feels especially forced since the beginning of the chapter can lead to anything, but you decide to talk about clearly plot relevant details, and you have Ruby practically teach the topic to Jaune, something clearly meant for the audience instead. My recommendation: Make it shorter and put it in somewhere where it feels reasonable to talk about, maybe between two people who are familiar with the subject and are actually applying it. It now feels like a fact of the world that is being shown because it really makes sense to use here. If you want to add more information, you could put it in Ch3, after Ruby looks at her reddened hair. I like how you made the infodump give us enough information to think about the implications of her hair colour in the next chapter, so you should leave that much information. Eg. When Ruby first looks at Jaune, she notices his blonde hair and immediately thinks that he must be socially competent. That reveals a lot of information about how colour affects personalities without any extra explanation. + you could extend this to other characters and really build up this image of colour profiling being an inherent fact of the world. On the other hand, I realise now that it showed Ruby's character as someone who likes to talk at great length about conceptuals things. I don't think this is a good way to do it, since this was completely overshadowed by /infodump/.

Yep I like the red colour used to describe Pyrrha.

"She did a quick calculation in her head": /Nobody does that./ Humans have really good intuition which is much faster than our logical minds, we are built to use training to substitute for precise calculations. I'd expect that Ruby doesn't need to think about it, since we know that she is adept at using her scythe for propulsion, so she'd have lots of practice in getting a feel for how much she needs. If she /can/ calculate it and /needs/ to calculate it, then that would be quite inhuman.
