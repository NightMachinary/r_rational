Thanks! That's actually a really interesting list to read. I have my own set of things I worry come across as contrived in the first chapter, but the only intersection with your friend's list was the "middle of a civilian craft" part. (One I'm a little surprised he didn't mention: why the hell would Yang let Ruby get most of the way through doing diagnostics on Ember Celica before asking what she was doing?)

I actually went back and forth on what kind of vocabulary to use. I think it's a big turn off for certain readers, but on the other hand I really liked learning new words from reading when I was a kid. It's probably good to make sure it doesn't get excessive, though; I almost replaced the word "symbiote" with "symbiont" in the last chapter, but managed to restrain myself :P

(Also, potentially interesting sausage-making aside: I try to give characters specific verbal habits so that dialogue actually reads like two people talking, and differences in vocabulary are a super low-effort way to do that. Once Ruby has a large vocabulary, using a large vocabulary in the narration really helps give it that close-third-person feel.)
