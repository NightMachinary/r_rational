Question for anyone kind enough to read: what /negative/ feedback do you have on the story so far?

(There seems to be a pretty strong social norm in online fiction of giving almost entirely positive feedback, which I think is probably a useful social norm to have, but if anyone has any constructive criticism I'd be interested in hearing that too.)
