Thanks!

Aura was explained in only the vaguest terms in the early seasons, and then they changed it anyway in the later seasons. I don't think the way I've been writing aura directly conflicts with anything in the earlier seasons (although I could totally be wrong). It does conflict with some information in the later seasons, though, and in any case it's taking some pretty significant liberties.
