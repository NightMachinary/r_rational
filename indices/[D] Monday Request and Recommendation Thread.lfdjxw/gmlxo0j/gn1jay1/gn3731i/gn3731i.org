I wanted to like Azarinth Healer, but the main character is an almost completely uninteresting murder hobo, the litRPG side of it is a completely pointless numbers-go-up wankfest, and the writing is absolutely flat-out atrocious. It's less "riddled with grammatical errors" and more "the grammatical errors are a reflection of a chthonic madness, of which every sentence is a notarikon", and that's just the errors, not the literary Darkest Dungeon which are the /deliberate/ departures from every writing best practice ever.

I didn't like it, is what I'm saying, but thank you for the thought.
