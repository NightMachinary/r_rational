Delve is so good you're reading it twice.

Anyways, check out Azarinth Healer on RR. Fun progression litRPG, no particular focus on rationality but hits all the marks for an enjoyable popcorn fic. Best of all: it's LONG. And the upload schedule is nuts (4 chapters a week).

Quality is a bit lower in the beginning, but it quickly picks up. If you like the first 10 chapters, you're pretty much guaranteed to like the rest.
