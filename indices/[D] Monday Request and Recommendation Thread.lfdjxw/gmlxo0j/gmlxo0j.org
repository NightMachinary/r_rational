I am looking for recommendations for books or serials. (Or fanfic, but nothing from Harry Potter, My Little Pony, or Worm.) No quests.

For books, you can assume that I've read everything that's been nominated for a Hugo and everything else by that author (which is pretty close to true). My five favorite authors this morning are, in no particular order: Lois McMaster Bujold, Jo Walton, Graydon Saunders, Becky Chambers, and Arkady Martine.

For serials, my top three all-time favorites are: Unsong, A Practical Guide to Evil, and Katalepsis. I've also read... /takes a deep breath/

Lady Knight Volant (and sequels; would read similar-quality Pierce fics), Worm/Ward/Pact/Twig/Pale, Just a Bystander, [a large variety of Worm fanfic], The Wandering Inn, Saga of Soul, Harry Potter and the Natural D20, HPMOR, The Zombie Knight, Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, Delve, Cinnamon Bun, The Many Lives of Cadence Lee, Eight, New Life of a Summoned Demoness, Dungeon Crawler Carl, Devil's Foundry, Unbound, Vainquer the Dragon, Blessed Time, Tower of Somnus, Ar'Kendrithyst, Beware of Chicken, Beneath the Dragoneye Moons, that serial with the Office Space dungeon, Skyclad or whatever it's called, Delve, URGY, and Every Hero Needs A Vacation.
