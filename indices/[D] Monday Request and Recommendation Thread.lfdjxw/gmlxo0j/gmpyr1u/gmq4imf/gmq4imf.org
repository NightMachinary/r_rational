A Memory Called Empire (Arkady Martine's debut novel) is absolutely amazing and you definitely need to read it, especially since the sequel is coming out soon(!).

Brust, I have already read (Vallista was such a disappointment so hopefully Tsalmoth will be good). Robin McKinley is an old favorite. Hannu Rajaniemi, his books ring a bell but I don't think I've read them, so hooray! A book to add to the list!
