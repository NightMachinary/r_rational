Given the four first names on that list, I am pretty certain I need to go read Arkady right now.

Lets see. Steven Brust can probably be sourced from your local library. The main series is high-grade and varied fantasy, the bricks in the same universe are well done pastiches on Dumas. Do you like Dumas? Then you will like the bricks. If not, not.

Hannu Rajaniemi for science fiction set in a very, very buzy solar system by someone who actually knows their science.

Robin Mckinleys Sunshine is the only urban fantasy novel I ever bother reccing, and it deserves it. Also likely library sourceable.
