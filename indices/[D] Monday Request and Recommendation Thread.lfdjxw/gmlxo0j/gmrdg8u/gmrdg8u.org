Royalroad stuff: A Journey of Black and Red, Suoer Minion, Humble Life of a Skill Trainer, The Menocht Loop, Confessions of the Magpie Wizard, I Don't Want to be the Hive Queen. (in half-assed order of best to least best. Check out the page blurbs or my comment history in previous rec threads for details. Also use a webpage archiver for Magpie wizard, since the author got a deal with some ebook publisher and takes down the finished books after a delay from their completion)

Overlord is a good light novel series, but light novels are 100% an acquired taste, and the author of Overlord specifically loves his unusual and detailed perspective changes. For example, book 4 is 80% from the point of view of a kinda locally notable lizardman's journey, as the actual mc of the series sends one of his not-lieutenants to effortlessly conquer all the lizardman tribes. Books 12 and 13 are from the perspective of a paladin's squire, which sounds less engaging than it ends up being (also she is 100% Best Girl from the entire series, fight me).

Also I am ignoring your "no Harry Potter" thing because the There is Nothing to Fear collection/series/thing is amazing and I wholeheartedly recommend it, enough to specifically ignore your criteria. You can check out previous posts on this subreddit for discussion on it.
