I suppose take this with a grain of salt as far as aligned preferences go, since about half your list are misses for me, but I would say that TGaB is a rather poor story. The worldbuilding is cool and the characters are usualy at least decently interesting, but it suffers a lot from bloat (both in plot and in cast) and is very averse to inflicting meaningful consequences of any kind - not just character death, either.
