If one liked /Disco Elysium/ and yet never played /Planescape: Torment/, I highly recommend that one as well. To be fair, Disco Elysium is an improvement in almost everything, but still, it's very interesting to compare it to one of its main influences (or at least, the main game with the same vibe).

Also, I second this so, /so/ hard. Probably the best game of the decade.
