Lately I've been playing the early access version of /Baldur's Gate 3/, and I think it would meet your requirements. You can avoid fighting in almost every conflict with a sentient opponent by making saving throws on deception, persuasion or intimidation dialogue choices. Most of the pivotal character interactions give you at least three branching choices with fully fleshed out dialogue trees.

In my opinion it's the best story-focused isometric RPG I've played since the /Planescape/ games. I eagerly await the game's completion.
