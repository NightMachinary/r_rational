  Does this feel like a satisfying option? Sounds more like boring skill improvement and then you choose the option and hope it succeeds. And how is the reward, are you forced to fight, if you want to get decent experience and equipment?

I like skill checks in dialogue when the game appropriately rewards the player for choosing those skills. In BG3, winning the dialogue checks usually results in learning more about the person/situation/background, which is the kind of reward that I find satisfying. Off the top of my head, I can't recall if winning dialogue gave xp, but I do know that I had no trouble reaching the level cap of the early access, and my party was still competent in encounters even though I used dialogue to skip quite a few combats.

My only caveat is that each dialogue roll is a D20 saving throw, and I was sometimes frustrated by the RNG even when rolling with stats that I had maxed out (Intelligence and Charisma). I religiously used the Friends cantrip and had my cleric companion buff me with Guidance anytime I started a critical conversation. My hope is that the devs will listen to feedback and make the dialogue rolls less dependent on RNG in the finished version of the game.

  How is it compared Baldurs Gate 2 - If you have played it? I really liked the atmosphere in BG2.

I have indeed played the previous 2 BG games. Your mileage may vary, but personally I enjoy the depth of dialogue and branching quest choices in BG3 more than the simpler, more linear plot of BG1 & 2. One aspect I consider a huge improvement in BG3: unlike in the previous games, none of the NPC's are generic; they all have voiced dialogue and detailed appearances that make them interesting to talk to. This is true even for the mooks that you might end up killing depending on your choices.

Regarding atmosphere, the intro portion of BG3 is stellar for setting the scene and really gripped my imagination. After the intro, the story settles (for a while) into a more common, Sword Coast fantasy setting. However, the last third of the early access sends you adventuring into an entirely different, fascinating part of the world which has a beautiful (and perilous) atmosphere to it.

  And the companions came over as more realistic and believable as almost any other game. I found only Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic comparable, but there most were not likeable at all (for me).

Regarding companions: I recall not caring for most of the BG1 & 2 companions. To me the companions in the KOTOR games were more likeable, or at least interesting enough that I wanted to keep getting to know them even when they were being insufferable. I consider the BG3 companions to be at least as good as the ones in KOTOR; I was quite attached to my early access party members even though they frequently disagreed with my choices and hadn't fully opened up to me yet. Their distinct personalities and varied backgrounds piqued my interest, and I found them easy to empathize with.
