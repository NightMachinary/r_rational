Indeed I didn't. I am not really even pro immortality in real life given current and probable near future state of humanity. But I just took that (what I mentioned in earlier posts) away from the game. It might have been reinforced by all the other fiction which usually paints the want to be immortal as evil. Usually only evil overlords want to be immortal. Yes there is a common exception: Undying elves, but they are already born like that.

There is more to a movie than watching its sequal. More to computer memory than a memory upgrade. While I agree with that statement, your argument doesn't show anything. Anyway I am just stating my opinion here, I don't even want to argue about it and win some discussion.

Lets phrase my opinion differently: As a game about immortality P:T wasn't satisfying for me regarding the depiction of it as a general state of being. Contrary to that I found all the memories and dialogues about the consequences and ethics for the Nameless one quite good. As long as it wasn't hinting at a opinion of immortality in general. Which seemed too often to be the case. And as P:T from my perspective wanted not only to tell a story about the Nameless one, but be philosophical about immortality, it failed. And that is just my interpretation.
