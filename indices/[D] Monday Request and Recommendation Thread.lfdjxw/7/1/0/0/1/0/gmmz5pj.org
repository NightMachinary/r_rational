That area is a neat concept although visually ugly. My main complaint is it's a big set of corridors with unavoidable combat encounters in them. Not even much meaningful talking, just combat, which isn't the strength of the game.

Regarding avoiding combat, there's an entire class in Planescape Torment where you can just go invisible permanently, and avoid literally everything. With a focused build, it's only intro of the game where you need to ever worry about being seen. In comparison in TTN, IIRC you can only stealth during combats and for combat purposes so that avoidance option is off the table.
