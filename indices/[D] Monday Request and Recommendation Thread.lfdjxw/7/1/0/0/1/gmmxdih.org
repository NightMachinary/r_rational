Are you talking about the Bloom? If so, then to me that's an interesting example of how much tastes can vary. That was one of my favorite parts of the game because of how interesting the concept of that area was in comparison to most settings I've seen in video games. To me that was one of the most fun and rewarding areas to explore, partially because it was visually so bizarre.

Our opinions also differ in that I consider the dialogue, writing and characters all stellar compared to other story-focused games I've played (I've played a lot of CRPGs).

Also, your take on avoiding combat in PST is only true insofar as the game mechanics allow you to sprint past enemies and phase to the next area to avoid dying. To me that only feels technically-true to the op's request: to me, abusing the system to skip content doesn't feel like an equal alternative to actually experiencing the content and associated rewards. If you don't game Planescape's wonky, half-turnbased combat system to skip battles, then /Planescape: Torment/ and /Torment: Tides of Numenera/ actually have similar amounts of combat where diplomacy isn't an option.
