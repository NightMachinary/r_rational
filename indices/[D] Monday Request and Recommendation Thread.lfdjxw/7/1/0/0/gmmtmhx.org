I played Torment: Tides of Numenera and hated it, from a longtime Planescape:Torment fan. I'm using PST as a reference because TTN is billed as a spiritual sequal, with a direct comparison to the older game in its description on the Steam store.

In Numenara, the real star of the show is the setting, but you also don't get to see much of it. The starting city is cool, then you don't go many other places, then you spend half the game in an ugly hellhole (vague to avoid spoilers). So, you don't get to see much of the world or the best parts of the world. Even aside from that though, the plot and characters are forgettable. The writing and dialog is mediocre. It's good-for-a-videogame, but not good compared to the other dialog focused games. I'd put it as well below PST, and also below Disco Elysium.

For specifically what the OP was asking for, I also don't remember it being particularly non-combat. There's many, many points where combat seems unavoidable, and since it's turn based you can't just run past people before they can hit you. IIRC, its non-combat resolution frequently means you're just killing people with intractable environmental objects instead. Comparatively, Disco Elysium doesn't have combat and PST has a single unavoidable non-lethal combat.

Torment: Tides of Numenara was part of wave of revival of old style CRPGs along with Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2, Tyrrany, Divinity: Original Sin, Shadowrun, and smaller indie efforts like Age of Decadence. I've played all of them, and I think it's among the weakest of the group, frequently even on what's supposed to be it's strengths (writing and characters).
