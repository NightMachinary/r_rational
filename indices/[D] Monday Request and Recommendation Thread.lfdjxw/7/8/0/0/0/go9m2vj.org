They want to introduce a subscription system for CK2 where you can rent ~50% of the DLCs and base game for 5â‚¬ a month. Maybe interesting for some here.

Regarding DLCs of CK2 (3?): Have also heard that they change the balancing of the game through patches after the DLC release. So you are either forced to buy the DLC for decent gaming experience or don't update the game.
