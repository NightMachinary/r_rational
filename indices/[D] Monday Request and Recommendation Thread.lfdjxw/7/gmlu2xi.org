Are there any story driven computer role play games (RPG), where combat isn't the main focus/conflict solution of the game? The next best thing are games where you can alternatively sneak, but that is not what I am looking for.

I would like to see a game where you have well thought through mechanics to solve conflicts/quests without combat, e.g. with some diplomacy mechanics.

There are all this games that want to tell you that killing adversaries off is the only solution. And I am fed up with it.

I know that there exist game genres without combat, but I am looking for an RPG. Ideally something where I really can play the role I intended and not what the game wants me to do (kill them or walk away).
