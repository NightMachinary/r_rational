A out-of-the-blue rec for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32535/the-terrarians-reincarnation]]

It's a generic trope-filled Isekai but 1. Has decent writing, 2. Does not have a Harem or unrealistic romantic fawning over the mc. 3. Inspite what the name suggests has a cool fantasy world.

I enjoyed it so far and wanted to mention it cos the name may turn ppl off.
