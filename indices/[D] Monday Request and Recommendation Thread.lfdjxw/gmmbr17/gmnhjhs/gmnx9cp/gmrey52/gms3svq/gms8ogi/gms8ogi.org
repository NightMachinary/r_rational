I mean "story you would enjoy inserting yourself into" can be literally anything as long as the story has a defined main character, since there's such a range of people and perspectives out there. Even grimdark torture porn will be someone's wish somewhere sometime.

I took wish fulfillment as having a significantly less narrow base, and I don't think Overlord has a broad enough number of people who would swap places with the mc in a heartbeat than those who wouldn't. Like the main character literally starts the story the sole member of his formerly close group of friends who has enough good memories and free time to witness the vr game's shut down, everyone else is too busy trying to survive in a (which is revealed slowly over the course of the novels, and never an explicit focus) literal corporate hellscape dystopia where you can't breath outside with out an oxygen tank, and dead orphans in the street are not an uncommon appearance. The start of the journey has the mc losing nearly everything that could define him as human besides his memories, he is given constant reminders of the emotional capacity he has lost as well as his extreme physical changes, those loyal to him are severely delusional about him to the point that Ainz spends the entire story worried about tripping up and being either hated or turned on by them, and the powers he has claimed are 95% ways to kill things or do stuff with dead things since he specialises super hard into necromancy.

Ainz lives a life of paranoia and fear, constantly struggling to survive and navigate though social situations as he believes a large enough blunder will see him turned on by everyone around him. There's also his belief (and as a reader, the knowledge) that he could be killed at any time by a timely ambush/assassination due to his own weaknesses and the fact that he is influential enough, and hated enough as an undead, to receive such attention.

But I guess some of the monsters around him have big tits so its alright yeah?
