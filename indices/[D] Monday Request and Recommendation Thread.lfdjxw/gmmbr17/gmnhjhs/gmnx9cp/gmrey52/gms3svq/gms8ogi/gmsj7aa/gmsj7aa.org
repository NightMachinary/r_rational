  can be literally anything as long as the story has a defined main character, since there's such a range of people and perspectives out there.

Sure, if you want to be technical about it; just like anything can be a comedy or a horror depending on the perspective, and I guess pretty much all fiction is wish-fulfillment eventually.

I think I'll amend my definition; the stories OP seems to be after is one where the journey is more important than the destination. I would say wish-fulfillment are stories which skip the first part.

In the case of overlord; the wish is "Being super powerful with a group of loyal followers and being seen as a mythical/feared figure by the populace + being adored by hot girls and other people". The "unsavory" intro is skimmed over for a reason, and the interpersonal conflict is there for some stakes. All the other perspectives all feed into the "Ainz is so great" "Ainz is so powerful", "Ainz is so evil but powerful", etc feeling. They are all there not for their own sake but for amplifying the "circle-jerk" of the MC insert. (Which BTW I think is GOOD. I, and most readers of Overlord would not enjoy it otherwise, and think of it as "pointless side stories". They aren't thought of that way because they all feed into the main plot with Ainz and make you feel good).

He is super powerful from the start, got his power through no effort of his own (although even stories with effort won't make much difference to someone who enjoys it for its "wish fulfillment"), stays super powerful and the story is all there to support and amplify this feeling.

I would be very surprised if most readers would not want to swap places with him in a heart beat.

I think I agree with OP that Overlord is basically the definition of wish-fulfillment, and that's why I like it.
