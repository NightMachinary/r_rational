Ainz has an incredible knowledge of spells from his dedication to Yggdrasil, and his combat effectiveness comes from his planning, knowledge, preparation, and composure (Shalltear fight, the undead Dragon Lord from the sidestory).

My interest in the series stems from the broad range of interactions between different people and cultures and everything in the side story, as well as the disparity between the internal monlogue of Ainz and the perspective people have od him.

I think out disagreement here is what we've looked at. I see wish fulfilment based on how Ainz thinks about the situation, you see it as the situation itself.

Loke Batman gets held up as wish fulfilment because billionaire playboy superhero detective mcguiver, but I can't help but see the guy who tries to deal with his childhood trauma, isolation, and systemic problems in Gotham by beating people up with his fists. Like the aspects of the situation are pretty wish fulfilment, but the person who ends up in the situation, and how they feel in that situation, seems horrible.
