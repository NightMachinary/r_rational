What do you define as Wish-fulfillment? - I absolutely love wish-fulfillment, but just cos your wish doesn't contain a harem doesn't make it any less fulfilling. I would define wish fulfillment as a story which makes the MC enjoyable to insert yourself into, which I think Overlord is literally nothing BUT that lol.

-- And personally I don't understand how anyone would like any fiction that isn't wish fulfillment, but they exist apparently, like OP, hence his/her request, and Overlord definitely does not fit that request XD
