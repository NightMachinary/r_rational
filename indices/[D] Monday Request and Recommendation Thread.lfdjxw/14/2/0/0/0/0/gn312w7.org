Our world too is four-dimensional (3 spatial dimensions + time). The difference is in how you apply Pythagoras' theorem in spacetime. In our world, the distance between two events (in units in which the speed of light is 1, so imagine measuring time in seconds, and space in light seconds), is:

r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} - t^{2}

and that minus sign in front of the time makes all the difference. In the world of the novels I described those signs are all +. This has tremendous consequences if you work them out - the most immediate being that relativistic time dilation works the other way around: in the world of the novels, if you travel at relativistic speeds, /more/ time passes for you than for whoever was left on your home planet. Another consequence is that time travel becomes not only possible, but extremely trivial.
