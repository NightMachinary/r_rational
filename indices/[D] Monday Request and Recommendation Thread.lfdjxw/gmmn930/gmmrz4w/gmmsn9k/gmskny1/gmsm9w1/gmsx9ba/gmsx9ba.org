Also I don't know how you feel about time travel in comparison to magic, if you're keen then All Night Laundry and Homestuck do stories about the exploration of (and general fuckery relating to) time travel. They hit similar themes, except Homestuck is a garguantuan clusterfuck that will take you a month to get through (and the intro kinda drags, i got a response with a link to a video reading with voice acting version a few days back in a conversation about it here) and ANL is much more reasonable. They're both webcomics though. Oh, and they have great queer representation too.
