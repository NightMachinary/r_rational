Anything related to scientific experimentation with magic that is NOT HPMOR? Fanfic or otherwise, just with the scientific method itself as a major part of the plot.

Edit: To clarify, I mean that someone basically just experiments, observes, and hypothesizes with magic. I don't mean that they have to take an electron microscope and look at magic particles, although that would be cool, I just mean that they figure out how to refine the function of magic and exploit its rules to optimize the results of using it. I want something which delves into that process.

Also, if anyone can somehow manage to find one with a gay male MC, I will love them forever
