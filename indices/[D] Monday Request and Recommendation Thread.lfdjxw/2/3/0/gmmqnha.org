I'd recommend Ar'Kendrythist too. It's a bit of a controversial story here, but imo there a similar level of exploring the system and what makes it tick. It turns out to be godly politics and the time before the Sundering that makes the system of Ar'Kendrythist tick, and that was very interesting to me. It feels more like a high fantasy world that happened to have a litrpg system, instead of the other way around.
