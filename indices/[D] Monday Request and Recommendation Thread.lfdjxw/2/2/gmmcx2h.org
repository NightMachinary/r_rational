  The pacing is bad. Really, really bad. The narrative got incredibly bogged down for hundreds of thousands of words and it's unclear how it's going to recover.

I guess it wasn't just an artifact of the 1/week release schedule.

--------------

I'll recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights With Monsters]] for that niche: Normal guy is dropped into a fantasy world crawling with monsters and adventurers. He gets magic powers, puts together a team, and steadily grows in power as the locals teach him and he experiences more of the world. It has coherent and integrated plot arcs that build off of one another, a dripfeed of worldbuilding, and good pacing. The main character isn't /quite/ to my tastes, but his irreverence and defiance of social norms can make for interesting reading, at least. He isn't quite /rational/, but the world he's in is, so it's close enough.

EDIT: The first ~hundred chapters will be going offline soon. Either hurry, or pay through patreon/Amazon.
