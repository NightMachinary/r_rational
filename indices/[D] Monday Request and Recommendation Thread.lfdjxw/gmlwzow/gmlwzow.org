My current favourite story I'm following is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38219/brewer-king][Brewer King]] on royal road.

Grim dark with amazing world building and a lot of very folk tale types of monsters. The main character feels mature, kind and reasonable but is currently working through some serious grief. Other characters all feel interesting and independent. The start is probably slightly weaker than the rest. All in all it very much has a gritty, realistic feel to it; with some real weight behind the consequences of actions in a messed up world.

Also Perfect Run is also very enjoyable, but I assume most of everyone on royal road are aware of it.
