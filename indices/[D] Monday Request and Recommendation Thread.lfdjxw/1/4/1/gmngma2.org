I'll second that last one for SG1/ATLA. Not a combo of universes I thought would work, but it suprisingly does turning bending into another 'scenario of the week' for SG1 who are well in character being concerned with kids fighting and throwing elemental attacks around. Even if the 'kids' are very much able to handle themselves.

Not to mention the dynamic of choosing Toph and Zuko as the main ATLA characters. Toph finally got her field trip, I'm considering it canon you can't stop me!
