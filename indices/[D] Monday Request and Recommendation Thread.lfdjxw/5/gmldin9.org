Last week someone recommended Polyhistor Academy. I binged it, and enjoyed it a decent amount. Quests aren't my favorite thing but I'm running a little low on reading materials lately and I haven't really explored that side of online writing. Any recommandations?

I should probably mention that I have read the Erogamer, since I have seen it recommended here before.
