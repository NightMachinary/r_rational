Look at what I dug up for you! The quest that Questionable Questing was created for - [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/questionable_gaming/azula-quest-repositorium-t28.html][Azula Quest]]*!

Something's not quite right with little princess Azula. Will the voters manage to hammer her into a semblance of a well-adjusted (or at least functioning) adult? Read to find out!

I would have certainly recommended this eight years ago.

Would I recommend it now? I don't know. It's been too long and I don't want to start rereading it right now.
