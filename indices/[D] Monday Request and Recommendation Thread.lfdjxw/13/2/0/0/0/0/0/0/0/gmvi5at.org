Yeah possibly, to me the main appeal of overlord is that it makes me feel good, and all the other things you describe is just there to not ruin that feeling by being unrealistic.

I never enjoyed batman for some reason, but yeah, I wouldn't care about his origin, and would get annoyed reading about his mental issues, I'd just read it for the good feeling. So yeah, I would define Batman as Wish fulfillment, that doesn't make it bad nor does it not make it deep in other genres and aspects.

To me, Wish Fulfillment is an attribute, which does not counter any other attributes (other than maybe tragedy).
