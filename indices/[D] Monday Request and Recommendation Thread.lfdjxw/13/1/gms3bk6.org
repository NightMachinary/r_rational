I specifically don't enjoy this type of Isekai, but you may enjoy some of the ones I didn't enjoy much:[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35885/leaves-of-terranthir][leaves of ter..something]] Which I didn't enjoy because its mostly about survival instead of human interaction but you may.

And Azarynth Healer by the same author to a lesser extent which I enjoyed immensely but still is very fighting-focused.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38704/ortus][Ortus]] Short but current chapters are all survival.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20451/who-says-this-ol-cant-become-a-splendid-slime][Who says this OL can't be a splendid slime]] - Its almost all human interactions but survival is a primary motivator.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20568/tree-of-aeons-an-isekai-story][Tree of Aeons]] - Where it is up to is all kingdom-building. The MC is a tree tho so no harem, and the main goal is to not get killed by the 10-yearly demon king attacks (and finding a way to stop them).

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39307/a-fine-octet-of-legs][A fine octect of legs]] Survival

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36308/new-life-of-a-summoned-demoness]] survival

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36804/the-devils-foundry]] a superhero Isekai

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31474/magic-smithing]] Decent isekai about smithing

Probably quite a few more if you want to add some further requirements?
