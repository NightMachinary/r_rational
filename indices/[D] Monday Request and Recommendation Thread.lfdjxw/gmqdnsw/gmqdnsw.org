I recently saw a rec for [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]], and I really enjoyed it.

Spoilers: It's about a prototype AI weapon comprised of nanobots that is mysteriously gifted human emulation software and uses it to escape captivity, where it has to learn how to blend in to the real world. The world outside the lab is one comprised of various super powers that spontaneously trigger in living organisms. While not all questions are answered yet, the world building is really good, and most of what I like about the story. The characters and social interactions are also relatively well written, and the pacing is pretty good. The way that the human.exe emulation software works doesn't /entirely/ make sense, but it's good enough that I'm willing to ignore the minor questions it raises. Supposedly the author already has the entire plot mapped out.

My biggest complaint is that it updates relatively slowly (about every 1-2 months recently), and the end doesn't appear to be that close (although there is 2 years worth of updates to binge).
