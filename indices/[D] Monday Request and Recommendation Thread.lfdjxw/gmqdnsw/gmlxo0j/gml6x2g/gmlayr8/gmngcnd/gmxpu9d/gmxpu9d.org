Ortus is... At the very least an overcorrection, honestly. To take Delve from aspiring auramancer stuck in a town looking for people to party up with so he can learn their language and things about the world, who struggles to achieve this due to having no entry point into their culture beyond the adventurer's guild... to lifestealer with a giant system investment in being a lone wolf, who skulks through the woods draining baby animals for no good reason, I don't think the level cap was the only thing the author took issue with.

And I don't think the pacing is any better what with the survival chapters not developing the story in any real direction or getting across any characterization beyond the most instrumental survivalist mindset stuff.

I get that the author's intention is to make the protagonist edgier and generate more conflict for them in the long run, but their story goes way too far in telegraphing that they have no interest in maintaining a vibrant supporting cast the way Delve kind of manages to, after some trying.
