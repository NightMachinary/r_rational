Well I guess I made it sound more like a disrecommendation and personally I did not like it that much for the reasons I mentioned. Though last I looked at it the combat was something that did not actually happen in a lot of runs and the pc would die in it if not specialized for it from the start.

As far as diving the developers intent, that was my impression. There are a lot of ways any one quest can go but it is gated behind the pc skills for which points are scarce and if you do not know what the options are you can easily get dropped into combat and die.
