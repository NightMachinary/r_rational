It was recommended here before.

Basically an NPC companion in a game is sentient and the PC is the kind of player who tries to break everything in a game.

Things I like: Update speed - I caught up quickly but every few days there's an update\\
++++Humour - I laughed out loud on numerous occasions, pretty rare text media to do that to me, if you have ever played an rpg (last time I did was some years ago) you'll probably enjoy the jokes

Things I don't like:\\
Update size/plot progress per update- updates are often small and do little to progress the plot\\
Rambling and repetitive internal thoughts - the POV char often thinks about the same thing, which is more of an issue when you binge it, and you will often be like "here they go again", for example there's one chapter where the guy is like "tell me what it's like when we fast travel" and they fast travel then and there, then she thinks about telling him like 20 times instead of just bringing it up straight away, he brings it up 10 chapters later so it's not dropped but you hear her think about her feelings about it too many times before she tells anyone
