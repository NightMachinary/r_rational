Main character literally has all his strong emotions forcibly surprised, a body that can not eat or drink, and is constantly moderately anxious or paranoid. It is 100% a power fantasy, but there's enough caveats that wish fulfillment isn't entirely accurate. Also like more than a third of the series is from other perspectives than the main character.
