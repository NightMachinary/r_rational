Ah, I took "scientific" too literally.

Humble Life of a Skill Trainer is exactly what you want then. LitRPG where everyone is protective of their skills, main character is from the taboo guild that trains others instead of leaving families and master/apprentice gigs to try and pass things down alone. Mc starts delving into the depths of skills a lot more as the story progresses, and its a major goal of his.

Delve is a controversial work due to its pacing, but it does do magic exploration to the point of the mc bringing out the calculus, but the whole setting is more or less at the lower tiers of magic, and the closest thing to an exploit is from the patreon chapters, a few ahead of the public ones, the mc works out a really efficient way to improve stat growth from training, but it happens right before an arc starting where training (or at least the stat grinding type of training) has to be put to the wayside

The Harry Potter fic Spells in Silence does magic exploration, but its very unstructured exploration right now, with a very young protagonist (currently pre-Hogwarts age by about a year) so your mileage may vary.

Another HP fic, Blood Crest, does a lot of magic exploration and learning, but at a higher level it's more like a bunch of different approaches stumbling semi-blindly forward than anything structured. There's no definitive answer on the rules of magic and a bunch of different, clashing, ideas at play. Also Harry is in school, so he's not exactly personally pushing the boundries much himself right now.

Oh, and pretty much every highly recommend Naruto fic here is about working about how the fuck all the ninja stuff makes sense, so go through the subreddit looking foe those and there's a bunch. I think The Need to Become Stronger started updating again. I never got too into Naruto stuff so I don't remember what I've read properly.
