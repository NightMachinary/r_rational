hi, I just started to read schooled in magic again, I originally stopped keeping up with it in book 14 and just started the 15th, and it has woken up my appetite for an uplift fantasy story. my only requirements are that the story is at least 300 thousand words long(around = to 3 published books) and that it's either finished or updating(or publishing) regularly.
