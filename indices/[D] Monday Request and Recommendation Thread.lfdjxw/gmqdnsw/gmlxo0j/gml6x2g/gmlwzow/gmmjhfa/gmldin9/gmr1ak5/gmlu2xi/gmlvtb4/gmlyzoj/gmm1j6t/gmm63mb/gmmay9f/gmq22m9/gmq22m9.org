Those this feel like a satisfying option? Sounds more like boring skill improvement and then you choose the option and hope it succeeds. And how is the reward, are you forced to fight, if you want to get decent experience and equipment?

How is it compared Baldus Gate 2 - If you have played it? I really liked the atmosphere in BG2. And the companions came over as more realistic and believable as almost any other game. I found only Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic I & II comparable, but in II most were not likeable at all (for me).
