  My main complaint is it's a big set of corridors with unavoidable combat encounters in them.

That's... not how I would describe that portion of the game. Maybe we are thinking of different areas? The Bloom was a multitude of branching rooms inside a giant parasite, some of which were portals to other dimensions that each had very different visual aesthetics. Most of my encounters in The Bloom were actually dialogue interactions with members of the various societies that had gotten trapped there.

  Regarding avoiding combat, there's an entire class in Planescape Torment where you can just go invisible permanently, and avoid literally everything. With a focused build, it's only intro of the game where you need to ever worry about being seen. In comparison in TTN, you can only stealth during combats and for combat purposes so that avoidance option is off the table.

PST does have a more rigorous stealth system compared to TTN, similar to other games built on the same framework. However, I distinctly recall several combat encounters that you get forced into just by zoning into an area. Those can only be skipped by sprinting. It's a valid playstyle for those who want 0 combat, but I think it would fall afoul of this part of op's request:
