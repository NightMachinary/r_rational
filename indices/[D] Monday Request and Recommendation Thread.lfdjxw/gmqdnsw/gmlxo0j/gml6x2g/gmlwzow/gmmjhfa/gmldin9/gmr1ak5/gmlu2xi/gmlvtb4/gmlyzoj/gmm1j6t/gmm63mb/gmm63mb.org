Dishonored is a pretty well-known game where the combat is entirely optional. Yes, you can run around like a murderous nightmare blendering through the poor guards, but you can also explore the world, finding non-lethal ways to complete each level. Hell, you get an achievement for completing the game without killing anyone.
