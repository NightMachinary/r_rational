Well if I was disputing the review I'd probably be more likely to say that person has nostalgia goggles about Harry Potter rather than saying the writing is amazing. It is perfectly fine writing IMO, but video game writing can't compare to novels. Also HP 1 is comparable to Academagia 1 for obvious reasons. Be weird if a game that currently follows 11-12 year olds had the same content and style as the later Potter novels. On the other hand its been like 8 years since the first game was done so you probably won't get later years any time soon.
