Ar'Kendrythist has elements of both, ish? The protagonist is bisexual, and the main love interest in the beginning was a single dad. Now there's no one. There's deep exploration of the magic system, but it's a full on magical system. Things happen due to magical reasons, sometimes with little indication of why, although the protagonist can make educated guesses.

Meet the Freak on royalroad has some good scientific exploration of the magic system, although I didn't like its other aspects as much. Very straight.

Blue Core has scientific exploration as well, although it's also part erotica. Also very straight.
