Well, I failed and wrote, that I found KOTOR companions not likeable. I actually meant those of KOTOR II. I case of BG2 I wanted to express that they felt real not just like an attachment or someone that only exists for you, like in many other games. It could be done better of course but as of yet no game I played managed to do so.
