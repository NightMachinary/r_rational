I mean, the game is set on multiple planes, some of which were afterlives. And you can have like 10 conversations about the afterlives. Seems you were going into it with a very specific Less Wrong (or whatever) mindset, because the game really isn't that hostile to the idea of immortality. But there is more to life than life extension, even if life extension is a good thing, and the game has more to say than just "death bad."
