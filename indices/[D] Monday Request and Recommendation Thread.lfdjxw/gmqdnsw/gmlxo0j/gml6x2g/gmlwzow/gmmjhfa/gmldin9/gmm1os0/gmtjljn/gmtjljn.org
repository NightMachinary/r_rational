Loved The Sins of Cinnamon, which almost didn't feel like a quest at all seeing how little player input there was. I'm sad that it stopped where it did, since the dungeon felt just a tiny bit like a long prologue, to me.

Is it bad that I was more interested in finding out more about the worldbuilding in BAHHSC than the stated goal of the quest?

Going to try Marked for Death next, since several people have mentioned it. Thanks for the recs!
