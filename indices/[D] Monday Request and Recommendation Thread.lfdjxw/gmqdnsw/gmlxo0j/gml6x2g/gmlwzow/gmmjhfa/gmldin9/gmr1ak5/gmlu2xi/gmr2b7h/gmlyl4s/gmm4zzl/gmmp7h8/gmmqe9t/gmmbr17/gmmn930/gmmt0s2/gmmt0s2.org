[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside/chapter/408863/0-setting-the-board][Castle Kingside]] has this, though it takes a while until the MC stabilizes his situation enough to experiment. It's about a doctor who gets reincarnated into a medievalesque fantasy world as a starving beggar, to serve as entertainment for the gods in a sort of divine chess game. Currently on hiatus while the author reworks the front half of the story.
