The three others I enjoyed:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/i-thought-this-was-a-mystery-dungeon-pokemon-si.46591/#post-10466976][I thought this was a PMD SI]]

Tyrunt SI. as good as Hyphen IMO and long.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13202202/1/Dreaming-of-Family][Dreaming of family]]

Ends in a really satisfying spot, feels like the end of the "first book". Strongly recommend this.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/cold-comfort-pokemon-si.68980/#post-16066924][Cold Comfort]]

Short but enjoyed it enough.

There is also a worm cross I got a bit bored off and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13143788/1/I-Just-Want-To-Travel-The-World][I just want to travel the world]] and everything by the author, but I ended up dropping them.

Let me know if you find any more good SI into a pokemon (but not PMD), I love those. Backwards Grin is by far my favorite so far.
