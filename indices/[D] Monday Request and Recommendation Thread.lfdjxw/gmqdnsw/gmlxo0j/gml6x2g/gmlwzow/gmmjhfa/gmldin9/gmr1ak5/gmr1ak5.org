Alright, I read [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]] as suggested elsewhere in this post, and against my expectations, I enjoyed it immensely--particularly the worldbuilding. Now, I'm craving *LitRPG or "System" stories where civilization has developed past the antiquated System of yore.* For example, they might have smartphones, regular air travel, a space program, etc, yet all be saddled with anachronistic classes like "archer" or "smith" or whatever some of which people can basically never level because the world isn't about brutal survival anymore, nobody gets into melee fights anymore, and all the wilderness has been tamed, dungeons regulated/shut down, etc. Any stories with a setting like this or characters like this?

As for a quick review of /The Sins of Cinnamon/, it was generally pretty good as I already stated. Originally, I was a bit turned off by it being marked NSFW, but as far as QQ-content goes, it's positively tame and I wouldn't really describe it as porn. The main character is simply a sex worker, and that has certain trappings that come with it. I'm sad that this is on hiatus, as I'd really love to see more of the world.
