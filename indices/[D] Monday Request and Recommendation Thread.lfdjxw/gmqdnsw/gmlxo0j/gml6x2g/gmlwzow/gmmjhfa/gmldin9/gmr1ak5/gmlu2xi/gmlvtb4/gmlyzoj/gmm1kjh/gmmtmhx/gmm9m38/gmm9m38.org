I played it and loved it. In my opinion the game has an engrossing plot, fascinating settings and side characters, and very unique worldbuilding. Wiron2 is correct that, like in /Planescape: Torment/, the game is chock full of dialogue choices that allow you to use persuasion or deception to sidestep a lot of the combat.

I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that the game feels like it should be longer, and the combat felt a little too easy late in the game.
