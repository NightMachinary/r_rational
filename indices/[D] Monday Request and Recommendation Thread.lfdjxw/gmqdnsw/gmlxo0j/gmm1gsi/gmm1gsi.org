Spice and Wolf is a nice romance + economy 101 series.

The Demon Lord's Lover on RR is a fun romantic comedy with a surprisingly deep world and lore.

Monroe in RR is a relaxing slice of life with a robust system. Many people didn't like chapter one and dropped. I found chapter one pretty unnecessary, since it kinda gets glossed over by everything else afterward, and mentioned maybe once or twice.

Christopher Ruocchio's Sun Eater series is a fun coming of age science opera. Takes lots of inspiration from Dune and Kingkiller chronicles, but by book 2 it's its own thing.

Coeur Al'aran writes mainly Jaune centric fanfics on RWBY. Really hits that shounen vibe with his stories, although usually they don't have Jaune powering up to become the most powerful.
