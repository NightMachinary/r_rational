I noticed a distinct lack of [[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076G8DVN6][Cradle]] in your list, so... that. Plus the rest of Will Wight's catalogue. I particularly liked the House of Blades series.

I don't know if he's ever been nominated for a Hugo, but Alastair Reynold's [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00H6SZLGW][Revelation Space]] series is great (as is the rest of his bibliography).

If you've read Beware of Chicken you know that at the beginning the MC gives thanks to "Shizuko" for instructions on how to grow rice; the manga / web novel he's referring to is /Sengoku Komachi Kurou Tan/, and both are great if you can find them (it's not hard but is probably piracy I guess?). It's a fairly standard "transplanted into the past, now I gotta uplift" story, and the MC is believably hypercompetent (her grandfather is essentially Japanese [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug][Norman Borlaug]] and has ensured that she knows the history of agriculture inside and out).

If you liked Katalepsis but want something from the perspective of a friendly eldritch entity, you might want to try [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40038/eldritch-entity-on-a-journey-of-self-discovery][Eldritch Entity on a Journey of Self Discovery]] - it's kinda like Cinnamon Bun, except the main character is a friendly outside context problem. It's very new, though, so beware.

If you feel like a dungeon core story, NoDragons is back with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39793/oasis-core][OASIS CORE]], which is set in the same world as Thieves' Dungeon.
