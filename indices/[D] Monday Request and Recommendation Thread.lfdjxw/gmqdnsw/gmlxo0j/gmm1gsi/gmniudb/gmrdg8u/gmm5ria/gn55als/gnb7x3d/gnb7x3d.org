I found that The Gods are Bastards is great once it gets into swing, and that takes a bit. I don't remember the beginning that well (there is a /lot/ of it), but once the core group of students is all together and start school, things move in plot-direction very well.

That said, the author loves using extensive prologues, epilogues, and interludes which means that occasionally you're not reading about the core cast while they're cliffhangering somewhere else. In general, this is fine because many of the side characters are absolutely great, but especially later on (there are like 20+ books) character bloat becomes a bit of an issue. Still, I found the interludes and non-main character chapters mostly skip/skimmable in those few occasions where I just needed to know what was going to happen next.
