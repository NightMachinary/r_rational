I think PGtE might be a little better simply because I really enjoy the genre-savvyness, but The Gods are Bastards really does give its characters a chance to shine. They might feel like a lot at first, but everyone gets some great development and time in the spotlight.

Additionally the supporting characters are just awesome.
