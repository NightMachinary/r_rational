If you're in the mood for superheroics, I recommend [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/summus-proelium-table-of-contents/][Summus Proelium]] which is pretty great. Well written and updates 1.5 times a week.

From the same author, there's also [[https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Heretical Edge]] which is sorta an urban fantasy magical school story, but gets really wild later on. The first book is complete and the second one releases chapters also 1.5 times a week. There is a lot of content here, and some fantastic worldbuilding and intelligent characters. Really, I'm surprised how few people know this one.

Also, recommend last week, but Vacant Throne is beefy and a good story to boot. Sometimes struggles a bit with pacing, but otherwise, very well done.
