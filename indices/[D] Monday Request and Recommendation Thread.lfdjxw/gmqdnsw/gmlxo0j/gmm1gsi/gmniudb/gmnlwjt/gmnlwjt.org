Not interested in manga at all. Cradle is on my to-read list, after it was recommended to me as an answer to "If I am going to read exactly one cultivation story and deep-six the entire genre if I don't like it, what do I read".

I don't know how I've neglected the Revelation Space books, given that I've read and loved Revenger and I think also Chasm City. Excellent!

I hadn't seen Eldritch Entity, so that and OASIS are in.

(I've read only one dungeon core story, No Epic Loot Only Puns, which I forgot to add to my list. But I liked it! A shame it's apparently on hiatus.)

Thank you for the recommendations!
