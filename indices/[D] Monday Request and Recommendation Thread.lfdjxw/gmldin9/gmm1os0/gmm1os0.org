As far as quests go, these are the ones I can recommend:

- [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/][The Sins of Cinnamon]]/[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-days-of-thyme.9683/][The Days of Thyme]] (NSFW): These two quests share the same setting, which is made of some completely original worldbuilding. Sins of Cinnamon should be read first though, since it takes place before Days of Thyme. The MC in Sins of Cinnamon starts as a sex worker (one comfortable with her life choices), but things go off the rails rather quickly.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)]]: The premise to this one is that the MC is a side character in a harem anime, and the 'goal' of the quest is to become a popular enough character to get a spin-off show. The worldbuilding is original and very well done.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-champion-in-earth-bet-worm-original-setting.19973/][A Champion in Earth Bet]]: This is a quest set in a 'crossover' between the Worm setting and an original superhero setting the author has been using privately for some time. The original setting isn't seen very much, and mostly existed to let the players choose their starting character. The Worm half of the crossover is actually extremely well expanded upon, as the author created dozens of international capes for the MC to interact with.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/mass-effect-altered-humanity.35440/][Mass Effect: Altered Humanity]]: Unlike the rest of the quests I'm recommending, this is a quest that follows a civilization as opposed to a main character. The Player faction is the Terran Dominion, a Military Republic that emerged from the ashes of utter ecological catastrophe back on Earth. It clawed its way to the stars, emerging onto the galactic scene in a much different form... and the other sapient civilizations also developed somewhat differently.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/][Now You Feel Like Number None]]: This is a Bleach quest where the MC starts as a low-ranking arrancar servant in S≈çsuke Aizen's Hueco Mundo. Interestingly, it also has some prominent Hollow Knight influences. Since most of the main characters are arrancar, they spend a lot of time trying to deal with their intrinsic natures, and what it means to maybe/maybe not be monsters.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-destiny-of-strife-a-hollows-quest-bleach.29076/][A Destiny of Strife]]: This is a Bleach quest where you follow a full-on, soul-devouring Hollow. Make no mistake, the MC is a monster in this one. Charismatic and silver-tongued, sure, but a monster nonetheless.

- [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/][Marked for Death]]: What if someone did their best to make the Naruto setting actually make sense? Turns out, you might just end up with a deathworld, populated by chakra beasts, superhuman ninja, and horrified civilians. This quest starts with the foundation of Hidden Swamp by a large group of deserters from Hidden Mist. The quest is explicitly rational, which tends to make it fairly popular around here.
