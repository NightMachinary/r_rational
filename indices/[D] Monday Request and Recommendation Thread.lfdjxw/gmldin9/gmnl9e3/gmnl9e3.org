Oh boy what an ask. Just scanned through my watchlist on SufficientVelocity, Spacebattles, and QuestionableQuesting, and grabbed all the ones good enough to recommend. Because I know myself and don't want to spend literally the next two hours writing blurbs on each of these, I'm just going to categorize them and give basic tags. Up to you to actually poke your head and see for yourself if it is to your taste.
