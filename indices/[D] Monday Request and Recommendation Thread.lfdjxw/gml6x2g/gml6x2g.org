So, last week I followed a link on this subreddit to /Delve/, a litrpg. I proceeded to archive binge the hell out of it.

Things I liked:

- Main character does his best to investigate and optimize for the system in an intelligent and reader-comprehensible way

- Slow takeoff; he doesn't become OP by leveraging One Weird Trick

- Well-written on a technical sentence-by-sentence level; it doesn't hurt my brain to read it

Things I didn't like:

- The pacing is bad. Really, really bad. The narrative got incredibly bogged down for hundreds of thousands of words and it's unclear how it's going to recover.

- Relatedly, classic issue with serials: the author very clearly changed his mind about how he was handling various plots and characters midstream, but couldn't go back and change anything, so stuff meanders.

Anything that hits the same high notes without those problems?
