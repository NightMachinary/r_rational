[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38704/ortus][Ortus]] is an attempt by another author to make a Delve-ish story without Delve's problems; an older version has already run aground, and the linked story is the re-write.

The first one was pretty good despite some obvious problems (the MC didn't really seem to exist, before) and though I haven't read the rewrite the reviews claim that a lot of the problems were fixed.
