This is gonna sound kinda weird because its not a rpg focused on small groups, but ck2 and ck3 (I have only played ck2, but I have heard that ck3 is also good). The base of the game is the rpg mechanics, and you can play it in ways that are less war focused. So if you want to avoid tons of war there are ways of growing via diplo and intrigue. Control your religion and stuff like that.
