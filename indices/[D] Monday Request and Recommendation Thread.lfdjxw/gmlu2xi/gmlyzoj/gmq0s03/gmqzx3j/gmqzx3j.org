So, I'll go to bat for Planescape Torment here. I think everything is thoroughly justified in the text. Heavy spoilers.

First, the main problem with The Nameless One living forever is the method by which he does so. He made a deal with the most evil of creatures (literally, none eviler) to live forever, but the execution was that every time he died, someone else would die instead. The story implies that it's perfectly moral to try and live forever, it's murdering other people that's a problem.

Also, TNO being actually immortal is a philosophical question. When he dies, he forgets everything. One side of the debate is a character who says "well, I can see your soul never left so when you get back up you're clearly the same person and thus immortal"*** while the the other side of the debate is that if you have irrecoverably lost your memories you've basically died. Lets come back to this. The game leaves it to the player to decide, as you're clearly not the same person, but you're not losing EVERY memory, only 99.9% of them. The conversation is less about mortality and more about identity and what it really means to be you.

To complicate things, the process is breaking down. Each time TNO dies, there's a little bit less of him and it seems to be accelerating. At the start of the story, TNO is no longer forgetting (which is the premise of the story and allows him to survive long enough to piece things together), but this seems to be a last gasp of the magic that sustains him falling apart. We have no idea of knowing how long it'll last, and how much of a fluke the couple of days of the story are compared to his thousands of years of existence. Unless he does something now when he has the chance, then eventually instead of death he'll end up for eternity without his mind. An eternity insensate or trapped in a tomb is possibly much worse than the hells and just a worse oblivion.

Which brings me to, the afterlife. Death in Planescape is a quite a bit different than IRL. It's confirmed that afterlives are real, and that you go to them as the same person you were in life. In real life DEATH IS BAD, obviously. But in Planescape you could spend aeons in heaven and banging hot celestial elves. Eventually you end up having your soul merge into soulstuff (or you become denizen of the plane and survive to be a god, but that's like a 1 in a trillion chance. And even gods die eventually too, they just have geologically long lifespans), to be reincarnated or made one with the world and the only bad part is that you eventually forget who you were. ***But if TNO was already forgetting when he died, then on a moral level it's not much different for a person to die than to lose all their memories.

Edit: that is to say everyone in Planescape is effectively immortal from our point of view. It's not a concern. The unanswered question of the story is "what can change the nature of a man?" What is it that a man can do to not be responsible for what they've done.

Since both we and our character know that if TNO dies the way that mortals do, he'll get to keep his memories and keep on being the same person, only in SUPERHELL, philosophically it isn't a question about his death. Instead it's a question of if it's right for him to avoid his punishment. No matter what, TNO is going to cease to be eventually, but that could take longer than recorded history. (The story started because he already contacted one of the top 20 most powerful gods in existence and this was the best they can do. He has no reason to think he can get even better 'super-immortality'.) So he needs to choose what to do in the next ~millennia: either he does nothing and loses himself by degrees while killing innocents along the way, he gets himself back into the normal afterlife and is punished in the blood war, or he wipes himself out to true oblivion (which is fairly explicitly a bad end).

IMO, I think the game does go into the ethics of the situations from several views, and has some deep reflections on philosophical subjects.
