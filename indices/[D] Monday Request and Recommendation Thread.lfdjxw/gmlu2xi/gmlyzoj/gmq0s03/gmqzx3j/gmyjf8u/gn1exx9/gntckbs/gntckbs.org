Of course. But I didn't know really anything about afterlife there. I mean it was clear that there are some. But how good is the one you can get? Should have been better presented to view it like that. And I guess you still need to be a good person in the eye of your favored god to get the good deal. And I am taking your word for it, that you could indeed have a everlasting good afterlife.

Doesn't change the fact that - as I perceive it - our pop culture views the pursuit of immortality/undying-ness as something generally only evil persons do. Or you are lucky and born with it.
