I largely agree with what you wrote, but as far as I can remember the vibe I got while playing the game was this: (Almost) everyone expressed the opinion that it is bad to (want to) live forever. NOT that it is bad to do so by unethical means. And that was what stuck in my head and it was annoying. There was no reflection on it, at least no relevant one, otherwise I would have remembered it.

Some of the things you wrote are only obvious if you have background knowledge of the D&D metaverse, so they don't count for a normal player (e.g. me) and his view of the game. Maybe you get to know some of it by reading all those in-game mini books (I think P:T had those too), but they were just to boring (for me). So in the end P:T is only a game for those who want to read a lot anyway and are interested in the lore. And I might not be interested enough, I don't know. Although I liked to watch some youtube videos about D&D lore. So it might be just the writing style of the mini books again. Whatever.
