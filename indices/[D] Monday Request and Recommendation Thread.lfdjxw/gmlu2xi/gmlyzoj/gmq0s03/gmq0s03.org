I played Planescape: Torment. I don't remember it as a game where combat is usually optional. But anyway, I didn't like it. I can't recommend it for anyone who doesn't think death is a good think or inevitable (when you have actual powers to evade it). It could have been really good, if the focus would have been far more on the ethics side, instead of the death part. Thanks for those Indie game recommendations. I will take a look at them.

Torment: Tides of N - Took a in-depth look at it ~2 years ago and decided it is not for me. Don't remember why though. Although the artwork/style is incredible. It looks more like out of a alien world and still like something where humans could live then everything else I have ever seen. Even if the game doesn't interest you, looking at it could be an interesting and nice experience if you are curious.
