I am going to tentatively suggest Age of Decadence. The game has several(I never cared to figure out how many but I guess maybe a dozen or less before you start to see minor variations) main interconnecting paths you can take and combat is only one of them. The amount of possible solutions to the game is huge but this is what it actually feels like.

Instead of feeling like roleplaying it quickly starts to seem like an actual puzzle game. You need to divine what the developers wanted and keep points in reserve to not get into combat which you will lose if you did not specialize for it.

The game is also grimdark and the pc is the only one who is and has to be honest, unless you get onto some of the scripted forks. It also feels very dated.
