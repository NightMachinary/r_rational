I think that the KoTOR 2 companions were a lot better than in KOTOR in many cases, mainly because of the depth of dialogue interactions. I guess I see where you are coming from about the BG2 companions - they definitely had loyalties beyond their role to the player, which caused conflict with the player in many cases. I think the BG3 companions would fill that same requirement - they definitely have other loyalties and motivations beyond their temporary(?) alliance with the player. That's part of what made them so interesting to me.
