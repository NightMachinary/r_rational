He doesn't have any gun making skills. It could take him months to make a good enough gun. That was why I suggested he make a quick dirty cannon which serves as little more than a metal container containing some explosive which fires a lot of metal pellets at something. Single use. Or he might be able to steal a legacy cannon from somewhere, something old enough that the military don't care.

The trapping might be doable, but it could take an alternate route- it is shockingly agile, you can't really herd it to a predesignated route that easily. You know it will be somewhere in the area of the weak magic but not specifically which tree it will take, and trapping everywhere may be a bit beyond his skills. For that I'd probably want to recruit an expert trapper to help him.
