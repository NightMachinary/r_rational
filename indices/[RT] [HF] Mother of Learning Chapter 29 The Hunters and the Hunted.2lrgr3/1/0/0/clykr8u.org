I'd say Zoltan needs to get or replicate with magic something akin to modern anti-materiel rifle (or WW2 anti-tank rifle) to get effective firearm against the spider.

And to do that he mostly needs to increase projectile speed (assuming it has decent 8-10 mm caliber already).

And with that stronger barrel would help as it allows for bigger charge.
