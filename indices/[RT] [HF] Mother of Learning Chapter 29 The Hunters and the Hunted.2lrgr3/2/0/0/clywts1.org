A sort of adaptation like yours isn't that uncommon.

[[http://www.narutod20.com/downloads/]]

There's a Naruto rpg. It deals with the sorts of issues you mention, as does the source material, d20 modern.

1. [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/magic/spellPoints.htm]] spell points are a common variant of the magic system.

2. Shields would replace HP and provide 'easy healing'. They're a durable protection that can regenerate fast.

3. There is actually an 'xp' cost for spells as I note below.

Not that you have to or should, but it wouldn't be that hard to adapt dnd rules to your setting.

I'd probably replace levels with mentorship. You do killing monsters and jobs and such and get xp. This xp can be spent on spells and magical items. Each set of spells and magical items and stats unlocks a level with a particular mentor which grants various benefits like new resources, new books with reduced costs for certain things. If you're spending your time making magical items you're focusing your effort and experience on doing that and it's assumed that whatever advice and experience you get from your mentor will be focused around that magical item. Generally, as you move up the circles you'll gain access to increasing resources and prestige.

Wouldn't be that hard to make one.
