I wonder how well the trick with turning the ground into liquid and back to solid would fare against the GH. Basically he needs to immobilize it without directly applying magic to it. Maybe the ground under its feet could be turned into quick drying cement? Or the cement could be temporarily held in stasis to keep it from setting, until the spider touches it, at which point the stasis spell could be cancelled so it falls in and gets stuck.
