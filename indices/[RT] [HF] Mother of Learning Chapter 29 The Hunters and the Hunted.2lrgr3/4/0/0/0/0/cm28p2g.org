Well, red robe did go through them like a knife through butter. I was actually thinking they just did it once, to make Zorian think the aranea were gone, so he doesn't try to make contact with them again.

As zorian notes, if red robe actually can wipe souls like he claims, the invasion should be trivial. Permakill a few key people each reset, eventually there is nobody powerful left to resist.
