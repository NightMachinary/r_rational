Gotcha. Just a bit of a coincidence, that's all. That's always a pain -- given the amount of stuff out there, it's hard to NOT have coincidental match ups between what you write and something else. I was irked when someone asked if one of my original characters was based on someone else's writing, so I hope I didn't push that button.
