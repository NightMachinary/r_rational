There's one case with clear MO of Red Robe (the man found with no apparent cause of death), but others are not so clear. For example, the very first man is missing for two month when it's not even the end of the loop. And there's no corpses in most cases, just missing people. Why would Red Robe go to extra trouble of hiding the bodies (every restart!)?

All this may imply that someone was snatching soul magic specialists /before/ the loop. Maybe even to setup this very loop.
