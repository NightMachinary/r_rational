I have never read a superhero comic in my life, other than a couple of issues of batman as a kid (I was not impressed). Superhero comics were never very big in Croatia. I grew up reading comics like Tex, Zagor, Alan Ford, Dylan Dog, Nathan Never, Lazarus Leed and so on. I'm pretty sure they're Italian, though I neither new nor cared about that when I was a kid.

So yeah, if something seems to be a Marvel/DC reference in my stories, it's probably not. I only got interested in superheroes due to the recent proliferation of superhero movies, television shows like Heroes, and because of the Worm Webserial... and even then I just casually skimmed through the various superhero wikia for amusement.
