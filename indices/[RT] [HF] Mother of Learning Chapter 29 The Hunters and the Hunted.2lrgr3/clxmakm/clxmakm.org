This fic is an absolute delight.

Is Red Robe hunting down the soul magicians? If so, why hasn't he gotten around to Silverlake yet? When he does, will he find Zorian? :E

The wolf shifter tribe seems like it will be a very interesting plotline. I look forward to seeing that explored. And will it have any relation to the Silver Legend? That description almost begs "werewolf" ...

This world is just so rich; I can tell the author has spent a lot of time mapping it out. Kudos to them!
