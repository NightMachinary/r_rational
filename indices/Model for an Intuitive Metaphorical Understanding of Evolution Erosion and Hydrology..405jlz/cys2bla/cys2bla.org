I think a large part of the challenge lies simply in the language we use when talking about evolution. We anthropomorphize evolution. We talk about it in terms of 'evolution causes X' which is I think the main problem. Its nouns, they're the issue really. In English, there's not enough differentiation between groups of nouns, its all a big homogeneous mass. The result is we group things like people together with things like blind idiot forces acting on the world. I follow Sapir-Whorf and think that issues like this might be a result of issues with the language underlying the conversation.
