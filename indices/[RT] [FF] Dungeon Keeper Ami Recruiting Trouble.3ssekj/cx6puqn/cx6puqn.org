This story reminded me of the [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Series-298][Tabula Avatar]] series ([[http://baldursgate.wikia.com/][Baldur's Gate]] × [[http://buffy.wikia.com][Buffy.)]]

Some choices Ami was making were really frustrating, especially considering that she was supposed to be risking her “soul” and being eternally tortured in case of failing almost any of her plans.

Aside from that, the unnecessary anime-style fanservice scenes, and the regular contacts with sailor universe (haven't seen Sailor Moon, neither care much about it), the story was rather entertaining to read.

Too bad it's a slow WiP like so many other interesting projects out there.
