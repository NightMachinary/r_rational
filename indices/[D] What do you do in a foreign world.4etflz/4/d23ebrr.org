If my magi-translator has given me reading/writing as well as speech I'll probably go get myself a job as a scribe.

I'll also turn my phone off and make sure to boil all my drinking water and cook my own food.

There is a none-zero chance I might also accidentally kill the entire population by breathing on them. so I'll try to avoid getting my own germs on anyone.
