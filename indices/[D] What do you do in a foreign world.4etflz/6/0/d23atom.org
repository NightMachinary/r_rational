Do you normally come into contact with people that antagonize you? If so, what typically happens?

  Will there be a proverbial good samaritan, or will you have to eek out a living?

Not as such. You'll find nice people and mean people, but you wouldn't just come across someone immediately willing to take care of you. imagine the reverse scenario-- someone's claiming they're from a different world with better technology/magic. Maybe you believe them, maybe you don't, but at best you're probably still going to try and alert the authorities.
