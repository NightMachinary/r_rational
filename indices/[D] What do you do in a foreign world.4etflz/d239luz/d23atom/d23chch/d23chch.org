Sure, but the premise of the second part of my post was predicated on the first part- having people do others harm in alleyways is not uncommon at all, especially in older times when it was one man's word against another's.

As a foreigner you would most certainly draw attention, at the very least the attention of people curious about your looks/clothing. If you weren't careful and depending on the time of day or part of the city the type of inhabitants you'd meet may not be innocently curious, especially if you were a female.

If you were in a poorer part of town your clothing could be misconstrued as that of a foreign noble and you could end up getting mugged. Modern clothes and people are generally more clean and well shaven than most people ever were in the past, which is even more likely if we were clean shaven clean clothes pale skin and being able to read/do arithmetic on paper.

The first thing i would do after finding food and a water source would be to find a way to fit in with the middle/upper class because there is no way i would want to stand out.
