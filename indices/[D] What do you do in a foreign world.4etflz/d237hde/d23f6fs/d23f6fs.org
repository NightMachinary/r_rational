  The typical fantasy story usually let's the main character instantly join an adventuring guild, but let's assume they won't let someone with zero background in.

It should probably be a red flag if they /do/ let just anybody in. The first thing that comes to mind is a certain type of private military contractor, that doesn't care what credentials you don't have, because they'll just send people into the gauntlet and see who comes back out.
