Ultimately, the size of the town or city and the state of government has a huge effect. Were I in such a situation, I would be careful of begging as a negative stigma is quickly attached to beggars in a smaller town.

The first priority, therefore, is gathering information on where to find work. The typical fantasy story usually let's the main character instantly join an adventuring guild, but let's assume they won't let someone with zero background in. Your best bet is to find a job for the government or a business that hires laborers, like construction. If you can read the world's language you should be able to quickly find clerical work.

Although you'll want to appear as a foreigner, certain gaps on your knowledge will become apparent quickly. It's best to find a public library or source of information early, but that priority isn't as immediate as survival.

In the best case, you could meet a government official and convince them you had secrets from another land. After some demonstrations of basic mathematics and engineering, you might be able to find work there. Or get executed, so it's best to find information before taking such rash action.

If worse comes to worse, you can always beg or steal for your survival, though you will most likely run amuck of the law.

Tldr : information comes right after survival
