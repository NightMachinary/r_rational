Yah, I have a pretty applicable skill set for a lot of stuff related to this kind of thing these days.

I know how to cook, I can draw decently (I'm no renaissance master but I could do stuff with a 'shocking degree of realism') I am confident that with effort I could eventually build a hand crank generator, a capacitor and a battery. So I can actually RECHARGE my phone. Although that holds a risk of burning the thing out as I'm not sure how to get the right balance of volts/amps.

I know how to build the first versions of movable type and printing presses in theory.

I like mechanical puzzles enough that I could probably make for a poor man's leonardo da-vinci or hero of alexandria.

The middle ages is sadly a little bit EARLIER then my prime boot strap point.

But I still am confident I could probably be a pretty successful wizard.

Also I like teaching.
