OK, I have a Nexus 4, pen, keys (now just lumps of metal, except for a rather low intensity keychain flashlight), wallet and checkbook containing mostly worthless bits of paper and plastic ... the pictures of my kids are probably the most valuable things in it, some cash (probably worthless), battery pack that's good for maybe six full charges of my phone, Square credit card reader (now worthless), and a Kindle Paperwhite that happens to have the complete "Foreigner" series by C. J. Cherryh loaded on it.

I normally carry a messenger bag but you said "pockets". If I have my bag I have a tablet and either a netbook or a macbook pro depending on which I happened to be carrying that day, plus more pens and a notepad.

Oh and a hat, it's a very nice hat.

First thing, turn off the phone and kindle. Then go look for a university or equivalent.
