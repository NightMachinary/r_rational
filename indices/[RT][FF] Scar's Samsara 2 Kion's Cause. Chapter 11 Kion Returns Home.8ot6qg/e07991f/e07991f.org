Fun fact: The lion extra at the end of this chapter is named "Madita", meaning "mother of lions", after the lead lioness in a documentary starring none other than... Jeremy Irons! Yes, that's right, there exists a lion documentary featuring a Zira-esque badass mother lioness which is narrated by Scar. Naturally, I watched the crap out of it. The full video is available on youtube: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1748&v=mEdVSJtLGQs]]

By the way, you might have noticed that this story features quite a few different 'sides', rather than just being team good vs team evil. This is because I wanted to emulate Yudkowsky's concept of 'true moral conflict'. Scar's Samsara was already interesting because it was the personal story of the villain rather than a grand battle of good vs evil, but since this one is told from the perspective of Kion (who is more of a double subversion of the classical hero archetype than anything, in the sense that he is played straight despite having all the flaws that modern subversions have critiqued) I thought it was necessary.

So by this point in the story you have Kion and the Lion Guard as the de facto good guys, but then there is also conflict with the King in that Ono reports to Simba, while Simba in turn is in conflict with Nala for going behind her back with Scar using Zazu as an intermediary, while Scar and Shenzi created their own team in the Outlands, until Shenzi betrayed him and joined up with her son to fight Jasiri, whose clan is in conflict with Janja due to personal reasons, but who also dislikes the Lions in general, and in turn...

It makes for a much more interesting story than just good vs evil, I think. And it'll only get more convoluted from here on out :p

Next chapter will be the first to feature a different viewpoint character! Bonus rationality points to anyone who can guess who it is :>
