I did consider various devices like these, and they'd definitely serve to eliminate the possibility of "wait, did this load correctly?". But with every one I tried, it felt like I was /easing/ the reader out of the story, if that makes sense? A lot of how I wrote this thing was in service of putting the reader in Luke's head, and the last beat was an attempt to force the reader back out into their /own/ head, making them conscious of their own thoughts on the final conversations. I have no idea how effective that was, but I think that ending on a full stop would just leave people like "yep, that was okay," and ending on an ellipsis would read a little too much like "too be continued..."
