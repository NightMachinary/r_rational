I'm loathe to say "this story is about x", because it's about a few things, but in part it's about the act of being a spectator, both of the world around you and of your own thoughts. Luke spends most of the story stuck in his own head, but towards the end of the story the stream-of-consciousness gives way entirely to (two) external conversations. As the Buzzkill/Roo argument finally lets him start to understand the point of Beyblades, Mira basically absolves him of the need to understand in the first place. The final jumbotron beat is about Luke seeing himself from the outside. The story's "outcome" at the relationship level is no longer in question, and its outcome on the Beyblade level no longer matters, so there's no more story to tell, and the camera cuts away

(I hope this explanation is good enough until I release the story's commentary. Also, it's fascinating to me that you skimmed Mira's dialogue in favour of the Beyblade stuff; the conflict for attention there was deliberate, but other readers that have commented on this were more invested in Mira!)
