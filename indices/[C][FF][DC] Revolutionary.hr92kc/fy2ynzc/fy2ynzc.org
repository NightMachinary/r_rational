Painfully realistic psychology here. I think most of the people who frequent this sub probably have some idea what it's like to be /really/ into something that people who are important to you just /aren't./

There are experiences which I just kind of can't really share with anyone. Even if somebody was interested, I might have to give them /years/ of context just to get them in the neighborhood of understanding, and /I hate/ talking about myself and I /hate/ the sound of my own voice, so I empathize with Mira powerfully. Sucks to have something that's important to you, someone that's important to you, and no good way to connect the two.

And I've been on the outside too, seeing that something is intensely important to someone, and realizing I'd have to cross an ocean of context before I could start to understand, with no guarantee it'd speak to me the same way.

Well done. Great character sketch. I love the pro wrestling version of Beyblade tournaments too.
