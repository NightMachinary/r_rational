been thinking about this comment all morning. Somehow, despite including multiple child characters in this story, and implying Mira got into Beyblades as a kid, /and/ writing the Roo dialogue that you're talking about, I gave very little conscious thought to the idea of Beyblades /from the perspective of/ children, rather than in retrospect as an adult

I like that you talk about Digimon here, because Digimon was something I neither understood nor had any first-hand experience with as a kid. So it reminds me that, past a certain level of obscurity, everything means something to someone, if that makes sense?

my friends got me really into Pokemon when I was a kid, and I think the point where I lost interest was the point where it stopped being about me and my friends pitting our faves against one another, and became more about competitive strategies, and I was leaving my DS on overnight using a hacky way of levelling up Pokemon in day-care. When I was older, I inadvertently got a lot of friends into MTG, and years later many of them are at the point where they're spending lots of money on competitive cards and interesting combos, while I still like collecting commons and playing lots of beefy creatures. Maybe it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, but I've never considered myself particularly /skilled/, and I think that's why Beyblades as a skill/-less/ sport makes sense to me. To this day, I enjoy rock-paper-scissors far more than the average person
