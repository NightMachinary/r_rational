I think the weirdly good epiphany moment with Roo's take near the end elevates this. Good work, seriously. That take somehow made Beyblades cool.

It reminded me of playing Digimon World with a cousin, strangely enough. The multiplayer for that game was a VS mode where you could pit two digimon saves against each other, and if the digimon wasn't trained in a particular stat, you had no real control over it. It was a lot like one of those wrestling staging games, with COM vs COM tournaments. Slotting beyblades into that category made it make sense again. I no longer need to wonder why my friends and me ever wasted money on crappy knockoffs when I was in elementary.

This is definitely not the main takeaway of the story, but it was a surprisingly good bit of it.
