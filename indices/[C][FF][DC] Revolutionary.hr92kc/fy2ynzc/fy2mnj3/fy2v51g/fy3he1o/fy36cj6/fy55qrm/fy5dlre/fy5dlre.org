I enjoyed this story a lot. As somebody with a tendency toward anxiety and introspection, I often have difficulty enjoying stories told from perspectives like these, with a narrator very much in their own head. It often rings false or too contrived. But your writing captured that particular kind of stream of consciousness in a way I found very satisfying. Thanks, and I'm looking forward to working through whatever else you've written or will write.

I am tempted now to nerd out on a closer critical reading of various things about this that I found tasty, but I don't know if that's something anybody would enjoy and it sounds like you intend to cover a lot of that ground yourself in a behind-the-scenes post. I'll at least wait till that's posted.
