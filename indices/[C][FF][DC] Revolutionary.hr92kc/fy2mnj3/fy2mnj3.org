*/Luke's girlfriend drags him to a Beyblade tournament./*

a while ago I saw the phrase "rational romance" on this sub and haven't been able to get it out of my head since. This ended up not quite being that, but it focuses on a conflict I haven't personally seen in fiction before and it's heavily rooted in the thought processes/biases of the protagonist. Some other notes:

- [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle][/Worth the Candle's/]] relationship-centric flashbacks were a big influence on this thing, but I think I drew more inspiration from AW's short fics, which always make interesting parallels between some aspect of a fictional word and a seemingly-disconnected theme. The story "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13635237/1/Sivad-s-Question][Sivad's Question]]" posted here the other week did the same with an even more ludicruous premise. I'm hoping this can scratch that itch for some of you
- my experience with Beyblades is effectively nonexistent, and I deliberately avoided researching it. I wish there was a word like "nonfanfiction" to describe what this thing is. Of all the early-2000s-collectible-games that TV put in front of me as a kid, I think Beyblades was the one I understood least, so I hope that this story manages to communicate why someone might like /some/ version of Beyblades - even if it's not /our/ version of Beyblades - and how a game like this might work in the real world
- a behind-the-scenes commentary explaining the writing process behind this thing +will hopefully be up by next month+ can be read [[https://wadapan.wordpress.com/2020/07/13/revolutionary/2/][here]], which some people might find interesting
