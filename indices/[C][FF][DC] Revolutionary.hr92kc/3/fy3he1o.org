I'm really confused by the ending, why does it end mid sentence?

I've got to say the last part of it is really good. Well done on the mixing of the interesting banter between buzzkill and roo with the protagonists' discussion on their relationship. It felt really tense and exciting. I felt like the main character skimming through what she was saying as I strained to pay attention to the match.
