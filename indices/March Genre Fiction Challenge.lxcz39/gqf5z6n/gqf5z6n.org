Rage builds, pressing my brain's inner wall:\\
the urge to avenge you, refusing to stall.\\
And as none struck you down (our loss cancer's theft),\\
I won't taste revenge until I've murdered Death.

The foe is collosal, its power unmatched--\\
I can't claim revenge by sword or by hatchet,\\
but scalpel, perhaps, can provide me intel.\\
To conquer my foe, I must needs know him well.

Study his methods, surpassingly subtle,\\
his arguments always beyond our rebuttal,\\
but tut, 's his advantage not singular still?\\
His time can't run out, ours inev'tably will.

But evit I must, it's the goal of this game,\\
To see the scythe-wielder be finally tame.\\
And as humankind's been compared to a flame,\\
I dissect respiration to further my aim.

Oxidative damage grinds me like a mill,\\
Free radicals taking their wage to the till.\\
As nothing is free and I've no time to muddle,\\
I drop nanite and compound into petri puddle.

At last I find one that makes telomeres swell,\\
The sick and the aged begin to feel well.\\
I brew it by barrels, my plot finely hatched--\\
the bug in our bestial code finally patched.

I feel at this point like I've got nothing left,\\
and stare wild-eyed into the face of Death.\\
As though I've won the game, he stoops down for his ball,\\
but I snatch it and say, "not 'til I've rezzed them all."
