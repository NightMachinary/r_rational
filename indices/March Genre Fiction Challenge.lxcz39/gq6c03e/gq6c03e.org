Portrait of Suffering

She lingers with the broken\\
The despondent and the damned\\
Each step is cowled in silence\\
She dares not raise her head

Robed in grey, her hands\\
Are clasped in constant prayer\\
She's unobtrusive, yet\\
You'll always know she's there

All will shun her presence\\
But those who seek her find\\
In anguish she is peace\\
And rest for weary minds
