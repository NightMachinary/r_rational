​

I live, I die, I live again,

forever stuck, November, ten.

My plane hijacked by a group of men,

I live, I die, I live again.

​

I live, I die, I live again,

Loop'd twenty two minutes of pain.

not landing but blown up instead,

I fight, I die, I live again.

​

I live, I die, I live again,

my mind can barely take the strain.

Keep trying every stratagem,

Plane blows, I die, I live again.

​

I live, I die, I live again,

hijacker stabbed in the vein,

reaching to snuff the bomb and then..

A blast, I die, I live again.

​

I live, I die, I live again,

try maybe talking sense in them,

their empty stares laugh at me and,

I fail, I die, I live again.

​

I live, I die, I live again,

Flight Marshal's name was Jimmy Glenn,

Hijackers shot him in the brain

I cry, I die I live again.

​

I live, I die, I live again,

trying to crack a window pane,

diversion fails and though glass rained,

they win, I die, I live again

​

I live, I die, I live again,

Id rather have my whisky gents,

Feel free to blow us up when can,

I drink, I die, I live again

​

I live, I die, I live again,

if plane took path most turbulent,

would wires of the bomb be rent?

I think, I die, I live again

​

I live, I die, I live again,

A clever plot, and luck insane,

a certain cellphone number gained,

I smile, I die, I live again

​

I live, I die, I live again,

Idea formed, a message sent,

the pilot takes a hint, loop spent,

I WIN, I live, I laugh, the end.
