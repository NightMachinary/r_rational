*Textbook*

I am reading physics. An alarm beeps.

The sound and flinch displace me; replace me

In my seat. I forgot that I was me.

The world is a ringing cacophony,

stinging harmonies,

Weight and light and biology,

but now this force joins the menagerie,

Electricity.

--------------

I silence my phone, the undead black stone,

Singing with charge, presence large and unknown,

A field is stirring the intent inside,

Reminding me the place I wished to go.

The streaming light is my past-self's desires.

I set an alarm, but charming discourse

had disarmed me. Now my arm snaps up,

the dimness alarming,

I flick a switch, and the descending sun's

darkness becomes just a forgotten itch,

My fingers charge through plastic and cable,

To tungsten, a cause and effect that might,

Resist the nighttime that snuck up on me.

These things just hang in walls! Magic unseen.

--------------

My augmented mind's eye scans the router.

Silent shouter, a signal splashing out

Calling in my phone's every favor,

Next, I see the computer at my desk

It has too much intent, but I know that

the disk reader is cold and connected,

never wavering.

Ready to read anything set in front of it,

Like I was, I am yet.

I glance toward my door, wonder is force,

Flying through it all, every directive

Is a silent shape made by these objects,

But also deliberate accident.

Evolution. I too am being shaped.

But just now I'm late.

I leap to my feet, step forward to leave

A head from which the blood left--stood too fast,

Cause and effect are like that.

Still the new force makes my hair stand on end

as feet shuffle, scuffle across the floor,

The force fills the wetness behind my eyes,

Carries a particle echo of stone,

Through lens into my brain and then some more,

It holds together the fibers that make

my hand squeeze on the handle in the door,

It was here and always has been here,

In my possessions, in blood and sinew,

In those who live and those who lived before.

I never knew about that which flew,

Through air, my body, and everything else,

As if one word could hold the entire tune.

I go out; leave my room. And just for now,

My mind embraces the whole world anew.
