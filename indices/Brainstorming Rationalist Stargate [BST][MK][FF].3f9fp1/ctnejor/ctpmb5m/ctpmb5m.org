I recall a scene at soime point where it was explained that the many people in the galkaxy actually are descended from (past) humans, and Sam points out that humans evolved on Earth and did not comer from elsewhere, to which the reply was that this means the Earth is the ancestral source of the human race.

In other words, it's already canon that at least large portions of the galaxy /are/ descended from Earth beings.
