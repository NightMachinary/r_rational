The Tok'ra are all descendants of a single queen (Egeria). Given that the wiki says,

#+begin_quote
  Dozens of Tok'ra symbiotes would be captured and killed by the Goa'uld and almost spelt the end of their kind. Luckily, the eldest brood of Egeria led their kind into hiding where they managed to survive.

  After taking stock over their situation, the Tok'ra realized they were unable to acquire military forces sufficient to counter the System Lords and thus they adopted strategies of subterfuge. (RPG: "Fantastic Frontiers: Stargate Season One")

I guess that leaves their numbers somewhere around a hundred? Depends on how many prim'ta (infant Goa'uld) per brood. Compared to however many Goa'uld had long-before left their homeworld using Unas hosts, transferred to humans, and then set up an empire spanning most of the galaxy, they wouldn't have much of a chance.

Chemical brain damage sufficient to induce megalomania in a species that already views humanoids as cattle doesn't preclude military might or some adaptive ability. Even in real-life humans, mild or localized brain damage doesn't stop us from having an impact -- it just makes us More Wrong. :P

As for wiping out the Goa'uld, I should be more specific: all Goa'uld EXCEPT the Tok'ra should be wiped out, especially any remaining System Lord-wannabes -- they consistently caused widespread suffering and death for everyone around them for millenia without regret. As little as the Free Jaffa might like being dependant on the Tau'ri, it seems like it would be better just to use the Asgard tech to synthesize tretonin for them.
