I don't see /rationalist/ fic about Stargate being possible without a fully actualized character. Thus, they need to /already/ be an Ascended. Otherwise, you need some plot shenanigins just to get some baseline human into place to actually do interesting things in the universe.

All of those seem really cheap and pointless, not things that an intelligent person could achieve in a single human lifetime. And from the start of the show, you've got something like a year until the first existential threat to the Earth, three years best case if canon's absurdly lucky events happen. What, just over four years until nano-deathwave gets delivered to Earth by idiots? And about six years until higher beings need to save everyone's asses in the entire Milky Way.

So unless you want a story about how to fight an impossible fight until plot elements come to save the day...

I'm thinking, Rational Anubis fixes the galaxy to better fight off the coming Ori genocide, but no one else gets that--including the Ancients--so he has to crush some mortal skulls in the process. Means he has to play by some stupid rules, but so long as he doesn't "cheat" in ways that get the higher Ascended on his case, anything is fair game.

Basically, like in canon. But with smart use of nanotech and other such gadgets. Unlike Earth, he's in a position to actually munchkin this stuff up in interesting ways. That's the rationalist story I'd tell.

Oh. And souls are real in the Stargate 'verse, and if you're "evolved" enough, you get to keep using yours. Otherwise, it gets turned into undifferentiated energy when you die. Unless an ascended saves it for you (!?!). And the only known immortality devices "dirty" your soul, making you psychotic and stupid, and unable to ascend at all ever. So. That's a thing.
