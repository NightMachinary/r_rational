There is an internal treaty of non-interference. The Ascended of the Milky Way are composed of multiple races, and the Ancients are the ones with the most power. They agreed to certain measures in a pact with the Ori Ascended a long fucking time ago to end or prevent, it isn't clear which, a galactic war between superbeings.

The Ascended agreed not to use their powers directly on mortals, including helping them ascend.
