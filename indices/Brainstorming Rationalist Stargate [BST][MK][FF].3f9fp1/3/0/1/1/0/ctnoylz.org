The highest level conflict was primarily the Ancients vs the Ori. They are both foreigners in our galaxy, as the name Alterans implies. The Ancients fled to our galaxy after a horrible war in their native galaxy, one the Ori won. The Milky Way has native ascended, also.

The Ori discover the Milky Way a long time ago and poisoned the Ancients, and continue their fight while still obeying the letter of their treaty. The, ahem, /origin/ of the conflict was the humans the Ori created. The Ori didn't know there were humans in the Milky Way, though, possibly because of the power of the Ancients.

In the show, they've just gotten around to full-scale conquest. The Ancients are not powerful enough to engage in open combat, and are barely able to continue enforcing the treaty as the Ori's human agents conquer the Milky Way.

The Ancients didn't like they way the Ori promised humans ascension, but then just used people's souls as fuel for their own purposes. Ascending everyone would result in the power being spread thin, and also break the treaty, so they don't do that despite their promises to worshipers. The SG-'verse is a place where mortal worship fuels gods, so keeping people who aren't ascended worshiping them is something the gods are in favor of.

The Ori want to enslave everyone with their religion. The Ancients just want the mortals to have a change to develop naturally, and several individuals are in favor of helping up moral people who are already close. But their treaty disallows that.

Anubis tricked an Ancient into helping him, Oma, which got her into a lot of trouble. In the end, there was a galaxy-scale Ascended-killer weapon that got used through a super gate into the Ori's home base. It killed all but one of them...somehow...

Based on your initial timeline ideas, that is where you'd be. Anubis is also dead by that time. Most likely.
