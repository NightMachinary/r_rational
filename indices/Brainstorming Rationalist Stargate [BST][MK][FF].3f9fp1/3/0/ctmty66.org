The idea of Anubis as the hero is exellent! I think I'm going to steal that.

Ascending doesn't seem to equal being fully actualized. Many Ascended beings have descended in order to fulfill their goals. I'm thinking that the current set of ascended have acted against enough people's interests to qualify as an enemy.

If, as a group, they care about intelligent life, why aren't they ascending everyone on death?
