The problem with writing from a point of view after the series is that you import all of the problems of the original series itself. In order to fix all of these problems, hacks must be added to make things work. The problem is that the scale of these hacks is quite large.

Stolen technology is not anywhere near enough to explain anything. Plus, the Goa'uld have canonically invented and altered that technology and have no desire to share it or make it easy to share with their slaves or their Jaffa.

In order to explain the silly and idiotic decisions of almost everyone, you essentially need a magical galaxy wide field (perhaps larger) that is more powerful than the combined might of the ascended. Naturally this field is focused only on decisions made by or in relation to space travel and interspecies relationships. There is literally no other way to explain it.

I have suggested the only two options I can think of for the ability to understand tech and they require the intervention of third parties (possibly ascended?).

There is also Daniels' ability to translate absolutely everything, the complete lack of translation (everything is in English), the extremely low populations of people in the galaxy, the social situations in virtually every alien society and yet other problems. None of these have solutions that do not involve unknown third parties or magical intervention.
