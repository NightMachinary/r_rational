You bring up a lot of good points. Since I'm writing from a point after the events of the series, I'm looking for a way to explain how those events happened.

Explaining how humans have been able to use alien tech is a big part of that. As is understanding what many of the 'minor' factions have been up to.

The Goa'uld are primarily using stolen technology, so the ease of humans using it might be a side effect of the fact that it's been filtered for ease of use? That doesn't seem like enough...

Exposing the SGC seems like a reasonable thing to do, especially since the leaks are increasing. I think military paranoia would explain why they haven't, except that they aren't nearly paranoid enough in any other way.
