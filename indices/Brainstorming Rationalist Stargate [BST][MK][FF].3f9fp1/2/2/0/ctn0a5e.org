I see two ways of doing so. The first option is that they received some kind of completely undetectable intelligence adjustment. Furthermore, this adjustment was somehow unnoticed (or present from birth). The degree of adjustment is such that both of them will view all other humans as moronic ants in comparison to themselves. To give a precise comparison, this is enough intelligence to give Carter the intelligence of the super AI replicators.

The second option is unknown third parties (at least as powerful as the ascended) have been giving these people information telepathically for their entire investigation. None of their work was really theirs - this third party simply gave them the information.
