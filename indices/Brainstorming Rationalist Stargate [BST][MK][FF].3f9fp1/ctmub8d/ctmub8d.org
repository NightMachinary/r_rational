I think that a rational story would make things more realistic for everyone. Stargate gives out idiot balls to everyone, not just the heroes. They also have several Hollywood tropes that are very unrealistic.

For the SGC, they would have a plan for disclosure and actually use it. If they did not, then it would be disclosed anyway and they would lose control over how it was done. Captain Carter is a great astrophysics person, but she is not a superhuman AI. This means that she does not solve every problem, she has a specialty and her problems are solved in a matter of weeks or months, not minutes. (This is true of Daniel as well.) In addition to this, the greatest advantage of science is numbers and freedom not individual science heroes. This means a secret investigation will lack both and will therefore be very slow. This is another reason to favor disclosure.

For the Goa'uld, they are made incompetent for better TV. The sarcophagus can give them brain damage, but their numbers and the length of time they have been alive will lead to better technology. Their technology should be so advanced that the SGC cannot distinguish it from magic without assistance. (The ease by which technology is learned comes from Hollywood's inability to understand large numbers.) Remember that they are supposed to have been technologically advanced for thousands of years. Even if they advanced slower than Earth did, their technology will still be orders of magnitude better than when they started. Also, their actions will (and canonically did) take account of advanced worlds and enemies. So when Apophis arrived in his ships, he would start bombing right away - perhaps while sending a message. He would not wait in orbit until the heroes defeat him.

For the other races in general, there seems to be a common trend of either ignoring their existence or the aliens simply giving everything to Earth. Exceptions to that are rare. This is simply not realistic. Advanced aliens are their own people with their own agenda. They will also act in the galaxy even when the main characters are not looking.

As for the Earth, the US has no reason to give up the stargate. At the same time, early disclosure will not lead to that. The US is a member of the Security Council and is capable of simply rejecting any claims they do not like. Furthermore, operating from the United Nations gives the US a way to represent their operations as being "from the Earth as a whole", even though they retain control of the stargate and the operations of it. Furthermore, disclosure will not lead to public panic unless it is uncontrolled during a Goa'uld attack. A controlled disclosure will lead to wonder and determination. The worst possibility is the formation of cults that worship Goa'uld, and such cults would not be popular.

For the advanced races, their technology should be so advanced that the SGC has no hope of understanding how it works. Their first order of business should be new theories of physics, not new guns. The SGC attempting to understand to understand Asgard technology should be even worse than a caveman attempting to understand how a modern laptop works. The SGC's first priority should therefore be gaining new science teachers, alien science textbooks and other science information to speed up their progress. Disclosure should happen as soon as possible in order to gain the resources of the world rather than a tiny section of the United States. I cannot emphasize how advanced the science and technology really should appear to us. Captain Carter and all of the scientists in world should be unable to crack Asgard technology no matter how long they investigate it.
