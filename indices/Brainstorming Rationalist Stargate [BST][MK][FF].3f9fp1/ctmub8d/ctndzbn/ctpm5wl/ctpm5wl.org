The sarcophagus was deliberately retconned away--/after/, and separately from it being shown to cause insanity--and we shouldn't treat it as existing in the Stargate universe.

(And I suspect that having it cause insanity was a first attempt to retcon it away by giving a reason why everyone doesn't use it. Someone probably then realized that wasn't enough, since they could make a rule that you can only use it 5 times before you have to retire, and then they actually retconned it out completely.)
