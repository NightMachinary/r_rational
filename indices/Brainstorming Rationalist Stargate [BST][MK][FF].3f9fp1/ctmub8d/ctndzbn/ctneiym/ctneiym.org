I would probably expect that conversational Goa'uld functions as a trade language within their empire and in any nearby systems. So having everyone in the SGC learn conversational Goa'uld would probably be required. (Right now, the US teaches languages for the military in an intensive two year program. So I would expect something like that to be required for everyone.)

As for guns, you are right that they need that right away. The problem is that any guns they need they probably cannot use. The energy requirements are likely too high. If not, then actually setting them would be a huge engineering problem. So while they want guns, they would probably have to settle for hand weapons (staff weapons, zats and the like). Space weapons would probably require a third party to defend Earth's space while Earth learns advanced physics and how to build our own weapons.
