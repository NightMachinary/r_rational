  The problem is that any guns they need they probably cannot use. The energy requirements are likely too high.

If we can acquire weapons, we can also acquire ammunition.

  Space weapons would probably require a third party to defend Earth's space
#+end_quote

A third party could provide materiel and training to use it, rather than materiel and personnel. The CIA, by way of analogy, provides firearms and training to guerrilla groups in half the nations of the world, but it doesn't provide soldiers.

  while Earth learns advanced physics and how to build our own weapons.

You're conflating science with engineering. While it would be useful for us to learn advanced physics so we can make better defenses and weaponry, that's a long-term thing. In the mid term, we need a secure supply of materiel, preferably one we control -- we need to be able to manufacture and maintain the equipment we use. That just requires someone (possibly our putative benefactor) to understand in detail how to create the items in question and the current manufacturing and resource collection abilities of Earth and how to connect the two.

That last task requires someone to understand the physics, most likely, or at least materials engineering. But that could easily be the benefactor rather than us Earthlings.
