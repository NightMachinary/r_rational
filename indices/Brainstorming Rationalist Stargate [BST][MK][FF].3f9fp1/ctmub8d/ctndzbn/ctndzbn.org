  The sarcophagus can give them brain damage, but their numbers and the length of time they have been alive will lead to better technology.

Especially because the sarcophagus just makes humans, at least, more of a selfish asshole and not any dumber. It's possible that the effect doesn't apply to Goa'uld, and it's possible that Goa'uld can heal any damage to themselves or their hosts that results from the sarcophagus. There is speculation in one episode that sarcophagus usage is a key differentiating factor between the Goa'uld and the Tok'ra, but as far as I can tell, it's just one bit of throwaway speculation.

If the sarcophagus devices only have ill effects on humans, Goa'uld might not care at all. Turning a host evil when that host already has no ability to exercise their will -- it just doesn't matter.

  problems are solved in a matter of weeks or months, not minutes.

Likewise, languages are analyzed in a matter of months. Daniel Jackson doesn't automatically understand a language just because a human is speaking it. I'd understand if everyone at SGC had to learn at least conversational Goa'uld and the Goa'uld demanded that their slaves could all speak and understand the language. (In my personal canon, everyone at SGC knows the primary language in use by system lords, and Daniel Jackson knows the three or four minor languages used by system lords.)

  Their first order of business should be new theories of physics, not new guns.

It depends. When the Goa'uld are beating on your door, you want guns. The more safety you have, the further you anticipate the attack to be, the further up the chain you can go. If you've got a year, you might just want enough technical knowledge to start mass producing weapons. If you have a decade, you want the science too.
