Carter has a semi-reasonable in-universe explanation. Very early on, she was possessed by a Goa'uld, and she retains memories. Perhaps those include understanding of the physics required. Vala understands Goa'uld tech for similar reasons

McKay does have the viewpoint that everyone else is an idiot, perhaps he was an asgard experiment? It's been established that Loki was tinkering with humans.

I realize that these are hacks, and not completely satisfying. I'll keep thinking on this.
