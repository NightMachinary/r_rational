  The Goa'uld are primarily using stolen technology, so the ease of humans using it might be a side effect of the fact that it's been filtered for ease of use? That doesn't seem like enough...

Some of the items are pretty simple. A staff weapon, for instance, only needs two controls: on and shoot. Every Jaffa warrior needs to know how to use one, in case you find a prisoner willing to talk. Failing that, every Jaffa warrior has a staff weapon, so you can use cameras to try to record how a Jaffa activates a staff weapon.

A ha'tak is a complex piece of equipment. Teal'c might be able to pilot one, but he would probably need one on hand in order to train someone else. No doubt he is missing some knowledge about how to use them, and no doubt he would accidentally omit some of his knowledge when teaching another. Still, it would probably be good enough for someone fluent in Goa'uld to work out the details in time -- with some moderately high probability of destroying the ha'tak and everyone inside.
