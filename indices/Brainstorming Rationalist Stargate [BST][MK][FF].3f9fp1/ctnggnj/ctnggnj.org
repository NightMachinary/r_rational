-mybe the goauld have long memories but are kinda stupid, cruising on stolen tech and the fragments of ingenuity displayed by their followers (which can never be allowed too much freedom, see how they had to leave earth?)

-Something something souls, ascension, magical universe.

-Turns out, consciousness hinges on biological components.

-They don't need to. That thin layer of metal on top of the portal instantly destroys anything that comes through because that's just how wormholes work. If there's no room to materialize on the other end the object just disappears.

-Canonically, the main problem is how to break the news to the public. I think we can assume post-scarcity is coming soon without actually going into the nitty gritty of how (it's never just one thing anyway) but right now humanity has only /just/ made contact.

-ascended plane may have its own scarcities and dangers. Plus, the other ascended might harm you once you lose the non-interference protection clause. It's traditional story-logic and I think also a folk-christian belief in some circles that the evil fairies and demons can't touch you until you yourself dabble in magic first anyway, at which point you're fair game.

-The timeline splits into new ones whenever you thusly travel (then again, the timeline is probably splitting constantly anyhow in this physics) and there are infinite alternate realities. Philosophical questions abound. It's likely that an instance in which this is already being done exists.

-Canon seems to suggest replicators aren't intelligent enough to plan ahead (like the one time they basically rusted away because they didn't realize they were going to fall into the ocean). I think they're basically meant to be very good at adapting via some simple process. They were accidentally released by a stupid humanlike AGI, not intentionally designed. But they do have human-form versions which are human-level intelligent and irrational.

-Goa'uld are all essentially the same person. Genetic memory, remember? So it's not necessarily useful to talk about the utility function of the species as a whole.
