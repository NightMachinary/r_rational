It seemed to me that ascension was /generally/ treated as requiring a certain amount of study and also required that you be accepted by other ascended beings. There were, of course, exceptions (one wonders about how all the livestock on Abydos managed to ascend with the people), but every longrunning TV show has weirdnesses every so often.

If you want something else to explain away, explain away why the Ancients look like humans.

Also, explain why everyone speaks English, although I would really treat that as a deliberate plot hole needed to make stories work. Alternatively, one theory is that there's a common galactic language that most people speak and Stargate personnel are normally taught. It just isn'[t shown in the show (and does explain away the occasional instances where foreign language skills are necessary.)

Re: replicators, I think that counts as another post-scarcity technology. Remember the Weir replicator and Fran?

As for Goauld incompetency, I see the Goauld being defeated by Earth as the equivalent of the Aztecs being defeated by the Spanish. They have lots of advantages, but lots of people hate them and an outside force can make the whole thing collapse. Unlike the Aztecs versus the Spanish they have higher technology than the Earth, but their social structure isn't conducive to either efficient use of the tech they have or of research to improve their tech.
