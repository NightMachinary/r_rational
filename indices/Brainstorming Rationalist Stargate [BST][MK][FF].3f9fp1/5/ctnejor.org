How exactly do goa'ulds control their host anyways? From my understanding they interfere with the motor signals coming from the brain by wrapping around the spinal cord and doing...what? if they cut the spinal cord, the host will probably die, right? do they control the direction of the signal(s) coming from the brain? if so, how do they control what signals are sent in the first place? Do they just stop all motor signals that they don't want, until the human host gives in and gives them the motor signal they want? But if the human decides not to move at all, or to only move a little bit, so they only do small simple movements, how would the goa'uld control them then?

It seems like the goua'ld would have to control the brain itself, by inhibiting some connections and promoting others. But if this happens, the hosts themselves would be changed by that. Also, what happens to the host when they enter a sarcophagus? Shouldn't the host ALSO develop megalomania?

TBH, I suspect that the megalomania caused by the sarcophagus actually was meant as an anti-immortality plot device.

The goauld's brains are too small to be sapient. Maybe what the goa'uld does is alter the host's utility function in some way that is beneficial to it. I think they alter the host's utility function to make them power-hungry. Maybe goauld are kind of like fungi and they're more concerned with what will allow as much of their offspring to germinate as possible, rather than the more human motivation of survival and family. So the goauld make their hosts power hungry in order to gain access to more resources, more food, and more hosts for their offspring. Ultimately they want all humans to be jaffa and to make as many jaffa who live as long as possible, so that they can maximize their germinated offspring.

I think the goauld should be fungal, not reptillian. The only reason they were snakes in the first place was because snakes are considered satanic.

Of course, if the goauld are fungi rather than snakes, that eliminates the ancient egyptian conection.

Why are all the aliens from human mythology anyway? It's like humans aren't even CAPABLE of making things up.

I would say this implies a heavy level of interaction between humans and the other sapient races. If the humans are the ancestors of the ancients and the ancients are time travellers, that might explain why they are taking a special interest. The ancients are reclusive, so if they want to communicate with the ancients, they leave a record with the ancestors of the ancients...

An alt explanation is that ALL of the advanced aliens are descendants of humans or other earth creatures from the future. This would make more sense with how the gouald would be fungus (or even snakes like in canon), and why the azguard are humanoid and look and talk like humans. It would explain why everyone speaks english or at least some language that Daniel is actually capable of translating. It would also explain how the gouauld could be semi-sapient with such small brains; technological advances that improve their brain's efficiency, or maybe their brains are made of nanotech rather than normal brain cells, so they actually have room for a full-sized brain in their tiny bodies.

Also, take out the glowing eyes thing. :P
