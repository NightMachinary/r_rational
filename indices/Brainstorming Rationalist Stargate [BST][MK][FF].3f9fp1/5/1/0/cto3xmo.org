the only problem with this is that

1. the goauld wouldn't need to change the host's utility function if they were smart enough to remember things themselves, so--
2. the goauld need human neural substrate for their genetic memories to be remembered, since their own brains are too small to do that.
3. if this does not happen instantaneously, then there must be some sort of extended process in which the human host's brain state gradually transforms based on the goauld's genetic instructions. Or something. So something of the host does survive...for a while. After a thousand years, though, it's WAY past too late. Tbh, though, having genetic instructions for transforming an entire brain seems to me kind of energy-costly and possibly even more unlikely to develop naturally than it would to evolve their own sapience. They probably just transform parts of the brain in certain ways. However, that would make their long term genetic memory quite limited, since there's only so many human neurons whose states can be coded for by a small reptilian genome. And it also would be no different than to'kra, since if goauld are not sapient, they can't understand when a human gives consent or not to let them in. Of course, if they have some way of acquiring new genes from their host, that could maybe improve their long term genetic memory by increasing the number of neurons whose brain states they can change.
