The big question that arises from Goa'uld brain damage: why didn't the Tok'ra win long ago? Sure, they have smaller numbers, but so did the SGC.

I'm not sure how I feel about wiping out the Goa'uld as a species. They are sentient, and capable of morality. Tok'ra hosts seem to be genuinely happy about the situation. But any descended from those who used the sarcophagus are probably a lost cause.

I really like the idea of the asgard worrying about being hacked. As you say, reasonable since their ships aren't secure.
