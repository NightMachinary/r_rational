I'm going to assume that you're not going to even try reconciling the last-of-his-species-Ra, only-two-gates-halfway-across-the-known-universe of the classic Stargate movie with the later canon.

Regarding 1a:

- The Goa'uld are parasites with generally low creativity and one-dimensional personality. According to the Stargate Wikia, at least, Cronus and Ra acted out pretty much the same routines for 10K years; Apophis and (especially) Ba'al were outliers in that regard.

- Ra "went shopping" for humans around 10,500 BC. The Goa'uld keep them at a Neolithic(?) tech level, brainwash them into thinking Goa'uld are gods over generations with "miracles" of stolen tech, and only fight among each other in a lazy feudal power system where everyone in charge is long-lived family; you have a recipe for exactly what we see: militaries optimized so the slaves can't rebel successfully most of the time, "soldiers" equipped to inflict fear and not be particularly effective, and ships designed to save their own scaly tails.

- *The Goa'uld are, literally, brain-damaged.* The Sarcophagus has the nasty side effect of inducing megalomania with repeated (especially unnecessary) usage, canonically, which was one of the reasons why the Tok'ra, who used it stingily if at all, had such different results in their utility function. I would think a sane SGC wouldn't use it unless necessary, once they acquired one and if learned of the side effects.

1b: I have no damn clue how it works, given that the Wraith can consciously reverse the process, giving more 'lifeforce' to their target. Supposedly the Ancients tried coming up with a non-Ascension form of immortality, using baseline humans an the Iratus bug. /shrug/

1c. Perhaps the Asgard were too concerned that the Replicators would hack their new android/gynoid/is-there-even-a-genderless-version-wordoid bodies? They couldn't even secure their own ships. As for before encountering the the pesks...no idea. The ancient races overall seem badly written.

1d. They were pretty quick to create and install the Iris, even as of the second episode. Pretty sure they upgraded it later, when they discovered new materials. I don't see a good reason why they didn't use that "Canadian SG-1" fic's simple solution of turning the gate horizontal after O'Neil was basically trapped offworld by one until he could dig out.

2. Post-scarcity stuff

- Ascension wouldn't do a lot of good anyway, since the majority of the Ascended beings don't permit interfering with the "lower plane" often.

- The Nox rightly see humanity as "too young" to deal with.

- Time Dilation Fields would require a) people to leave their families for subjectively long periods, isolating them or b) basically setting-and-forgetting type assembly lines and timer-operated experiments. Could work, I suppose.

- There were at least four Ancient Repositories. Two would stuff your head with so much data that you would have little-to-no conscious executive function left not-overwritten, a third out of date with an immediately-lethal-to-humans normal access method (Destiny's) and a fourth (Merlin's) that actually had a virtual interface to assist. The Asgard had thousands of years to study a "small portion" of the newer version, and "only scratched the surface". The problem with Merlin's machine would be /knowing what to look for/, still not an easy task, and we're assuming here that the Ascended beings didn't simply destroy that one after the Sangraal had been used against the Ori.

- Time travel is an unbounded number of security breaches and existence failures not waiting around to have been going to be later simultaneously happening all at once. Smart!RepliCarter would automatically win, once she figured that out.

3. Credible threats left after the destruction of the Ori? Whether the Replicators are still a threat is dependant on if those in the Milky Way were able to transmit the disruptor frequency used on Dekara. There were seven of the Asuran human-form Replicators left inactive from exposure to space in Pegasus, but that's all, and the Wraith aren't stupid enough to reactivate the weapons proven so successful against them in the past. The Goa'uld, frankly, are best simply hunted down and eliminated. Permanently.

The Lucian Alliance would be the most interesting opponent, I think. They're mostly humans who had suffered under Goa'uld rule who snatched up the infrastructure for themselves and turned to (mostly) organized crime -- not nearly as easy to "hide behind calculations" for the Kinsey-types upstairs.

Bonus from your other list: the Tok'ra did mention that the Goa'uld communication devices were not secure; however, SG-1 first encountered the devices in the final episode of the 1st season, and didn't meet the Tok'ra until the 11th episode of the 2nd season. Lot of time for leaking intel if the SGC were to use them.
