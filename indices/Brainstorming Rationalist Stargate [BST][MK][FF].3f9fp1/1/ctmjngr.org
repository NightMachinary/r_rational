I don't really care for reaching for uploaded computronium supertech dyson sphere, etc status that should rationally comes with SG-1 acquiring all those technology and munchkin. Really, there's too much supertech available to Earth for research. It should be harder and much rarer, or else the story transforms Earth into an unrecognizable technological civilization.

Make the story limited and the narrative bigger. Less focus on SG-1, and more focus on SGC as an organization, with some view on world politics.

Plan for public disclosure, even if the disclosure event was unplanned. They should have plans of some kind as to how to inform the public.

Exploration should be slower and more careful. More use of drones and MALPs.

How do the Chinese and Russian go along with the US? What is Earth's policy for defense? Why don't Earthlings screw each other over? What treaties are there? What arrangements are made, and so on.
