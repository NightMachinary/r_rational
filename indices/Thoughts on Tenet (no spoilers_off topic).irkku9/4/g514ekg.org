It's a really good execution of the premise. There is a little bit of hand waving in terms of how certain things work to drive the plot, and obviously if you want to nitpick you can question the physics of it, but it's very impressive how much Nolan trusts the audience‘s intelligence.

If you're seeing it in English, you should request a closed caption device or see a subtitled screening. For me the sound mix didn't stop me understanding anything crucial, but there are definitely some loud scenes where I was straining to work out what was being said, and a couple of those are complicated enough that it did detract from the experience. I think the issue is worse in IMAX theatres with louder bass and also depends on how good you are at picking out speech from noise and understanding foreign accents; I've definitely heard of multiple people who couldn't understand half the dialogue.

Also, don't watch the final trailer which gives too much away IMO.

The mixed reviews seem to be largely down to reviewers who couldn't understand the mechanics of what was going on. Even some positive reviews say things like “don't worry about understanding the plot, just enjoy the ride”. And audience reviews are full of angry people who just couldn't understand what was happening (and not because of the sound mix, although I'm sure that didn't help).
