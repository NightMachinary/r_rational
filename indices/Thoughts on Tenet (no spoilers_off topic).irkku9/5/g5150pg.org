There were a few points that I felt a teensy bit iffy about, if we're talking plot points:

-hiding a piece of technology makes much less sense than destroying it

-sending a piece of technology to the past is more difficult and less secure than sending it to, say, space

-as I understood the climax, the tech was being buried, and hence would only be recoverable by the future because they'd know where to look for it. All that the governments of our time needed to do was dig it up?

-They spoke often of ignorance being a strength, but they never really went into why? Like. There was no big traitor problem, and it seems like they wanted to do something with ensuring closed time loops, but they never really went into it

I've heard some knocking the characters as flat, which I wouldn't say is necessarily unfair, but on the whole I definitely enjoyed it, and I was pretty easily able to suspend my disbelief for the above list. I'd give it a strong 7/10.
