Yeah, there were times I had no idea what was being said. I did wish for subtitles more than once.

I kinda feel it executed its premise almost too well, it felt like just an action movie that happened to have time reversal in it. I know it must have been insane to shoot and make it work, but it looks so smooth it feels like it undersells itself a bit. I gave it a solid 8, but I was hoping for more. It's so much less twisty than I'd hoped. Maybe I just love overly-complicated time travel plots too much to appreciate something simpler.

But then again, I keep thinking about it, and while some things were obvious even from the beginning, I wonder if I was missing something. I need to see it again.
