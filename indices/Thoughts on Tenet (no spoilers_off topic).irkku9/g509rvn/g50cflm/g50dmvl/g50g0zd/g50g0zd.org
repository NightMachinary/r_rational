You actually DO have something pretty close to a guarantee of that. If you buy your tickets same-day online you can check different times and see how full the theater is by what seats on the map are marked as unavailable. If the theater is nearly empty, buy a ticket and go; if it's half-full, hold off and try again on some other mid-afternoon mid-week seating option.

I mean, sure, the theater COULD suddenly fill up with last-minute in-person ticket buyers...but that's not the way to bet. (Anyway, it worked for me.)
