I saw it in a New Jersey AMC theater and it felt pretty safe because /everybody else/ is thinking like you are and not going. They've removed half the seats from the seating chart they make available and the theater is /still/ mostly empty!

So you're sharing a /huge/ well-ventilated room - a room with enough air conditioning to quietly stay cool with 200 people in it - with less than a dozen other people, all of whom are wearing masks nearly all of the time and none of whom are seated directly next to you.
