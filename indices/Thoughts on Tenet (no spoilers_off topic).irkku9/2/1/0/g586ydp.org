Wait so if you shot a person with a "reversed" bullet and it didn't penetrate all the way through... they could have been... born with a bullet inside them? Lived their whole life with a bullet stuck inside their body, until it finally gets sucked out back into a gun a few decades later?

I do enjoy a good movie even if it has a ridiculous plot so long as it's internally self consistent, which is why I find these logical incongruities rather jarring.

As a footnote, just realized the heat-to-cold reversal of the explosion that saved the protagonist also should mean that the internal combustion engine of any car, as well as any explosive based firearm, would fail to operate the instant they were reversed.
