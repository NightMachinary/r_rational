I think it works if you want it to work. For example, for the bullets; they were made some years ago, the protagonist acquired them, they went through the 'twister' at the freeport, shot into the glass, and then they kept travelling backwards until they were melted in the forge where the glass panels were made.

For Andrei, he would plan the room and order the panels, then the panel makers would contact him, bewildered, about the panels coming out of the forge already with bullet holes. Maybe not something he expected when making the order, but not too surprising either. It would let him know that there would be a firefight there.

Sure, none of this is explained in the movie, but that's also part of the enjoyment right? Maybe a bit of a stretch.

Twister is the name of the time reversing machine in my theater subtitles, I didn't catch the dialogue
