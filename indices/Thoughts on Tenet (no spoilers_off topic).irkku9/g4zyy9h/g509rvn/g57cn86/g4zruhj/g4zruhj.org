I only saw it once and will have to see it again to be sure (though I was paying very close attention), but it appeared to me that he actually managed to execute a single-timeline time travel plot brilliantly and without any plot holes.

Can definitely see how the movie may be confusing to people who haven't read a lot of time travel fiction; half of my friend group had some trouble getting it .The character writing was also a bit stilted at times.

Still, I also loved the movie. it didn't assume the watchers were idiots,it had brilliant cinematography and action and I was engaged from start to finish. Definitely recommend it to people in this sub.

Overall, best Bond film I've ever seen.
