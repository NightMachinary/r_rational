My biggest complaint about the movie is how much it revolves around its bland main character. The guy is always given special importance (especially with the reveal at the end) that isn't really justified by anything he does or by his personality.

Also a lot of the time-travel mechanics made no sense, but that's par for the course, and the movie is very enjoyable if you don't think too hard about the rules.
