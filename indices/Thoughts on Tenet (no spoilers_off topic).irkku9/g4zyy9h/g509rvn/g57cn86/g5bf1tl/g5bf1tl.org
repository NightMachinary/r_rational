I think the "bullet holes in the glass before the shooting" thing is probably my least favorite part of the conceit, but the explanation is not that they were manufactured that way, but that there are limits to how far back in time reversed physics actually affects things. So in the case of the window, from the perspective of someone moving forward in time, the cracks just "appear" all at once.

Similarly, if a reversed piece of glass was hit with a normal bullet, then from the perspective of someone going back in time, the glass would suddenly "appear" to have a hole. In theory, anyway.

Like I said, probably my least favorite part of the conceit, because it would be better if things were symmetrical, and is (IIRC, only saw it once) never addressed in the movie.
