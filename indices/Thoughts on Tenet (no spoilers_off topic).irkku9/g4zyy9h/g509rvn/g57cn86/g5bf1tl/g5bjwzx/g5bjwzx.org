I think it gets even crazier if you consider the inertial reference frame of "reversed" objects.

Imagine you shot a thug with a "reversed" bullet and it didn't penetrate all the way through... so they wake up that morning with a bullet already inside them? But after they have breakfast and realise it's their last day on the job, they still have to go to work, confront you and get shot by you, and finally that bullet gets sucked out back into a gun.

Or maybe the bullet must remain spatially relative to the room, in which case they walk into the room that morning, see a bullet floating in mid-air, and somehow transport that bullet into themselves so it can be unfired by your weapon.
