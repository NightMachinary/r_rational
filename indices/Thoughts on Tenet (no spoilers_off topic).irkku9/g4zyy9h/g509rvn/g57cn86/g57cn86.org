I think I'm one of the few people who dislike this movie. I can't wrap my mind around how reversed entities work.

Consider the scene where the protagonist fights his reversed doppelganger, who (for unfathomable reasons) decides to shoot at him thrice with a pistol. He steps into the room, notices the bullet holes and deduces that the gunshots take place in the future. But wait, does that mean the glass was always cracked prior to this, up to the point reversed!Protagonist unpulls the trigger? Does that mean that some years ago a construction crew built the room and installed glass panels with bullet holes already in them?

The whole part about explosions causing hypothermia felt like an asspull.

Dialogue was very hard to make out.

Another thing I didn't get was the time rush and failure condition. You have a big bad that's threatening to stash the keys to a time capsule containing a superweapon that may be used to end the world in future? Why is there a time pressure? You literally have all the time in the world to stop him because 1. You can reverse and revisit the site again at any point in it's past and 2. Even if he did succeed in burying the site/sending the signal, you have the next 200 years to find the keys at your leisure.

I feel like Nolan added complexity for the sake of complexity itself and to me that's never a good thing. I felt similarly disappointed at the end of Interstellar when they went on that spiel about love transcending time.
