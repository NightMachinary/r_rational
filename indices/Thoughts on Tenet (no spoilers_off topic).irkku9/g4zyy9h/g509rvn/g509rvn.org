I love Nolan, and I will watch this, but not in theaters due to covid. I won't go to a theater this year and probably not all of next year either to be honest.

If they had released this digitally day one I would have gladly paid $30-40 to watch it online because I want to support Nolan and the industry but I guess they want to leave that money on the table while they futility try to push back the arrival of the day-one digital simultaneous release. Because theaters know once that happens it's over for probably half their business. When I have the option to just watch it at home opening night I'll almost certainly never go to a theater again except for event movies a couple of times a year, and that's independent of covid.
