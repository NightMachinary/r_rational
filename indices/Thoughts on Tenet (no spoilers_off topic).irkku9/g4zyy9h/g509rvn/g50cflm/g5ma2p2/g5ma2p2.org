Agreed on all points. The theater and film industry are going to have to to reinvent themselves. The price to see a movie in theaters has been inceasing while the comparitive benefits of doing so have been decreasing for a long time. Covid destroying the industries inertia is going to make the effects of those trends hit hard.

I don't know what they're going to do though, $30-$40 dollars for a digital viewing might not be enough for them. That's too much for me to watch it individually but probably not enough for film makers if I watch it with one other person let alone a group. Not to mention if this became common home theaters and larger home group watching would increase. I feel bad for the industry but also 100% expect them to hurt consumers when compensating.
