I saw it in english and felt like it needed subtitles. Several characters had very thick foreign accents and when they spoke quietly against a loud soundtrack I pretty much had to /guess/ what they were saying. The worst character in this regard was Pria - the actor's native language is apparently Gujerati ("the 6th most common language in India") and I missed a /lot/ of her lines.

The fact that I couldn't tell what people were saying substantially detracted from the film experience and made it much more confusing than it needed to be.
