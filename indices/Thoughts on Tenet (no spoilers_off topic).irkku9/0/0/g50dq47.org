Yeah, I would have loved to have watched it with subtitles. I really didn't understand a word of it, and apparently our theatre had turned the bass /down/ from what it was meant to be. I really struggled to follow what was happening half the time. It's annoying as the concept seemed so solid.

(DW I live in a jurisdiction with no covid for 150 days, theatres are fine!)
