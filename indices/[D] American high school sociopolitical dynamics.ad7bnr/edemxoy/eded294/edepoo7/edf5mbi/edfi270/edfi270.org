Watch Bo Burnham's masterpiece Eighth Grade for a brutally honest portrait into teenage school life. It's a year short of high school, so there's less about parties, college applications, standardized tests etc., but the social dynamics are largely similar. The most terrifying part to me was the overwhelming prevalence of social media and smartphones, whicb were just starting to exist when I was in high school.
