The last point is quite interesting i.e. the football player is elected simply from name recognition. I meant 'contest' in a social sense, but since you mention it: I think I understand what a prom is, it's a kind of formal ball room dance? I have heard of homecoming but never understood it, even after skimming the Wikipedia on it. If you can give the gist of it, I'd appreciate it.
