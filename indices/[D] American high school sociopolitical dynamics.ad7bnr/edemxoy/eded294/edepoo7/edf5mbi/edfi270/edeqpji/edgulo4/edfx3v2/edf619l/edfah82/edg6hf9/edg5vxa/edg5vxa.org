That article sounds like stereotypical 70's. As for my own high school experiences, I wasn't really paying attention. I mostly read books instead of interacting with people, and pretty much didn't make any friends or enemies. Well, there was that one kid who kept teasing about making soup out of my pet, but he turned out to be alright. As far as I could tell then, and now from looking back at yearbook pictures, the kids in the honors classes seemed to be overall fairly popular. Also there was that one girl who seemed to lead a pretty cliquey group who was kind of mean to me but later declared it to be some sort of initiation or something that I had passed and then tried to be friends, but I wasn't really interested. I think that might actually have been in middle school. I don't remember noticing any cliques in high school. My school overall was pretty noncompetitive gradeswise, I would say. The majority of my classmates who graduated went to the nearby community college afterwards, which is pretty easy to get into. Anyway, I put absolute minimal effort into popularity at school and still managed to end up pretty well known and not unpopular somehow.
