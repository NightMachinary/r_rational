Fairly hyperbolic if you take it literally . You wouldn't get beaten to the ground daily but might be a little kick at you as you as you walk by going on here and there, subtle enough to seem like an accident. Or a verbal threat. It's more the daily, randomly enforced fear that /it might happen at any time/ that makes it feel subjectively like a daily struggle. So every day you have to be vigilant even though it doesn't happen daily. It's more like a thunderstorm than a sunrise though.
