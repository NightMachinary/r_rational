Interesting. The experiences of yourself, [[/u/vanillafog][u/vanillafog]] and [[/u/EthanCC][u/EthanCC]] seem much more similar to my own. This is consistent with what I've learned from my nieces and friend's kids recently graduated from high school in the US. Regional variation based on economic status is probably a big factor as [[/u/vanillafog][u/vanillafog]] points out, along with Hollywood's incentive to magnify the drama.
