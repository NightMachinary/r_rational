  The whole "struggle of the nerds" stereotyping is archaic at best and never existed at worst.

Attending college after graduating high school used to be an unusual thing. Now, it's the expectation. It's not surprising that being a straight-A student was once considered "lame nerd shit" and now it's pretty normal for someone to get straight A's, especially when you consider the effects of grade inflation as more and more kids have been pushed to enroll in college (even if they're not particularly sure what they want to study).

As recently as [[https://trends.collegeboard.org/education-pays/figures-tables/educational-attainment-over-time-1940-2009][1990, most adults ages 25 to 34 never attended college]] (which reflects the education level of people who graduated high school 1976-1983). Paul Graham (author of the "Why Nerds are Unpopular" essay) would have entered high school in 1979, back when "college track kids" were still a minority (but growing in numbers, eventually becoming the majority 10 years later).

There was some [[https://loving-not-heyting.tumblr.com/post/181527573744/on-smartness-and-nerd-persecution][discourse]] on this subject earlier this week:

  It's worth remembering that Every Context is Different and that Your High School is Not Archetypical (whoever you are).

  In particular, I think the “persecuted contemptible brainiac vs. popular dumb jock” meme is an old one that gets more and more obsolete every year, at least in urban and liberal-suburban America.

  During the days of the Boomers' youth, I gather, it was very real indeed. Adolescent society had a very high premium on conformity, there was a very narrow range of acceptable interests, and being too devoted to academics was a strong sign that you were insufficiently devoted to winning the acceptance of your peers. During my own early-Millennial youth in the ‘90s, it was still at least sort of a thing; the very smartest and highest-achieving kids in my (liberal-suburban) school were in fact outcasts by dint of being too weird, and the valorization of the football team etc. was still a social fact that was to some extent being actively supported by the community and the administration. Looking at high school now, it seems to be true not at all.

  At least to some extent, this probably has to do with the ever-increasing academic pressure on American teenagers.
