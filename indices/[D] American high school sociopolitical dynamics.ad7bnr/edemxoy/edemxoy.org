Everyone's a lot nicer than in the stereotypes. I don't know if I was lucky or if every other school was Mean Girls, but popularity and grades/intelligence were correlated and school sports wasn't nearly as big a deal as in movies. There wasn't any battle between cliques or anything. You have a few people who were at the center of some group, and they tended to like each other.
