skimming the linked article, I don't think it echoes my own (mid-late 2000s) experiences well, though I'm not sure how well my case generalizes elsewhere (I attended an all-male Jesuit college prep school, so e.g. nobody paid attention to clothes, since we all had to abide by the same dress code). Popularity and intelligence (and athleticism and charm and so on) were largely decoupled at the school-wide population level, or perhaps even weakly + associated. Though I guess we didn't have much in way of "global" popularity, either, in that a lot of the social interaction splintered into individual microcosms, where one could garner more or less popularity that would not carryover to other groups. This division was so profound that I recall at graduation observing with a friend that over half the school (~150 / 300 people) was utterly unrecognizable to us, despite having apparently worked alongside us the last four years. Though that may more appropriately reflect our own reclusiveness or obliviousness. These local groups had their own semi-hierarchical social networks, sure, but being, say, the star quarterback only gave one very minor "standing" among e.g. band geeks or robotics nerds or whatever, unless one also chose to cross-train in their interests. There also wasn't much in way of bullying, either -- usually nicer individuals were more popular, and more obnoxious and rude individuals universally shunned (I guess niceness/gregariousness formed the ultimate basis of one's global level of popularity). People in my experience also tended to have a few partially overlapping groups they hung out with, so the networks were loosely connected rather than completely isolated.

ofc, that's not to say that the smartest students were also the most popular, or vice-versa, or that /within/ groups there weren't inverse associations not seen in the broader pop (b/c joint and conditional distributions are diff't things, Berkson's paradox, etc.).

edit: economic status also didn't seem to structure much of the social groups -- my own sampled from across all levels of parental income and class, from the borderline impoverished kids attending on scholarship and work-for-tuition-waiver to children of deca-/centimillionaires. With a few exceptions people in my group didn't care too much about (relative standing wrt) grades, either, or test scores etc.
