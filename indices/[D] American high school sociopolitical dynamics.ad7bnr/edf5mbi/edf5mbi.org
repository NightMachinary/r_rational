Just outta high school, roughly a year and a half now, I still remember what my English teacher said about us students every recess.

Him and other teachers liked watching the inner courtyard of the 2000+ student school every time we were released to lunch or extended passing period from the teacher's lounge 3 stories above us.

According to him, he could instantly pic out the different years each student belonged to by how fast they walked and where they were sitting. Same friend groups sat in the same place save for the elevated very center of the courtyard which was passed between the most popular groups of each year.

Territorial disputes were settled in a mainly stereotypical British manner. A frown, force of numbers, and tradition (most sitting in the same location for all 4 years) determined who would move.

Inter-year friendships outside clubs or sports were rare according to my teacher as well as my own personal experience.

At least in my school, there was an extreme segregation between AP (advanced) students and regular class students. Not only social segregation but physical. AP classrooms were often on upper floors and on one end of a building and regular classrooms were on the other end. Again, outside of clubs and sports, there were rarely any interaction at all between these halves of the student body. Even then, clubs and surprisingly sports were super majority composed of more academically inclined students.

And I'm not going to lie, there was a prevalent undercurrent throughout school culture of disdain and superiority of AP students to regular students. As this divide also appeared along racial lines, racism, while not overt, coastal California is way to progressive for that, underlined every interaction between the two groups. Im not going to name them but you can probably guess the composition of the two bodies.

Outside this larger academic divide between classes, there is no "popularity contests" as they're mostly won in middle school (largely the same student body from elementary to middle to high school). High school battleground is mainly forged along GPA differences and every 0.01 counted.

Especially at the very top, everyone in the top 20 knew where other people stood within the same year and their chances of college.

This could most evidently seen in senior year where all pretenses of "learning" was dropped and students were either preening with applied and then accepted colleges (oh the social humiliation of those who thought they were guaranteed and told everyone but waitlisted/rejected).

In fact, if you want a glimpse into the minds/stress of academic high school seniors, take a look at the new tab on [[/r/ApplyingToCollege]]. You have everything, from memes to serious discussion.

This reality is obviously not shown in Hollywood television as you cant really magnify the interpersonal drama of late teenagers buried in paper
