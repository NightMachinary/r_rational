There was definitely a transition at some point, perhaps in the 1990-2010 period, when being a nerd would get you beaten up.

I think things change (and things continue to change, at different paces depending on the location) happened more or less when the prospect of getting "beat up" at a school stops being something that realistically happens. When I went to school you had to watch yourself physically, 10 years later my siblings at the same school with many of the same teachers even were /shocked/ that my experiences ever happened.

I bet Hollywood writers primarily depict even earlier periods, the ones they grew up in (like 1960-1990) so it would have been even worse back then.

Hint: if being gay or foreign or otherwise different wouldn't get you beaten up every day of your life, you probably didn't go to a school where the nerd / jock / cheerleader "popularity" dynamic existed. As soon as 1) being "different" is celebrated rather than punished and 2) physical violence comes off the table as a way to "win" a social interaction a tipping point occurs, and these are related phenomenon.
