When I read the linked article, two quotes popped out at me.

#+begin_quote
  "The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids. But there is no external pressure to do this well."

This is not true today. In many cases, a school can be punished for having low standardized test scores by having its funding reduced or being closed altogether. Some schools give teachers pay raises depending on how much their students improve under their tutelage.

  "I didn't realize that the reason we nerds didn't fit in was that in some ways we were a step ahead. We were already thinking about the kind of things that matter in the real world, instead of spending all our time playing an exacting but mostly pointless game like the others."

I think almost every high schooler I've ever met is a "nerd" in this way. They're already thinking about things that matter outside of high school. They also play the game of popularity, but they don't spend nearly as much time or energy on it.

Maybe this is why my high school experience was so different from the one described in the article. Our school was trying to educate us, and we were trying to get an education. To some degree, we did have cliques - there were the nerds, the athletes, the band geeks, and so on. People with similar interests tended to stick together. However, there wasn't much of a hierarchy: the cheerleaders didn't lord their higher social status over the rest of the student body, and the nerds weren't revered either.

That being said, America is a big place, and your high school experience can vary wildly depending on the kind of school you went to. For example, I never had to worry about gang violence, but many kids did. My neighbors didn't need to set up a suicide watch because too many teens were ending their own lives, but people in another city did. Maybe, somewhere, there still are high schools where popularity contests dominate.
