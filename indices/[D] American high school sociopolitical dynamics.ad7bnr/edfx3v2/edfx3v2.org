The article is pretty inaccurate now. Popularity isn't hugely a thing, neither are school sports. Really students are divided by "care" and "not care". Either you take all the ap classes, try your best on tests, do random clubs because they look good for college and it's a way to be with your friends for longer during the day, or you take regular classes and just do whatever. Being smart makes you more popular if your in the first group, and dosen't affect you in the second. Sports are like clubs: unless your in them, you don't really care about them. High school is mostly full of hormonal teenagers who don't really have anything to do besides school, and if their lucky, a major interest or hobby. Often the type of people who don't care about school simply have nothing that particularly interests them or motivates them in life. [[/u/LiminalSouthpaw]] comment is pretty accurate

EDIT: I would also like to note that this changes pretty heavily based on location. The above is what the suburbs are like, where school is pretty much your entire life, as there's not really public transportation for kids to get around and do stuff. In cities, everyone from school is so spread out from each other, and it's such a big school that no one talks to school friends outside of school, and classmates often change year to year or class to class.
