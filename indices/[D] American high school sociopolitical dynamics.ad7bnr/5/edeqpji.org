The thing is, there are at least 22,000 high schools in the US. Most of these will be public high schools, but many are private, vocational, agricultural, or some other variation.

With 22k schools in 22k different locations, every single school will have its own unique flavor that has a lot to do with the specifics of the surrounding community. While there are some federal standards, each state, and each town has a lot of say in how high schools are organized and operated.

The experience of a student at an inner city school in Boston will be very different from the experience of a student at an inner city school in Flint. Their experience will be different from the experience of a student at a prestigious private catholic institution.

Furthermore, the experience of students change from year to year and from cohort to cohort. For instance, the year ahead of mine in high school had a stronger reputation for partying and traditional high school dramatics, while my year had a more studious reputation. Popular students in my year were also quite high-achieving in grades and athletics.

If you want more useful information, then I believe you will need to be more specific in your query.
