Homecoming is a tradition that's kind of vestigial these days but still is pretty big at some colleges and small town high schools. The idea is that alumni all come back for that weekend and there's a football game and parades and stuff to celebrate. What's relevant most of the time is that there is a school dance that is the biggest social event of the fall. Everybody dresses up (although it is less formal than prom) and many a young man dreams of asking his crush to dance or go to the dance together as a prelude to dating. There is also a Homecoming Court or Homecoming Royalty elected. Usually a King and Queen, maybe some more. They basically get like a tiara or something and maybe they flip the coin before the homecoming game.

Opposite Homecoming is the Prom, which is the major social event of the spring, as well as the year or even your time in high school. It is black-tie formal, so the boys rent tuxes and the girls basically do a practice run of the wedding dress purchase process. It is sometimes restricted only to seniors and their dates, or sometimes juniors, seniors, and their dates. There is more pressure to have a date and to slow-dance and things than at homecoming which is more of a party. Popular kids or well-known couples often publicly ask each other to prom in elaborate ways, like how some people do stunts when proposing. These are always loudly applauded and there is a bunch of pressure to say yes. Traditionally senior prom would be the night when high school sweethearts have sex for the first time. After prom parties are also a big deal. Prom King and Prom Queen are socially more prestigious than homecoming royalty, but are basically the same deal with even less actual significance.
