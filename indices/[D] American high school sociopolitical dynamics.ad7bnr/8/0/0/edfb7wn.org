probably around that range for most things. I don't even think we elected any student government, they just let whoever wanted to have it on their college applications be in charge of homecoming decorations or whatever it was they did. I think the only reason anyone voted on things at all was because they made us do it in homeroom. But nobody would vote for you unless you had a bloc of like 100 people all lined up ready to go. Superlatives were mostly down to who the journalism club kids knew.
