How good was your voter turnout for elections at your school?

I had ~2000 back at my high school but less than 10% actually voted. And that was for widely publicized council positions.

A couple of my friends got into the yearbook by getting us together along with some outside friends of friends as a voting block to put most of us into the yearbook.

We mainly did it as a joke, thinking it wouldnt work, but evidently it did.

American democracy at work.
