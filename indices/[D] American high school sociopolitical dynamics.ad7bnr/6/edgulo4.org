I think Graham is making it more complicated than it is. In cultures that haven't managed to quell interpersonal violence (such as some American high schools in the 1980-2010s) people would solve social problems through violence. Violence can actually become a way to /gain/ (rather than lose) status. Physically weak people and people who were raised or have a natural disposition towards not being violent or fighting back can become at a social disadvantage. Targets for violence are often people who are "weird" (slightly autistic, slightly adhd, gay, foreign, etc). Therefore being different, unathletic, or pacifist makes you a social outcast.

When I was in middle school I wad regularly harassed (punched, kicked, tripped, glasses stolen, verbally threatened, clothes stolen in gym, rocks and small objects thrown, and so on) by two boys for being, foreign, socially inept, and generally unwilling to fight. One day I hit a third boy (not one of the bullies) for saying something unkind about my mother (in retrospect it was actually a misunderstanding, I had recently immigrated from a culture where it was an unthinkable insult while the the offending boy intended it as light teasing) and noticed that other people began talking about what I did in a sort of a praising fashion. This is why I say that violence - even when disproportionate and culturally inappropriate - can actually raise social status, paradoxically.

Also, over time I became friends with a group of more accepting boys (in retrospect, i think they were less racist because they all happened to be black or Hispanic) and some of them were more athletic and less averse to violence than I was and would defend me against the people who would try to fight me. I think my experience was kind of the decline of bullying in schools. I never had the really bad stuff (stuck in the toilet, etc) done.

I think if there's any extent to which intelligence can be a disadvantage in this environment, it's probably because the cultural correlates to intelligence are linked to the cultural correlates of nonviolence. I was not really physically weaker than the boys who bullied me, but I had glasses which put me at a /huge/ disadvantage in fighting and unable to retaliate and "stand up for myself". I used to imagine that one day they'd very publicly throw the first punch and then I'd really show them, but it would often be a subtle kick or something made to look like an accident done while a teacher was watching, or a veiled threat made in private - there was a social component to the violence which made it something more than just "who is stronger" . I imagine people who weren't physically able to fight got it even worse.
