Thank you for your perspective. I'm sorry you had to go through the initial rough patch in school.

Your comment on violence being present or absent as part of the culture makes a lot of sense in hindsight. I was raised to be very pacifist and I am psychologically incapable of fighting to defend myself. It wasn't an issue for me, since my home culture is very pacifist and I was tall and well built for my age. But I would have had a rough time in certain American schools, I imagine.

BTW, insulting one's mother is unthinkable in my culture too. When I first landed in the US, I was appalled by a certain swear word relating to ones's mother which is thrown around casually.
