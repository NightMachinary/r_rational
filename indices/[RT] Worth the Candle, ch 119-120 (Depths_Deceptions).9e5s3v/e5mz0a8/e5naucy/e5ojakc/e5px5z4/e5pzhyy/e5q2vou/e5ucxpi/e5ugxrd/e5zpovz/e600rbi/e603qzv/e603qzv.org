ah, yeah, i actually didn't think too much on La Grande Mort, just assuming a sort of pun meaning. now that i have, i don't think it's actually usable here as a poor taste joke meaning "actual death" or "physical death" after a "petite mort".

one meaning would be "the great death" of enlightenment, or ego-death. i'm thinking successfully soul-fucking the locus might get him closer to that state, and actually be more meaningful.

another would be "great death" as in some mass extinction event. so maybe when they conquer hell and eradicate the demons and devils. i'd rather call that straight up "genocide". perhaps they survive some exclusion zone becoming unexclusioned or other mass casualty event the DM sets up.
