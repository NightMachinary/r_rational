  so do you mean subtext as in the meaning in worth the candle, as an achievement that joon unlocked?

I'm talking about the subtext of "Le Grande Mort". It's clearly a reference to "La Petite Mort", but /what/ it's saying is incredibly unclear. Is it just a pun of sorts? Is it trying to imply that the petite mort and grande mort are linked/causal?
