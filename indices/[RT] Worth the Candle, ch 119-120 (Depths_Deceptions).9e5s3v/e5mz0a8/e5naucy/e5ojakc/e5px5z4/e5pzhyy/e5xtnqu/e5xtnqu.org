omg yall suck at explaining

"Le petite mort" means "little death", is french euphemism for orgasm, /and, also important to explain/, when he first gave Fenn an orgasm the DM hit him with an in game achievement called "la petite mort", making him highly uncomfortable.

So now, it would make him even madder for the dm to write "the big death".
