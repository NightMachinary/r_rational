Blegh, sorry about the delay on these. I found them particularly hard to write, mostly because of the emotional load. /Hopefully/ things will be a little faster going forward, but I don't like making promises, so I won't.

The worldbuilding doc is still being written, in case you were curious about that; the current outline I'm filling in has sections for Magic (~26 varieties), History (pre-Imperial, three empires, two inter-imperiums), Geography, Races (~140), and Cosmology. If you have anything else you think is must-include, let me know (the big one, Gods, is probably going to be written and then left out until/unless they appear in the story, since I don't want spoilers for things that haven't appeared in the text).
