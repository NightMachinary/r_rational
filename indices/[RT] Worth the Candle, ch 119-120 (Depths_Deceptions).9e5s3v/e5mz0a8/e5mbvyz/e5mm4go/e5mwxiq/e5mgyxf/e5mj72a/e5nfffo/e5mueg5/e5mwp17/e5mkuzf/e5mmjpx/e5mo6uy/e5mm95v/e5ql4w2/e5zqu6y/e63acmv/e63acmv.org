Depends on your frame of reference, I suppose. From the point of view of Earth, I think he is dead. However, he didn't necessarily die in a way that looks like suicide. Arthur, for example, got hit by a truck. That being said, apparent suicide would fit into his personal narrative on Earth so it's possible.

Either way, he's obviously still alive on Aerb so from a larger frame of reference he's not dead so it can't be effectively suicide.
