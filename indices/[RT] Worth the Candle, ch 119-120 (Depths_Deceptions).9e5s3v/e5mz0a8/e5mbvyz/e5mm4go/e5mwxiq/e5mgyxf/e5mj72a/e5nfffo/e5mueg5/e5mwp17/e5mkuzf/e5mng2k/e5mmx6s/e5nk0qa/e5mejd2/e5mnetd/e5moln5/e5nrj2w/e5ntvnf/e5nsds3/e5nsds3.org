I'm not great at literary critic, but here's my take on it:

When you only use the female love interest's death to get at the main character, you're reducing her final moments to a plot device. That is pretty demeaning to her character, kinda like the "use me for spare parts" thing Fenn's letter suggested.

Often a character's death can have meaning to them (besides being an endpoint); like someone consciously choosing to sacrifice their life for someone else, or jumping off a cliff rather than face trial. Having a character just /killed/ takes that agency away from them and turns them into a victim.
