That I can recall there don't seem to be many permanent immunities available in the setting. Valencia has a fair number thanks to what she is, but then that also has social drawbacks and probably isn't duplicable by others.

That seems to leave things that can be done with forms of magic we don't understand well yet, things that can be done with entads that are theoretically accessible by the party, and temporary immunities used alongside methods of knowing when to use them ahead of time.
