He's still being obnoxious.

There's a difference between "representation and gender balance in media as a whole matter" and "one doesn't actually have to pick the same gender for this character archetype every time for whatever convoluted reasons they think they have". Arthur is equating those and then saying Tiff is being inconsistent, then declares that he "won the argument".

Tiff elaborates later,

#+begin_quote
  “The whole argument is about stories and their impacts in aggregate, ” said Tiff. “Set aside your pet theories on causes for a second, if ninety percent of protagonists are male, and ninety percent of love interests are female, and writers kill off love interests half the time, then that's -- I don't know, some math, but you'd run into it a lot of the time, and most of what a girl sees growing up is women having horrible things happen to them as a way of motivating the main character or increasing the stakes. Which sucks.”

Then Arthur just brushes this objection off,

#+begin_quote
  Arthur shrugged. “Okay?” he asked. “I never said that it didn't suck.”
#+end_quote

Honestly I'm not sure what Arthur's thesis statement in this argument is (or how he thinks he "won") but he doesn't really seem to be listening to Tiff.

If he really had already understood how much it sucked, he wouldn't have tried to trap Tiff in an inconsistency like he did, because he would have understood what she was trying to say.
