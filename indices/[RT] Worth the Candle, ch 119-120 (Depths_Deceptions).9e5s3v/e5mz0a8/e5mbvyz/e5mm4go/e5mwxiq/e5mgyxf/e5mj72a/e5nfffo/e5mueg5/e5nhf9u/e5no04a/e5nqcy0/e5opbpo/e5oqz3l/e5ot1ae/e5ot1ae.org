It seems like the game is designed to discourage grinding and easy munchkinry -- which, well, why wouldn't it be? If you can design 140 species and thousands of years of history on the fly, generating rock-solid game mechanics should be easy.

So it seems like they just need to play the game carefully and as well as they can, with munchkinry in mind but mostly acting like rational people in a normal world. They'll probably only use the Sacrifice when absolutely necessary, and do their best to guess what skills will be most useful. They won't actually solve the Woodworking 100 Problem.
