Well, there's one path... We know that Fel Seed is so invincible he can't even be /theoretically/ beaten by anyone other than Joon.

Joon knows Fel Seed's power, and per chapter 114, Joon's defining trait is that he can use excluded magic outside of an exclusion zone. It's probably really^{really^{really}} evil to use so that makes them a non-option, but Joon has a direct line to literal invulnerability if he really wants it.
