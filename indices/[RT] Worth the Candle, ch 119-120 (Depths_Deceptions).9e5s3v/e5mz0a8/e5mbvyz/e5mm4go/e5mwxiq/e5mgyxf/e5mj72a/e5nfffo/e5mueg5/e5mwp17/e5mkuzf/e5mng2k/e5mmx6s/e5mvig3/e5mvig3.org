On the contrary, I think this is literally the only way the story could have gone and still have Fenn come back to life. If they just acted like they could resurrect her and then went and did it, it would become all but impossible to actually kill any other protagonist. We would just expect them to come back.

But if they go through two whole chapters of emotional turmoil and then suddenly bring her back somehow, it's much more of a plot twist and we won't automatically expect it in the future.

Dunno if they actually will, but I would say these two chapters increase the chance rather than decrease it.
