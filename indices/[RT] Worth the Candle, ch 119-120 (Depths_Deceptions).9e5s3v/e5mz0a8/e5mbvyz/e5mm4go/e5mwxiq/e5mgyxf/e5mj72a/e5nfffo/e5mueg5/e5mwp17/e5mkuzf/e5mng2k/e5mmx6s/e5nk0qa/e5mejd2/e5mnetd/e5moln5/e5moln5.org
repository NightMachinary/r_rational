man, I thought Arthur's argument was super-obnoxious. Tiff (I think) is trying to say that authors need to get less attached to gender roles so they can start writing more balanced stories. And Arthur is like "lol you're saying gender doesn't matter so the fridge trope doesn't matter".

Like geez dude, no wonder Tiff lost interest in him. (I mean, it's not totally clear if this is how Arthur actually felt since it's a dream, but I assume it's based in reality.)
