  As I said, this only goes if the DM didn't intentionally kill specifically to mess with Juniper.

Very debatable!

However, I was just trying to force the metaphor. Fenn's not the typical woman stuffed in a fridge, but her death here does evoke the trope, at least in a meta way. The DM could definitely have nudged it so she lived, but she died, with Joon aware of the DM's omission (and implicitly aware of /why/ it was her who died, i.e. love interest, just broke up).
