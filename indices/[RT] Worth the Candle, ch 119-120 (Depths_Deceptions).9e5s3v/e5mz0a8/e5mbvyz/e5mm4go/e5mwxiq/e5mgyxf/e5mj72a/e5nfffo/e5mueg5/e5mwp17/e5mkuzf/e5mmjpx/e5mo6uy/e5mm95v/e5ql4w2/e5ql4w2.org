The connection between death and the Game World is something that I noticed way back during his conversation with the DM. I think it's the other way around though; I suspect Arthur died in the real world because he took the DM's offer. Similarly, I don't think Joon committed suicide, but he is probably dead in the real world due to taking the offer.
