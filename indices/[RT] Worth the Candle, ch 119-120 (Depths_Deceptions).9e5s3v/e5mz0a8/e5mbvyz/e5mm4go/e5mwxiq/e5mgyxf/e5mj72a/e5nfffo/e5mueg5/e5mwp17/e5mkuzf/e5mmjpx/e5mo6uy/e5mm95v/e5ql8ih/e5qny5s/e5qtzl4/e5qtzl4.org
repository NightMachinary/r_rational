When he meets the DM and sees the recording of the initial offer:

  “I'll do it,” I said. “Can I ... what happens to me, when I leave Earth? I'd like to leave a note or something.” /If I was really here, was Earth even real?/ “I don't want to hurt anyone.”

  “[REDACTED],” he replied.

  “There were parts of that you left out,” I said, once I'd finished reliving the memory. “Do my parents think that I'm dead?”

  “I'm worried about potential spoilers,” replied the Dungeon Master.

Then later:

#+begin_quote
  “Tell me whether he's real,” I said. “No, tell me /how/ he's real, how that's even possible, because he died nine months before I came here, and we didn't have this technology then.”

  “He's real,” said the Dungeon Master. “I know how much he meant to you. I'm not going to say how that's possible, but you can draw your own conclusions, if you decide that I'm not lying. And he's out there, somewhere on Aerb or one of the other planes. He spent most of his life on Aerb, he's not going to be how you remembered him -- you know that, that's not news -- but the Arthur that came to Aerb wasn't just Arthur as you remembered him. He's the real deal, Arthur as he actually existed.”
#+end_quote

To me, this seems strongly like the DM is the cause of Arthur dying. Joon even explicitly calls it out when he asks if his parents think that he's dead, and that would explain why everyone thought Arthur was dead when he got transported to Aerb.
