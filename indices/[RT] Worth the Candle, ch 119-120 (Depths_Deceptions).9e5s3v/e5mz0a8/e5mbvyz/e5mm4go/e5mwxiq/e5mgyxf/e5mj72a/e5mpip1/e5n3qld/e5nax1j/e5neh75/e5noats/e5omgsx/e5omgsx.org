  You know what didn't work? Trying to get books that hadn't existed when I left Earth. I thought it was definitely within the Dungeon Master's power to create a copy of /The Winds of Winter/ or /The Doors of Stone/, but the backpack gave me back a note that said it couldn't or wouldn't. That also extended to technical books from after 2017.
