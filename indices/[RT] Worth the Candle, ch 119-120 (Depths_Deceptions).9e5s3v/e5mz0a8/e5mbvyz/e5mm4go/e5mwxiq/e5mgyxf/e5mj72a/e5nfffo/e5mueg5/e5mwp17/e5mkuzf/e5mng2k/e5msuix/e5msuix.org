Joon wouldn't do it because of various reasons, primarily because he feels it would feel like erasing her memory from his life. Or some similar form of disrespect, to erase feeling bad about her being gone. He does mention that Amaryllis might do so, but I kind of doubt that she would for the same reason Joon doesn't, although she might consider it if they didn't have the time chamber and needed to deal with something urgent without being crippled by grief.
