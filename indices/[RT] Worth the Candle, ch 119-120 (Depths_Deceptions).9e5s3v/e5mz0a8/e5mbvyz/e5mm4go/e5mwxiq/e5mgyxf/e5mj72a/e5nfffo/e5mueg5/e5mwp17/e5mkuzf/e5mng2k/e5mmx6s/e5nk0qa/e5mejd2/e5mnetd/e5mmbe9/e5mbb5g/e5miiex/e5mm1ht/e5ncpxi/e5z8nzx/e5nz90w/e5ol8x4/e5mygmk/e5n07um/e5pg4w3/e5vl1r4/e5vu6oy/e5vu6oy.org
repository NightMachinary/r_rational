I hope not. It'd be a little too convenient for Joon. He feels bad for going out with Tiff without even telling Arthur but he gets to feel better about it after the fact because it turns out Arthur was actually a bad guy all around. It especially feels weird to me since Arthur seems to have been based on a real person in real life, and his actions with Bethel are purely hypothetical.
