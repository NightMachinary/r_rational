This was definitely emotionally heavy. Having lost someone relatively recently I could identify with a lot of Juniper's thoughts and it wasn't pleasant. It was definitely worth reading though. Thank you.

Regarding the world building doc, I think exclusions and events related to them are a must-include. And Athenaea, though I guess those could be considered part of the magic section. I'd also enjoy entries for the most important/impressive Entads. And maybe something about cultures separate from races, what with the more numerous ones having multiple disparate nations, not to mention the existence of multi-racial cultures.

Edit: Entads, not enters.
