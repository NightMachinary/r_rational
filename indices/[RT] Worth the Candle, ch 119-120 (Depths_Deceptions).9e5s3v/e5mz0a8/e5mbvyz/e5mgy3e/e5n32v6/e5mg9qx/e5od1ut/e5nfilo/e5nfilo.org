Perhaps obviously, I think the main criteria for what's in the doc should be things that you already know about and things you're interested in writing.

But in terms of this game /I'd/ like to see - which is admittedly somewhat different from what's a "must-include" - most of it relates back to the people of the world. Who lives where, what the cultural quirks and values of different groups looks like, where and why the alliances and tensions between people lie, who's producing what and who are they trading it with, how the power structures and politics are set up, the vibes of different cities, etc. Etc.

As a general rule I personally find, say, the effects of a magic system on the society and the setting as interesting if not more than the exact rules of the system.
