If Fenn didn't get killed, then there would have been a little suspicion on Joon's behalf, but nothing a devil couldn't manipulate her way out of. (Especially if Val's plan was to swoop in as a romantic partner, which I still think is the case regardless of what she said to Mary.)

It's just that Fenn's death knocked the whole plan off the rails, so now that it's impossible the plan just looks stupid in retrospect.
