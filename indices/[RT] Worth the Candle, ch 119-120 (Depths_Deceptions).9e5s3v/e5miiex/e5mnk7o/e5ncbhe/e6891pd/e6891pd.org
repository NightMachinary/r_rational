Unless we concede that she was murdered by DM, Fenn is not an example of this trope.

Fridging is an enemy killing a love interest with the express purpose of hurting the protagonist. The demaning part comes in the loss of agency the woman suffers, she is a plot point and motivation, killed not for /who/ she is but /what/ she is to the MC.

In this case Fenn died in combat as a part of the party where everyone was in danger.

As I said, this only goes if the DM didn't intentionally kill /specifically/ to mess with Juniper.
