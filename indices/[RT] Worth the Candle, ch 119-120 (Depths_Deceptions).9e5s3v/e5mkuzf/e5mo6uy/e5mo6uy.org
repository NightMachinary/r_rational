Yeah, I also noticed that Arthur went to Aerb after apparently dying, but Joon was apparently just sitting in class. I've always wondered if there was more to it, like that Joon committed suicide (but doesn't remember it, maybe because he's built using a brain snapshot from a few hours before).

And yes, I'm pretty sure Joon mentioned considering suicide or trying to kill himself in an earlier chapter, but I don't remember where.
