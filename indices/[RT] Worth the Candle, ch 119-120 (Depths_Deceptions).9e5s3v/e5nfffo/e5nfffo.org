Trying to figure out what's going on with Valencia is really interesting.

On the one hand, Valencia deciding to break Joon and Fenn up because she can see all the flaws in their relationship is very reasonable. It's a perfect instantiation of what we know about how devils see the world, and it's subtle enough to be plausible.

On the other hand, everyone in-universe seems to have so much respect for the ability of devils to manipulate people, that it seems really hard to believe that Valencia didn't know Joon would be super suspicious of her therapy breaking him and Fenn up, even before Fenn's death. I think there's still a real possibility that we haven't gotten the full story.

(Also, Joon burning Wisdom and /actually acting like a wise person as a result/, at least for a few paragraphs, was wonderful from both a narrative and emotional perspective. Forgiving Valencia had a biggest emotional impact of the update, at least for me.)
