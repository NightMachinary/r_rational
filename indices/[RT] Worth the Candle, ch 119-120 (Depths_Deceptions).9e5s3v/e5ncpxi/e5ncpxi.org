I have a new working theory for how Juniper got to Aerb and it's all because of this one line in chapter 120

#+begin_quote
  only if you wrote them like I did, you called them suicide notes instead.
#+end_quote

I hypothesize that the last day Juniper experienced on Earth before coming to Aerb, Juniper chose to commit suicide for some reason and was put into cryonic preservation.

The part that makes me suspect this possibility is a throwaway line all the way back in chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  Five seconds ago, I had been passing notes in fifth period English.
#+end_quote

Perfectly innocuous, right? What teenager hasn't passed notes to their friends in class? Except...what friend? Juniper talked about how all of his relationships were wrecked or drifted apart after Arthur's death and there were no mention of him making up with his old friends or making new ones. Only Reimer and Tom was still in the DM group at that point and I'm not sure they were getting along well enough to be passing notes. I speculate that he was actually passing notes with someone who was trying to help him or talk about Arthur (could be Tiff or someone else) and his memories cut out right before he reads or writes something that causes a fight or something awful at his school. So he then chooses to die later that day and is frozen with his memories of his suicide (and its cause) erased or forgotten.

Another weaker supporting point for this theory is how he never explicitly thinks about just exactly /what/ he was doing or seeing in fifth period English. Every time Juniper thinks about how he got to Aerb, it's always how he could possibly suddenly transition from everyday life to Aerb (or the meeting with the DM in chapter 79). But there's no review of the classroom memory for any clues about his impending fate or any flashback to the scene itself of when he transitions (nor does he ever talk about it with his party) and I can't help but think it's a small clue about what is missing from the 'story'/memory.
