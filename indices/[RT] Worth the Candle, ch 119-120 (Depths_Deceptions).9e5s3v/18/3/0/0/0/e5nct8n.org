I'm curious what pushed Pallida to pledge her service to Joon. The dissolution of her party? Juniper's display of raw emotion at Fenn's death? Some other trigger, like the demonstration of advanced soul magic ("sacred power of my eternal soul" - wonder how the renacim and soul mages are historically related)?
