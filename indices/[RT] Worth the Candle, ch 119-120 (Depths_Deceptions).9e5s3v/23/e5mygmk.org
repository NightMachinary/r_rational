Somehow I think people should have called out Joon harder for his melodramatic stupidity in the end (“You look at me with a devil behind your eyes again and I'll never speak to you again.”). His melodramatic stupidity towards pink-haired lady was more forgivable, since still in shock.

Otherwise, awesome chapters.

I was, and still am, skeptical of the timing of Fenn's death immediately after the breakup, because I hate that trope ("oh, relationship becomes difficult to write? just kill it off"). But the trope is more bearable due to its in-universe discussion and the Narrative being part of the world.
