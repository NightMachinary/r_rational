Sorry, I explained myself badly.

So, there is a trope where character X moves into a position that makes the story hard to write, and lazy/coward authors just kill off character X.

Imagine that Fenn does not die; imagining the group dynamics afterwards is not easy, and probably not easy to write. Now, it is something that we're not gonna see. In other words, her death cheapens the breakup and robs us of seeing how they struggle to have a working relationship, how Joon does or does not move on, and the same for Fenn.

That stinks. It stinks somewhat less due to the fact that the story talks explicitly about the timing.
