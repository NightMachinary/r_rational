I'm gonna shelf the million things I want to say on the topic of the /shitfest/ and just gonna mention this:

In a tabletop RPG, I usually see 3 phases: "the honeymoon", where everyone starts with a clean bill. No desperation, no pressing issues, just trying things out.

Then you have the "divination blocking phase", because that's usually when you start needing it. You start making ripples and should start to paying attention to more than the quest summary unless you want to get backstabbed through a portal.

Finally, you have the "everything gets political" phase, where thing start getting so tangled and you become such major player on the grand scale of things, you can't just solve the problems your have now by punching a few mountains. You stop deciding things about your character, and instead start deciding things for whole countries at a time.

What I'm trying to say is, I feel like Joon and the party are getting to the second phase. And so far weird unexpected magical shit have been the bane of their existence (gold magic, soul manipulation, illusion, soul poison, etc). They /really/ need to start thinking immunities instead of contingencies IMO.
