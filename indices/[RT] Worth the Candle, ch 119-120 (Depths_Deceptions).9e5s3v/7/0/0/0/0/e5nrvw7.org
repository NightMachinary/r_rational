Joon also had a gestalt skill outside of its exclusion zone (Deception see chapter 64) , though he couldn't keep it. This is second instance of some Joon/exclusion-zone weirdness going on, and potentially worth investigating, though I think saying he can flat out ignore exclusions is probably jumping to conclusions.
