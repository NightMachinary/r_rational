Yes, there is that. From the point of view of a player, I don't know how I would go about solving this. Skills and magic take years to train for anyone else so the higher ranks are clouded in mystery, even more considering the game interaction with them. The party develops quickly but they have hard caps on skill levels due to stats and stats due to level. Grinding is dangerous, and plot can just suddenly happen. Then there are the magic items that are rare as hell, have rules on who can use them and can be compromised.

I keep waiting for Juniper to just unlock something that he can actually grind and make some hard progress. But who knows, maybe Raven is exactly what they need. Someone that was based on a old player, knew Uther and may have extra insight on the game layer.
