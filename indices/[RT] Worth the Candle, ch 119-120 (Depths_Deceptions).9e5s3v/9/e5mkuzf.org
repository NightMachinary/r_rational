  ... only if you wrote them like I did, you called them suicide notes instead.

This seems pretty significant. June wrote suicide notes. Before coming to Aerb. Where the only other person to go there apparently died before doing so.

June's struggle with Fenn's death, and the way he lashed out at his party, was both hard to read and really well done. I feel like the implication made by the above casts a lot of his actions in a new light.

Was there any hint of suicide earlier on?
