  I've always wondered if there was more to it, like that Joon committed suicide (but doesn't remember it, maybe because he's built using a brain snapshot from a few hours before).

If that's the case, then if Joon had refused to take the DM's offer and go to Aerb he probably would have just... stopped existing, since on Earth he was already dead.
