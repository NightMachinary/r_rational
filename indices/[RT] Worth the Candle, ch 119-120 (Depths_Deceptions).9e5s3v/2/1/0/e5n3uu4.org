The point of fantasy writing isn't the exact content, but how it makes you feel. The dream makes you feel like you're listening to a sensible discussion, which is what Joon would feel like in the dream, so it fulfils its purpose. A more "realistic" dream wouldn't make you feel like joon felt, and therefore would fail at its purpose.

It's kind of like how all speech in novels is heavily stylized-- it's unrealistic, but without body language and shared context, it does a better job of conveying what actually happens than actually including all the stuttering and stumbling and inspecificity even high-charisma people do.
