Yet another example of Arthur having shitty views of the opposite gender; he's casually ok with women being marginalized.

/“I haven't actually agreed that there is a problem,” said Arthur. “And that's not ground I'm willing to cede at this time.”/

I think Arthur had a lot of bad tendencies that young males have on Earth, and then Aerb turned it plus narcissism up to 13. I think we're going to find him alive somewhere, doing something incredibly shitty to women.
