That's the tricky part of Valencia. If you lived your whole life getting instant mastery-level insight of physics, for instance, even when you shut it off you're going to be pretty good. Checking she isn't using a soul to help just shows she isn't making up new lies or mega-analyzing new situations.

This is part of why Juniper was wise to insist on a total blackout of her looking at him with those skills. Hard, falsifiable rules are how you build trust with socially challenged people (which this is, I mean, plusses and minuses to it, but not being able to be sued is a legal problem too - who would do business with someone like that? - invulnerability isn't so great for trust).
