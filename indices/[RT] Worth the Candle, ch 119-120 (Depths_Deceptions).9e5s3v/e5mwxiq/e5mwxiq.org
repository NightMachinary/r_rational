Goddamn, Valencia makes it so freakin' difficult to parse what's truth and what's lies even when she's not using any devils. This chapter she told Amaryllis she doesn't love Joon, despite that little conversation she had with him back in chapter 77-

  “Too easy to see the paths in front of me, too hard to know which one to go down,” said Val. “None of the parts and pieces help me make sense of who I am or what I feel.” She looked up at me. “I love you,” she said. “I know that you don't love me back yet, and Amaryllis says that's just misplaced attachment, something that I'm going to have to find a way to get over, but she has her own issues with you, so I don't know how good her advice is.”

So now I have no idea if Valencia is simply lying to Amaryllis, or if she's lying to /herself,/ or if she's actually just grown past her fixation on Juniper.

Also, absolutely fantastic work by the author here. I was so caught up in the flow of emotion these last two chapters that I was actually getting frustrated that Juniper wasn't lashing out and hurting someone. I was emotionally primed for violence just from the specter of grief I got following Juniper's thoughts, so his own display of self-control in his conversation with Valencia was all the more impressive given how much more powerful his own desire to pass off some of his pain to others must have been.
