None of the characters seem to understand the actual problem with the women in refrigerator trope - Why it is such a hated trope. Which.. okay, that actually fits most of their characterizations, but would Tiff not have hit them upside the head?

The issue is not only that this trope involves female characters dying. It is also, and most egregiously, that their deaths have nothing to do with them.

They are murdered - /in story/ not just by the author, but from a Watsonian perspective, to hurt the male protagonist. Which is just insult on top of injury. If the love interest jumps in front of a bullet to save the protagonist, that would not be this trope. (Nor is Fenn, really. Fenn died a soldiers death.)
