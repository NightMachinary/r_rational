I think you're misreading the thing about "winning". He's not actually claiming that he's won the argument; he's saying that if she arbitrarily says that gender doesn't matter when it suits her, then she's torpedoeing her own argument. Maybe he's wrong, but not maliciously so.

I think Arthur and Tiff are both partially correct, but Tiff is more correct, and Arthur is being somewhat insensitive to the social implications of his argument. He's definitely over-argumentative and a little socially stunted. But he's not being /awful/, and I think the WtC readership is being a little unfair because we now view Arthur as compromised while Tiff is still perfect in Joon's memory.
