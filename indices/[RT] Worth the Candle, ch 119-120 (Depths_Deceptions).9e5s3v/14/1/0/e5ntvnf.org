Because it is a prime example of the denial of individual importance and agency to female characters.

Contrast this trope with the "Mentor always dies". Mentor is an even more hazardous occupation than love interest in narrative, but the mentor is invariably killed for reasons relating to the mentor. They sacrifice themselves, they are hunted down by their ancient enemies and so forth. Their death is about them.

Fridging is not. The killer does not care about the victim at all, except as an emotional bludgeon to point at the hero, and would be equally happy to burn their stamp collection. Which is dehumanizing as all hell.
