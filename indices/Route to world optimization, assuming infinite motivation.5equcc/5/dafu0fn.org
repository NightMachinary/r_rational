My thinking is as follows:

1. Get lots of money.
2. Build self replicating factories.
3. Set up an orbital ring system.
4. Use self replicating space robots to brute force other problems.

That's the crude outline. I'm not sure about all the details. Third step is somewhat optional/substitutable since a self replicating robot in space wouldn't need most of its mass launched (or any of it, in the pure form of the concept), it's just that the bootstrap rate of an ORS seems to be surprisingly rapid (Paul Birch calculated 8 hours to launch its own mass).
