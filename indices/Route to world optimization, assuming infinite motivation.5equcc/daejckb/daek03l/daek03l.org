Well if I gave you large quantities of useful resources it wouldn't really fit with the question I was asking, or I guess trying to imply. The idea is that your life does not currently revolve around improving the world, it presumably revolves around improving your life and the lives of people around you. This includes a lot of downtime that you could be using to study, or some other activity that would get you ahead in life but drive you absolutely insane if you never had any free time from.
