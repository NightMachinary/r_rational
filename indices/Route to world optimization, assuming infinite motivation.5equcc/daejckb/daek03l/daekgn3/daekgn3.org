"What do you mean 'you', kemosabe?" :)

I can make a plausible argument that everything I do is part of achieving my larger goals, which includes whatever amount of world-optimization I can manage with whatever resources and personal ability I can get. Of course, I'm not your average camper, so you may want to focus your question on people who haven't spent time figuring out what their own fundamental values are, or some similar nudge.
