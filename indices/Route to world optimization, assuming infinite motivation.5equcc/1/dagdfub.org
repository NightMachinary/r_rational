My specific goals, in world-optimisation terms, are pretty vanilla: get to a friendly AI singularity as quickly as possible, and minimise suffering in the meantime. For this, I go to 80,000 hours, check out their high-impact career recommendations, and then do all of them, simultaneously (okay, maybe not all of them, but as much as possible). I figure out how to spin my inhuman motivation levels into encouraging other people to do the same.

Also, I get a legal name change to the Comet King, because at infinite motivation I'm totally allowed to do that.
