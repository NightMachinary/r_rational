I took some notes a while ago about how to write a good novel that takes place in a utopian post-singularity society.

In order for readers to care about the story, about the characters and their experiences, there needs to be an actual story. There needs to be a plot. Of the seven basic plots, Overcoming the Monster, Rags to Riches, the Quest, Voyage and Return, Comedy, Tragedy, and Rebirth, all of them seem plausible for a utopian post-singularity society except for Overcoming the Monster and Tragedy. When you have all the time in the universe to accomplish your goals, the stakes are lower, but that doesn't mean there are no stakes.

So what are the stakes? What kind of goals are worth working towards? And of those, what kind of tasks have a possibility of success or failure, or even just of going well or going poorly over a certain period of time? That way there is still dramatic tension and readers care about the outcomes in the story. What do you write about when no one is dying and no one is being tortured or raped, etc.? Well, you just write about /everything else/.

For example:

Money Romance Relationships Reputation Exploration Learning Adventure Drama Humor Aliens

Will anything be serious at all? Will there be ways to help and be helped by other people?

Here's a story prompt I wrote, from the perspective of someone who is born shortly after the singularity.

"All my life I wanted to do something great. And all my life it seemed like all of the great accomplishments had already been done. There isn't really anything I can do that tops saving the human race from annihilation, is there? Nothing more impressive than saving countless lives, right? Plus, anything I can do that is of such great importance can be done by artificial intelligence. So whatever I do has to be meaningful to the human species in order to be worth doing by humans and not by AI. One thing I could do: Explore the whole Universe and gather data and memories to take with us when our artificial intelligence figures out how to escape from this universe before it runs out of negentropy..."

Maybe I'll write a story to go along with this some day. It will probably be a Star Trek fanfic in which [[#s][spoiler]]

Then again, as long as things don't go to shit I have no doubt that someone would at least name their space exploration ship after the ship in Star Trek.

Also, why can't we have petty disputes? Petty disputes are hilarious, and pretty much everybody has them all the time! If you don't have any petty disputes than you probably aren't close enough to anyone to get on each other's nerves. As long as nobody is being killed or seriously hurt by said petty disputes I see no problem with people having them.

Also, this seems kinda relevant here: [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/]]
