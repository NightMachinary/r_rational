I'm still reading "The skill informed me that it was actually a gestalt between Deception and Stealth".

Are you sure you've fixed it or that you didn't undo the fix by making another fix?

Frankly can you tell us right here in this thread what the two component skills for Deception are supposed to be? This alone of all typos ever in this story is something we can't figure out for ourselves without author input.

EDIT: I'm currently guessing it's a gestalt between Bluff and Stealth, or perhaps Lying and Stealth.
