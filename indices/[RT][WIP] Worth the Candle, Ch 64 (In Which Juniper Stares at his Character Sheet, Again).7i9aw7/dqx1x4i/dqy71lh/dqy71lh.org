  a handful of armor skills: Light Armor, Heavy Armor, Unarmored, and Shields
#+end_quote

but later we read

#+begin_quote
  Shields, Unarmored, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor
#+end_quote

So was that supposed to have been Light Armor or does Medium Armor also exist, and if so why wasn't it mentioned in the earlier set of armor skills?
