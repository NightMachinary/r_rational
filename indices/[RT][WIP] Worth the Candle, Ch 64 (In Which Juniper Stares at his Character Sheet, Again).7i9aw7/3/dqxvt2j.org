This new knowledge about souls makes me reconsider some of the assumptions about how souls and hells work in Aerb. Earth/American/christian mythology is that souls are tortured in hell. But in Aerb, where souls just hold data about a person and not the processes of consciousness, can a dead person really be tortured? I guess the demons can still plug a soul into a brain/ emulator or something and torture that.

Also it would be interesting to see how those artificial fetus souls compare to Joons. And if Valencia can get an artificial soul if her soullessness proves to be too much of a vulnerability.
