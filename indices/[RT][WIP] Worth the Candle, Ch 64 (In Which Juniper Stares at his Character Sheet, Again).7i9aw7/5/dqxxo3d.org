Sounds like he's behaving in a way he wouldn't expect-- could this "uncharacteristic" behavior be the consequence of various parts of his soul not being in alignment, evidence of tampering?

Other thoughts:

- Joon really needs to ask all three people --independently-- where and how long the touch was for, where they can't know the answer to each other. The question of exposure time is critical to figure out what level of impact Fallatehr could have had
- Once the whole party is together (or perhaps right away since Amaryllis is around) he needs to peek at his own soul and make sure that the /really/ obvious stuff is not amiss -- the trust levels of Fallatehr for example
- It is possible that Joons soul was read, but not modified, given the likely-short contact time. Perhaps to know values or see a snippet of past. Fallatehr could also have removed his bodies ability to feel physical contact at the knee (unlikely to be true or relevant, given the instant flailing)
- Given Fallatehr being a mage, plus Grak being armed and on high alert, it is likely that Fallatehr isn't able to get the jump on Grak, and that the proposed story is correct. But Fallatehr got the jump on a prisons worth of people, so who knows.......
- I agree with others that having all of {unarmored, medium armor, heavy armor, shields} is overkill -- he should probably just have the one that his current armor applies to, and perhaps unarmored.
- I would want to know if I could re-assign stat points, undoing the mistake that was putting two directly into insight.
- Is it possible to simply copy skills off another individual? Sure would be nice.
- If I were him, I'd tell Amaryllis about the twinned souls thing ASAP, or it will be a huge trust issiue later.
- Speaking of which, it would be nice to know if twinned souls can now be used for communication somehow -- if nothing else, by changing a small, irrelevant memory. On a related note, it is even more important to protect Joon from Fallatehr now, since Joon can likely change all of their souls if compromised
- Sounds like a fantastic time to buy some books on magics and what they're capable of, as well as exclusions of course
- if he could find ways around the gestalting exclusin (or others) by gaming the system, that's not a bad idea either. But I would be hesitant to risk running into bugs with the engine that controls my soul
