Definitely. You cannot wear two sets of armor at once. The only reason for both is if you have some armor that counts for both, and the effects of both skill would stack. Maybe he does not know what his armor counts as or wants to be able to switch, but biting the bullet would have been better.

You cannot use 2 handed weapons with dual wielding when you only have 2 hands, so keep One Handed and Dual Weapon skill and drop 2 handed weapons if you have to.

drop a couple redundant of the ranged weapon options for more skills. But craft skills be OP, yo! Dropping Alchemy seemed dumb

Dropping Wards (unless you are intending to make a wand and add it back in ASAP as it becomes usable) is pants on head retarded. You have seen firsthand how useful and versatile it is. And you have a teacher on hand. The more wards, the merrier.

Dropping gold Magic was probably smart, the call of gold makes it seem like a trap unless you have a way around that.
