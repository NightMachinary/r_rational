I felt the same way. Also, unless he gets some sort of magical shield, I'm unsure how efficient it will be to sacrifice two handed swings for a mundane shield, unless the skill gives him some type of defensive magic. He honestly could just learn how to use shields the mundane way to save himself a skill slot.

Dropping gem magic would have been a good choice as well, since he seems to hate it. With fire magic, I don't think he needs a redundant ranged magic option.
