At a guess, skills not blue slashed are not subject to his accelerated learning but function like skills do for normal people, which means.. I am pretty sure the heavy and medium armor skills are nigh-total waste of slots. Shield and unarmored, perhaps not, it is likely possible to become a combat prodigy at making use of those in a way that it likely noticeably is not for the armor slots.

.... He really should have toned down his value weighting of Leveling Up before making that many changes to his game interface - I think he overestimated the value of combat skills quite severely here.
