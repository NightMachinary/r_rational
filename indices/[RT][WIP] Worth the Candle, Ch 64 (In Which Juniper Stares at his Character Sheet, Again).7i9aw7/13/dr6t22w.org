Just caught up! Love this book, top-shelf pageturner.

I assume this has been suggested before, but I think our Joon is in an afterlife of some sort. He's mentioned being suicidal a couple of times now - but it can't have been entirely Arthur-driven? Given that Earth and Tiff are bigger circles than him. Also, the way hells and souls work in Aerb feels like a hint that that's analogous to his situation.

Also whew did he make some rash calls this chapter. He very nearly dropped romance in the name of a rushed min-max job. Jesus.

Man is the DM punishing him hard for that glove rocket. I can only assume his gut was right, and fighting Aumann (yes, I got it. Au. Very clever) then and there and chopper out - but given the later showdown I'm not sure they could've won that. I wonder if there was a third way out he and I missed. If there was, the DM was a lot more subtle about it than "the fog is not quite as high as St Paul's".

The narrative theory appears to only be half right. That's quite annoying.
