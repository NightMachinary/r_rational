Although Twinned Souls obviously has a large visible presence within Essentialism, I would have expected to see some connection to the other companions with Loyalty as well. But I guess that would be within the value circles somewhere, perhaps? And I anticipate that +June+ Joon will get around the copy/paste problem with his ribs by copying Mary's ribs (or maybe Fenn's, if she's close enough to human).

I'm bit confused as to why Deception kept him from leaving the interface if it never showed up as an error until now. I know diddly squat about coding, but I would have expected there to have been some kind of error message as soon as an illegal construction gestalt was created earlier in the story, either when he first obtained it, or as soon as it started leveling up. At that point it functionally should have been an activated piece of code, right? Is there a coding reason that it only caused an error once he opened the interface?

Neat chapter, not quite sure what to think of everything in it, but looking forward to seeing where it goes!

Edit: Reading too much of TGAB; this Juniper is Joon, not June :)
