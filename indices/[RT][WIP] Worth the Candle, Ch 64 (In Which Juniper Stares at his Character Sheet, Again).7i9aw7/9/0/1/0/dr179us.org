  Dropping Wards (unless you are intending to make a wand and add it back in ASAP as it becomes usable) is pants on head retarded. You have seen firsthand how useful and versatile it is. And you have a teacher on hand. The more wards, the merrier.

It takes a month just to craft the tools he'd need (and by my reading that's a hard limit, not something his level-up magic would let him breeze through). At the rate he's been progressing he could master every other magic on his list before he even got started on Wards.
