So, Joon only gets to edit his skills every 100 of his levels, divided by his Essentialism score.

The way I figure it, this probably generalizes as: as an Essentialist, Joon---with either a touch, or using Twinned-Souls links---gets to edit [/person/]'s skills every 100 of [/person/]'s levels, divided by Joon's Essentialism score.

If that's true, then if Joon skipped any interesting parts of the skill tree just now, he can still hook everyone else up with those unlocks instead. In fact, the party can now work out whole-party builds made up of character-builds with complementary skills.
