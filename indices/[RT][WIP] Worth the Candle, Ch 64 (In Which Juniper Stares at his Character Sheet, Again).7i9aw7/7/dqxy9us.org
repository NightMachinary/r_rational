My read on the situation:

Fallatehr didn't explicitly attack Joon, but he set him up for failure. It was a fork strategy:

If Joon really as great prodigy as he claim he would stack in his soul and would need Fallatehr help to exit, which could be exploited.

If Joon not such a great prodigy and unable to enter soul on the first (few) try he need long time to learn and thus securing Fallatehr position as a teacher. That make him not afraid of Joon party betrayal in medium term and provide with space for more attempts to change situation in his favor.
