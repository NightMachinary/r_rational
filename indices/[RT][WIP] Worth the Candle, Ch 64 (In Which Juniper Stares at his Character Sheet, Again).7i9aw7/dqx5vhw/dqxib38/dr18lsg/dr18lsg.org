I think that this is a great description, but for the last bit I'd like to comment that Exclusion currently appears to prevent further acquisition/ spread of an ability, but permits current users to retain that capability.

So no migration occurs when an exclusion occurs- current souls are simply marked with the new limitation, and the addition of that skill is subsequently prevented if they later try to acquire it.

Opinion?
