For coding reasons, deception may have been something that should be blocked from being created in the first place, but the DM made it anyways. This error would go undetected until the error causing part became relevant, or it came under scrutiny from analysis software. Then the analysis software wouldn't allow the software to continue functioning in a bad state, and remain locked until the error is fixed.
