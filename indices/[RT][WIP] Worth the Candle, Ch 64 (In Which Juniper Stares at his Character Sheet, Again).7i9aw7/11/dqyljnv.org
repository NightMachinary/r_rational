I would have tried bringing up a Grandfather Clause Exception, or leaving while thinking about exiting /without/ saving. Something to get without having to change the save state of your soul.

I've had a similar issue in forums where personal info I had left blank became required later. trying to use the exit at the bottom kept bringing up /Error - So & So is a required field/ But nothing stopped you from using the sidebar navigation to go to some other part of the site, or just closing the tab and reopening the site anyone other than the specific page with the blank required info section.

And putzing around in his soul until Essentialism went from his then current skill level of 5 to the self trained soft cap of 20 would have dropped the timeout from 20 levels to 5 levels.

Definitely want to find out about these Exclusions, and if they are known to other Soul Mages, or if he is getting more information than others due to the game layers. I like there being 256 Skills, brings back memories like FFIV having exactly 256 total different items in the game.

Spirit might be what being inducted as a Druid by a Locus gets you. It depends on proximity to the note, and none of your attributes at all.

Since he can do things without actually having levels in the skill (Learning Dwarven even though the skill has not leveled up, using Armor then that was never one of the 40) Does removing a skill actually make him bad at it by removing ability, or just remove the abnormal growth?

Removing Gem Magic might have helped here, since he has trained in it, but does not really use it because of the requirements. Would be still be the equivalent of a Skill Level 20 Gems mage (since he already had trained to that level) but progression is now normal, or is he suddenly unable to use gem magic at all?
