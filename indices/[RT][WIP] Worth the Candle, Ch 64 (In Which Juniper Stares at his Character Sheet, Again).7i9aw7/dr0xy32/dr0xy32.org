Now imagining the protagonist's ending if he had used up his possible skill changes (and had the maximum allowed skill number) prior to attempting log-out and getting the error; a pity there's no 'Cancel, leave without changes' option. Rather, curious that that applies when /leaving/, as I'd imagined that changes made would be applied in real time--actually, that he can make multiple changes and not have each one count to his total further suggests that changes are only saved/applied when he leaves. Again, unfortunate for him that there's no Apply/Cancel choice.
