I thought the same! Cutting out Art seems like it will put a hard cap on Joons Skin Magic. But I think the biggest benefit is easy to overlook: Joon knows all his skills now. Knowing that Fire and Water Magic are on the list means he can focus on trying to unlock them now. And Analysis sounds like it could pair well with... Well, pretty much everything, assuming it helps him extrapolate from what he sees. Though, I was a little disappointed Joon never tried to toggle any skills to unlocked, or to look for what skills pair together, a la his blade skills.

My big concern is that if Twin Soulling links Joons soul to his companions', then twinning with Val might have unexpected consequences for him, not just for her. Exciting!!
