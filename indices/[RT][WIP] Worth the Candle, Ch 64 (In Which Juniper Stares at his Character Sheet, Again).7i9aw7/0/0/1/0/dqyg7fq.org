When it's not an actual active skill, it defaults to regular-human levels of skill. Joon reflected that he can use shields and armor fine enough even though he doesn't have a skill that makes him really good at them, and same with piloting. So his art skills will probably drop back to how he was at them when he first got here, but not 2-year old scrawls.

In either case though, yeah, he's gonna have a hard time with skin magic from now on.
