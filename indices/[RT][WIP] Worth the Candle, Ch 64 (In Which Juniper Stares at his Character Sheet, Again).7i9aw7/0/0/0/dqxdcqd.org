Good point about art. But I think all his other choices seem alright, although I did want to see steel magic. He honestly could have dropped gem magic, as he finds it difficult and unrewarding to improve. The two social skills he added seem like great choices, and I somewhat hope that he later drops an armor skill for another social or intelligence skill. Depending how tree magic works, he might want some magic that can create structures such as walls or bridges.
