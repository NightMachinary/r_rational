My guess is that the fairy gate malfunctioning is a side effect of Winter being devoured by Night. They're using Winter powers to make the gates via the Hunt, but now it's a part of Night which is a power of Below, so it opens into one of the Hells more often than not.

I'm curious how the change to Winter has affected the Hunt. Are they still Fey at this point? Do they still have access to Winter, or is it Night for them as well? Were their oaths made specifically to Cat or to her title which now belongs to the Sisters?

Also, Cat mentioned that the Sisters flew off from her before she got to camp, and they specifically said not to harm Robber and his people, so it seems they already know the whole situation, so my guess is that the Hunt now reports to them, Larat excluded.
