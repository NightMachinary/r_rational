Only three possibilities I can think of for what's causing the magical problems

1) Whatever entity Cordelia's pulled out of the lake

2) The Dead King

3) A side-effect from what happened to Masego

It seems like a targeted attack, so I'm leaning toward the first two.

The "entity" looking at them might indicate the Dead King; he might be capable of messing with the fairy gates and have relays set up to mess with scrying. Or it could be a Hell Egg that Cordelia's dug up to use as a weapon. A really ancient demon, maybe.
