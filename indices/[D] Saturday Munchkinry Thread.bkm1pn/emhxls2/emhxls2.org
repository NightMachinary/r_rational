You have an iron buckler (a small handheld shield) with the magical ability to negate kinetic force.

Whenever a sufficiently strong kinetic attack (about the strength of a good punch) hits the front of the shield, the shield negates all kinetic forces applied to its front for 1 second, including the attack that triggered it. Specifically, Newton's laws are broken, as the attacker feels the opposite force pushing back, but the defender feels as though nothing has hit the shield.

This ability can only be triggered once every 5 seconds. If an attack hits after the 1 second negation period but before the 5 second cooldown is over, the shield behaves exactly like a regular iron buckler would. If the shield takes too much damage, the magic is lost.

What can be done with this magic iron buckler?
