Well, the problem is that every system is different and you can't really make educated guesses, so the only real way is to gather information. Have a large number of people level up and see what they get, record the results and pass that down to future generations. This of course isn't possible when you are a lone person and there's a high lethality rate but work as an organization and you can have a truely optimized second generation team.

It's important to research whether you can retrain/abandon your class.

You would also expect that other organization are gathering class information so maybe if you got wealthy enough you can trade but you'd still need time for information gathering.
