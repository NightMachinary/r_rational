  because of your plot-derived Hero Complex™, you cannot kill or injure this person.

Plan 1: Not even bind and gag them so they can't speak a wish? Because that seems like the simplest "non-violent" solution. It doesn't stop them from encountering the genie, since it could be thrown through the window to land in front of them or something. It just prevents them from making a wish.

Plan 2: Does this target person know you have a Hero Complex™? Could you do a self-sacrificial villain bluff? Act like you're aiming to kill them, and laugh about their wish to kill only half the world, because that means a 50% chance of you living to kill them. Nudge them towards the idea of wishing for you to die instead of 50% of the population.

Plan 3: Attempt to actually convince them with words and reason. Yuck. Attempt to tell them how killing 50% of the population would cripple the economy and result in them being unable to buy/steal anything because half the people producing the stuff and transporting it to stores are dead. Attempt to tell them how it would lead to anarchy and probably lead to their death. Such reasonable arguments are highly unlikely to work though, since if they were reasonable they wouldn't be wishing to kill 50% of the population.
