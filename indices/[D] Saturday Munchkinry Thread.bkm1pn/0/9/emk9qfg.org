History wouldn't be remotely similar, and the longer it went on, the more dissimilar it would be. Think about it this way.

- Everyone would have a secure way to store wealth. However, said wealth would disappear upon death. This would make our habits with money very different.

- Natural resources would be significantly more common. Imagine a society of migratory miners that teach their kids to dig up the same resources their great, great, great ancestors did. You could have 100 copies of the Hope Diamond. We would never have run out of Damascus steel.

- Hunter-gathering, and to a lesser extent, subsistence farming could allow substantially greater population density.

- Therefore, land on the prime plane becomes far, far more valuable. While everything else stays the same. Urbanization happens far earlier; everywhere. Civilization rests on control of houses, rather than fields, so the rest of the land becomes industrialized.

- Skilled labor gains in value, because differences of skill are more apparent in megacities. Making the most skilled artisans lots of land, increasing value. Maybe they work for social value as well as materials.

So, in summary, this could either lead to a technological explosion; or it could lead to a permanent state of huntergathering with enormous cities.
