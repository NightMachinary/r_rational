By the way what happens when a person dies? Is the plane inaccessible or does it disappear? The former situation leads to massively developed ancestral personal planes for wealthy families that have to be guarded against rivals or thieves attempting to steal a few hundred bricks out of your castle. If it's the latter and someone does while they have visitors do they just disappear along with the plane?

Speaking of transporting things, there are scientists who have meticulously tunneled a hole to the center of their personal planes by taking out chunks of ground just to see what the center of the earth looks like.

If the former situation in paragraph 2 is true, the mc's world is probably not the original earth. - it was made uninhabitable by people taking stuff to their personal planes until there just wasn't enough mass to maintain an atmosphere. Things like climate change are solved though - you just reset by migrating everyone to someone's personal plane.

Raw material becomes cheap and abundant. Want some gold? Just teleport us and our mining equipment over at this particular spot and we'll dig it out for you.
