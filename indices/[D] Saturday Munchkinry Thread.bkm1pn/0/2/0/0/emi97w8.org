  Bacteria/viruses/parasites that are adapted to humans would be less common, as they wouldn't have any native humans to infect.

Are there no apes or early primitive humans around? Even if there weren't, there are a lot of plagues that start in animals and somehow get transferred to humans because our physiology is close enough.

But let's look at the crime aspect instead of the disease aspect. Plane shift kidnapping doesn't work, and criminals can't be kept in normal prisons since they can just plane shift, move out of the prison's location, and plane shift back. Which means special prisons would be needed, like prisons on zeppelins or prisons in the ocean, that way plane shifting is death. These prisons would cost way more, so I imagine that there will be a strong shift in cultural perceptions towards favoring cheap capital punishments.

But before that, how would one catch a criminal? It only takes 5 minutes for them to escape to their personal plane, and if they are born on your plane they can return at any time, bringing with them drugs or bombs or whatever they please. Every person born on a plane is effectively a potential near-unstoppable villain for that plane. Which means that in order to have safe planes, one must impose laws where every baby is born off-plane except for a few heavily monitored exceptions for the purpose of bringing people into this plane.

Countries would also invest in building safe bunkers that criminals cannot plane-shift into, otherwise they could plane shift a bomb in, plane shift out, and the area gets destroyed by the bomb. Fortunately, a person can only plane shift to ground level, so building underground bunkers would work well. Ground level rooms can also be made secure by half-filling them with water, so people cannot plane-shift into the liquid water.
