1. For how long did humans as a species have this ability?
2. What does the "no evolution of sapient humans" description mean, more exactly? Is it only the H. sapiens species, all the apes, anything humanoid, anything sentient, anything alive, etc?
3. Can things be brought back from personal dimensions to the default one?
4. What happens when c_B is born in c_C's unique dimension? Does c_C's unique dimension become c_B's default one and c_B's unique one two degrees of separation away from the global default dimension?
5. What happens if char_A transports a group of people to her dimension, then dies for whatever reason? Does the group get irreversibly stuck in c_A's dimension?

   - can people give their unique "keys" to others, swap "keys", etc?

6. What happens if someone performs a journey like this A→A', A'→B', B'→B? Does it look to others like a teleportation with a delay in default dimension?
7. (important for the DM and players but rhetorical to me) does the research / experimentation regarding this dimension-hopping ability bear any results and answers?

   - does magic exist? Its capabilities, limitations, etc.
   - are laws of nature the same in the parallel universes?
   - is there a time dilation effect between parallels?

--------------

- If #1's answer is in (hundreds of) thousands of years, then the "humans" themselves don't look like IRL humans, their evolutionary fitness requirements having been vastly different from ours.
- If #3 is "yes", then wars for resources aren't as much of a thing for d_Earth's population.

  - fights / wars for sovereignty, hegemony, and the privilege to dictate laws and culture become more important through time though;
  - the mass / gravity of default Earth gradually increases through centuries and millennia.
  - various groups keep "fishing" for: knowledge and technology if #2 is "sophonts can exist", valuable biomatter and species if #2 is "life can exist", valuable dimension "seeds" (convenient natural resource mines, etc) if #2 is "no life can exist"; • some of these groups breed people on industrial scales, check what each new dimension looks like as soon as the key-holder can shift others with them into it, and periodically dump the accumulated "excess" population on one of the parallels. • If #5 is "they get stuck", then they probably also "jam the door" after dumping these people inside by (secretly) injecting the key-holder with a slow-acting fatal poison before the key-holder starts the transfer process; • this may be under a disguise of colonisation propaganda.
  - if #2 is "sophonts / life can exist in alternate versions" and #3 is "yes", then default Earth eventually gets destroyed (e.g. pandemics, “alien” WMDs, etc); or becomes a hub connecting multitude dimensions of sentient species; and/or becomes an extremely tightly controlled territory with draconian laws and regulations.

- if #6 is "yes", then general security measures and protocols are very different from ours.
- the tactical and strategic role of nuclear weapons and other WMD is different. Less of a deterrent, perhaps, with some other functions in its place.
