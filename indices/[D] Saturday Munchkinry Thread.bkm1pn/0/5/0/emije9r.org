  1. For how long did humans as a species have this ability?
#+end_quote

There exists a threshold of intelligence, above which any creature has this ability. For humans, this occurred after socialization, but before the development of agriculture.

#+begin_quote
  2. What does the "no evolution of sapient humans" description mean, more exactly? Is it only the H. sapiens species, all the apes, anything humanoid, anything sentient, anything alive, etc?
#+end_quote

The other great apes still exist in the personal planes, but are all below the threshold of intelligence necessary to have the ability to plane shift. The history in personal planes proceeded as in the same manner as ours, except that any newborn that would be above this threshold of intelligence was never born.

  3.Can things be brought back from personal dimensions to the default one?
#+end_quote

Yes. Resources can be brought through any plane shift.

  4.What happens when c_B is born in c_C's unique dimension? Does c_C's unique dimension become c_B's default one and c_B's unique one two degrees of separation away from the global default dimension?
#+end_quote

That is correct, c_C's unique dimension is the home dimension of c_B. c_B can plane shift into that dimension, and into her own unique dimension. c_C cannot travel to the global default dimension, except by being transported by another person.

  5.What happens if char_A transports a group of people to her dimension, then dies for whatever reason? Does the group get irreversibly stuck in c_A's dimension?
#+end_quote

c_A's dimension and anyone in it continue to exist independent of c_A's death. The group that was transported can, at any time, return to their birth dimension or their personal dimension. The limitations are only on the destination. That does mean, though, that unless somebody else was born in c_A's dimension while they were there, it would be possible to lose access entirely.

#+begin_quote

  - can people give their unique "keys" to others, swap "keys", etc?
#+end_quote

No. There is no way to gain the ability to plane shift to any additional planes. That said, while individuals could not, groups of people over long periods of time could by strategically choosing the birth dimension of their children. For example, trading families across dimensions might ensure that they have sufficient children born in each dimension they trade with that disease would be unlikely to disrupt trade.

#+begin_quote
  6.What happens if someone performs a journey like this A→A', A'→B', B'→B? Does it look to others like a teleportation with a delay in default dimension?
#+end_quote

That is correct. Physical travel across a different dimension would appear as if it were delayed teleportation.

#+begin_quote
  (important for the DM and players but rhetorical to me) does the research / experimentation regarding this dimension-hopping ability bear any results and answers? does magic exist? Its capabilities, limitations, etc. are laws of nature the same in the parallel universes? is there a time dilation effect between parallels?
#+end_quote

The laws of nature exist the same in all parallel universes, with no time dilation. Magic does not exist, though some of the rules of plane shifting may be relaxed through advanced research. For example, being able to travel to the birth plane of any creature, not just sapient creatures.
