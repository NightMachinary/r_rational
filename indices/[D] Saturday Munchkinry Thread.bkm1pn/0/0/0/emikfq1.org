  Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible; societies wouldn't be able to use jails or prisons.

Absolutely. I think that punishments would veer toward being either more or less humane than imprisonment, with nothing in-between. If it is something that could be immediately identified and sentenced, then physical punishment is possible. If the person can be immediately identified, then they could have fines imposed, since their goods/household would take longer to move.

  This could lead to the development of an aristocracy based on birth location: if a personal plane is settled and the person who it belonged to dies, only those born there would be able to leave the plane and return to it. They could ensure the security of their fortifications by forcing everyone else to give birth in an aristocrat's personal plane before being brought back, so that anyone else who shifts planes will be unable to return.

Correct, planes could be entirely cut off from each other. I hadn't thought of a plane managing security by requiring all births to be performed off-plane, but that would make sense.

  If everyone's personal plane is an identical copy of the same alternate earth, natural resources become much less of an issue
#+end_quote

That is correct, natural resources are in the same locations across all planes. This makes precious metals be much less precious, as surface-level deposits that on our Earth were exhausted in antiquity are readily available.
