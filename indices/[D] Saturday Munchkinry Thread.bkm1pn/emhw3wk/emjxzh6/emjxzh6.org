If I plug a usb cable into my ear, does the interface count as part of my body so the computer can interface with it? If so, you quickly gain access to existing software from the internet.

If you want, you can produce as many bitcoins as you want. If you want to scale up and probably go public, you can provide cloud hypercomputing services, though I would suggest you vet the ones that existing supercomputers can't execute. If you want to scale up even further, you can hold the world hostage with the threat of running an unvetted AI. (Such as by locating the Turing machine that best predicts Wikipedia articles across our past, then asking it for Wikipedia articles from our future.) And to scale to the maximum, fund AI research to get the safer deal, using your hardware advantage to not worry about arms races overriding safety.
