What differences are there between this hypercomputer and a regular computer? Unlimited memory and precision is a plus, but most computers already have more memory and precision than you need. Also an internet connection so you can actually tell others about it. No point being precise to 3000 decimal places if the only way to transfer the data is for you to literally speak 3000 digits out one by one. Getting the exact time doesn't really seem meaningful either since by the time your brain has applied for or processed the information, an inexact amount of time has passed. Capturing video can be done with a regular computer as well.

So rather than using the hypercomputer for its computing powers, I'm more interested in the fact that its literally linked to your sensory system. So unlike a VR device that can be forcefully taken off or damaged, this hypercomputer always has control over your senses. The question then is, does the hypercomputer have the power to overwrite your senses? For example, can you turn off your ability to feel pain with the hypercomputer? What about having the hypercomputer process input from your eyes, and modify the amount of light entering if it is too bright or too dark? Would you be able to render flashbangs completely useless by writing such programs?
