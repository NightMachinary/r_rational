infinite isn't practical. you have mass, which has a size and a density.

you could summon more copies of the same thing, certainly. but the mass of one book is small enough, that in the time it takes (picking up then dropping a book), your arms would get tired eventually. you face a practical limit because of boredom, fatigue, and the need to eat, drink, sleep, and other bodily functions.
