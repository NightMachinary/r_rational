you get a magic power: any book you touch, you can choose to add a copy to your personal library. you can summon or dismiss copies from your personal library at will. copies are the same as the original, including condition (wear, writing in margins, ect).

this only works on 'books', but is not limited to paper. you could copy a stone tablet, if it had enough writing carved into it. you must be able to recognize an item as a book for this to count, and there is a minimum amount of text needed to count as a book (a post-it note with one word is not a book, a stack of post it notes could be however). it takes a moment to copy, long enough to pick a book up, read the title, and set it back down.

so, whats the best use of this power?
