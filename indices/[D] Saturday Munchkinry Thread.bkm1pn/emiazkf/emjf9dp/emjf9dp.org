You can try to find an edge or exploit the system but the only reliable way to do well would be to get as big a group as possible and have everyone go different paths. This let's you find unbalanced specializations faster and to carry those who got unlucky.

If you're dealing with an unintelligent, unadaptable, and potentially unbalanced system you can look for exploits:

UI info

Negative number overflows

Resource cost exploits: Warriors use stamina, skeletons don't have stamina, skeleton warriors can use skills without cost. (Some story almost did this but instead went mage to my disappointment)

Exponential vs linear growths

Feedback loops

Deliberate exploration: Get skills for what you do? Try to get skills from anything useful or not
