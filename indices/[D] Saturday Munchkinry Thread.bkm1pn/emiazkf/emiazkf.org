What would be some efficient chains of actions in a sudden global LitRPG-fication scenario if the character had to be making decisions with very limited information about the new system (e.g. no manuals, no "guides" written by others, no time travel knowledge, etc)? Some examples:

- what if the specialisation they've ended up deciding on (wizard, melee, ranged, etc), turned out to be very weak or even disadvantageous in later game "stages"?
- Or they decided to gather information and experiment before acting and it turned out that the quickest to act won the most?
- or they decided to become a party- or village- player, and it turned out that the larger a group was the more likely it would be to get attacked and destroyed, etc.

In stories this problem rarely comes up because, well, the author has already designed what the game setting is going to be like, and they only have to more-or-less believably describe how the protagonist ends up making the "clever" initial set of choices.
