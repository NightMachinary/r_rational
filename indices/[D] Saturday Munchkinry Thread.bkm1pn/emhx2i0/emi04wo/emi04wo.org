How long does it take to plane shift? It is equivalent to one hour of physical labor, but does it actually take 1 hour to charge up the plane shift, during which time you must always remain in contact with all items and people?

Also, can you plane shift to your worlds even if you were plane shifted to someone else's personal plane? That's probably important to prevent plane shift kidnapping.

Furthermore, what does the following mean exactly?

  Each personal plane contains an alternate version of the world, identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved.

Are these worlds going to be full of giant predators that now didn't go extinct because of humans? Full of jungles with unknown plants? Full of bacteria, viruses and parasites that our immune systems have never seen? That sounds rather dangerous to enter by yourself. And also an easy way for people to kill everyone by going to their personal plane, contracting some never-seen-before plague, and returning to the plane of their birth. Cultural changes will then involve tons of people dying to plagues and a few safe bunkers under total reverse quarantine that are in highly inaccessible places to prevent people from plane shifting in. Like deep underground or underwater or in space.
