Disallowing births on important planes could lead to a significantly more gender-segregated society than ours.

Every woman allowed on your plane is a potential security risk, so it could be that /all/ women are barred from most important planes.

Depending on how spread society becomes across planes, women could be banned from all important societal functions. Voting, trade, etc.

Similar to our society in a lot of ways, but hugely exacerbated since keeping women out is actually a fairly logical thing to do.

This universe's Women's Suffrage movement is going to have a much harder time than ours.
