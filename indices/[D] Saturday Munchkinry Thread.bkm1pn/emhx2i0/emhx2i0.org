All humans have the ability to plane shift to alternate versions of Earth, subject to the following restrictions.

- Each person has exactly two planes that they can plane shift to. The first is the plane of their birth. The second is a personal plane unique to that individual.
- Each personal plane contains an alternate version of the world, identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved.
- When a person plane shifts, they can bring people and items with them, so long as they are in physical contact with all items being transported, and the total amount being transported is less than one ton of material.
- Performing a plane shift requires significant effort, equivalent to about an hour of physical labor.

Standard fantasy safety measures apply as follows.

- Plane shifting occurs relative to surface of Earth, or the nearest celestial body as applicable.
- Plane shifting will place a person at ground level, at rest relative to the surface.
- Plane shifting will not place any transported objects inside of solid or liquid.
- Plane shifting swaps the contents of a physical volume, preventing vacuum booms.

What cultural changes would take place as a result of this ability at various points throughout history?
