Practically unlimited natural resources is the main thing.

Dumb garbage at off shore worlds, the impact of humanity on this planet would be much more sustainable.

You could probably somehow use it to generate electricity by using the distortion.

Sneak into any place.

Prisons are useless.

Armish and nature loving groups have more opportunity to do what they could.

Literally no starvation ever. If there isn't enough food on earth you just take your tribe to one of your worlds.

You'd expect people to travel to other worlds and just live there for generations, though as they couldn't return if they went back to Earth Prime we wouldn't ever know. In fact our earth could be such a world.
