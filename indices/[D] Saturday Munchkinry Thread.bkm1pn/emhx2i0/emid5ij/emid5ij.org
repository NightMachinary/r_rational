  identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved.

I think, with respect to the Far Future of that world, the most relevant fact that we need to understand is whether the starting map of the other plane increments with age (e.g. do two newborns a thousand years apart get the same pre-human template of a plane? Or does the later newborn get an "updated" plane of a thousand years later?)

If it's the latter....this society is eventually going to have a big problem as the template world degrades and eventually becomes uninhabitable, or evolves intelligence of it's own.

But as for the near term...

  What cultural changes would take place as a result of this ability at various points throughout history?

-Due to every new-born having an entire planet, compulsory agriculture never happens. People will just hunt and gather in their ever-expanding plane-worlds forever. Going by modern hunter gatherers, and considering that this world would be /even more lush/ than that, it would have been extremely easy for any lone adult to sustain themselves /and/ 1-2 other persons through hunting and gathering. Humans are ridiculously effective as natural organisms even with stone age technology...and then consider that eventually they will invent technology /anyway/ and come into this lush world hunting with guns and such. (Unless they don't bother inventing tech until they're hungry, in which case they'll be hunter gatherers forever...but I doubt that)

-Since anyone can secede from any thing at any time, most of society exists as an anarchist's vision of utopia (though pockets of psychological control and aggressiveness may exist, it would be hard for them to affect anyone who isn't already inside of it)

-Some planes, especially the one where humans evolved and where the power started, will be default hubs. They may eventually become a bit crowded, but that's more or less okay (for us) because it doesn't really effect humanity if we destroy the ecology in those planes. Within those planes, scarcity over hub-resources begin to take hold to some degree, although this will ultimately be solved by anchoring additional hub planes together.

-By default, a plane is lost when a person dies. If society wishes to prevent plane loss, two planes can be "anchored" together by sending people to be born in them, then having the progenitor of that plane send them back. Those people can then take additional newborns to their "birth plane". In effect each plane can maintain a population of people who have been born in the other plane.

-two planes can "secede" forever by preventing the sending of new babies to be born in the other plane, preventing the incoming of new babies born on the other plane, committing genocide upon, or forcing out everyone who was born on the other plane, since there will then be no way for anyone to go to that plane and bring new immigrants. (Easy fodder for plot drama, as it would be easy for one or two people to be the "last link" between hub planes.).

-I imagine most conflict in this world would center around right of access to important planes, as most things humans usually fight over are no longer an issue. It would be incredibly easy for any individual or group who was sufficiently motivated to not want to be part of a conflict to escape from it (perhaps at the cost of losing access to an important plane), so most fighting would be between motivated combatants.
