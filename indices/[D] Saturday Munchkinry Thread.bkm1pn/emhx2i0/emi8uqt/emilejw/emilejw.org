Ideas not entirely dissimilar to this were explored in Baxter and Pratchett's Long Earth books. A warning before anyone gets their hopes up - the books are much more Baxter's style then they are Pratchett's, IMO. If you've liked any of Baxter's other stuff, the might be worth a shot - if you're thinking about reading them on the strength of Pratchett's name instead, you're likely to be disappointed.

Anyways, in those books you could travel to alternative realities in two different 'directions', each of which contained Earths that were slightly different but without humans when the story begins. The alternative realities are shared, not individualized. The story begins with the invention of a device that allows the majority of humanity to do this dimensional travelling cheaply and easily. The number of alternative realities in each 'direction' is extremely large and not known when the story begins.

The books are pretty decent about exploring how this radically reshapes human society.
