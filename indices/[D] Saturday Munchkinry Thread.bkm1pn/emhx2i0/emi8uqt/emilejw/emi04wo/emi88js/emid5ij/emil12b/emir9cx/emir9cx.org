  I'm not sure on this one, since to my knowledge the transition to agriculture happened in order to have a more steady supply of food, not to increase the total amount of food available. Hunting/gathering provides more food on average, but runs more risk of famine.

That's true in /our/ world, but you have to consider that said inconsistency in the food supply is ultimately due to the humans who were there /before/ those humans depleting the ecology of almost all it's megafauna in the first place. Behaviorally modern humans arrived on the scene with the ecology already depleted by other (non behaviorally modern) humans. You have to remember that even lower paleolithic humans have zero trouble killing large animals like elephants and whales, setting traps for small animals, etc...and you don't need a team of humans either, /one/ human with a long spear can kill an elephant. Stone age humans experience starvation when the ecology is depleted, when it becomes harder and harder to hunt because all the wild game is already dead...not because they are not consistent enough hunters.

I suspect one of the reasons that Africa is home to most of the world's remaining megafauna is because African megafauna have evolved alongside humans and for various reasons have a measure of adequate defense against stone age tech.

If /every single human/ can freshly be the sole invasive-species super predator in a brand new ecology, against animals who have never seen a human and have no life experience or evolutionary mechanisms helping them to avoid humans, spanning what is basically the entire planet, these considerations quickly evaporate. As for consistency? Remember that we can still share food at the hubs.

(What might be scarce, on the other hand, is the locations on civilized "hub" planes which conveniently correspond to ecologically desired locations on the wild personal planes - which would ultimately need to be solved via the aforementioned anchoring method.)

Now...if the wild-worlds were to undergo an ice age or a plague or something, that might be pretty annoying. (And they'd likely all have the problem simultaneously too).
