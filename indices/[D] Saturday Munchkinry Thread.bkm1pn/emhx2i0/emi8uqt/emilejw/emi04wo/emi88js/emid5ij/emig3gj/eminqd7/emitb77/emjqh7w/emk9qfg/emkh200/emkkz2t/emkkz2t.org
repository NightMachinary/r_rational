  By the way what happens when a person dies? Is the plane inaccessible or does it disappear?
#+end_quote

Anybody still in the plane will remain there until they plane shift out. If people have been born on somebody else's personal plane, they will be able to shift to it as their birth plane. If nobody has been born on that personal plane, there will be no way to return to it.
