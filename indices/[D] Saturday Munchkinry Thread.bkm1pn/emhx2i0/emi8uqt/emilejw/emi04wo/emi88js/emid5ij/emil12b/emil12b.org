  If it's the latter....this society is eventually going to have a big problem as the template world degrades and eventually becomes uninhabitable, or evolves intelligence of it's own.

The personal planes do age along with the original. On astronomy time scales, this will become an issue in about 1 billion years, when the sun's increase in power output raises the global temperature significantly.

  -Due to every new-born having an entire planet, compulsory agriculture never happens. People will just hunt and gather in their ever-expanding plane-worlds forever.

I'm not sure on this one, since to my knowledge the transition to agriculture happened in order to have a more steady supply of food, not to increase the total amount of food available. Hunting/gathering provides more food on average, but runs more risk of famine.

Agreed. Land would no longer be a primary resource, though developed land still would be. While a person could leave their home dimension at any time, it would require leaving behind much of the infrastructure that their home dimension provides.
