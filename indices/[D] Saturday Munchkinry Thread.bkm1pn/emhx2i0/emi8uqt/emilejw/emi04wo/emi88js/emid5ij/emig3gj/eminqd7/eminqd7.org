Hopefully this doesn't retread a lot of what people have already answered with.

*Prisons*

Prisons become completely impractical. Shifting automatically to ground/sea level makes it very hard to keep someone from escaping a hazardous cell. While initially people might think to build huge prison complexes on artificial islands, deserts, or other places prisoners wouldn't be able to survive shifting to, all it would take is one disgruntled individual to pull 1 ton of prison with them and effectively break everyone else out. (This is assuming you can shift parts of an item with you)

The only way it could work would be if A) the preparation to plane shift can be reliably detected and B) it can be disrupted, in which case you could have prisoners outfitted with taser collars to shock them if it detects and imminent shift.

*Security*

Keeping people out of things would be difficult, but at least not impossible. Security would be focused on keeping person-sized spaces from existing in secure areas when not in use, which could be done by lowering layers of mesh netting from the ceiling. Safes, depending on how discrete your material must be when shifting, would either have to be done away with entirely if someone can telefrag the door off, or be attached to building foundations to prevent them from being phased out.

Personal security would be a great deal more concerning. Phase-kidnapping would be a real problem when people can hold a finger to someone's shoulder while they're asleep and spirit them away 5 minutes later. Sleeping in general would become a scary activity, and sleeping in public would be taboo.

*Crime*

We could expect there to be a huge uptick in missing persons reports, since anyone who kills anyone now has a guaranteed way to hide a body. Serial killers would be a lot harder to catch. People would probably be a lot more okay with surveillance, cell phone tracking, and so on in light of that constant risk. Ironically, we would likely see a lot less poaching, as any hunter now has an entire world of untouched population up for grabs.

Aside from morbid crimes, petty theft would be on the rise. Big box stores would have to change their entire business model, more goods being stored behind glass and more display models only, with inventory being held in the back.

*World Colonization*

While I do think "Earth prime" (E) would continue to be a centralized hub for mankind, rich individuals and corporations would certainly create "private world networks" to their own benefit. They would begin with a single person transporting people and resources to their private plane (E' or F), full time, funded by some billionaire. When they have a settlement running, the generation of people born there will have F (and some F') as their phase worlds. Now, while the original person who had E and F as their phase worlds will eventually die, as long as you have a small population of people born to E and F stationed in the opposite world, you have continuous travel between them.

For example, given that a person's name starts with their native world, you have Edward and Fawn on world E, and Edith and Frank on world F. As long as you have E&F natives travelling in pairs between worlds, there will always be someone that can keep that connection active no matter what world they are on.

These worlds, I imagine, would mainly be used for resource mining, waste dumps, fast travel, and tourism. Since they require people to work, acting as a "world courier" would be a steady form of employment to many people. Eventually, population growth would begin to accelerate exponentially and economic growth would be limited only by the amount of people able to act as world couriers as industries become more and more efficient at extracting resources from worlds and shipping them back in 1 ton increments, and society enters a more or less utopian age thanks to an infinite amount of resources to extract.
