Physical security is wiped out. Walk up to a locked door, shift, walk past where the door isn't, shift back.

You can't really use personal planes to get around that, beyond a certain point, because if you put the gold in Sgt Bilko's personal plane, and he dies, it's all gone.

You can't easily colonize a personal plane for the same reason... it's like you're going to a new planet. Children born in the colony can only come back to Earth by hitching a ride on returning Earthfolk, though a pool of colonist children can serve to relay people to the new world and come back with one of their passengers. Kind of like in Haldemann's /Mindbridge/.

Unpopular worlds might end up permanently lost, once the original opener dies.
