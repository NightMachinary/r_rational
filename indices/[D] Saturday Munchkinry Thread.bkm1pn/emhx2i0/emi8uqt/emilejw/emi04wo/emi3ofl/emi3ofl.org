  How long does it take to plane shift? It is equivalent to one hour of physical labor, but does it actually take 1 hour to charge up the plane shift, during which time you must always remain in contact with all items and people?
#+end_quote

About 5 minutes, during which you need to maintain contact.

  Also, can you plane shift to your worlds even if you were plane shifted to someone else's personal plane? That's probably important to prevent plane shift kidnapping.
#+end_quote

Yes. No matter what plane a person is on, they can always plane shift to their birth/personal planes. The restrictions are only on the destination, not on the departure location.

  Are these worlds going to be full of giant predators that now didn't go extinct because of humans? Full of jungles with unknown plants? Full of bacteria, viruses and parasites that our immune systems have never seen?
#+end_quote

Predators, yes, along with any plants that were driven extinct by humans. Bacteria/viruses/parasites that are adapted to humans would be less common, as they wouldn't have any native humans to infect.

#+begin_quote
  That sounds rather dangerous to enter by yourself.
#+end_quote

Quite so, apart from brief expeditions for resources, or for dumping waste. I imagine that there could be colonization pushes, with a slow building of structures/farms on one person's personal plane, followed by emigration.
