Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible; societies wouldn't be able to use jails or prisons.

Similarly, physical barriers and fortifications will be very different if anyone can travel from their birth plane to their personal plane, walk past where a wall would be, and travel back, like a 10-minute teleportation.

You might like to have a look at Charles Stross's Merchant Princes series, it involves a similar powerset and does a good job of exploring the implications.

Here's a few possible ways to maintain a secure location:

- Keep it on your personal plane and never bring anyone there. If you die, it becomes inaccessible.
- Keep it on your personal plane, use conventional barriers, and ensure that nobody gives birth there.
- Make it impossible to plane shift into using the safety measures: away from any celestial body, above or below ground level (justifies wizard's towers and dungeons), inside a body of liquid (use scuba tanks or drain the location when you need to access it), or moving at high speeds (constantly moving train vaults? centrifuge vaults?)

This could lead to the development of an aristocracy based on birth location: if a personal plane is settled and the person who it belonged to dies, only those born there would be able to leave the plane and return to it. They could ensure the security of their fortifications by forcing everyone else to give birth in an aristocrat's personal plane before being brought back, so that anyone else who shifts planes will be unable to return.

If everyone's personal plane is an identical copy of the same alternate earth, natural resources become much less of an issue: locations in the personal plane with the most accessible resources will be mapped and become centres of industry. If someone finds a vein of iron in their personal plane, they can return to their birth plane, tell their friends the location, and their friends will find the same vein of iron in their own plane.
