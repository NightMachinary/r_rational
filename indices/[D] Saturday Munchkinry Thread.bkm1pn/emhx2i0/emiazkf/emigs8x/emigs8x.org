Well, it's just like you said: without an author guiding a character to an ideal/clever build, there's no practical way to decide on an ideal path because a litRPG mechanics world could have any kind of mechanic that screws over any strategy you might come up with. Realistically, the best you can hope for is commit to specialization(s) that seems to synergize well and hope you're not picking a dud.

Beyond that, your best bet is to try to test if any low-hanging fruit from whatever litRPGs you personally know are exploitable, like:

- combing whatever HUD/game interface you have (if any) for wordings that give you information about the game, like "0 unallocated stat points" meaning there's a way to raise arbitrary stats, or if there's a skill store, overworld map, etc
- whether stats can be "trained" like weightlifting for STR, and if there's a diminishing return on it like so many Gamer stories
- if skills can be created in the same way
- try to meditate to unlock your MP or concentrate really hard on something to unlock appraisal (lol)
