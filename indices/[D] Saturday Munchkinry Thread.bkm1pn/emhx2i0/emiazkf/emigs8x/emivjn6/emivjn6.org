  Or they decided to gather information and experiment before acting and it turned out that the quickest to act won the most?

This actually makes a lot of sense though. In most RPGs, once you're ahead of the pack, you tend to stay that way. The XP-rich become XP-richer because they can do more things that will get them more loot and XP and make them more OP to grab more loot in an endless cycle. Even if you don't maliciously stomp on those weaker than you, the very act of killing the stronger monsters means less killable monsters available for the people behind you by the time they get to your level.

So what's most important is getting a massive lead early on, which is what you see in many of these LitRPG stories: the MC discovers some powerful artifact or skillbook or whatever that puts them way ahead.

With that goal in mind, first check whether indirectly setting things on fire gets you some form of XP.

If so, set a forest on fire. If you're lucky, that counts as you killing everything in the forest and you become instantly overpowered. Just err, check that there aren't any elves who would then consider you public enemy #1.

Conduct other kinds of experiments for mass killing methods. Can you divert a river to a cave dungeon and drown everything in it? Can you cause an avalanche on a mountain and kill everything below? Can you create tons of traps and get XP for every monster that falls in one? Can you create monster farms to farm up tons of XP? Can you divert a river away from the lake it feeds into, wait for the lake to dry up, and then go in and trivially murder all the helpless lake monsters who are now feeble and dying from lack of water? The last one actually seems pretty doable for most RPG systems. There are all kinds of ways to conduct mass murder without knowing anything about actual combat.
