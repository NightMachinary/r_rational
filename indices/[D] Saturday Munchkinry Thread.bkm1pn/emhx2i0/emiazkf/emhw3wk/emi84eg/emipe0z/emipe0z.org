Someone who thought Thanos's plan in Infinity War was a really great idea will encounter a one-wish genie in exactly two weeks. You know their name and home address, but because of your plot-derived Hero Complexâ„¢, you cannot kill or injure this person.

They will encounter the genie no matter what you do, your task is to convince them not to go through with killing half of the population. Bonus points if you explain how you would coerce them into using their wish for something more productive
