Her superiors' continuous treatment of her as a non-threat feels somewhat of an idiot ball behaviour. Especially with all the power at her disposal and all the incongruent actions they are witnessing from her. This flaw is partially mitigated by #III-4, but not enough to not make them partially feel like hollywood zombies for plot railroading (IMO). So maybe insert some additional circumstances that would allow for her to successfully mask herself for so long?

And one thing I can think of her doing is trying to generate a self-fulfilling prophecy, brute-forcing variations of it until one of them shows in her visions to be powerful enough that once she broadcasts it in the master timeline it will captivate minds to a sufficient degree and start self-propagating until the vague-ish apocalypse prophesised by it can not help but be reenacted. I don't know if this is a cliche solution though, or how well will it suit the rest of your plot and setting structure.
