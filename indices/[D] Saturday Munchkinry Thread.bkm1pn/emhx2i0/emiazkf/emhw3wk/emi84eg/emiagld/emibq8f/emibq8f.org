Can you copy a copy? Can you effectively generate infinite mass? Because I'm thinking of building another Earth.

​

First construct a gigantic book on Earth prime that is full of useful materials like edible pages, words written in plant seeds, decorations made of precious metals, etc. Then copy the book. Summon out a copy of the book, and copy that copy. Then dismiss the first copy. Now you have two copies. Repeat over and over to get ridiculous amounts of copies stored away in your personal library.

​

Now get on a rocket and head for the opposite side of Earth's orbit, moving at the same speed as Earth. Mass summon your copies of the book until gravity binds them together and voilà, Earth 2.0.

​

Disclaimer: Ask your physicist if Earth 2.0 is right for you. Side effects include throwing other planets off their orbits and destroying all life on Earth Prime.
