The book definition seems flexible enough that this could be used as a fairly generic matter duplication power. Maybe have a handheld laser cutter to etch a patch of minute text onto objects, or stick microdots to them? There's the usual free energy approaches, like summoning and dismissing a huge osmium tablet at a height to get kinetic energy, or maybe an uranium tablet for a nuclear power plant.

It's also a natural fit for an archivist, I'm sure researchers would love having copies of ancient books that they could handle carelessly without having to worry about damage to the original.

You could claim to be a master forger and phantom thief, dealing exclusively with books. All you need to do is touch the original and you can present your client with an identical copy.
