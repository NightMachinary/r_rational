  No, flashbangs will still fuck you up, because it physically overwhelms your senses. Your eyes have to physically reset after experiencing that, and your ears have to recover. They're not generating good and useful data.

Rather than having the hypercomputer give you data after you are blinded, I was thinking more along the lines of preemptively writing a simple program that says something like "While light input > 100, do light input = light input - 10". So when your eyes are exposed to blinding light, the hypercomputer picks up on the brightness and immediately dims it to manageable levels. Would that work and thus stop flashbangs from affecting you?

Also infinite computation? That sounds ridiculously exploitable. You can write a machine learning algorithm that has infinite clones and infinite iterations to basically solve any problem whose solution is machine learnable, under the restriction of limited data flow into and out of you. That means you can play chess perfectly regardless of board size and pieces, but that wouldn't even be scratching the surface of what your hypercomputer can do. You wouldn't quite be able to turn your hypercomputer into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace's_demon][Laplace's Demon]], but you can probably get much much closer than anyone ever has.
