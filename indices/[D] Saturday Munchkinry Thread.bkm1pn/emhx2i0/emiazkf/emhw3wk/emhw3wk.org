A ROB puts a hypercomputer in your head. Its mental interface with you is capable of accepting any mental or sensory input, and writing to any part of you external to your mind. For example, it can capture video of what your eyes and your minds eyes see, and it can play back whatever it has recorded over your eyes, but not through your minds eyes. It also has a third output, which plays a similar role to your minds eye, while being separate from it. The manual indicates this is a limitation of the hardware.

It comes with an operating system that can be rewound to any previous state, an operating manual explaining the low level specification of how it works and the computational model it runs on, and the source code and IDE's for popular programming languages extended to take advantage of the properties of the hypercomputer, such as real precision number libraries, no limitations regarding memory, and compatibility modes for running code written in the regular version of the programming libraries.

The interface for querying time returns a real precision number.

When a scan is taken of your brain, you can see where it activates your neurons, but can find no sign of the hypercomputer itself. That is, while the interaction between you and the computer seems to take place completely in real space, there is no indication of how it is capable of reading or writing brain states, or how it performs it's computations. This is not addressed in the manual.

What do the people of [[/r/rational][r/rational]] do with this computer?
