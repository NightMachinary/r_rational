Have you read the Long Earth series? It's conceptually similar, basically a simple and easily assembled device allowing planar travel is invented. There's an apparently infinite number of them, and they go “East” and “West”, which are opposite from each other. The rules to “stepping”, as they call it, are that no solid iron can step, and only sentient beings can initiate a step. One of the interesting consequences is that hunter-gathering is much more feasible as a form of survival, because land is no longer scarce.
