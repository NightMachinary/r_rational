Unlimited delta-v for a spacecraft. Attach a bouncy ball to the buckler with a spring, such that the bouncy ball strikes the buckler every 5 seconds. Any time the buckler is struck, the center of mass of the buckler+bouncy ball system accelerates in the direction of the hammer. This provides a way to accelerate indefinitely, using only [[https://xkcd.com/2115/][a source of electricity]] to keep the bouncy ball moving.
