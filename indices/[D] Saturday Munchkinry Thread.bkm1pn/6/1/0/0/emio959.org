You could hit yourself with the shield to stop a fall in midair. Falling feet first you can pull the shield up under your feet 1s every 5s of falling. So if you can survive impacts of 5s of freefall onto an iron shield this let's you fall from arbitrary heights! This is the equivalent of a 214km/h impact for a 75kg person.

Practically you can double your safe drop distance. If you can drop 1 story safely you can now do 2, 1 story drop onto the shield, and 1 story drop onto the ground.
