No, it can only read and set neural impulses. The first step of vision isn't a neural process, the first step is the bleaching of photosensitive proteins in the eye. What a flashbang does is activate all photoreceptive cells in the eye at once, leaving you completely blind for about 5 seconds. The cells that detect light are physically incapable of sending a signal, because the proteins responsible for detecting light are being regenerated.

On the subject of machine learning and laplaces demon, you can do one better and instantiate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI][AIXI,]] which probably wouldn't be very smart (especially if you try to be clever and use your mood as it's reward function) but would definitely lead to some interesting consequences.
