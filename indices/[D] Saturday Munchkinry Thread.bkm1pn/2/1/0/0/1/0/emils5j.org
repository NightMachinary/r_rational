You could use the computer to use other receptors as light receptors to try to see. Use it to detect tiny changes in their firing due to light sources, filter out the background, and filter them by skin tone for color resolution. Getting different color tattoos would help with the color resolution, drastically different absorption rates for known colors. Use different levels of thickness for clothes as another contrast.

You could also just avoid the flashbang? Get some basic image recognition going if flashbang=pulled,delay.brandfuse, then rolleyes into back of head until it goes off. Code it better to avoid mistakes and exploitation, but this should dramatically reduce the effects on your eyes
