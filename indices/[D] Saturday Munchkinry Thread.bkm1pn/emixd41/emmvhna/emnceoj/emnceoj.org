She does have her mind read at least once a day, so that's part of why she never comes under suspicion. She also has a long history of mental illness - she was raised up because a lot of people thought "Oh man, what a shell of a person... But you know, I could really make use of those powers of hers..." When she isn't aware of her true motives, she has almost no direction in her life other than trying to be helpful to the people who raised her up, and wanting to feel like she's helping to protect civilization from the mysterious apocalyptic threat everyone is trying to put a stop to. It also helps that she genuinely hates one of the enemies of the country, and that prophecies seem to suggest this particular enemy will be some kind of trigger for the disaster. So anything big she does that she can play off as being a move against that enemy is seen as both more believable /and/ her trying to help.

As for prophecy manipulation, I didn't get into that in my first post because it's a whole other kettle of fish and gets quite complicated as well, but suffice it to say, she's got that covered. Destiny and prophecy can indeed be tinkered with and heavily abused under the right circumstances. The apocalypse she is working toward is 'supposed' to happen, and things go her way a little more easily because of it. Everyone else is trying to push giant boulders up a hill, while she just has to push them off course so they roll back down again. The power of destiny is not so strong that it's 'easy' so long as it favours you, and I hope I'll be able to show that as well, since it has some important limitations, but it's certainly an advantage to be working with it and not against it.

Thank you very much for your input! I realize that I'm only showing a small part of the plot and that that makes it harder to give feedback, but it's useful never the less. Thanks for your time.
