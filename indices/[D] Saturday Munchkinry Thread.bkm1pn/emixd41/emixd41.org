As I wrote this out, I realized it's pretty convoluted. Basically one of my villains is playing around with time while working for the people trying to catch her, and I want it to make sense for her to win in spite of hundreds of highly intelligent sociopaths trying to find and stop her. So what I need are things she can do with her time powers that are horribly broken, and ways others could conceivably stop her, given that she will see almost everything coming and has had a long time to prepare.

She has the power to collect information from the future. This power is not super convenient to use, and does have limitations we will get to, but the chain goes like this: She has the power to read minds. Furthermore, she has subordinates who can see a few seconds into their own subjective future. She can also freeze time for these agents. Adding all this together, she can read these agents' minds and see what the future will be like by freezing them until the point in time she wants to look at.

The problem this character faces is that she is working for an evil magical dictator who randomly and frequently reads her mind very thoroughly. She has a system in place to wipe her memory whenever she isn't working on treasonous plots, and has set up a bunch of triggers to give her back her memories and true motivations in situations where she is unlikely to have her mind read right this minute. This does leave her a bit of a mess with a horrible sense of not really having a core personality, since it gets ripped out all the time, but she's had high functioning Borderline Personality Disorder for decades, so those above her are used to her emotions and actions not always making perfect sense, or not knowing herself why she did x. She's very useful to them because she has rare powers, but at the end of the day they think she's just too damaged and pathetic to be any kind of criminal mastermind, never mind an apocalyptic threat at the core of their own power structure. They see her as a tool that is very easy to destroy if it turns against them. /And when she doesn't have her full memories and motivations, she genuinely agrees with this assessment./

I think I have things worked out fairly well, but I want to be sure I don't miss something obvious somebody should be doing if they are intelligent. This character is evil and wants to basically destroy civilization because of some plot stuff we don't need to get into. She also works at the highest levels of the magical science secret police and is tasked with sniffing out world ending threats, and the few people over her do not want to bring about any kind of apocalypse whatsoever.

What she needs to accomplish to reach her very specific win condition is for the evil empire of Nazi Wizard Moria to believe that the world is going to end on x date /and they can't stop it/. She also needs to set things up so that she is allowed to be in charge of the last ditch Hail Mary efforts to help humanity survive the apocalypse. She cannot brute force anything, but she is extremely good at manipulating people and has no qualms about destroying lives. Now, this is what she has going for her:

1) Can read minds fully

2) Can look ~5 seconds into her own subjective future

3) Has several subordinates who also have one of these powers.

4) Prophetic powers resist mind reading in my world. Even if you have all the time in the world, you cannot read thoughts about the victim's own prophetic powers, nor can you see their visions. /But/, if you have the same power as someone /and/ you can read minds, you can pierce this resistance. So she can pierce her own subordinates' resistances, but because nobody but her has both, /nobody/ can read /her/ thoughts and memories that directly touch on precognition and viewing the future.

5) By freezing time for herself or her minions, she can look much further into the future, with no hard maximum

6) By /thinking about/ freezing time for herself, she can instantly make herself aware of simple things like how long it would take for someone to unfreeze her, how long it will take for anyone to come here if she never left the room, at what time does the enemy storm the fortress, etc

7) Nobody else knows about 4, and nobody can read this information from her mind, because it pertains to prophetic powers

8) She is the first person to figure out that they can extend the range of the power by freezing time, and she formulates her master plan before anyone else figures out this is possible.

9) Her superiors think she's a pathetic shell of a person who lucked out and was born with some rare and useful powers, so she is not a suspect or considered a threat

10) Because she is considered safe and useful, she ends up something like the 5th most powerful person in the empire, and can use secret police resources pretty much however she wants, as long as she can make it look like it's not a power play or actively treasonous after the fact

11) Thousands of people with prophetic powers different from hers believe the world is going to end around date x as well, and prophetic powers are maddeningly unhelpful in trying to gleam any information on what the threat actually is

The limitations she has to deal with:

1) Her mind will be read fully pretty much every day, and on random occasion several times per day

2) Her superiors, subordinates and pretty much everyone else are working pretty hard to stop the world from ending, they just don't know they have a traitor working against them

3) For the last several years before the apocalypse, the people around her will also know that the precognition can be combined with freezing time. They just think she reported it the second she found out about it (Which agrees with her memories... Most of the time)

4) You can change the future after having seen it, but that depends on /your/ actions. You can't see what would happen if someone else, unrelated to your actions, decides to do something else. If you imagine freezing yourself to see what will happen in ten minutes, the future you see is the one in the world where you froze yourself and didn't go off to do anything else

So, important things I have already decided to have her do:

1) Arrange for the death of every single person in the world other than her who has both precognition /and/ the ability to read minds. They are both really rare powers, and it's nearly unheard of for anyone to have both. Never the less, she looks /real/ close for anyone who does and eliminates them.

2) The empire knows toward the end that they can look further into the future by freezing time viewers in time, but they don't know that she and she alone can read these visions in others' minds. Therefore, she knows everything they have predicted about the future, but they don't know everything she has predicted.

3) By commanding a mind reader to read her own mind after she freezes and unfreezes time for them, she can read the mind of her future self.

4) By precommitting to make random things go poorly for those around her in timelines where things don't work out to her advantage, she makes the main players gravitate toward choosing futures she likes. For example, say the queens want to look at a potential future where they execute this or that powerful subject they have, just to see what happens, who is plotting against them or has skeletons in the closet, etc. She would have set up a dead man's switch for random things to go poorly if she were to die and stop undoing those plans. Think Voldemort in HPMOR setting up the Blood Fort sacrifice to murder hundreds of students, all the while planning to cancel the ritual as long as he wasn't stopped from doing so. By making it appear that things would get visibly worse if she died and stopped being a helpful non-threatening bureaucrat, she closes out futures where she is executed as a precaution.

...Geesh. That's a lot of information. So, is it believable for her to succeed with her plans here? This all happens hundreds of years before my books actually begin. In the first book, my characters end up isolated and stuck in the ruins of the capital of this empire, and figure out /some/ of what happened there leading up to the apocalypse. And also, toward the end of the first book it becomes clear that she set a few things in motion that have yet to play out, even though she died hundreds of years ago.

I want to make sure readers aren't annoyed and feel like this woman couldn't possibly have succeeded in sabotaging all the empire's efforts to avert the end of their civilization. So really, what I'm looking for is, after reading through all this, is there anything you can think of that I might have missed about how she is more vulnerable than I imagine her? Does this all have some weakness I didn't think of? And also just in general, given the powers involved here, is there any cool shit that should definitely be happening that it sounds like I missed?
