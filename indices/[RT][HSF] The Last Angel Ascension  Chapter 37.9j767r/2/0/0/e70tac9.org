Fair enough is not really kin to the fifth element and the like. Now you made me think where would i put it in a library.

If the library separates scifi from litarature? This would sit nicely besides Old Man War and the Lost Fleet. Militaty scifi.

If the library divides by how the book pulls you in, what feeling uses to keep you reading, this is a mistery novel with a bit of horror for the first part. Like the harry potter books are mistery novels at their heart, this draw you with questions of what happened to the ship after the prologue or what will happen to the cadets.

Still and excelent novel, if i werent as broke as i am i would donate to the authors patreon without a doubt.

I dont know what stonepunk story are you talking about but if you kindly point me in that direction i will give it a look.
