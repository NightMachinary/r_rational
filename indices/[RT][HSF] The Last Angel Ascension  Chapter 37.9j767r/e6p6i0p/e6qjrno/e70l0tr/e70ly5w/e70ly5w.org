Sure. But, I wouldn't call it a Space Opera.

Or, rather, I wouldn't call both it and Fifth Element or Valerian space operas. It's not hard like a Benford, but it is a universe with a series of exploitable (and exploited), well-defined fake physics.

So, guess that makes it just SF? I'll tag it that way next time.

PS - Oh! I think that does make the Stonepunk story hard scifi?
