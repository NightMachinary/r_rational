To get to the bottom of Moh's mineral you've got to be talc, which is pretty solid stuff compared to non-minerals like cotton or fat and even colloid minerals like wet clay.

This /is/ space opera. Reconstructed, rational space opera. /Hard/ space opera, even, by the standards of that genre. I'm just not not sure it's mineral-hard sci-fi. Still, if you'd said DC that would give people less clue about genre and this is absolutely a genre piece.
