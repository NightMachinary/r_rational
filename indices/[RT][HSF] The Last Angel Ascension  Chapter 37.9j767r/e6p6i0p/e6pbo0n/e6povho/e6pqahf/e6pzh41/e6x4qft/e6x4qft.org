I have a feeling your professor is exaggerating, and doesn't realize most students might not have the context to understand the exaggeration. Otherwise I wouldn't be around to tell you this (I used to work on & maintain equipment that was designed with plasma modeling techniques) and you wouldn't have such a nice or cheap computer to have this conversation (semiconductor manufacturing uses equipment that yadda yadda)
