quite enjoying last angel. My only objection so far is the scene where the captain plays chess with Red. Her objection that Red is "cheating" is pretty silly, as is the idea that the captain should expect to be able to win at all. Chess AI are already way beyond what humans can compete with, and I'd expect a futuristic supercomputer to surpass our current state of the art. This would have been common knowledge even in 2013 when this was written. It would be better if the author had just invented a novel strategy game rather than reference chess without having much knowledge of it.
