Talc isn't that hard to scratch with anything that looks even vaguely like a rock. Neither is gypsum. There's a healthy chunk of stuff that's still approachable and entertaining. Niven and Pournelle are more than chalky enough, for example, without being able to survive abuse from orthoclase feldspar.

FTL is only one of The Last Angel's sins, there's a uniformity and familiarity to alien culture, they all breathe the same atmosphere, they're mostly biologically compatible and can eat many of the same foods. Language compatibility. Space battles that are designed to be fun rather than make a lot of scientific sense.

I /love/ it, mind you. It's also strong rational in that the author has done both world and story design homework. Things make a deeply satisfying narrative sense, without much in the way of holes. Please enjoy responsibly.

(...and, as mentioned elsewhere, this is a sequel to a previous work and spoils a lot of the surprises of that one early. Make sure to read it first.)
