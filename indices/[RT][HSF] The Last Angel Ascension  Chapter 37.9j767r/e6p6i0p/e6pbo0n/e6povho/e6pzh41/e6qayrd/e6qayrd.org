Agreed. Also the dark futures of Greg Bear, some of which are practically topaz.

If you want to ease your way in on the crumbly end, there's always Neal Stephenson and Michael Crichton. They aspire to hardness, and give a sense of what you'd be getting yourself into if you went in search of hard sci-fi.

I guess that's my critique of realism in Last Angel: It aspires to be great war fiction, great space pirate fiction, great haunted house fiction. Hardness isn't the goal at all, and if it would come into conflict with any of those other goals it's perfectly happy to develop scratches.
