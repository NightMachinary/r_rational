Sorry but I just can't empathize with your viewpoint. Maybe it is because I am already pretty sure that free will as many people imagine it is probably not only not real, but doesn't make any logical sense to begin with. And yet this doesn't make me any less happy as far as I can discern. After all you yourself said "there's no real difference with the two, deterministic and free will. If they were switched each day, nobody would actually notice." so why would it matter to know for sure one way or the other? Except that such a clarity may have at least some potential to model other people's behaviors and desires in "my ordinary world" thus maybe leading me towards better serving the happiness of myself and those I care about.

  The universe is entropic, biased toward negativity, either that or your brain is, since your brain is the only thing with a concept of negativity.

But these are things I , and most other people moderately versed in naturalistic cosmology, already know. Yet I seem to be happy enough on an average day. Why would understanding these things even better make me unhappy?

  If you took a pill that would make you know everything, chances are you would be depressed.

I don't think that OP's hypothetical pill is supposed to give instant omniscience or anything of the like. We are just talking about a general increase in mental faculties that, even if it is by a factor of ten, would still be very far from omniscience.

But even if the pill contained the knowledge and truth about everything and anything it would also contain the knowledge of how to fix my own unhappiness, along with all kinds of things that could improve the human condition by levels that may well be worth my sacrifice of happiness even if the truth turns out to be that I can never make myself happy again.

In any case such an omniscience pill would have to rewire my brain so much just to comprehend it that I am not even sure that concepts such as happiness/unhappiness would even still apply to me. I would essentially be one-third God after all.
