I'd be really interested in the other 5% then. But yes, a 95% chance to make you mentally unstable and suicidal would be one of those side effects that would prevent me from taking the drug. Just like I wouldn't take it if it were to "merely" poison and kill me within a year.

I don't see how that is relevant to not wanting to take an intelligence enhancing rug merely /because/ it makes you smarter and/or reveals additional knowledge to you.
