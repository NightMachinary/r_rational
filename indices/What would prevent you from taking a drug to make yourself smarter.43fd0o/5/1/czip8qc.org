  any increase in intelligence is sort of self-justifying in that you can then look back on who/what you were before and would feel no desire to return to it, due to how your perspective has expanded.

Isn't the problem with that the fact that the changed you may not have the same views as the current you, and thus may find things you would find abhorrent now to be fine? Suppose a side effect was that you now found most forms of murder to be ethically ok; or at least, you didn't care about them happening. You wouldn't want to return to your previous state, but that would still be a change for the worse.
