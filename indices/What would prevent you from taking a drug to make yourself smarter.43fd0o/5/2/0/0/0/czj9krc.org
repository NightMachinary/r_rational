A business card. I write [[http://www.inkitt.com/alexbeyman][short stories]] which point to my paid, published work. If someone I meet is interested, they can swipe their phone on my hand and that page comes up on it. Saves me from having to write down or spell out for them as they make note of it somewhere for later. It's also more likely to stick out in their mind, and thus get read, this way.
