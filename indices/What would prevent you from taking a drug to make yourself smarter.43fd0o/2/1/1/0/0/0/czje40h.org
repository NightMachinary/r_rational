It creates a separate class, one that is /specifically/ defined as systematically intellectually /superior/ (by society, not just by an individual). Assuming that the initial trend illustrated in OP holds up, there will be an abundance of evidence that the boosted "just win" / are "just better" / "advance humanity more". While it remains the case that the population isn't composed entirely of boosted, that's the justification right there.
