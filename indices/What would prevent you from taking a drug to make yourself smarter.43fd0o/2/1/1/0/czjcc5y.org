.. What? Of course everyone actually are automatons, so what? I regret I have only one downvote to give.

Consider the level of boosting we are talking about. It's specifically significant; it's not just slightly smarter (which can be illusory in a sense that intelligence is made up of multiple skills, you can be bad at some of those and still 'look smart').

This is exactly the same argument that is used in discussion about AI existential risk. When the difference gets large enough, it creates an objective justification for classism. (or in other words, when you are relatively equal in the 'size of the lever' you wield, you don't have any solid reason to consider others as beneath you... but when you have much more power to achieve things, you actually do have a *very* real reason to consider them beneath you. Instead of just being a deluded teenager who thinks their particular talents are more important than they actually are, you and they both could easily see that in an objective sense you actually do outclass them -- perform *systematically* and *cumulatively* better than they do. It's not at all complicated to see why that could turn into a game -- we already have plenty of examples of it : parents vs their kids)

This argument won't occur to all of the boosted. But it would be quite strange if it didn't occur to some of them, and hence, quite strange if it didn't appear to promote sociopathy/psychopathy to some measurable degree.
