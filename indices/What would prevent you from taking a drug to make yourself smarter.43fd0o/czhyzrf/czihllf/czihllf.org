It seems problematic, to me, to assume that the mental boost itself wouldn't qualify here. That subtle shift you suggest seems like a direct consequence, not a side effect, as the boosting effects really would make un-boosted humans more like ants -- programmed automatons. It would definitely make it harder to relate to those who aren't boosted -- social interaction would -not- be on an even basis, and it would become even more imbalanced as the gains compound.

Social interaction becoming purely a too-easy game that the boosted are nonetheless required to play, seems to me a likely outcome, and of course when you're stuck with something too easy you start experimenting to make it more interesting.
