You make an interesting point. I guess what I would mean is that there is some 'ideal' version of me that is smarter, and then various shades of 'not-me' that gain/lose various positive/negative characteristics that I would rather not slide towards. I'm not sure if this makes any more sense. This is kind of like a genie's wish - even if I could state what I wanted, what I really want is for my 'wish' to be interpreted intelligently on a higher level to best satisfy myself in a way I might not have explicitly been able to state.
