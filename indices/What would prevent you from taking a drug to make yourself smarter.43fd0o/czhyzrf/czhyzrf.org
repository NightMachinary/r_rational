I think I would be afraid to take it if it changed who I was. Maybe it subtly shifts users towards socio/psychopathy? Like someone else mentioned, if it causes addiction or death, that can be fixed by an intelligent doctor. Behavioral shifts would be harder to detect, I think. I don't want to lose who I am.
