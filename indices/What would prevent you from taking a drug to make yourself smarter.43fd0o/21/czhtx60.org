In a world where this drug exists and is common, there is less motivation to take it - if I don't take it, somebody else will, and they will solve whichever problem I wanted to solve. So, let's assume only a really small number of people (including me) get any benefits from it. What would stop me? X= horrible levels of depression and suicidal urges or X = complete paralysis and blindness. Something like that.
