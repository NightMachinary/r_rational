Honestly, the only thing that would stop me from taking that drug would be a problem I wouldn't be able to get rid of either by stopping, or by using my new found intelligence. After all, what would stop a doctor from taking the drug and curing the addiction with his boosted intellect? Or figuring out how to counteract the affects of withdrawal? Only if X couldn't be solved by increased intelligence, and couldn't be gotten rid of by halting your use of the drug, would I not take that pill.
