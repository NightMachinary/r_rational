Isolation. Frankly, the smarter I am the less people I can properly connect with on a complete and genuine level without feeling like I have to wait for them to catch up. If a decent proportion of the population were doing it, then that's fine I could just hang out with them. Otherwise though, it's not really worth it to me.
