  Is it more rational to have an faith derived viewpoint and live happier or to take the pill and gain higher intelligence, making you abandon the viewpoint and therefore abandon some enjoyment of life.

What?

  Assuming you're an atheist, it would be better to go on believing a slightly foolish thing that makes you much happier than to spend your limited life years less happy because of a significant but ultimately futile truth.

Oh, this foolishness. Look, sound utility functions are over /world-states/, not mental-states (that's why hedonic utilitarianism is such bullshit in the first place). Decoupling my mental state from the state of the real world /doesn't help anything, ever./

  If you took a pill that would make you know everything, chances are you would be depressed. The universe is entropic, biased toward negativity, either that or your brain is, since your brain is the only thing with a concept of negativity.

Well, negativity bias in human minds is definitely a thing. We do use utility-weighted sampling to imagine things, after all. But also, if I knew /everything/, I'd probably try to rig myself a new Big Bang.
