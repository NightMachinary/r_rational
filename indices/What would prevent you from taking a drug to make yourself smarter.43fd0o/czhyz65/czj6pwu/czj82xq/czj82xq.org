Oh, but it is. Is it more rational to have an faith derived viewpoint and live happier or to take the pill and gain higher intelligence, making you abandon the viewpoint and therefore abandon some enjoyment of life.

Take the argument of free will. Imagine that you're a person who believes in it. You take pride in this, you're happy. Then you take the pill. Suddenly, you're so intelligent that the truth is clear (just assuming this is) there is no free will. Suddenly, you're a lot less happy. See, there's no real difference with the two, deterministic and free will. If they were switched each day, nobody would actually notice. You can do what you will, but not will what you will. Seeing that the distinction is useless really, as well as 99% of information about anything outside of your ordinary world. Assuming you're an atheist, it would be better to go on believing a slightly foolish thing that makes you much happier than to spend your limited life years less happy because of a significant but ultimately futile truth.

If you took a pill that would make you know everything, chances are you would be depressed. The universe is entropic, biased toward negativity, either that or your brain is, since your brain is the only thing with a concept of negativity.
