Mostly all of them currently. The racetams I'm not on currently, but I'm just in an off-cycle.

Nootropics for beginners : there's a couple ways to approach this. Nootropics are generally broken down into pharmaceutical and nutraceutical. I would suggest choosing which angle you are most comfortable with - do your research (I suggest examine.com as the best source of impartial information on supplements period), check out [[/r/nootropics]] and get some ideas. Start slow and try each ingredient by itself before adding it to your stack.

The other option is to buy one of the pre-made stacks that companies sell. There are downsides ; you don't learn nearly as much about nootropics because you never research, measure, change, and create your own stacks, every body is different and will respond optimally to slightly different doses, if you make your own stacks you can personalize it to your biology - you can't do this with pre-mades-, there's also the possibility of quality changes, fake ingredients, or scummy businesses in the "natural health market" (there are many issues here). Despite that, I do use one pre-made stack right now for a couple reasons: I know the owners of the company, and am relatively confident that it's all high quality ingredients, it saves me time and money making my own stack (involves 10+ good nootropics, which are a pain to source, measure, and cap myself), and it's also an affiliate company, so I can make a bit of $ from referrals. I still add additional nootropics to the pre-made, as it's not a perfect product yet.

Lots of it can be placebo (and what's wrong with that if it works?), but there are a ton of studies that show quantitative increases in many cognitive functions from a slew of different nootropics, again check out [[http://www.examine.com][www.examine.com]] and look up any of the things I posted before - look at the human effect matrix, it's awesome. I of course have a ton of anecdotal stories from people who have taken nootropics, but I prefer the research side as weight.

Actual effect? Increased cognitive functions across the board (depends what you're taking!) attention, memory, reaction time, learning, comprehension, alertness, anxiety decrease, stress decrease, depression decrease. Plus, you can get physical effects from them as well - increased endurance, decreased heat & cold sensitivity, increased oxygen absorption, etc. Anywhere from a 1-15% increase if I were to generalize (the pre-made I'm on has shown a 7.52% increase in memory, attention, and learning speed, for example). Enough that you can notice a difference in your life (absolutely!) but not enough that you're suddenly a polyglot photographic memory genius - unfortunately.
