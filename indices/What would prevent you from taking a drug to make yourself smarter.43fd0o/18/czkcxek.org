Maybe as price for getting smarter, you later get dumber. The drug temporarily, but extremely raises your cognitive capabilities, but as an aftereffect your average value of intelligence permanently drops. So basically in-short term it makes you super-smart, but in long term your mind gets more and more dull.

TL:DR The higher you fly, the harder you fall.
