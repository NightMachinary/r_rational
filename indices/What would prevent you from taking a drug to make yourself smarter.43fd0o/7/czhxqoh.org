If I could reasonably expect that utility*time would decrease, then I'd avoid them. If I could reasonably expect utility*time to only marginally increase, I'd probably still avoid them, because humans have a tendency to be too optimistic anyways. I'm also pretty uncomfortable with mind altering substances in general, so I'd need to take that into account, as using the drug would inherently lower my utility.

It would probably be a moot point pretty quickly anyways, though. At that level of intelligence boost, I know other people would be more than willing to take them, and I believe the people who have access to that drug (assuming I can get access) would probably have similar ethics to mine anyways, so I could just be a free rider to whatever progress they make.
