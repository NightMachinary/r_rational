If it's widely available, then it seems like you'd have to take it to stay competitive.

Things that would prevent me from taking it...

- Particularly bad withdrawl symptoms, combined with the drug not staying 'fresh' very long, and uncertainty regarding future availability

- High risk of long term mental problems (EG: Dementia, depression, etc), combined with the drug itself being not very popular. (If a large number of people are taking it, then the market for solutions to problems it generates will be large, and the problems are likely to be solved)

- Aggressively shortened lifespan. I'd probably be willing to lose 20-25 years in exchange for a miracle drug of that nature, but much more then that and I'd begin second guessing this.
