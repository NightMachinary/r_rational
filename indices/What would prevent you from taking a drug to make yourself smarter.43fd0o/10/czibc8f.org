If it significantly changed my values. If users had severe/minor but lasting changes in their personality that made them /different/ as a person afterwards, that would give me pause. If it's as great as in your examples, it would have to be pretty significant changes, but if users tended to, say, lose interest in friends and family/dramatically change political/religious/ethical views, it would be a tough choice. Even if I didn't use it, though, I'd keep it at hand in case there was a sudden change in circumstances.
