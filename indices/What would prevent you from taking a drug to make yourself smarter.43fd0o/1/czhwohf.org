I don't know if their is something that would stop me. With the level of boost you are talking about, even if it killed me I might still take it. I've never considered myself particularly intelligent, but if it could let an average Joe like me jump humanity forward a substantial amount then I would take it. death is bad but since it seems like I will not be alive by the time we figure out immortality, then it is better I try to make us get to that point faster.

The above is my gut reaction answer, but really taking time to think about it... I don't know. I don't know how bad the penalty would have to be, or if I even would have the will power to apply myself and accomplish anything important after taking the drug.

The things that wound give me pause on whether or not to take it...

- A huge diminish in life span (kills you in a year or so)
- Permanent mental disability (dementia or being unable to care for the well being of others)
- Loss of control of body (being unable to move and only able to think)
