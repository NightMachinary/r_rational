Has anyone in-universe explored the possibility of using psychic types to telekinetically maneuver, lock, and throw pokeballs into place from afar? (or else use their own tk-powers?). It seems pokeballs provide a hard counter to the majority of pokemon without instant-kill auras, and even if they can't fit (e.g. great & heavy balls needed for Shiftry and Onix), don't they still briefly absorb their targets and, upon failure, leave the uncaptured pokemon slightly disoriented? An unceasing barrage of capture-failure could provide valuable opportunity for force concentration, repositioning, or escape, or else even just hide the more expensive ultra balls amid cheaper pokeball decoys. I can see why e.g. mechanical launchers don't work (with the close-proximity lock-on requirement), but any old Kadabra should be able to float some balls near a target, press a button, and send locked-on pokemon-seeking missiles forward a few seconds later?

Non-psychic pokemon might work, too -- humans may be [[https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12267][fairly exceptional throwers]], but give a fast, nimble, prehensile pokemon a ball and have it run up and do the delicate, dangerous work of pokemon-capture for you. It doesn't seem like there'd be a risk of it getting sucked in itself, since iirc pokeball technology is just as compatible with humans as it is with pokemon (just with the TBI being more obvious and debilitating for human subjects)?

edit: also, what's the word on [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Weaponry_in_the_Pok%C3%A9mon_world][other technological weaponry]] in this fic? Humans and pokemon have supernatural durability, sure, but they're not literally bulletproof, are they? And if, idk, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate#From_caves][Zubat poop]] doesn't work for black powder, could you still harness the rapid expansion of an exploding Voltorb to propel a piece of metal down another metal cylinder at high speeds? Also, the legendary birds are always flying and never land, right? b/c otherwise, couldn't you [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_artificial_non-nuclear_explosions][strap a bunch of Electrode together]] and have some tamed Dragonite drop them down from a mile up (with maybe some teleporting psychic types to provide barriers from auto-kill auras and steering until contact)? (even if this doesn't work, I wouldn't mind an interlude/omake chapter detailing its failure, similar to e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898446/1/Weaver-Nine][Weaver Nine]]'s initial attempts to kill Leviathan)
