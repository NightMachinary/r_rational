  It feels like it stretches the bounds of what a trained pokemon can be taught to do, since it requires not just getting within a certain range of an enemy without attacking, but then to hold the ball in a particular way until they hear a sound, then throw the ball at the pokemon. I'll probably include it in some way at some point :)
