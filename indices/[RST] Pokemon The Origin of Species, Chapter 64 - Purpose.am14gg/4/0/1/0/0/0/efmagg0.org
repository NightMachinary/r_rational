It was really just a matter of thinking up all the ways to munchkin pokeball tech (dropping them en mass on top of pokemon from a helicopter or pidgeot, shooting them from slingshots from far away, spamming throws to keep them distracted even if they don't get caught) and then realizing they would very quickly break the world/fantasy, so I had to come up with a reason why you have to be close to the pokemon you're catching, keep them more-or-less still/weakened, etc.
