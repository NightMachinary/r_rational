  Human psychics' telekinetic range helps capture pokemon slightly farther away, but not meaningfully so, and it requires a lot of concentration. For pokemon, even very intelligent ones, TK is very hard to train with that kind of finesse.

Gotcha -- I guess we haven't seen to many overt displays of telekenesis yet, but I always picture the dexterity needed to maneuver a pokeball to be pretty basic (on par with e.g. eating with a spoon, or folding clothes, or sweeping with a broom -- without causing significant harm to self or others). But maybe here that level of control is less common, and tk-powers are better suited for coarse application of blunt force (I guess [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Psycho_Cut_(move)][psycho cut]] is a move, but only a handful of pokemon can learn it through leveling up -- maybe most psychic power can only apply force over large areas? though then it seems you can just construct a lightweight mechanical shell to transmit that force to the underlying pokeball, or else just use the telekenesis the more stealthily position the ball and leave other functions to radio control? you mention in a later comment that drones have been used but are annoying -- is that because the small blade length means that they're really noisy like IRL drones? cos then maybe telekinesis can substitute for the blades, assuming the relevant abilities are strong enough to support a few lbs of weight (which I feel they'd have to be to allow coarse combat application)).

  stretches the bounds of what a trained pokemon can be taught to do

I think I remember reading in an earlier thread that "smarter" Pokemon are only about as intelligent as chimpanzees, but then I figured most of the other ones to be at about the level of a dog? especially with the automated digital training/brainwashing technologies. I feel like most service animals can carry out multi-part commands, and are limited more by their lack of e.g. grasping ability.

  I've considered a chapter like this at some point, mostly as a result of Blue doing research on ways to deal with them

That'd be neat! On a more gruesome note, how is rapid expansion handled here (e.g. during release from a pokeball, or when Wailmer evolves to Wailord)? Specifically, say you encase a pokeball in larger ball with thick steel walls and small internal volume, and then release the pokemon held inside (or trigger its evolution via hormone / rare candy injection, or something). Would the interior's pressure swell to astronomical levels, leading to explosive decompression if the shell is breached? IDK the exact physics/math involved but I can imagine creating quite powerful bombs in this way.
