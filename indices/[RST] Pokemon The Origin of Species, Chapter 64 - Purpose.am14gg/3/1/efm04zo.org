Hmm its not totally inconceivable. I know part of what makes teenagers teenagers is that their hormones turn all feelings and emotions up to 11. So generalist emotion amplifiers aren't that unrealistic. Also, I'm pretty sure that if you start feeling something you're brain will try to come up with reasons to justify it. So like a kid in a dark room or like people living in what they think is a haunted house, it might just project a general negative feeling, amplifies that, and then the brain justifies it somehow. Its weird though because it seems to effect Dark people as well, and this sort of thing seems like a Psychic thing.
