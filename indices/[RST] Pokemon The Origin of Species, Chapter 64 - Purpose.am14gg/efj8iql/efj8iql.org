Why are so many people using water-type pokemon? Blue even says that his wartortle is the obvious choice. Just because it's raining and they're good in the rain? I'd expect rock-types to be the default in case of any stray lightning bolts, as well as to deal with all the flying-types.

EDIT: Hell YES, Blue has a Snorlax. Very badass.
