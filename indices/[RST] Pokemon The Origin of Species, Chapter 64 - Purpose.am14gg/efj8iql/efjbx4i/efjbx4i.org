Rainfall does [[https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rain#In_battle][boost the power of water-type attacks]] lol.

My understanding was that most of the rampaging Pokemon weren't electric types themselves, but rather drawn from the surrounding area, and Vermillion is right next to e.g. Diglett cave, which would have extra local ground/rock Pokemon (there are also lots of Ponyta and Rapidash about, it seems)? Alternatively, maybe being on the water means Vermillion trainers have more opportunity to catch powerful water types? I think this was the story where rock types experienced painful contact dermatitis upon exposure to water, so they'd probably be the worst to choose here.

As for electric types -- gameplay dictates rain to improve the accuracy of those moves, but wasn't this also the story where electric attacks work by intentionally ionizing the path between source and target? Maybe the rain interferes with that? Or would get drawn to all the lightning rods? Or would attract the attention of Zapdos? (in the games it did roost in the Kanto Power Plant).

In Blue's case, it might be the obvious choice just b/c it's his best trained, most powerful Pokemon (again IIRC).
