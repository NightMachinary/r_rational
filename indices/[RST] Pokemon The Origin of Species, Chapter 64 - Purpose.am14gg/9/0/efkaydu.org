Well, I don't watch the anime anymore, but that stopped long time ago and has more to do with repetitive plots and poor/non-existent character growth. I'm feeling less motivated to keep playing the games, but mostly because their stories are also really bad and the challenge is almost non-existant outside of nuzlockes.

So I don't think it's the unrealism that is the primary problem in my enjoyment of the franchise, and while I would love a more rational pokemon show or game, I mostly just want a well written and mature one at this point :)
