well, as I wrote in the first post, we are currently on release 18 and there are two more planned until the game is completed (though one of them might already be sort of post-game). So I guess, 90% done. There really is a lot of content available already, do note that the elite four are not at level 60 or something like that, the game uses the full level range, I expect everything to be at 100 by then.
