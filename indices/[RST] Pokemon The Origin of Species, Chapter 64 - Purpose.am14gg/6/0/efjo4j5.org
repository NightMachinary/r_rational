In my world Water pokemon are constantly replenished in the rain, which allows them to be pretty deadly, since running out of water is their major weakness in most engagements.

As for rock pokemon, like [[/u/phylogenik]] points out, they're basically allergic to water. Being in the rain is fairly torturous for them and drastically reduces their usability.
