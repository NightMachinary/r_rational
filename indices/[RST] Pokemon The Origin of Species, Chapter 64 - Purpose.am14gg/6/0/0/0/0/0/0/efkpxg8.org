Yeah, if anything that sounds like a poison attack.

What about salinity or temperature? We have Brine and Scald attacks already. If Electric types instinctively modulate their charge to effectively attack their chosen targets, might water types be modifying the quality and content of their water streams to ensure effectiveness against their natural prey? They must surely be doing something like that to effect the Muddy Water and Octazooka attacks.
