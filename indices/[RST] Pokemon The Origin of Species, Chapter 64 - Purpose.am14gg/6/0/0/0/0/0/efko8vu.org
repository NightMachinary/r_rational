I've thought about that, ideas like "living water" as being water that biologically contains some bacteria or something from the pokemon it was inside, but it gets complicated quick in terms of pokemon regaining their water mid-battle and it still being as effective. Plus it makes for far less non-pokemon related munchkinry.
