  Has anyone in-universe explored the possibility of using psychic types to telekinetically maneuver, lock, and throw pokeballs into place from afar? (or else use their own tk-powers?)
#+end_quote

This is, in fact, Giovanni's foremost plan with Mewtwo :) Human psychics' telekinetic range helps capture pokemon slightly farther away, but not meaningfully so, and it requires a lot of concentration. For pokemon, even very intelligent ones, TK is very hard to train with that kind of finesse.

  but give a fast, nimble, prehensile pokemon a ball and have it run up and do the delicate, dangerous work of pokemon-capture for you.

I've toyed with using mankey or machop as "long range pokeball throwers." It feels like it stretches the bounds of what a trained pokemon can be taught to do, since it requires not just getting within a certain range of an enemy without attacking, but then to hold the ball in a particular way until they hear a sound, then throw the ball at the pokemon. I'll probably include it in some way at some point.

  even if this doesn't work, I wouldn't mind an interlude/omake chapter detailing its failure

I've considered a chapter like this at some point, mostly as a result of Blue doing research on ways to deal with them.
