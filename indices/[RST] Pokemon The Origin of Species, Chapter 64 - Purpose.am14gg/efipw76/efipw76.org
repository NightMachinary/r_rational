The whole chapter I was waiting for Red to come out of the shadows, carrying Leaf, looking worse for wear and possibly just passing out. Blue is in for one hell of a surprise when he finds out how nightmarish their experience was compared to his.

I'll admit I fist pumped when I saw it was a Blue chapter! Man, it's been nearly a year since one of those. Lots of respect for him for not pulling a Shounen Protagonist(tm) and breaking rank to Make Something Of Himself. Sometimes the best you can do is just hunker down and help out where you can.
