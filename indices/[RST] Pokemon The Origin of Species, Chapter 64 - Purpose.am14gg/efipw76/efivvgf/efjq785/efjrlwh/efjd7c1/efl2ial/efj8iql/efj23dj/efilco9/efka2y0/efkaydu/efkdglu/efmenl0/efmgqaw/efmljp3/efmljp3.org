I have 140h of playtime currently, and am in the content that was added in episode (aka release) 17. The game is released up to episode 18, with afaik one or two more releases until completion. My Pokemon's level cap is at 85 currently, but I don't expect the game to be finished just as one reaches 100. I am avoiding spoilers for the content I haven't reached yet, but I think most pokemon bar legendaries are obtainable at this point, and all of the major overhauls of the game are done, so savegame continuity across episodes should be fairly certain as the releases happen. The development is fairly slow, but there is a /lot/ of content already available, and there is QA and backward compatibility to make sure people can just keep playing as the releases happen. In theory, I could have dug out my old savegames from ep.15 a couple years prior, when I picked the game up again last fall, I just wanted to replay it all since I had forgotten quite a few things.
