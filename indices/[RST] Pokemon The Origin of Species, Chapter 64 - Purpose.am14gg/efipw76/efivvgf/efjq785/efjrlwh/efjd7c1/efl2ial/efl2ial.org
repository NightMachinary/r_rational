I've been following this story for maybe a year now, but I don't think I've ever actually left a comment before. I used to like Pokemon, and then I guess I grew up a little too much - but there are times when this story makes me feel like I did when I was playing HG for the first time.

And I feel like that's entirely the point: the Pokemon games exist as sims in TOoS' world, but reality is infinitely more complex, and this is a story about some kids facing these complexities for the first time - all the way up to the Stormbringers, these force-of-nature spectres of death that overshadow the entire story. It's a coming of age story, but it feels so unlike every other coming of age story I've come across.

Looking forward to the next chapter, as always.
