This seems like an opportunity to plug [[http://www.rebornevo.com/index.php?/pr/download/][Reborn]], a fan-made game with many years of development backing it. It solves a lot of the problems of the original games, most notably the lack of difficulty - it can be quite fiendish, at times, like a pokemon/dark souls crossover. The story is also more than set dressing, much better than in the original games for sure, although that is a bit more of a matter of taste (I like some bits of the writing quite well, others felt more mediocre, but still head and shoulders above the originals).

​

I am currently on a play-through nearing the endgame, and seriously, the game is worth the time for me. It is amazing how much depth there is to the mechanics of pokemon, and a pleasure to actually need to creatively explore those to progress through the game instead of "just level your starter".

​

I have personally run Reborn on PC and Linux (using Wine, but still playable on a very weak machine) and can only recommend it for those here who enjoy complex mechanics and/or feel nostalgia for pokemon, but want to be challenged. The game is made for mature humans, there are some fairly dark moments/themes that get explored through the story and some innuendo in dialogues, but the game does (imo) a fairly good job of treating those things with respect. If anyone would like further information, feel free to drop me a PM :)
