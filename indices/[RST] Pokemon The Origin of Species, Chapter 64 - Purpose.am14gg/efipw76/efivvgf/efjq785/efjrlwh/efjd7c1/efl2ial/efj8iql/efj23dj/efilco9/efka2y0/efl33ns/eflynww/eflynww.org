My position so far is baaasically "no, that's a game conceit."

There are some ideas I've played with in terms of what natural processes are similar to the idea of trading pokemon, like traveling great distances to new climates or feelings of loss, but none of them really work and introduce obvious munchkinry that trivializes them.
