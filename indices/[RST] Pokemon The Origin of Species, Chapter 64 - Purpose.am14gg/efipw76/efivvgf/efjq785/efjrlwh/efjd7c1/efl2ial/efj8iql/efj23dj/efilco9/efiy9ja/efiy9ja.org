I was imagining something that, for example, obstructs like 80% of an alleyway; the idea being to funnel Pokemon into narrower spaces to allow the defenders to defeat them in detail. The panicked rush away from the Pressure seems to cause them to rampage destructively only when there's an obstacle directly blocking them, and crowd control barriers, while not effective against everything (e.g. the scyther that popped over one), /help/.
