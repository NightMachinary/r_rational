Sorry, not entirely certain what you mean by game-progress, but all the leaders and most or all of the elite for are introduced as part of the story, yeah. You can currently attain 17 out of a total of 18 badges, but that isn't a particularly useful metric, really, as there also happens quite a lot of stuff outside of gym battles, and the leaders are not the only challenges to overcome (though they certainly are challenging). I am happy to provide more answers, but I am not quite sure what you want to know - are you taking about how close the game is to being fully completed?
