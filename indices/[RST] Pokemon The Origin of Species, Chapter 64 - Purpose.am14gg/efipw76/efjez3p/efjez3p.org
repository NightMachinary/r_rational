Blue may be in for a rude shock when all the dust settles. He /did/ break off from his group without permission or even a word. That was a Mistake. Surge runs his gym in a very martial fashion, so... Yeah. That he was acting heroically and did tremendous amounts of good in the process won't erase the Mistake. Hopefully, it will mitigate the consequences.

/Sigh/ And now, having typed that, I'm debating with myself just how true I believe it to be. After all, HJPEV said that a soldier who can do nothing but follow orders is useless. Vermillion Gym isn't a true military, even if Surge has given it some of the trappings. For Blue Oak to come riding in from over the hills, capture a Snorlax from behind, and take his place at Gramps' side without breaking his stride is the very epitome of Big Damn Heroes. It doesn't matter that Gramps has done (and will probably continue to do) most of the heavy lifting in the fight. What people will notice is that they were losing ground before, and then Blue's arrival turned it around. Even if he loses status within the Gym for his behavior, it'll be nothing compared to the prestige he gains everywhere else for being the hero.
