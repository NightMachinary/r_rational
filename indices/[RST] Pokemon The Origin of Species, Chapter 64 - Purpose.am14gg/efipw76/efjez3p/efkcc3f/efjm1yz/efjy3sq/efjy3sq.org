Oh, I'm sure he will. Surge isn't a complete idiot, from what we've seen of him. He'll understand completely and still have to make some kind of statement about Blue ditching his squad in the middle of a Tier-3 event. Their stated goal was to spread the word on the evacuation and get everyone moving, and Blue didn't receive any instructions otherwise.

(I should flip back a few chapters and review the Priorities list.)

Now, obviously, you can't evacuate a stadium full of corpses, so stopping the Titanic Trio from murdering all the civilians was necessary. I'm just not sure that Blue will be seen to have made the right decision by acting as he did. Just because everything turns out in the end does NOT mean the thought processes you used to arrive at your decisions was correct. Someone who buys lottery tickets and wins is still an idiot for buying lottery tickets.
