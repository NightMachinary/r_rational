This chapter makes me wonder about the mechanics of Pressure. This is not just blanket fear, or nervousness, or cognitive disturbance. It seems to do something like "Look at all the emotions the target has. Find the one most likely to cause them to make mistakes. Power it up and focus the target's thoughts on it."

I am confused. Who, or what does the selection here? Who defines "mistakes". Something is tailoring the effect to each character. The Birds don't seem the type to be interested enough to do that, so it seems the most likely culprit is that target's brain itself. So is the target's definition of mistake used when the emotion to strengthen is found? Is the algorithm: "Make the target feel whatever feeling they fear the most"?

Let's see.

- Red: Fear of death.
- Leaf: Pokemon Guilt.
- Seto: Self-worth/guilt.
- Karen: Fear of losing.
- Blue: Fear of looking insignificant.

I don't feel it took a lot of effort to make the data match my hypothesis.

The case of Karen is especially interesting, since while the Pressure is very much harmful to her, it's not debilitating the way it is for most others. Blue's case is somewhat similar.

It is not clear to me that the Pressure in the cave exhibited such strong differentiation. Blue notes the effect being less weak this far from Zapdos, so doesn't seem like a mere matter of strength. Maybe the distance at which these features appear was too thin to notice in the smaller bubble?
