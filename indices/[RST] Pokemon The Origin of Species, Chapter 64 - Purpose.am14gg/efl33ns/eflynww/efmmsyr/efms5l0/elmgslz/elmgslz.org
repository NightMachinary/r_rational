Replying to a old thead but there is a tradeoff between gengar and alazakam.

â€‹

Gengar gains a lot of mass, thile Alakazam loses it. Gengar gains 40kg, while Zam loses about 16kg. I know, it's not exactly perfect, but it is something, specially when Haunter is supposed to weigh only 100 grams, and Kadabra is losing almost a third of its mass.
