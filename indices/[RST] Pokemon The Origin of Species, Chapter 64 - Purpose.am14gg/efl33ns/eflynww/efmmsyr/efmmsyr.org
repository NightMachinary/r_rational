It's worth noting that originally, the plan was for those pokemon to only evolve with a specific other pokemon being traded. So Machoke and Graveler would cross streams, and that's why Machamp has 4 arms, like a Graveller, and why Golem only has 2 and looks a bit like the Machoke line. Ultimately though, the idea was scrapped for being too complicated.

I dunno if that changes your thoughts on the matter, but I have relevant trivia and damn it I'm going to share it!
