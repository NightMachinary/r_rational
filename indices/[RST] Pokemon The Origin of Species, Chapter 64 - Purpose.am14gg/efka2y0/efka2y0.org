So just a question, but I was curious if your more realistic, scientific outlook affects your enjoyment of the Pok√©mon franchise. I mean, does it bother you when playing through one of the games to see how it's a pretty unrealistic fantasy world? Do you enjoy it less because it isn't based in the kind of realistic setting that your story is? or do you simply put away that kind of mind set for the sake of enjoying a game? Genuinely curious.
