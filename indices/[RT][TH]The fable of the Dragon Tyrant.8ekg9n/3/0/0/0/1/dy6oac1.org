The majority of those people, however, implicitly believe that they won't really "die". That they will instead enter another phase of existence where they retain their personal identity and will in some way be rewarded or punished for their past actions.

If such a phase really existed, really was run by a being that was admin of the universe, then yes, it would make sense to get to that phase.

Of course, people are irrational.
