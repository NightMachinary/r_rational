Well, finally CGP Grey does a proper video on death.

He did make "Why die?", but I have to say it felt strangely... flat? As though he'd just taken one of our ready-made argument lists and chanted them off in order. There was no punch to it, no turns, no real impact as far as I could tell. I was of course happy to see Grey campaign in the matter, from his considerably elevated position of publicity, but I couldn't shake the feeling that he's usually /better/ at it. I keep wondering if it was rushed in order to match Kurtzgesagt's schedule in releasing their corresponding video.

So if may, /that's more like it/.
