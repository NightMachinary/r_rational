Frankly, I think he ruined it. The whole effect of the paper is that you spend most of it going "yes yes, this is obvious, the dragon is bad, what's up with these people, what's his point?" and then you get to the "MORAL" at the end and learn it's about death, that /you're/ just like those people, and this can be a big sucker punch to your worldview.

CGP Gray left out the sucker punch. He failed to surprise the audience with the similarity to the aging situation at the end, so it's no wonder a lot of people didn't get it.
