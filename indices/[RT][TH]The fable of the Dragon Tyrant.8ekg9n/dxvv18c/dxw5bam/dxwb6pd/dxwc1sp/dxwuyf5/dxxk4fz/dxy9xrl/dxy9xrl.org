I'm well aware of the concept - sorry if I exaggerated it - I just think there's a time and a place for it, and this isn't it.

Grey has made plenty of messages, most of the kind "Here's how X works," some of the kind "Here's a reason to think Y." Because they were stated explicitly, we took them at face value and discussed them as they were. This message is largely inexplicit, but it is a message nontheless, and deserves to be taken as such.

Now, one can take the DotA view and look at the fable outside of its underlying intent, but then we're having a completely different discussion - we're treating the video as an artwork more than a message.

This isn't inherently wrong, but it brings me back to my original point. With Grey being primarily a communicator and educator, it seems we're primarily here for the "message" view, and if we don't, we ought to be obligated to wear flashing neon signs saying "Currently taking the 'artwork' view" to avoid misunderstandings. There's especially the risk of Motte-and-Baileying ourselves, with people having genuine disagreement about the intent behind the message getting mixed up with people insisting we're free to interpret the artwork however we want, leaving everyone exceptionally confused for their efforts.
