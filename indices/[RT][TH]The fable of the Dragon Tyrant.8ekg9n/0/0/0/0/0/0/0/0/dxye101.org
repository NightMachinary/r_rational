  one can take the DotA view and look at the fable outside of its underlying intent, but then we're having a completely different discussion - we're treating the video as an artwork more than a message.

True.

  With Grey being primarily a communicator and educator, it seems we're primarily here for the "message" view

I think ‘we're primarily here for the "message" view' because that's what the past history \ context of this subreddit would suggest. However, this discussion branch was about what the users in the [[/r/videos/]] were there for, and for them the answer would be at least slightly different. Not everybody browsing [[/r/videos/]] is familiar with CGP's past videos (even if many still are), and primary goal there is to go find something entertaining to watch, which would give additional validation to the “interpretation” approach.

  we ought to be obligated to wear flashing neon signs saying "Currently taking the 'artwork' view" to avoid misunderstandings

I've no definite opinion on this one ATM.
