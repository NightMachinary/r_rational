  Death of the Author as a concept is outright anathema to communication

I'd compare it more to those [[https://i.imgur.com/8nbDw5B.gifv][anamorphic]] [[https://i.imgur.com/ES9kwop.gifv][art]] [[https://i.imgur.com/CEizkY0.mp4][installations]], except since they're in the domain of ideas instead of the 3-dimensional space, there is almost an infinite number of possible interpretations to a given sculpture made out of words and ideas.

It's not that the reader [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4XT-l-_3y0][(or the writer)]] should be deliberately aiming to reach a /mis/understanding, but rather that 1. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDGMS_tjRxU][communication through words alone]] and no mutual mind-reading will inevitably end up being a lossy transfer of information, and that 2. once you have released something into the domain of public discource, you don't completely own it any more. You own the copyrights, the credits, etc, but it's no longer under your control; other people will be adding their own meanings to what you were trying to say.

And this doesn't have to be something purely bad or obstructive, especially if the author is aware of this and tries to prepare their work the best they can before releasing it.

tl;dr Everything is fanfiction.
