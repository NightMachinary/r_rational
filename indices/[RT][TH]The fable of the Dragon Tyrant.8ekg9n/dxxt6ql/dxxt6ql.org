I think the fable does not correctly describe the way our society is currently organized. Aging does not come to everyone (even the king) in the same manner. The dragon feeds way more on those that do not have the means to bribe the agents that take them to the train.

There are drugs today that cure hepatitis C but that are not affordable to the majority of people. Who is to say that a cure for aging will not be the same, and it will be affordable by everyone, irrespective to social status? It seems that a scenario like the movie Elysium is more probable than the one presented in the fable, where death is cured for everyone.
