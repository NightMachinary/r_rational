i'm always down for videos about killing death

but I kind of have this nagging annoyance that the "opposition" so to speak isn't accurately portrayed

it's not that people want to die, objectively most don't. but we have hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary knowledge of death and at best fewer than two hundred years of people having concrete evidence death may be conquerable. the "moral adviser" has no reason to believe the "dragon" can be killed, so of course their rationalization is in full swing

like, I think this allegory is poor because it doesn't accurately represent the enormity and inevitability (for now!) of death and instead portrays it as a tangible hurdle

the point is, i just don't really think oppose killing death, they just don't know how to conceptualize having a reason to believe it's possible
