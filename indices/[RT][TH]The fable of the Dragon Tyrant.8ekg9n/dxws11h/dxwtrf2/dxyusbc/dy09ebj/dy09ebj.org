That's still a misuse of the word.

But putting that aside and answering your actual point:

When people hear 'would you like to die?' they substitute it with 'would you like to die now?' and answer that, rather than answering 'would you like to die at some unknown point in next 100 years?'.

If people say 'no' to 'would you like to live forever?' then they are saying 'yes' to 'would you like to die at some point' since that's the only current alternative.
