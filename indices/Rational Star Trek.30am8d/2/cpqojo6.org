Replace away teams with expendable robots. Directly connect the crew into the computers a la the matrix in order to dramatically reduce the size of the ship. Or upload them entirely, which should be trivial compared to beaming people around. Alternately, control everything remotely if FTL communication works well enough. Disassemble the planets and use the resources to make Dyson spheres and space stations.

The question isn't what you must change. The question is what you can keep.
