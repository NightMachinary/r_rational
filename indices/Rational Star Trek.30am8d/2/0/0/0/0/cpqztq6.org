The technological imbalance I mentioned was virtual reality, not uploading. I can imagine uploading being more difficult than it seems, but we're already a good way to doing virtual reality. We have cochlear implants. How difficult can hooking up the other senses be?

Even if politics does make it impossible to disassemble Earth, the other planets should at least have been harvested. They'd block the sunlight, but shining a light at Earth so it looks like there's a sun isn't too much to ask. Certainly not in comparison to six sextillion tonnes of iron.

The sun emits 63 megawatts per square meter. This is enough to lift 50 grams of matter from Mercury using radiation pressure, which is an insanely inefficient way of doing it. It won't take long to have another square meter of solar panels, and increase the rate of building exponentially. Once you have the technology for a Dyson sphere to be possible, doing it is trivial. Considering they get vast amounts of energy from matter/antimatter annihilation, solar power seems comparatively easy.
