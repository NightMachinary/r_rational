I'm starting to understand your line of reasoning a bit more. Not to say I agree with it, but I think I can understand it.

On the point of VR vs Holodeck, I think our disagreement is more one of priorities than actual dissonant logic. You care more about the Most-Probable-Outcome for history, which has us developing VR within the next century and holodecks never being invented due to being obsolete before they arrive. I care more about preserving Trek, at the cost of improbable turns in science such as the failure to perfect safe brain interface even in the semi-distant future. Both are completely possible. One is just more likely, while the other is compatible with Trek as we know it.

In a galaxy where you can't blow up an asteroid without some piece of shrapnel hitting a Goldilocks Zone M-class planet, and where starships and space travel are more common than dirt, finding places for people to live isn't going to be enough of an issue to where Dyson Spheres become efficient, let alone necessary. I don't argue with the possibility or practicality of it. I argue that even in the future politics and humanity in general wouldn't be far-seeing enough to prepare for a thousand years later when they hit the twenty-octillion population mark and run out of uninhabited planets to colonize and terraform.

The Borg do eventually harvest matter and energy as well. They go into this a bit more in Voyager, and even more in the comics. There are Borg mega-stations that enclose small stars and gradually extract all the radiation and rare minerals from them. In the distant 128th century, when the Borg have successfully assimilated the entire galaxy, their territory has no planets or stars or black holes or any other celestial bodies. Instead, they have a vast grid of perfectly spaced and uniform mass. They just haven't gotten there yet with the Alpha Quadrant in the 24th century. And similarly, they do in fact invent a lot of new tech. The Transwarp conduits weren't assimilated from anyone. They were an original Borg creation based off of the collective scientific know-how of hundreds of other species.
