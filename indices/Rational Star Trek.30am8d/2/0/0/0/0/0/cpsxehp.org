Getting sights, sounds, etc to the person isn't the hard part of VR. The hard part is getting input from their brain, intercepting the link from head to limb so that your digital limb moves instead. I'm perfectly willing to believe that there may be some medical risk involved in that, even in the 24th century.

I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. I don't know why solar power is such a priority when there seems to be nothing short of an energy surplus in Starfleet due to the kinds of power generation they already have. If they do harvest Mars and the like, they would certainly have better things to do with those resources.
