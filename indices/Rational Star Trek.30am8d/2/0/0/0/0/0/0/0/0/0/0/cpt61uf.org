  Redshirts don't sign up because they're suicidal.
#+end_quote

No, but they're still willing to sign up even though it's dangerous. If they controlled robots remotely via VR, it would still have all those advantages, but no danger.

This is looking too much like a false dichotomy, so I want to clarify that I don't think these are the Federation's only choices. I'm just saying that if they decide to save money by giving everyone VR instead of holodecks, they won't be short on people. Unless they're already short on people. I guess we haven't established that they're not.

  culturally barren bunker within which masses of purposeless and unthinking clones can simply live, with nothing left to do or live for.
#+end_quote

You value culture? You need people to have culture. If you have more people, more cultures can thrive. Consider how much cultural diversity we have with six billion people. Now imagine how much we could have if we built a Dyson sphere that could support a septillion people. Now imagine if we did that for each star. Remember that xkcd comic about the [[https://xkcd.com/1095/][crazy straw enthusiasts]]? That would stop looking so silly. I was only suggesting clones for necessary manpower, so they would necessarily have a purpose. I personally would be in favor of increasing the population as high as possible, with the purpose of having fun.

I accept the repugnant conclusion, but I do not think it's applicable to a transhuman society. The expensive part about a person isn't that they're happy and fulfilled. It's that they have a mind. If you spend the energy to make a person, you might as well add in the tiny extra resources to connect them and their neighbors into a virtual utopia.

  I have no clue what you mean by in parallel. Could you possibly explain that a bit better?
#+end_quote

Suppose the Federation has a population of a trillion, and will exist for a billion years. Adding on another billion years is creating a new population of a trillion people for a billion years. If they instead had a population of two trillion for one billion years, it would be the same number of people, just rearranging when they lived. Unless you consider future people more important than present people, this is just as good.

  And your statement about the Borg is simply wrong.
#+end_quote

I'm not clear about the emotion part, but if they're creative, why do they only seem to be able to repurpose technology from others? I feel like the queens are the only actual people.

  And they do harvest.
#+end_quote

They harvest people. They should be able to make people. The problem is energy and mass. That's what they should be harvesting.
