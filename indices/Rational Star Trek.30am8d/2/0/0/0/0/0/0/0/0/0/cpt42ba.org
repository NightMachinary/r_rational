Redshirts don't sign up because they're suicidal. They sign up because they want to beam down to exotic alien planets and meet new forms of life. Or maybe they sign up because they're ambitious and want to become a captain one day. O'Brian was essentially a redshirt before he got promoted and became the chief engineer on Deep Space Nine. Every bridge-crew member you see was most probably a redshirt at some point in their career.

I have no clue what you mean by in parallel. Could you possibly explain that a bit better?

Your point about existential threats is basically saying that what the Federation is, at its core, dooms the galaxy to eventual destruction or invasion because it isn't spending every optimized second of manpower transforming the galaxy into an indestructible and culturally baron bunker within which masses of purposeless and unthinking clones can simply live, with nothing left to do or live for.

And your statement about the Borg is simply wrong. They have emotion and creativity on an individual level, as proven by the queens. They simply don't show it because the whole works as a heavily and severely optimized hivemind. And they do harvest. All they ever do is harvest. What do you think they mean when they say "You will be assimilated"?
