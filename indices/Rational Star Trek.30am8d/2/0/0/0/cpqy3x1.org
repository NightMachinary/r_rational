Just because a technological imbalance seems unlikely doesn't make it impossible. Someone from over a century ago would almost certainly find it odd that in 2015 we can grow a human ear on a mouse, but still don't have commonplace personal jetpacks. The brain is an adequately complicated mechanism to cause trouble interacting with even very advanced technology. For this same reason, uploading people could prove very problematic.

The rationalized Starfleet no longer has the capability of transforming energy into matter freely. Very few devices shown rely on it that couldn't work through some other less troublesome mechanic instead.

The Eiffel tower was just an example. You can't disassemble a planet without demolishing the vast majority of the things on it. Most of those things are owned by people who almost certainly wouldn't want their homes to be demolished. The opposition for such a project would be simply overwhelming, in any century. TNG even had an episode where numerous parties stood against the creation of a new continent on earth, because they didn't want their homeworld to change. Nostalgia will always stand in the way of progress in some form or another. Here's your 23rd century example.

And that's not even discussing how exactly an undertaking of that magnitude would be executed, which is preposterous even by Trek standards.
