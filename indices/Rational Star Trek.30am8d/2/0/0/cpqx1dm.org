"However, human away teams would still be desired for any necessary immediate decision-making."

That's why I have humans on the ship. They can control the robots from there. The only problem is if communications can be blocked. There also might be a speed-of-light delay. It would be hard to tell from them just talking, but it would be problematic if they're controlling robots. In that case, they just need to be on or hovering over the planet somewhere near the robots. They can still be in their own fortress.

There is no way they have the technology to create edible food from atoms, but they can't do proper VR.

The computer on a teleporter doesn't store all the information of a person, but I'm pretty sure it processes it. You'd be able to scan someone's brain and record just what you need to upload them.

Once you can get solar panels to be sufficiently cheap and efficient, you can use the power from them to harvest more matter, resulting in an exponential growth until you have a Dyson sphere.

The Earth requires ten million tonnes of resources to create one square meter of living space. I don't know politics, so I don't know how what would be required, but just leaving the planet there is insane. France can keep their Eiffel tower, but unless they plan on using the 180 billion tonnes of resources under it, I figure they're up for grabs.
