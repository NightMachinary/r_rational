Why would sending robots be considered disrespectful? And if a race were sufficiently primitive that they didn't understand the advantage of not risking lives in exploration, they are unlikely to be sufficiently advanced to be able to tell that a humaniform construct like Data (teleoperated) is not a human.

Refusing to enter a facility where communications will not be possible for teleoperations is no different in the eyes of the other race than refusing to enter an area where a live person will go out of contact. Repeater stations could be deployed where it was truly impossible to meet without entering areas with poor signal.

Your other points make a lot more sense, but I had to bounce off the disrespectfulness.
