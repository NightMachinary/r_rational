Spock was also able to mind meld with V'Ger in The Motion Picture. V'Ger is a machine. A very advanced machine, yes, but still a machine. Then there's also the fact that Troi was able to read the emotions off of Data when he first got his chip. But somehow she got nothing from the Borg, or Q for that matter unless he wanted her to. There are so many problems opened up by the telepathy in Trek that I'm almost tempted to just throw it out completely.

But then, you could also just limit it. Say Vulcans need the physical contact to do anything. That they can only read humanoid species. Same limitations given to Betaziods, with perhaps a slight proximity bonus at the cost of detail and depth.
