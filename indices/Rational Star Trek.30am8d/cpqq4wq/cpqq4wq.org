On several occasions, an accidental turn of phrase has caused the ship's computer to GENERATE strong AI. Sometimes, it is the friendly AI of Leah Brahms. Sometimes, it is the... well hell, even the Moriarty AI was fairly friendly. He only wanted the one damn thing and wasn't INTERESTED in playing the villain. He just didn't have any other cards to make anyone take him seriously, and couldn't live at the whim of people who clearly weren't taking him seriously.

The ship library will of course contain LessWrong. It will know what is meant by Friendliness. We just direct the ship to be human-Friendly, it generates a friendly AI, and we send it off crewless. Because the ship can totally do that. It can self-repair itself with transporters and replicators and tractor beams. It can self-produce with exocomps. Space is conquered for the Federation.
