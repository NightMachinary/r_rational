not saying you're wrong that it should be abandoned, but within the framework of the system, the warp factor as a measure wasn't actually arbitrary, at least, not after the TNG overhauls to the system. Warp factors were stable points in subspace field compression, or some other such technobabble, but the specific speeds in it's logarithmic progression were stable nodes in that compression, points at which the power output needed to maintain the field dropped off sharply. For example, once you hit warp 2, the power needed to maintain warp 2 was drastically less than the power required to sustain warp 1.9. Now, you might want to throw out warp drive and this explanation entirely, but since I'm not aware of any practical, plausible ideas for ftl travel as convenient as is absolutely required to make the Trek universe actually be the Trek universe, I'm not sure you want to do that. I'd just do what the writers rarely did, and consistently apply warp drive as it's described in the tech manual. Namely, the transition /to/ warp 9 is the single most power-intensive thing the ship ever does; it might briefly interrupt use of warp power for secondary systems, or even be impossible of backup power is offline, limiting the ship to warp 8 until backup is online again. And a ship should never travel at anything but a whole-number warp factor, excepting at greater than 9, since the threshold to achieve warp 10 requires requires an infinite amount of energy, making it as impossible as accelerating to light speed with conventional propulsion. But given the insanely sharp logarithmic spike in power use past warp 9, it would be a thing for short-term use in the most desperate emergencies only, and should have real consequences for the ship, including wearing out engine components, depleting fuel supplies, and disabling secondary systems for the duration.

:edit: You might well want to readjust the scale, of course; as it stood in tng, it was never clear why they would ever travel at less than warp 8, at least, unless you factor in the whole "turns out warp drive breaks space" thing they threw out in a later season and rarely mentioned again. But just some kajiggering with fuel and wear economy might resolve this problem; if warp 8 is 10x faster than warp 7, but consumes fuel at 50x the rate and wears out expensive engine components many times faster as well, it would suddenly make sense to be economical with your speed choices, even if they had a huge impact on your schedule.
