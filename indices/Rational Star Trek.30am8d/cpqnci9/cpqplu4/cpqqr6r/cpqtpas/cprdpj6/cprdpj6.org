They have space warping technology. Make transporters into temporary folded space bubbles. When a person steps on to the transporter platform space is bent around them, a tractor beam then moves beam is used to move the bubble to a targeted location at warp speed and then unwraps the bubble. This could also explain why it is so difficult to beam aboard a ship which is in warp - the warp bubble around the ship prevent transporter warp bubbles from entering.
