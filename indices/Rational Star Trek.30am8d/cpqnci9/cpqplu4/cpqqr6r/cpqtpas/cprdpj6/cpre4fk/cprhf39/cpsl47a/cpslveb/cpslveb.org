The problem is the atmosphere /is/ matter. Also it leaves the possibility for advances in the various technologies to allow transportation into other spaceships. This has been shown in cannon repeatedly. It also opens up the possibility of planets where it's magnetic field or ionosphere preventing transporters.

My initial idea, which I didn't post, was to have people stand on the platform and a tube lowers around them. Then they are enveloped in a space bubble and shot out like a torpedo. Which is kind of similar to the transporters in Galaxy Quest.
