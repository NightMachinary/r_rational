that explanation would effectively repurpose the existing handwavium supply, which is good. Feels a little strange to me, and would beg the question of why these bubbles are different from those used on ships - if you can create completely enclosed bubbles, that cease to connect or interact with normal space entirely (so they can go through the ship's hull, etc), then why don't ships do that when traveling at warp? You could say that creating such closed bubbles is more energy-intensive than the "open," gradient, bubbles ships use, and that it's only possible because the size of the bubbles is so much smaller, I suppose; but then, why don't they put these on torpedoes? shields might be said to protect against the effect, but once past shields, such a torpedo could detonate deep inside the ship, at any precise location you want (like, say, inside their engine core) rather than against the hull. Of course, I overlooked this same question in suggesting the vague "literal teleportation" in the first place, now that I think of it. Meh. In any case, yeah, transporters are a tricky problem, for hard scifi.
