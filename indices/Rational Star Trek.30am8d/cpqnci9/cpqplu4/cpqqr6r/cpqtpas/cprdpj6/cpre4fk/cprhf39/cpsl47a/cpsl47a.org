Instead of a complicated explanation why the transporters work through your own hull, why not make transportation through matter impossible? The transporter rooms would be on the outside of the ship. When they needed to receive or send a transport beam, they'd need to open up the hatch and allign their ships properly. Likewise, they wouldn't be able to transport into buildings or caves, only on the planet surface.
