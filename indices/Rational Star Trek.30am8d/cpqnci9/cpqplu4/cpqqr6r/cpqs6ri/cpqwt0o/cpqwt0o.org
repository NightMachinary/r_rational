  The tech level is probably the most difficult problem I've seen here so far. I honestly don't know how to fix it. I suppose you could say that most species developed roughly parallel to each other, or that some of them have reached a level of cultural stagnation that prevents progress. Both are extremely questionable solutions, to say the least.

For non-military technologies, economy/trade would tend to keep most species at comparable levels of technology. Everyone wants to get their grasping appendages on the future equivalent of the latest ipod. Someone will always be willing to buy and sell for the right price.

From a military standpoint, the Cold War may offer the best parallel: The US and USSR were not openly sharing technology but through various forms of espionage and observation, the two nations' military technology were kept /roughly/ on par even if they occasionally chose different solutions to similar problems. If one nation gained a slight advantage, a counter development by the other nation usually followed soon after.
