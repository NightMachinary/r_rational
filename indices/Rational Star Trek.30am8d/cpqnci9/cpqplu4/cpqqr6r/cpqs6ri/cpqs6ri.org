Replicators use fairly simple uniform patterns that take up very little relative data space. That's why home-cooked foods taste so much better. They have far more variety from one cubic millimeter to the next. The transporter is a bigger issue, but not an impossible one. If it proves too difficult, however, you could simply dispose of them and make away teams always take a shuttle.

The economy is volunteer-based. Engineers are engineers because they want to be. Redshirts are Redshirts because they know Kung Fu, and almost nothing about warp coils. Same goes for architects and construction workers. There are billions of people back on earth and the colonies who are perfectly content to just eat replicated food and watch holoplays for the rest of their lives.

AI is simply much more difficult than it seems. The ships computer is the closest Starfleet has. Professor Soong was a genius beyond his time, and a specialist in studying ancient technologies left behind by great extinct civilizations.

The tech level is probably the most difficult problem I've seen here so far. I honestly don't know how to fix it. I suppose you could say that most species developed roughly parallel to each other, or that some of them have reached a level of cultural stagnation that prevents progress. Both are extremely questionable solutions, to say the least.

They look the same because a common ancestor seeded millions of terraformed planets across the galaxy with life, several dozen millennia ago. This is canon, and little has to change about it to be more adequately explained.

I suppose there could be some unsolved issues with VR and brain interface that make it dangerous, or unpredictable. This is reasonable, considering how vastly complicated the human brain is, and how different it can be from person to person, let alone species to species.

I'll look over the munchkinry link. Thank you for that. ( =
