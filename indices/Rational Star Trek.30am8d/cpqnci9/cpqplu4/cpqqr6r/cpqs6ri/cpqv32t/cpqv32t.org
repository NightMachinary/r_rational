The economy thing isn't really solved by having a volunteer economy.

Let's say that I want a haircut. I would have to go find a guy who decided that he wanted to be a barber, right? But it seems really, really unlikely that supply of barber-hours would magically match the demand of barber-hours, doesn't it? So either we have:

- A shortage of barbers. This is a big problem, because there's nothing pushing people to /become/ barbers if they don't want to be. We don't have money, right? So I can't simply pay someone to cut my hair. The demand for haircuts keeps going up, but it's totally disconnected from the supply of barbers.
- A shortage of hair to cut. This is less of a problem - presumably some of those would-be barbers just quit. (This seems somewhat unlikely to me, given that I don't know many people with enthusiasm for service.)

This applies to literally every service that someone in the Federation might want another person to provide. And if you're going with "replicator food tastes worse" you're exacerbating how ridiculous this economy is, because now there's a demand for non-replicated goods which can only be filled by people deciding to become farmers. Same goes for everything that a replicator only makes a sub-par version of. Tailors, bakers, chefs, etc.

The natural result of a government-enforced "volunteer economy" is a grey market. The best chef on the station gives preferential treatment to the best barber, and they bypass each others waiting list. Maybe those people with high demand for their services start asking for something that can't be replicated, like strips of latinum (or better, a cryptocurrency). And suddenly you have a real economy again, if one that the Federation is trying desperately to stamp out because it conflicts with their ideals.
