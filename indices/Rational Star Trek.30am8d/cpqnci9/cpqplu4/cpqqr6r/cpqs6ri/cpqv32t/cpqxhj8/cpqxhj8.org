A volunteer based post scarcity economy is not the same as a lack of economy. Just because people wouldn't have to work doesn't mean that they wouldn't be rewarded if they chose to. There would be currency, that would be earned by a job well done. Shelter and replicator foods just wouldn't cost anything, as they would be universal resources, much like healthcare and education in many nations of our current world.

And the barber issue is obviously solved by barber robots.
