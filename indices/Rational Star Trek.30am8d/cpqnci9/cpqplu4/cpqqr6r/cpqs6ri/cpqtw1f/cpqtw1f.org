  AI is simply much more difficult than it seems. The ships computer is the closest Starfleet has. Professor Soong was a genius beyond his time, and a specialist in studying ancient technologies left behind by great extinct civilizations.

And then Geordi accidentally created strong AI by not choosing his words carefully enough in a holodeck. This is the sort of thing you just have to excise whole-cloth from a rational reinterpretation; that the ship's computer, completely unbeknownst to those who designed, built, maintain, and operate it, is capable of creating a strong AI, and has zero safeguards to prevent anyone from instructing it to do so merely by uttering a few words in the holodeck, is just not credible. That, upon discovering this ability, they promptly /forget all about it/ pushes it soundly into the realm of the surreal.
