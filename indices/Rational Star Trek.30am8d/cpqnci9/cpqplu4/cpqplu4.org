On the contrary. There are clear solutions to every problem you just listed. The warp 1-10 scale never made much sense anyway, with the distances presented. So a new exponential scale would be implemented. The away teams would simply become B-team main characters, which would lead to a much more ensemble cast, some of which may actually die over the course of the series.

I don't know enough about the structuring of military or Starfleet in particular to address the NCOs, but I have a feeling it could be easily solved by the same ensemble cast as above. Yes, the bridge must move. And with that said, the ships would likely have to be redesigned as well. It's a shame to get rid of the classic Enterprise shape, but there's little justification for it.

If Harry Potter can be made rational, surely the same can be done for one of the greatest science fiction franchises of the last fifty years. If you wish to dissuade me, then yes, you shall continue. I am not giving up.
