IIRC the canon explanation for enterprise shape is its a particularly efficient form to contain in a warp bubble. If energy effiency under warp speed is at the top of your priority list ( 90% of bridge problems can be solved by more/higher/further/wider. Divert power to the shield! Divert power to life support! etc) it makes sense to take hits in eg. combat form factor. Later designs such as Defiant can use worse warp designs thanks to overpowered warship generators. As for borg cubes... Well, I guess the queen was willing to pay huge signalling costs?
