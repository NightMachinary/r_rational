With time travel it'd be good to have an increased risk factor. The various methods of time travel they use are pretty unpredictable so have them not always work. As a general matter, roll a 1d20 whenever they time travel, if it hits anything below 18 they all die.

For the aliens you could have a mix of common ancestor devices and evolution. Have the standard canon races like vulcans and such be humanoid but most races encountered be alien. This was done due to budget constraints, in a literary story you can ignore budgets. Likewise with the suits.

Holographic stuff and teleportation and replication should be limited- huge energy requirements, a single holodeck is a substantial portion of the ships energy expenditure, teleportation is enormously expensive in energy. The computing requirements for all should also be substantial, if your computer is figuring out firing solutions you don't want to waste power or computing time on teleportation, replication or holodecks.

On technology, stealing alien technology should be a major thing.

Per this timeline it might take on average several millennia for the average civilization to develop effective warp travel. Perhaps it's very non intuitive how it works and requires careful analysis of the results of increasingly powerful particle accelerators and very powerful sensory data. Humanity has an advantage with stolen alien technology and their technological advancements are based on those. The development of advanced transwarp and time travel technologies would require extensive study of wormholes and stellar engineering to build transwarp gates which for an average civilization might take more millennia of study.

Some of the principles behind these things are very simple, hypothetically. A subspace manipulator just requires precise manufacturing to an atomic scale of promethium rotating at 999.07 hertz and a flow of electricity across it at .666V. An engineer who has studied more advanced alien ships may be able to use some alien technology intuitively to do something unusual if they know that at 1432.6 hertz and 0.4242V you can get quadruple the output at the cost of a massive increase in radioactive decay.
