I don't think anyone on earth has enough understanding of genetics yet to do more than spitball a probability estimate, but it may well be impossible. I was thinking the seeds would be encoded with a large amount of "junk dna" that was actually useful recipes to facilitate their evolution, just waiting to be activated. Obviously there would be drift, and mutation, and expecting these genes to all survive billions of years of independent, unguided evolution entirely intact is a fool's game. But as a few obvious examples, a strong predisposition for developing bilateral symetry could be build into the simplest life. It was said the seeds were microorganisms; I'm imagining them being given a massive toolbox of inactive genes, with loads of redundancy, which would greatly increase the likelihood of live evolving along certain paths. Evolution would be completely free to ignore the hint, mutate all the genes into uselessness (or divergent usefulness), and blaze it's own path, but this process would take far longer, because those that happen to follow the intended path find themselves already armed with genes for overcoming evolutionary challenges just waiting to be activated. This is, of course, may well be incompatible with what is already known about the evolution of life on earth, but I'm not constraining myself in my rational!trek idea to "this could be an actual future from this point in reality," and have no objection to tweaking earth's evolutionary history within the story to be compatible with this notion. If you developed such a seed and planted it on every planet in the goldilocks zone in the entire galaxy, even if the vast majority of them went off-script at some point, a few wouldn't, and those few might develop sentient humanoids, or at least, roughly compatible biospheres (i.e., breathable air), at a far faster rate than natural evolution, meaning that a few billion years later, you would suddenly get a lot of similar humanoid races appearing within what by evolutionary terms is a pretty short timeframe, and with very little competition at the same level from non-humanoid intelligence that evolved entirely naturally or without staying roughly on the seed's planned rails.

:edit: Oh, and bear in mind with all of this, according to canon, the progenitors explored the galaxy and found themselves alone, implying that intelligent life was an incredibly rare thing to evolve entirely naturally. Honestly, that seems like motive enough to me right there for wanting to seed the future of the galaxy to produce more life before going off to whatever their version of a transhuman singularity was.
