dangit, lost my lengthy reply to an internet hiccup. Retyping...

yeah, the more I think about this idea, the more I'm liking it, and I'm thinking this is really the rational!trek story I really want to read.

I've always felt there was something off, in a pieces-don't-quite-fit way, with Spock's story. He's generally presented as being less logical and more emotional than other Vulcans, but at the same time, Vulcans are said to actually have /more/ intense emotions than humans, which contributed to their development of a culture based on emotional suppression. But if their emotions are more intense, and their control is learned, then a half-human, half-vulcan would, high-level logically if not by sound genetic theory, be less emotional, and so if raised Vulcan, have better emotional control than pure vulcans his own age. He would be a prodigy of logic, not a victim of human emotions. Further, most major vulcan characters end up being portrayed as quite clearly more motivated by emotions than they will admit, and simply maintain a calm veneer of logic while rationalizing this behavior.

Now, given that, picture a half-human spock growing up among Vulcans. He is, in fact, a prodigy in logic and emotional control, thanks to the moderating influence of his human side's less intense emotions. Whether he is known by all to be half-human or only known by certain authority figures makes little difference, I think. His peers will resent him for his perceived superiority either way; knowing his ancestry will only be a change of degree in this resentment, a point they will hang their rationalizations on if they know. Either way, their resentment will result to them finding subtle ways to provoke him. Add in some authority figures, teachers and the like, who know his ancestry and find him offensive because of it, and you've created an environment where he will be attacked, however passive-aggressively, on all sides; held to higher standards, provoked far more than his peers, and punished out of proportion for any slips. And in the face of all of this, he may well have more emotional outbursts than his peers, despite superior emotional control, which will naturally be pointed to as proof of his inferiority, weakness resulting from his hybrid ancestry. But whatever they think, he remains a prodigy in emotional control, and eventually rises above even this increased level of stress to be a model of the vulcan ideal. However, the result will still be a rational!spock surrounded by Vulcans who believe themselves to be perfectly rational but are clearly and demonstrably not. He controls his impulse to resent them, and in time even comes to genuinely be thankful for the extra stress that he has been subjected to, seeing it as the fire by which his mastery of his own mind was tempered. And this Spock, coming to meet humans for the first time as a young man, finds them no more rational than Vulcans, but more honest in their irrationality, and is drawn to Star Fleet because of this.

yeah... that's a story I'd read.
