[[mailto:lol@tricorder][lol@tricorder]]. Or just, y'know, put some sort of passive beacon in all tech taken to the surface so you can just beam the damned things out if you have to. Something as simple as a lump of some exotic element your insanely advanced sensors can detect should work fine, and be proof against being rendered inoperable by anything not sufficient to destroy the entire device. A better idea, of course, is to use cloaked probes to scan the surface and observe in a holodeck from your ship parked behind a neighboring planet. The holodecks are, by far, the most under-utilized piece of tech in the entire trekverse, imo. Soooo much untapped potential there.
