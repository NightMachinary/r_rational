Yeah, the rule of thumb was "if the captain does it, it's Good and Right, if anyone else does it, it's Very Bad, or at least, causes Big Problems." But picard violated it around 10 times, and that's only counting the times the script explicitly pointed out that he was violating it. No consequences for him, and no revisions made. Hell, even if you just stop treating it as a single, simple rule and make it a premise from which a whole complicated book of interpretation and application is drawn, with case history and precedent and the like, it would no longer bother me. It's a blanket rule with some pretty awful consequences, like "if this struggling species of intelligent, pre-warp-drive humanoids last 1000 survivors are going to die because their star is going nova, well, sucks to be them, but Prime Directive says we can't help!" and, apparently, no exceptions made except in a seek-forgiveness-afterwords kind of way. That just doesn't seem believable to me for an organization as large and old as the Federation.
