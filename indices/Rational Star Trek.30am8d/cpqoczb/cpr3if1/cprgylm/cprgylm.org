A plausible Rational workaround would be that the Federation treats the Prime Directive as a governing tenet in order to save itself from the obligation of spending 100% of its time doing first contact and then dealing with the inevitable fallout of first contact upon each and every new civilization. Starfleet in particular is strongly incentivized to focus on defense and peacekeeping, with humanitarian projects strictly limited to cases of political expediency.

So, you posit a second large, powerful, charitable organization in the TrekVerse, the purpose of which is exactly that. We are supposed to believe that Federation citizens are all highly morally evolved, and they would presumably donate lots of time and resources to the project of saving uncontacted civilizations.
