I don't really think that Star Trek is a good setting to give the rational treatment to. Technology was never the point, at least in the best episodes; it's just a way to get people into their predicaments, mostly to examine modern social problems through the lens of some exotic setup. But in a rational treatment of the series, sensible use of the technology completely warps everything until the rest of the trappings of the series melt away - this might work if technology was ever the point in the first place, but it doesn't work for a series to be mutated so thoroughly by a background detail.

I think you'd probably get a better exploration of Star Trek's themes - modern social problems in new contexts, with an optimistic take - with something closer to near-future cyberpunk and early pre-singularity metahumans.

If you're dead set on Star Trek though, I think the only thing that can save the series is if all the homeworlds are run by FAI and most people live in a technological singularity, but nobody has found a version of fun theory that catches quite everyone, so we still have bored adventure seekers off in space.
