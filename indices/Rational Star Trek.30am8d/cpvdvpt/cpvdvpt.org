I think the only way to fix it and have it be remotely similar to current Star Trek is to go the "Dune" route and write in a religious injunction against AI above a certain level.

You could use the fact that all the races in the galaxy obviously have a common ancestor to create a species-spanning religion, with the central pillar of its commandments being never to create an intelligence not in the form of the Ancestor.

This would mean that species like the Horta would be persona non-grata to many people, even in the oh-so-tolerant Federation.

Also, Data would be the ultimate heresy. Everyone would hate him, except those very few people who could see that it wasn't his fault that he was created.
