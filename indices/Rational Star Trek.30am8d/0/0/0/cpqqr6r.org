You need a better explanation for why transporters and replicators can't be used to just clone people wholesale (which probably means making some retcons to problematic episodes).

You need a better explanation for why replicators can't make living things in general - the explanation that Star Trek uses is that everything that looks organic is really just cobbled together from nonorganic parts, but tastes like and functions as the nutritional equivalent of its organic counterpart.

You need some kind of explanation for how the economy works - even if material goods are now meaningless, labor isn't, which means that an economy of some kind should exist.

You need an explanation for why there isn't artificial intelligence (or why it sucks so much).

You need an explanation for why everyone seems to be at the same general tech level, and seemingly got there through different paths.

You need an explanation for why every species looks the same.

You need an explanation for why there's no brain simulation/uploading/interface - how people have holograms and no one has thought to just plug their brain into a computer (or if they have, why no one is ever seen doing that).
