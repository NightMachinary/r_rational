re: their economy, my headcanon has always been that they were, for all intents and purposes, a post-scarcity economy, thanks mainly to matter replicators. The amount of non-automatable labor actually required to sustain a population would be fairly small, very plausibly small enough for an entirely volunteer workforce to handle.

Their hand-wavey explanation for why they can't just replicate people is that the patterns are too massive, that food patterns are compressed to simple repeating formula, while a human, or any living thing, has a pattern that must be preserved exactly, without such cheating, particularly in the brain, where I think they even threw in stuff about quantum state having to be copied exactly (how on earth they are supposed to be reading and then reproducing both the position and the velocity of every electron, I have no idea. The Heisenberg Compensators were probably involved.) None of these explanations are entirely satisfactory from a hard sci-fi perspective, of course.

I would think to translate the ideas into hard scifi, first you would have to create a hard differentiation of replicators and transporters; they should not be related technology at all. Replicators should be a form of nanoassembly, building up atoms into molecules and ultimately into complex objects. Not, as said in canon, literally making energy into matter. This would have the side-benefit of explaining why they can't just replicate antimatter in whatever quantity they need, as no transformation the replicator could apply would turn matter into antimatter. Which allows you to have elements of a scarcity economy, if only at the level of the starships, which depend on antimatter engines to power their warp drives. Which, in turn, gives an answer to why gangs of bored teenagers don't build and fly their own starships around after downloading replicator plans from the 24th century interweb.

As for transporters... eeh... I have no good answer for how transporters could work in a hard sci-fi setting. I honestly just don't. Someone more clever than me may come up with one, but for myself, I would either add a liberal amount of handwavium to power actual matter teleportation - you're not torn apart, digitized, and then rebuilt, you're literally, physically teleported, somehow - or I'd remove transporters entirely. The latter, of course, makes it notably less Trek, since they are such a staple of the trekverse.
