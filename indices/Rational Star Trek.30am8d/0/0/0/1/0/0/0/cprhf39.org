Those are all good points. I think we can place rational limits on the technology to prevent such problems. The transporter bubbles need to be constantly maintained or they will fall apart and destroy whatever is inside them. The computing power and energy requirements to wrap and unwrap space is monumental, in fact it requires something the size of Galaxy class spaceship. Shields disrupt the bubble maintenance beams causing the bubbles to fail catastrophically. Hulls also have a strong electrical charge, the voltage constantly shifting which also disrupts transporter signals. One would need to know the hull and shield frequencies to allow a transporter beam through. Consequently while bubbles can go through your own hull and shields they are unlikely to make it through an enemy's shield or hull. It also allows for rational advances in shield, hull and transporter bubble technologies.

Warp bubbles put the objects within them into "subspace" (what ever that might be) whereas transporters use real space. The main difference being that one can transmit and receive information from real space when in subspace and vice versa but this means you can't pass through solid matter. The warp fields are relatively simpler to compute and maintain as a result.
