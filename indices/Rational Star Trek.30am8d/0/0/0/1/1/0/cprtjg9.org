  We never really see much in the way of robotics either, which means that there's at least some labor demand for any remaining unpleasant tasks

This was a plot point in Voyager. It turns out that the Medical Hologram Mark I was rejected for service as an emergency medical device, but was repurposed as a janitor. This so upset Dr. Zimmerman that he used other people to model subsequent EMHs. Andy Dick was the Mark II (said to have better bedside manner), and Dr. Bashir was the initial choice for a long term EMH.
