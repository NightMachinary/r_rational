re: AI, they do and they don't. I mean, every holodeck personality, not just the "special" ones the writers graced with proper self-awareness, is an AI far beyond our current capabilities. And at one point, on VOY, there was an alpha quadrant subplot about the old first generation EMH being repurposed as miners. Within the confines of a holodeck, or within the effective area of a holographic emitter, holograms /are/ AI. Very good AI. AI completely capable of doing anything from menial labor to providing medical care. They never /call/ it "AI" but there's no escaping the fact that it /is/ AI. I'm not entirely clear on where the distinction is drawn between "strong" and "weak" AI, but they are nearly as intelligent and capable as a human and, within areas of specialization, have been demonstrated to equal if not exceed the best humans. The EMH on Voyager made legitimate new medical breakthroughs; the leah brahms charater from Geordi's program was not just a mechanized assistant, but clearly a collaborating partner in their efforts to save the ship. The doctor even had a desire to improve himself, though he lacked the knowledge, or programming, to properly understand holoprogramming, and so was not able to do so himself. But there's no reason to think holoprogramming is inherently more complex than the entire field of medical knowledge and practice for a an advanced multi-species culture, or the complete workings of the Enterprise engines, power systems, and warp drive. They just never showed an AI that had been programmed with that specialized knowledge before. If they did, I suspect it would certainly qualify as strong AI, with all the risks and rewards that entails.
