  re: their economy, my headcanon has always been that they were, for all intents and purposes, a post-scarcity economy, thanks mainly to matter replicators. The amount of non-automatable labor actually required to sustain a population would be fairly small, very plausibly small enough for an entirely volunteer workforce to handle.

They're post-goods-scarcity, but they're not post-services-scarcity. They still need doctors, engineers, police, emergency response, administration, teachers, etc. And at least canonically, there are some things that can't be replicated for one reason or another. One of the big questions that I have about the setting is how much labor is actually automated. Clearly they /don't/ have strong AI, or even terribly good weak AI, which means that intellectual labor probably remains in heavy demand. We never really see much in the way of robotics either, which means that there's at least some labor demand for any remaining unpleasant tasks (unless this robot army is hidden from view for reasons of series budget or aesthetics).

To be frank, a lot of what people are seen doing in the series seems like grunt work, and I kind of wonder how it is that people outside of Starfleet don't just look at problems that need fixing and think "someone else can recalibrate the sensors today, that seems boring". But maybe I'm just too cynical about what motivates people to do work.
