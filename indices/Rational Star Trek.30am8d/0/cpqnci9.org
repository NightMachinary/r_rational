Well, you'll need a predictable warp scale. I like /Warp Factor x/ = c(/x/^{/x/)}

And for gods sake, stop having the captain, first officer, and senior medical officer beam down to the planet, when Away Team 7, with optional Diplomatic Officer Jones is a much more sensible plan.

Also, where are the NCO's? Sure, Cheif O'Brian shows up, but what about Crewman second class Smith? If everybody is an officer, what's the point of officers?

Please, move the bridge. Everything is view-screens anyway. Put the most important command and control systems in the core of the hull, behind extra shielding, not sitting on top of the ship with a "Please shoot me" sign and some nice breakable windows on top.

Shall I continue, or are you giving this up for a loss?
