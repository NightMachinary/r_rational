  the threshold to achieve warp 10 requires requires an infinite amount of energy

I believe one of the official "Science of Star Trek" books said that. And then warp factors up to 36 were used in the series. People tried to explain that by saying that warp factors were re-designated in the beginning of the 24th century, and that by the 2350s "warp factor 10" is an impossibility (whereas in the 2250s it was merely unsafe for passengers). But several times afterward, warp factors of 10 and above were observed.

There's no point in trying to establish /continuity/ of science in Star Trek, much less sanity.
