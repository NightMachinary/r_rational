There was only one occasion, I think, in all of TNG, where they used warp factors higher than 10, and that in a god-awful, season 1, "turns out Wesley isn't just a precocious prodigy, he can actually alter space and time with his brain!" episode that Should Not Be Spoken Of.

Then ther ewas the abomination of an episode of Voyager where they managed to hit warp 10, traveling infinitely fast and passing through every point in the universe, and as a result, captain janeway and tom paris turned into giant salimanders and had sex. That episode Should also Not Be Spoken Of.

It was TOS that predated the "warp 10 is infinite speed/infinite energy" idea, and used a completely different warp scale.
