You could modify it however you liked, but if I remember correctly, they found the galaxy far more devoid of life in general, and completely devoid of intelligent life besides themselves, so I've always pictured them seeding every primordial world that had any chance of supporting life. Now, in a rational take, no matter how brilliant they were, the vast majority would've gone off the planned evolutionary rails long before developing intelligent humanoids, but there are any number of points along the way where they could diverge and still have followed the plan long enough to have a common, breathable atmosphere - the first microorganisms basically do terraform the planet they evolved on, after all, and this is true whether they evolve naturally or are planted there by Sufficiently Advanced Aliens. As long as they stay on the rails long enough to get to photosynthesis, then you'll probably wind up with something at least similar to earth in terms of atmospheric composition.
