Scotty's the one who maintained speeds in excess of warp 9.9 for minutes on a ship that was only supposed to be able to go 9.5 before exploding. He pulled off the same trick later with a Klingon cruiser only rated for warp 8.9. If anyone can break the laws of reality given only a few hours of air and a transporter to tinker with, it's Scotty.
