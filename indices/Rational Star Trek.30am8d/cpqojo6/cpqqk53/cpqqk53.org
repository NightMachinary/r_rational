The usage of drones and robots is a legitimate concern. However, human away teams would still be desired for any necessary immediate decision-making. Especially if other intelligent life exists on the world, in which case sending robots in to interact could be considered disrespectful.

There's very little evidence of virtual reality being a viable and commonplace technology in Starfleet. The clearest example of this is in the holodeck, which takes up much more space and is much more limited than simply giving each crewmember a VR headset. And if they don't even have proper VR, they certainly can't upload people entirely.

The transporter doesn't work like you're thinking it does. It actually transforms the objects into a kind of particle beam, which is reassembled into matter on the other end. The computer at no point stores all the information of a complete person, since the buffer couldn't handle that much data. This actually becomes a plot point in DS9, when they have to erase almost every file on the entire station just to store a pattern that the buffer would've lost otherwise.

Of course with that being said, the transporter would almost certainly have to be redesigned to make more sense, if not disposed of completely.

Subspace communications have always been one of the more problematic elements of Trek. Simply having the vessels receive prerecorded orders that take time to transmit is the easiest solution, which also makes remote starships not possible.

Disassembling planets is no small order. Especially when said planets are covered in culture and life that one has to sustain. How would you convince the French that some theoretical Dyson sphere is a valuable enough concept for them to all move offworld for several months and allow the destruction of the Eiffel tower?
