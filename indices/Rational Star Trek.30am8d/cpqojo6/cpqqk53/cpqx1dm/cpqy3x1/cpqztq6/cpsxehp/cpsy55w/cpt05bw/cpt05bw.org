Why would you trap people in VR against their will for the rest of their lives when you can just as easily use a holodeck?

And that's really the question for the other thing too. Why? What's the objective that you work to achieve by all of this deconstruction and reconstruction? Are you trying to make the Federation bigger? The canon Federation works for the benefit of its citizens and the progress of exploration and knowledge. In other words, better, not bigger. The citizens don't benefit from growing more citizens in a tube. And you don't explore more planets better, faster, if you demolish everything in your path along the way. The Borg are pretty much the civilization you're talking about, taken to its logical extreme. And they're the bad guys, because at the end of the day Trek is about humanity. And humanity has flaws, whether we like it or not.
