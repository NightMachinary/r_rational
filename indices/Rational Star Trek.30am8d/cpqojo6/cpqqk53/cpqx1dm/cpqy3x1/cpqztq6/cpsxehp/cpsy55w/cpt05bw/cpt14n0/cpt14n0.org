I wouldn't do it against their will, but I would imagine it would get common as people get used to it. In any case, it would be easier to find people who did that than to find people ready to die, so if they have a supply of redshirts as it is, they can supply their ships with people who underwent this procedure.

Holodecks can only alter your environment. VR can alter you. They'd need something far more impressive than this to turn into starfish aliens, but this setup would work for becoming a pony or something. Someone on VR can just use a robot to interact with normal people. Normal people cannot immigrate to Equestria. Also, holodecks seem to be expensive or something. There's just a few per ship, instead of making the whole ship like that. Admittedly, they might just be heavy or something, and they're only rare on starships. Either way, starships need VR.

Suppose the world was going to end in a billion years. But you could change something to make it last two billion. Would you? Now imagine that instead of these next billion years happening in series, they could happen in parallel. It has some disadvantages. It's harder to do science in parallel. But it's still almost as good.

But if you don't buy any of that, and you don't care about parallelizing science, the simple fact is that the Federation faces existential threats that it could stop with more manpower. They wouldn't have to worry about Klingons or the Borg or whoever made the planet-eating doomsday device.

The Borg are straw transhumans. They have creative sterility. They have VR, but hardly use it. They have little if any emotion. They have entire star systems worth of resources at their disposal that they just don't seem to bother harvesting.
