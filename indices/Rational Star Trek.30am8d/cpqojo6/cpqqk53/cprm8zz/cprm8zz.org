  This actually becomes a plot point in DS9, when they have to erase almost every file on the entire station just to store a pattern that the buffer would've lost otherwise.

Wow, I hate to think how much storage space is being spent on replicator patterns. Unless replicators have a /very/ limited menu. Granted, steak or cereal or what have you would compress much better than a human brain, and you can potentially have it in read-only storage after spending an outrageous amount of computational power analyzing the object and finding a compact representation.

On the other hand, there's a potentially much larger problem than mere storage space: processing speed. So, fine, you have physical humans on the ship. They could still send down robots or at least a dedicated team of guards, diplomats, linguists, and field scientists rather than the captain and first officer.
