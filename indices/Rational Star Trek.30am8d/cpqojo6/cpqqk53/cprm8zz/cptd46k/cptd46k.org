*TL;DR:*

DS9 likely vastly overestimated the amount of data required to store an individual, even when including the amount of information needed to store brain patterns at the quantum level.

A device the size of a cell phone can hold about a hundred-thousand times more data than the entire human race has created (including books, images, and video) if said device had the information density of DNA.

--------------

I just read that the human body, excluding the non-human microbes within each person, contains 150 trillion GB of information as DNA. And mass-wise, DNA is a negligible portion of the body.

Here's an approximate calculation using DNA's information density. Hopefully, I make no errors! ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yottabyte][I double-checked with Wikipedia. I'm not far off, so I think I did things correctly.]])

Data per human in GB: 10^{14} GB

Mass of DNA per person: 10 g

Information Density: 10^{13} GB g^{-1}

To do the calculation, let's assume a futuristic replicator storage device is about the size of a cell phone, which has a volume of about 10^{2} cm^{3}. We'll also need to identify a plausible material so we can use its density. Since DNA is organic material, it probably contains a lot of carbon, so I'll use the density of graphite, which is carbon in its standard state at room temperature.

Graphite's density is about 10^{0} g cm^{-3} at room temperature.

The storage of a cell phone sized device with DNA-like information density and graphite-like physical density:

= (Information Density) (Physical Density) (Volume of Object)

= (10^{13} GB g^{-1}) (10^{0} g cm^{-3}) (10^{2} cm^{3})

= 10^{15} GB per cellphone

= 10^{24} B, or a yottabyte of information

For comparison, it's estimated that humans have created about 10^{19} B of information, including all books and digital media, which could all fit in a billion times over inside of this cell phone-sized, DNA-like device.
