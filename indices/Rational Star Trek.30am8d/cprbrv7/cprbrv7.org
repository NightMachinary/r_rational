The ships would have no physical interior space. They would consist of solid computronium. Anything beamed aboard or brought in through an 'airlock' or 'hangar' would simply be converted to transporter buffer patterns which ran in appropriately shielded sandboxes and were able to interact with each other in a simulation of a ship interior (which wouldn't have to be even remotely consistent with the exterior, Euclidian space, or the laws of physics). No inertial dampers needed, too, unless to hold the ship itself together. Certainly none tuned to avoid turning the crew into strawberry wallpaper during acceleration.

The exterior designs themselves would be much more symmetrical on a vertical axis. Fewer goose-neck designs and more like the Sovereign or Constellation classes. There's also no real reason they shouldn't be rotationally symmetric to a significant degree. The only reason that could possibly work for the majority of canon Federation designs would be if the warp fields were specifically and deliberately designed to be lopsided for some reason. Even needing to land on a planet shouldn't necessarily mean nacelles way off-center from the center of mass.

A sphere is actually a /much/ better design - smaller target for a given volume/mass, a better-protected core, lower shield-power requirements. I'd like to see one with a tennis-ball curve of phaser banks. Or, given phasers appear to be able to shoot in any direction, why not use the transporter systems to plate the entire exterior surface with phasers wherever and whenever they're needed?

Physical away teams would be generated as needed, with self-contained intelligence and a permanent subspace comms link to the ship. They could, of course, be entirely human for all intents and purposes, or humanoid robots, or replicas of local sapients, or floating clouds of smart dust.
