I don't know what Alcubierre means. But in Trek they use warp drive, which warps space around the ship as it moves. In effect, they don't traverse the grand majority of the space between point A and point B because point B simply moves closer to the ship while point A moves farther away. NASA is actually working on building a warp drive IRL.

The implication is that nothing would be destroyed because if the ship hits anything it will simply be warped around the ship as it passes. Of course canon Trek is full of examples that break this concept. But canon Trek wasn't often consistent about much of anything.
