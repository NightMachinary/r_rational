true; the way I was picturing it was more like, among the knowledge shared by the progenitors was the genetic template for a "basic humanoid," and the genetic equivalent to a merge/dif tool, where a given species, say Vulcans, could be reduced to a set of genetic deviations from the base reference, and somehow combined with the set of difs for Humans compared to the same base, to produce a kind of hybrid, which would, genetically, really be a completely distinct, third species. This would be, of course, flatly impossible - or at least, as close to it as to make no odds - for two truly independently evolved species, but might be possible for two expressions of one form that grew from a common, designed genetic seed. Even in that case, it would be fantastically more complicated than I'm making it sound, but given sufficiently deep understanding of gene coding and expression and enough computing power, doesn't strike me as inherently impossible.
