I like your new Spock origin story. Could that possibly be tied into the "Enterprise" finale, which featured the birth of the first human/Vulcan baby? Perhaps Spock was put through a kind of witness protection program as a baby, and adopted by Sarek and Amanda. Years later, after the threat of Terra Prime is confirmed to be gone for good, Spock is told of his true heritage, as the son of T'Pol.
