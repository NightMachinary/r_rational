  it was a case of stupidly-advanced-civilization seeding the universe with dna that was basically pre-loaded with the potential for humanoid life.

Somehow I don't think seeding the Earth with [[https://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/anomalocaris-500m-year-old-predator-1.jpg][this]] and [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Opabinia_BW2.jpg][this]] would be a good way to ensure that squishy bipeds evolved eventually. Easier to say that the precursors decided to make roughly compatible species throughout the galaxy and guided evolution for a few tens of millions of years to produce a plethora of intelligent bipeds.

For a fully reasonable explanation, you probably want to extend this genetic manipulation to about 1GA in the past. This would account for the genetic similarity between humans and other creatures.

There's a giant, glaring question of motive, of course.
