Regarding the Prime Directive... there really needs to be a lot better justification for it than the existing one, which is basically just anti-colonialism. It's an integral part of the Trekverse, so it /should/ still be present, but it needs better apologetics than the primary sources have provided for it. Absent the existence of a coherent moral theory that explains why noninterference is such a good policy, you get the following rational response (by [[http://warpfairy.dreamwidth.org/441.html][Alicorn]], if you haven't seen this one before):

  The Prime Directive is the most staggering atrocity - in sheer scope - ever to have been perpetrated by an advanced civilization.

  In its name, genocides and mass enslavements are committed, planets are wrenched out of orbit into their suns or torn apart by supervolcanoes with millions or billions of innocents aboard, and literally uncounted numbers of men, women, and children fall prey to all manner of poverty, scarcity, illness, violence, disaster, and opportunity cost with every second that ticks by. Meanwhile, prosperous neighbors, concealing themselves like shy gods, leaving the little cousins to their deadly growth and winnowing, cheat themselves out of all the culture and insight and genius that they insist on abandoning to their noninterference policy.
