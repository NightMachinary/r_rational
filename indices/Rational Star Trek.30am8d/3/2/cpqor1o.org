Might it also be possible for those Precursors to stick around for awhile and weed out these lines while encouraging those lines?

I'm not super well-versed in my Trek lore, so when did these Precursors stop doing stuff? Even if they were hanging around up to a million years ago (or if they'd left probes) they could have stacked the deck pretty heavily.

As for the Prime Directive, it seems like an at least /mostly/ reasonable rule that honestly never turned out badly for the sole reason that the plot required this to be so. IIRC however, there was a TNG episode which centered on somebody /else/ having violated the Prime Directive and accidentally causing a horrendous war.
