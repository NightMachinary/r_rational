A Matter of Perspective.

Also used practically to good effect by troi in Schisms, and by Geordi in the Leah Brahm episode, the title of which escapes me. Probably others I'm forgetting.

But yeah. These sorts of things barely scratch the surface. The whole episode where Geordi was controlling some probe through a the neural interface from his visor... the whole episode I kept thinking "Why can't you just holodeck this? Why is this apparently dangerous neural interface necessary?"
