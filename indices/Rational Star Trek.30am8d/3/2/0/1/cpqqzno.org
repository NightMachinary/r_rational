The Prime Directive would have to be altered severely. Instead of "never interfere under any circumstances" it would be "never interfere more than absolutely necessary for the purpose of observation. Unless an entire intelligent civilization is at risk, in which case try not to get caught saving them. But if you are caught, make sure to explain to them that you're aliens with Sufficiently Advanced Technology, and not gods or anything of the sort. If they refuse to believe that you're not gods, than at least try to leave them with as close to the same societal objectives as when you found them. And for goodness sake, if you drop a tricorder, just let it be. Don't make things worse by trying to go get it back."
