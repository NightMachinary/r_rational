The Giants series by James P. Hogan is basically "Find something, talk about it a bunch, find another thing, talk about it a bunch in connection with everything else found so far, rinse and repeat."

The first novel is about finding a 50,000 year old human corpse. /On the moon./

The science is not totally accurate (it was written awhile ago) but it's still a lot of fun for people who don't mind a novel that is basically talking heads and nothing but.
