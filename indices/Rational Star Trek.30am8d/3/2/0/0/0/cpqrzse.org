There are a bunch of niche stories like that. I was attempting a History of Magical Society in Britain from 1400 to the Present a few months ago, in fact. The foreward thanked Mr H Potter for revealing the ruins of "the Two Alleys District" to general society, thus beginning the practice manaology and magical anthropology. I'd even listed the size of the various coins in circulation and what sort of milling they had.

I lost interest before I got to the point where I could show anything, though.
