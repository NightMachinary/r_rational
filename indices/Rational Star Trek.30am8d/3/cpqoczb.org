you wouldn't have to abandon evolution entirely; the common-ancestor established as canon in TNG episode The Chase wasn't a simple, naturalistic case of "we all evolved from them." it was a case of stupidly-advanced-civilization seeding the universe with dna that was basically pre-loaded with the potential for humanoid life. Convergent evolution may be bs when applied as a justification for the standard "minor variations on humans" approach to aliens, but there is a real phenomenon there, and if certain conditions are favored by pre-existing code in these genetic seeds, it doesn't seem entirely implausible to me that billions of years of divergent evolution from those common seeds might tend in most cases to carry over those constraints. Add in that planets without the seeds, or where the seeds mutated early to lose these constraints, might have an objective evolutionary dis-advantage, basically deviating from the plan in ways that required them to evolve new solutions to challenges that arrive later, where pre-coded solutions are no longer applicable. This would mean that, while many other kinds of alien life are certainly possible, they would take longer to evolve compared to the humanoids who stick generally to the plan coded into these life-seeds, and so would be exceptionally rare in the timeframe of the story.

More interesting, to me, is the question of what you would have to change about the underlying philosophy of the federation. Friendship and cooperation and peace are certainly fine rational goals, as is a willingness to fight back when others don't always share that philosophy. But what of their relationships with other species? The prime directive has always been contentious, and seems at times to exist only so that the various trek crews can find reasons to have to violate it. If the rule is a good rule, it needs to be enforced, consistently, and if it's not a good rule, then it needs to be redefined or replaced with something that is a good rule, and can be enforced consistently. The idea that the federation's prime directive is so frequently set aside, and with no significant consequences, just strains credibility.

:edit: Oh, the half-human-half-alien thing would have to go, though; unless there is literally a common ancestor that is very recent in evolutionary terms (like romulans and vulcans), there's just no rationalizing this short of extremely complicated genetic engineering, on a level nobody in the trek universe seems to have come close to. Well, except, possibly, those ancestors who seeded us all - which might, actually, be something more useful than "hi, kids, you play nice now" as a final message/gift for those progenetors to have buried in our DNA for us to find. But without serious canon history restructuring, such that that discovery was made centuries earlier, you couldn't have, say, Spock as a half-human, half-vulcan in the TOS era. Which, actually, as I think about it, I think is absolutely what you should do, and make Spock one of the first experimental applications of this knowledge, a hybrid created towards the express purpose of bringing humans and vulcans closer together.
