OP, this is an amazing idea. I have recently been watching DS9 for the first time since reading HPMOR, and it is completely ruined. The number of just boneheaded mistakes made per episode makes it almost unwatchable. Even so, I grew up with this franchise, and still love it.

A few of my personal suggestions:

- Fix the economy via basic income. The Federation is a post scarcity society that provides a basic level of existance, but anything beyond that and you need to get a paying job. The Federation gets around their "no money" rule by providing energy credits. It's not really money, it's a reallocation of reactor time!

- Pretend the Sol System is average. Much like MOR inserts a new rule of reality, you can play with habitable planets by saying that our solar system is pretty average, and most systems have an "earth like" planet.

- (Relaited to above) Pretend humans are the average. Earth like species happen to be the solution that nature tends towards. It doesn't have to be correct, just internally consistant. Delete all viable mixed species offspring, but not interspecies romance. After all... it's not unheard of here in the real world.

- Read some good military science fiction before you start writing. My personal suggestions are The Lost Fleet series (arguably the best depiction of space battles between capital ships), Odyssey One, Democracy's Right, and just for fun Wings of Steele (just the first book).

Edit: One more.

- Fix replicators by making them 3D printers that can do certain molecular manipulations. They can build a steak, but not a living cow. They can build a circuit board, but economies of scale make it cheaper to actually use a ship yard to build the /Enterprise/, and a foundry for armor plating.
