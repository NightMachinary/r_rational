Great read, thanks again for writing it!

One minor thing: in this last chapter Scar's language becomes a lot more casual. Calling Simba "Kid" rather than "boy," joking about his good looks. Maybe it's intended to show that he's feeling much less dignified/uptight now, but it felt a little off as presented. Maybe make it explicit if that's was intended :)
