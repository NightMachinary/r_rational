--Spoilers for chapter 9. Go back and read that if you haven't already--

The more I think about it, the more I feel that Ahadi does not quite fit as the final villain. Thematically, it really should have been Mufasa: The story starts with the conflict between the two brothers, it's what motivates Scar throughout the story, and then it would end with them fighting once more only to find peace in the end. There's closure between the two this way as well, and it teaches an important lesson about confirmation bias, but it's just less narratively satisfying with Ahadi as villain I think.

I guess I just didn't want to do the predictable "evil Dumbledore" routine that I have already seen so many fanfictions do. That and, uh... Mufasa was such an awesome character whose death was one of those tragic childhood-defining events of our generation, and I just couldn't bring myself to make him the bad guy. :S
