Thanks a lot! That's some high praise.

The whole explanation of how powers and spirits worked was a bit confusing to many, I think. The basic idea is that everyone has the potential for spiritual power within them, but most animals cannot tap into this because they lack focus and will power. However, by gaining enlightenment (aided by mind-expanding drugs, i.e. the red fruits) animals can gain awareness of their spirit and their connection to the world around them, thereby gaining control over the elements and allowing their spirit to persist after death instead of dissipating and becoming just another part of the world.

It's basically the same as in Star Wars, now that I think about it. Probably because both setting are based on the same Buddhist and spiritual concepts.
