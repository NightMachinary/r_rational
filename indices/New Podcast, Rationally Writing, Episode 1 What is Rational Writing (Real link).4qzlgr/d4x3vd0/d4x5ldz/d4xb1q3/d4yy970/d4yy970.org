    ...Is that really the best title we have?
  #+end_quote

  Probably not, but I'm absolutely horrendous at naming things, and we haven't thought of anything better yet :) The symmetry to Rationally Speaking felt a bit on the nose, but at the same time it succinctly describes what the point of the podcast is, *albeit with the quick disclaimer that we're talking about fiction*. If you think of a better one by all means let us know!

Dude, /it's the title/. It's probably the only thing the majority of people will ever read about the show. A disclaimer is /decades/ too late in the mind of someone idly scrolling through a list of podcasts. Your title and cover image don't sell the podcast by themselves, so people who don't know what it is without looking for it won't bother. The title needs to be changed, and before the paint dries. Consider this:

*RATIONALLY WRITING is a podcast about/for:*

1. Writing rational & rationalist fiction.
2. People who don't write rational fiction but want to learn how.
3. People who don't write rationalist fiction but want to learn how.
4. Writing logically sound fiction.
5. Writing logically sound non-fiction.
6. People who don't write fiction or non-fiction but want to learn how, with a rational/ist approach.
7. Somebody who read the first five arcs of /Twig/ and wants more.

I think your podcast is aimed at 1-4, but the title goes all the way through 5 and 7. That weakens the podcast in the long-run, irregardless of its actual content. You don't want people to be making requests for podcasts in other subreddits and needing a "quick disclaimer".

    I would recommend a "History of Rational Fiction" as your second episode. So I thought about this, but really once you get past the description of what HPMOR is (a 5 minute conversation at best), another quicker one for Luminosity, and the start of the subreddit, it all gets very muddled and boring for anyone not already very invested in the culture. If you disagree, I'd be happy to hear your idea for what the episode should cover.

Um, no. You referenced other rational stories at least a dozen times. It's virtually certain that you will keep using them as examples. You have to establish the major works of a canon before you can summon them offhand. Until you explain that you're going to make it harder for people who don't read everything posted here. I mean, you were the guy who took it upon himself to smooth over the opening chapters of HPMOR. Why would you do the same thing in your own podcast?

(Speaking of which, you'll need to get EY on as soon as you can)

  HPMOR would be at the beginning of a conversation about "the history of rational fiction," as you imply later. But as a way to introduce it to new people, explaining its roots doesn't serve as much, in my view. Maybe I'm wrong.

My intuition is that if you don't explicitly detail what and why HPMOR is, you'll end up implicitly referencing things about it throughout the podcast. It's better to get all of that out of the way instead of relying on your audience having read the story beforehand.

After writing and deleting this comment five times, I think my beef is that, for a podcast titled "Rationally Writing" it wasn't in-depth enough to help the writers, but it was also too dependent on the subreddit and other stories to be a proper introduction. That's why I say you need to pick a side more strongly each episode (Personally I loathe /Writing Excuses/ since I believe it's far too shallow to be of any use, but maybe that's because my mom's a writer and I've literally heard it all before).

The best book on writing I ever read was /Emotional Structure: A Guide For Screenwriters/, by Peter Dunne. Unlike most writing books, it developed an entire script piece by piece as you read. In fact, it developed multiple drafts of the script, which could be very different, and discussed why a particular change was made to a character or scene. By the end of the book, there really was a complete original film script inside. I've haven't since found something which so thoroughly detailed so many facets of storytelling.

But that book wasn't an introduction to learning how to write. By ignoring 90% of the people who buy writing books (seriously, have you been to [[/r/writing]]? It's just middle school all over again), the author could make something relevant to people who had been writing things all their lives.

It's like... what sort of podcast would teach /you/ more about writing? That would actually challenge you, and make you a much better writer? I don't really think this first episode is an episode of /that/ podcast. And this:

is /not/ a valid way to think about the history of rational fiction. I'm sure I could write a (long) essay about HPMOR and a (longer) one about /Worm/, and people in the future will do so, but /why wait for the future?/

Here's what I think, as a bare minimum, a "history" episode should cover. First, you start at the very beginning: LessWrong, and EY (maybe /Three Worlds Collide/). Then you describe HPMOR, the first few chapters of it and how people reacted to them, specifically describing how EY designed his story to bring rationalist ideals to /Harry Potter/ fans. EY has made many comments about this, so it shouldn't be too hard at all. Then you have to talk about the readers of the HPMOR subreddit forking into [[/r/rational]] during the doldrums of HPMOR. Then you go back and time and talk about how the community tried to integrate other works like /Worm/ and /Luminosity/ which had many of the still-vague "qualities of rational fiction" but not explicitly rationalist, and why we have a divide right there in the sidebar. Then you can briefly highlight the original works which began to be produced in the subreddit like /Branches on the Tree of Time/ or /A Bluer Shade Of White/, in chronological order.

(I just discovered that rationalfiction.io doesn't include dates for when a story was first written or published. From an antropologist's perspective, that's really irritating. Actually, there are a bunch of things about that site which irritate me. I should write a strongly worded letter.)

The point isn't to make something "only for people who are already very interested in the subculture". I reject /that/ dichotomy. It's not the audience's job to be interested, but yours to make it interesting. You can easily cover the above paragraph in a half-hour episode. I remember visiting this subreddit many times a day, every day, and reading every comment in high school because I was watching this genre sprout from the very start and /it was exciting/. Recapture that spirit and you will have no problems making people who are unfamiliar into the very familiar.

Lastly, for an example of a podcast episode I believe is basically perfect, have [[http://mentalpod.com/archives/3990][this (extermely NSFW, trigger warning, etc. but you're an adult) episode]] from the [[http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/12/a-podcast-for-your-mental-health/382981/][/Mental Illness Happy Hour/]]. You don't have to listen to the whole thing, just the first fifteen or twenty minutes should be more than enough. I know it's completely unfair to compare episode 1 of yours to episode 266 of his, but it is not apples-to-oranges.

This isn't extremely helpful feedback, I know. I also know that I haven't made a podcast and could well be talking out of my ass. This could also be an irreconcilible difference of vision. Take it with a grain of salt. Just know that I see the potential and I will be sad if the podcast never gets there.
