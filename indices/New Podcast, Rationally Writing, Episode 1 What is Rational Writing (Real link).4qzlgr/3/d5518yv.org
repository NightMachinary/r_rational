Only got around to reading the podcast now, so here's my two cents. In addition to advice on how to write characters smarter than yourself, I think you should also talk about how to write character dumber, or at least less knowledgable, than yourself since that seemed to be an issue alexanderwales brought up. Once you learn to think rationally, it becomes hard to write irrational characters.

For my second cent, I think you should also talk about genre conventions that are developing in rational fiction. For example, I finally got around to reading A Bluer Shade of White and noticed Olaf's development is based on a model of intelligence that isn't well known outside of our community. We can easily understand that Olaf is a Seed AI, but many readers wouldn't and might find it's inclusion jarring.
