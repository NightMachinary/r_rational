I'm typing up some notes on history right now. I have two big issues with it as an episode concept. First, it sort of seems like it would be better suited to something like a blog post than a free-flowing conversation (which I think we can probably deal with as topics for discussion between reading out the timeline). Second, we're both involved with that history and there's going to be an element of autobiography that I'm not a hundred percent comfortable with (but that's something I can get over).
