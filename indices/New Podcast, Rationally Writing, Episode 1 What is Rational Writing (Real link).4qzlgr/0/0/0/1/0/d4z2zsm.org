  I think your podcast is aimed at 1-4, but the title goes all the way through 5 and 7. That weakens the podcast in the long-run, irregardless of its actual content. You don't want people to be making requests for podcasts in other subreddits and needing a "quick disclaimer".

I understand, I just don't know of a better one. The recommended "Rationally Writing Fiction" feels too long and unwieldy, and "Fictionality" as someone else suggested just doesn't communicate, well, anything about what the podcast is about other than it's about fiction. And not even writing fiction, just fiction in general, which granted we'll be covering, but not as much.

  Um, no. You referenced other rational stories at least a dozen times. It's virtually certain that you will keep using them as examples. You have to establish the major works of a canon before you can summon them offhand. Until you explain that you're going to make it harder for people who don't read everything posted here. I mean, you were the guy who took it upon himself to smooth over the opening chapters of HPMOR. Why would you do the same thing in your own podcast?

I'll have to consider this after I get more feedback from people both in the community and not. I understand your point: if we reference a story later in the podcast, someone listening from the beginning is more likely to understand the reference if we've explained the story. Right now I think it's just better to reference and explain them as necessary, and letting the reader pick up that, say, Luminosity is a rationalfiction of Twilight, through a quick description and some context. Maybe we didn't do a good enough job of that in the first episode, so I'll keep an eye on it for later ones.

Yeah, that would be cool. I just figured his time is too valuable to mess around with something like this until it can be a bit refined and ensure it's not a wasted venture in general :)

  After writing and deleting this comment five times, I think my beef is that, for a podcast titled "Rationally Writing" it wasn't in-depth enough to help the writers, but it was also too dependent on the subreddit and other stories to be a proper introduction... It's like... what sort of podcast would teach you more about writing? That would actually challenge you, and make you a much better writer? I don't really think this first episode is an episode of that podcast.

I can only repeat myself here and say that it was the first episode, meant to simply introduce the topic and define it. I appreciate that you have/had high hopes for the podcast: I did and do too. But I feel like you're being unrealistic in your expectations based on one episode. Maybe that's me being defensive, but I don't feel defensive. I just don't know how to deliver everything you want this podcast to be in one episode, or even two or three. It'll take a bit of time to get there, and you're welcome to wait until it does and check in with it later if you'd like.

  Lastly, for an example of a podcast episode I believe is basically perfect, have this

I'll definitely check it out and respond again when I have :)

  Here's what I think, as a bare minimum, a "history" episode should cover... This isn't extremely helpful feedback, I know. I also know that I haven't made a podcast and could well be talking out of my ass. This could also be an irreconcilible difference of vision. Take it with a grain of salt. Just know that I see the potential and I will be sad if the podcast never gets there.
#+end_quote

It's extremely helpful feedback, actually, though it might just be a difference of vision, yeah. You have made me update a bit on my belief of the importance of establishing the works and what they're about though, and I do like your idea for the "history" episode trying to capture the spirit of what made so many people interested, so I'll talk to [[/u/alexanderwales]] about it.

Thanks again!
