Considering the rational fiction community is small, gathering listeners from within is easy, just word of mouth and posting here. The goal of the name might be better posed as attracting outsiders, in which case a less descriptive title could work.

Something like "fictionality" could attract avid readers who have never heard of the genre, just because it actually sounds like a fiction podcast.
