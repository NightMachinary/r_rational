  ...Is that really the best title we have?
#+end_quote

Probably not, but I'm absolutely horrendous at naming things, and we haven't thought of anything better yet :) The symmetry to Rationally Speaking felt a bit on the nose, but at the same time it succinctly describes what the point of the podcast is, albeit with the quick disclaimer that we're talking about fiction. If you think of a better one by all means let us know!

#+begin_quote
  but if you really plan to do this often you'll want the best mics you can get.
#+end_quote

Definitely a thought we've had, we'll see how the feedback for the show goes :)

#+begin_quote
  Speaking of which, what is the long term? You can dig into the old posts of the subreddit for material to discuss, but is that it?
#+end_quote

We currently have an episode idea list over 20 long, and all of it without even doing reviews or interviews, or digging into the subreddit for material, so we should be good for a fair bit.

#+begin_quote
  How often will you release episodes?
#+end_quote

Current plan is weekly.

#+begin_quote
  How long will episodes be? Will each episode be the same length?
#+end_quote

30-45 minutes, probably not as long as an hour, though it's still a bit early to tell. Some topics will warrant longer episodes, and we might split them if people prefer shorter episodes.

#+begin_quote
  What is the criteria for selecting guests?
#+end_quote

If we do guests we'll probably just reach out to other rationalist writers and ask them to come on to talk about their work or something they want to get into, or maybe even brainstorm ideas.

#+begin_quote
  You have a fundamental question which must be answered immediately: is this podcast for creators of rational fiction, or for people who haven't heard of it?
#+end_quote

With all due respect, I reject this dichotomy. Absolutely, the first episode is largely a retread for those in this subreddit. The second episode may be a bit of that too, since it's about tropes, but hopefully less so, and even less for each subsequent one. The idea of the podcast is to go into depth and analysis of the genre and process, both for those who enjoy that sort of thing and for those who are still new to it. We'd like to draw more people into the rational fiction community, and in my view at least, that includes introducing its tenets to those unfamiliar. As the podcast advances "those unfamiliar" are now familiar with it, so it's less of a concern.

#+begin_quote
  If Rationally Writing is an outreach podcast, then it fails, but for less severe issues. I find it very odd that the episode is titled "What is Rational Fiction" but HPMOR isn't mentioned until halfway through.
#+end_quote

HPMOR would be at the beginning of a conversation about "the history of rational fiction," as you imply later. But as a way to introduce it to new people, explaining its roots doesn't serve as much, in my view. Maybe I'm wrong.

#+begin_quote
  I would recommend a "History of Rational Fiction" as your second episode.
#+end_quote

So I thought about this, but really once you get past the description of what HPMOR is (a 5 minute conversation at best), another quicker one for Luminosity, and the start of the subreddit, it all gets very muddled and boring for anyone not already very invested in the culture. If you disagree, I'd be happy to hear your idea for what the episode should cover.

#+begin_quote
  It was a decent first effort, but the podcast, like this comment, seems very... amateur.
#+end_quote

I hope the later episodes mark an improvement for you. If you do listen to them, I look forward to your feedback on them!
