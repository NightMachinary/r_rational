...Is that really the best title we have?

Somehow, both of you sound exactly as I imagined you would. The sound quality was fine, though the distance between your mouth and and microphone varied at times, but if you really plan to do this often you'll want the best mics you can get. I listen to a possibly unreasonable number of podcasts and try to think constructively about things. This may come off as nitpicky, but imagine I'm saying them in the nicest way I can.

One thing that must happen is you must expand beyond Soundcloud. Get on iTunes at least. Also, the cover image is blurred and messy, and unsuitable for the long term. Personally I've always thought the basic image for rational fiction is a large book with a dagger for a bookmark.

Speaking of which, what is the long term? You can dig into the old posts of the subreddit for material to discuss, but is that it? How often will you release episodes? How long will episodes be? Will each episode be the same length?

How often will guests appear? How many guests can even appear (I'm sure you'll have enough for now, but by episode twenty or thirty it's going to dry up). What is the criteria for selecting guests?

However, these are all minor issues compared to this one: there is nothing here I have not heard before. This episode does nothing to add to the "ongoing conversation". It only retreads it, in a format which takes much longer to consume.

*You have a fundamental question which must be answered immediately: is this podcast for creators of rational fiction, or for people who haven't heard of it?* This may be harsh to ask something like that from a first episode, but it's not instantly apparent to me and that's really bad.

If /Rationally Writing/ (such a dry title) is for writers of rational fiction, it fails, because it isn't adding anything you don't get from the subreddit already. Rational writers' time would be better spent writing than listening at the reduced speed.

If /Rationally Writing/ is an outreach podcast, then it fails, but for less severe issues. I find it very odd that the episode is titled "What is Rational Fiction" but HPMOR isn't mentioned until halfway through. Someone who knows nothing about this subreddit is better served reading the sidebar and TVTropes page, except for the fact that these pages assumed as obvious to the reader, which they may not be.

Basically, if you want this podcast to drive the "conversation" it must be much tougher and denser than it is now. It cannot summarize past conversations, or it will fail and die.

If you want this podcast to summarize the past, it must operate in a vacuum. You may not intend this podcast to expand beyond this subreddit, but if it ever does you will have to redo the first couple of episodes. I would recommend a "History of Rational Fiction" as your second episode, but you guys already said it was going to be tropes, so I'm too late. It was nice that you guys identified the different between "Rationalist" and "Rationalist-Adjacent" but there was so much more you could have said there (and so much which should be said) that it's just not going to cut it to broach topics without taking them to their conclusions.

I have a lot more to say, but this comment is much too long already. It was a decent first effort, but the podcast, like this comment, seems very... amateur.

P. S. That title is weak, but I can't think of a better one. But it must exist.
