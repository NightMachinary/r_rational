Contrary to what someone else said, I actually think that you did move the conversation forward a bit regarding the genre. A lot of what you and [[/u/alexanderwales]] said here (e.g. about a ban on the Rule of Cool) has been noted in comments, but I don't think I'd heard a similar division of Rational/Rationalist to the one that was put forward here. I hope you can formalize a bit more what the genre is, and what the distinction is, such that we can improve on what we have in the sidebar, which I've never really liked.

I think your focus on the type of protagonist in the distinction between the two is a good one. I think it may be that the extent to which the protagonist is explicitly-ish a rationalist may be /the/ deciding factor in which sort of story a work is. I mean, the puzzle thing mentioned in the sidebar is good, and important, but I think failing that test is more evidence of bad writing than of a story not fitting into the rationalist genre -- and I'm not sure that it is any more important in RST fic than in RT fic.

Another point I liked was about the rules world not just needing to be sane, but sane and accessible to the reader. This is another thing we should probably just change in the sidebar, to distance the genre specifications from "the rules of good writing," though I liked what was said on this topic as well.

Basically, I thought you each said interesting things that helped me understand what we're doing here a bit better (well, not me, really). You /did/ advance the conversation, I think. Keep doing that :).

It would be nice if you enunciated a bit more though; I had to slow down the audio a bit from my customary 3.5x playback speed :P.
