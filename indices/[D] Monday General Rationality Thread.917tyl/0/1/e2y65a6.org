  ... but what do you guys have to say about memory improvement books?
#+end_quote

The best one is /Your Memory: How it Works and How to Improve it/ by Higbee. [[https://imgur.com/a/n8KPo][Here's the table of contents]]. Higbee was a psychologist and wrote it specifically to bridge the gap between the memory books that were strictly theoretical with no practical applications, and the memory books that were mostly practical with little scientific backing. He used it as a textbook in his classes.

As you can see from the TOC, it's pretty comprehensive.

  Is this a legitimate field of study that can improve memory to the degree promised, is it pseudoscience, or somewhere in between?
#+end_quote

It's legit.

In 2006 the Norwegian Memory Champion taught three random people to remember 1005 decimals of pi in 10 hours. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQfrN-ZIeMo][Video here]]. (Sorry it's Norwegian only, and the auto-translate is hilariously bad.)

Results: the man remembered only 120 decimals, but both women remembered all 1005 decimals, resulting in a new (at the time) women's world record (at least according to the video, although [[http://www.pi-world-ranking-list.com/index.php?page=lists&category=pi][this website]] only lists it as a Norwegian record).

The caveats here are that these people had expert guidance, and the task was well defined: remembering digits in a specific order.

But the encouraging bit is that these people had no previous experience at all.

As far as I can tell from the video they used the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system][Major System]] to translate numbers into letters, and then assemble the letters into words (the names of objects), and then they place these objects along a journey. ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci][Method of Loci]].)

To retrieve the digits, you then simply mentally walk along the route, retrieve the object stored at each location, and then translate the letters of the word of the object back into numbers according to the rules of the Major System.

If you're not interested in remembering digits of pi (and honestly: who is? lol), then you simply translate whatever text you want to remember into an object and then use the journey method directly.

The Greeks and Romans used this to remember their speeches.

  If it's anywhere close to the former, it seems like the kind of thing that should be shared with everyone
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  ... how to efficiently memorize things would be one of the first things I would teach my potential child because it makes every other area of study easier, and I would similarly push for it to be taught in elementary school.
#+end_quote

Double yes.

Higbee notes that the different techniques can be used successfully with children and the intellectually disabled, and quotes examples to this effect.

--------------

One pedantic note:

When we talk about /remembering/, what we're really interested in is /recalling/ information.

That is to say: when I'm in /this/ situation, talking about /this/ subject, I want /this thought/ to automatically arise in my consciousness.

An excellent way of ensuring this is to create [[https://apps.ankiweb.net/][Anki]] flashcards.

Whenever you read a fact that's worth remembering, you rephrase it as a question-and-answer pair, or a fill-in-the-blank card.

E.g.:

- Q: What's the volume of a tea-spoon?
- A: 5 mL

Or:

- Q: What three factors increase the memorability of a mental image?
- A: Vividness, interactiveness, and bizarreness.

Then you simply practise answering these cards, with increasing intervals between repetitions. (Anki elegantly combines active recall, the spacing effect, and interleaving in one wholesome package.)
