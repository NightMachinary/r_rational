I don't regularly follow this thread, so it may have been discussed before, but what do you guys have to say about memory improvement books? Moonwalking With Einstein is arriving in the mail tomorrow, and I read Unlimited Memory on Saturday, but haven't put in the time to practice it yet. Is this a legitimate field of study that can improve memory to the degree promised, is it pseudoscience, or somewhere in between? If it's anywhere close to the former, it seems like the kind of thing that should be shared with everyone, and would be an extremely easy way to sell people on improving your thinking, given the tangible benefits. I don't have a child, nor am I anywhere near ready to in any sense of the word, but how to efficiently memorize things would be one of the first things I would teach my potential child because it makes every other area of study easier, and I would similarly push for it to be taught in elementary school.
