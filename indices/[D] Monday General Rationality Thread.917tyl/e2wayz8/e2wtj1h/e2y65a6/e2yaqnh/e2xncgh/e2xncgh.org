I imagine that it would depend largely on how you think.

It's kind of like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map][mind maps]], I'd imagine. I never saw the /point/ of mind maps; they didn't help me in the least. I tried using them only when some of my schoolteachers told us to, but it gave me no improvement over written notes. It was only years later that I came to the realisation that /some people actually DO think like that/. And for those people, mind maps really /will/ work, because what is in the paper is a better reflection of what is in the head.

I suspect that memory improvement tricks are probably similar. They'll work for some people - and the people for whom they work will write books describing how they work and/or recommend the books that worked for them. And, from the accounts that I've heard, these tricks will work /really well/ when they do work.

But they might not work as well for everyone.

Having said that, give it a try! If it works for you, the benefits can be immense - if it doesn't, you're out a small financial commitment.
