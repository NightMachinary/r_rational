Thank you for the comment. I will likely end up reading your book recommendation, although maybe not soon.

The author of Unlimited Memory claimed he memorized 10,000 digits of pi, and beat the previous world record for recall using the number to word method. His book covers that, along with the loci method and a few other techniques. One system was to create a list of words that rhyme with numbers (one-bun, two-shoe, etc.) and associate whatever you are trying to remember with the number word. Better for things you don't need sequential access to, but potentially very useful.

I don't intend to memorize digits of pi, since I've already done so for the first ten digits and that's probably more than I will ever have the need to recall offhand. Maybe I'll do so for the speed of light, e, or other important constants like that.

I've downloaded Anki, because it seems like everyone and their mother is recommending it in this thread. Thanks for the recommendation.
