Wireheading's already a thing; you can just drug yourself up to eleven and live the entirety of your remaining lifespan full of hedons.

That we don't already do it suggests that pleasure is not the same as utility. Your value intuition likely pushes you away from maximising happiness, instead looking for more other things like meaning, satisfaction, etc. Which is also why they're higher-status.

Most people's intuition also pushes them away from dying, so in that there's a difference.
