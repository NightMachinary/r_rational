I don't think we're actually disagreeing here. I think I'm just communicating poorly.

- The value intuition of an individual is a very variable thing, yes. I'm not talking about the value intuition of an individual; I'm talking about the average long-term value intuition over a large population (this already covers for depressive moods etc.)

- Yes, humans have adaptations that we execute. But living longer is more likely to result in the presence of more children and hence more grandchildren - this is true now and was true all throughout human history. Adaptations that improved the desire to /live longer/ and /find a secure source of food/ are adaptations that would have helped your genes survive throughout the entirety of human history.

- Value intuitions are not, in and of themselves, values. It's not hard to find a situation where average-over-a-large-population value intuitions are in direct opposition to one's actual values. And whether you should base your morality on your values or derive your values from your morality is another completely different debate. But I think that we can agree that you shouldn't be basing your morality on how many grandchildren it gives you.
