  That's all well and good, but I've noticed an inconsistency with how this sub (and the rationalist community as a whole) reacts to a similar topic. Namely, it seems like people have an extremely adverse reaction to the concept of [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading][wireheading]]. To me, it seems like a lot of the same criticisms of being pro-death apply to being anti-wireheading:

  - Humans have always naturally found means of happiness, so we don't have any frame of reference for a gratifying life by chemical means.
  - We don't have the technology to consistently make people happy, and the drugs we /do/ currently have often have extreme side effects, so we romanticise "pure" means of achieving happiness.
  - Humans associate wireheading with modern forms of hedonism (drug abuse, escapism, social isolation) without considering it in the context of the future.

  To be clear, I also feel an innate aversion to wireheading, but I'm wondering if it might not be rational to discard it just because it doesn't perfectly fit my conception of “ideal happiness”. Could it be that the best possible future is one where we're all hooked up to dopamine drips? It's not a pleasant thought, but it might be a necessary one.

I think that the traditional description of utilitarianism is wrong, and definitely incomplete. "Maximizing happiness" would definitely lead to wireheading, because wireheading is just shortcutting all the work for making suffering people happy. A better description would be "maximize the values that make us happy", which is still incomplete, but i believe to be more accurate. Would I want to live in a society that has abandoned all art, beauty, science, knowledge, critical thinking, love, and everything worthwhile about humanity, so long as all the people can put on a helmet or flip a switch and experience complete bliss? That sounds like one of the more horrifying dystopias to me. Happiness is an evolutionary way of making organisms do things that they like by giving them an immediate, tangible reward for the completion of some abstract goal. I want the things that currently make me happy to be maximized, not the happiness itself unless it comes about through the former method.

I don't have any innate problem with people occasionally using drugs or anything else to experience those wirehead like feelings, so long as they keep it occasional rather than consuming their existence.
