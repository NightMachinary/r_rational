I have a topic that I've been thinking about for a while, but I haven't really figured out how to put in the words. I know this sub has some pretty anti-death sentiments, as shown by the popularity of CGP Grey's [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77lzq9][video on the topic]]. The video does a great job of breaking down why anybody would have pro-death sentiments, and how they can be dangerous:

- Humans have never known a reality in which we don't die, so we don't have any frame of reference for a world without death.
- With our current technology, it's impossible to prevent death, so people choose to romanticise it as a coping mechanism.
- Humans feel an innate sense of “wrongness” at the concept of immortality, and popular media often portrays it as a curse rather than a blessing.

That's all well and good, but I've noticed an inconsistency with how this sub (and the rationalist community as a whole) reacts to a similar topic. Namely, it seems like people have an extremely adverse reaction to the concept of [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Wireheading][wireheading]]. To me, it seems like a lot of the same criticisms of being pro-death apply to being anti-wireheading:

- Humans have always naturally found means of happiness, so we don't have any frame of reference for a gratifying life by chemical means.
- We don't have the technology to consistently make people happy, and the drugs we /do/ currently have often have extreme side effects, so we romanticise "pure" means of achieving happiness.
- Humans associate wireheading with modern forms of hedonism (drug abuse, escapism, social isolation) without considering it in the context of the future.

To be clear, I also feel an innate aversion to wireheading, but I'm wondering if it might not be rational to discard it just because it doesn't perfectly fit my conception of “ideal happiness”. Could it be that the best possible future is one where we're all hooked up to dopamine drips? It's not a pleasant thought, but it might be a necessary one.

Thoughts?
