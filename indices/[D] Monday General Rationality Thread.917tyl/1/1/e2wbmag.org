I certainly don't have an aversion to carefully, properly done improvement of my happiness. I'm actually on anti-depressants right now, which are essentially a primitive form of that. The key is that I want to be modified to find pleasure in doing things that I want to do - eg eating salad tasting great, etc. Not have my mind put into a coma of continuous pleasure where I never make any choice again - ie be turned into hedonium.
