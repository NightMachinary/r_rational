You're not basing your morality on what is likely to see your genes propagated; humans are [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XPErvb8m9FapXCjhA/adaptation-executers-not-fitness-maximizers][not fitness-maximisers, they're adaptation-executers]].

Concretely this means that the values we have are obviously not random, they were selected via their fitness. They are not exactly equal to evolutionary fitness (i.e. gene propagation success). So you shouldn't base morality on evolutionary fitness; instead you should base it on fulfilling human values.

In any case no matter how your values came to be, you should base your morality on what the values actually are. I expect in small-scale situations your intuition will have better insight into your values than purely logical reasoning. (Modulo depressive moods etc where your intuition might say that you won't enjoy anything ever, and logical reasoning can help break out from that)
