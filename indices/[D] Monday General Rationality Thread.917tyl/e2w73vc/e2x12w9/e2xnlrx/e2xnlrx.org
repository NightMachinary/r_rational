Value intuition, taken over an entire society, is an evolved bias to human perception; that is to say, value intuition is going to (on average) put the most value on behaviours likely to lead to having grandchildren. It values living, so that you can be around to support children and possibly long enough to support grandchildren; it pushes you away from mere permanent hedonistic pleasure and towards stability of food and shelter, so that your children and grandchildren are more likely to survive; and so on.

Value intuition is an important part of the human psyche. But is it really a good idea to base your morality on what is most likely to see your genes successfully propagated into the future?
