It depends on what one means by wireheading. If you're talking about reducing the entirety of human experience to an unchanging and constant sensation of joy, like a video game which has been reduced to one screen that blares out "A WINNER IS YOU!" for all eternity, then the chief emotions that are conjured up in me are disgust and bewilderment that anyone would find this attractive. At that point, why not just commit suicide?

On the other hand, some people talk about [[https://www.wireheading.com][eliminating pain and establishing gradients of bliss]], and I find this to be a far less objectionable argument. Certainly, there is a part of me that dislikes the idea of engineering pain away, but I'm pretty sure that this is just a broken part of me that could only develop in a broken world, and that it'll be abandoned by future generations (or to put it another way, I can reason out how a future with any kind of pain would be inferior but I don't feel that wrongness on a visceral level, the way that I feel the wrongness of e.g. abusing animals).
