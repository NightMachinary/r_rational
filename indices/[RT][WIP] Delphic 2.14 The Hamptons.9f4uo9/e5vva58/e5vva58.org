I get the feeling Norberg was the driving force behind the original Iron Lantern Project. Going to admit, I keep hoping to see 'delphic' mention that he's extracting all of his assets from the country and leaving, moving to some other part of the world, and it's all because the Norburg's won't leave him to be an American. Or something. Incredibly petty, but becomes more and more rational with every new exposure to Harmony.
