Whenever you make a decision, try to see the consequences.\\
If it's the right decision you'll stick with it and therefore can see.\\
If it's a bad choice the future is blurry.\\
Now obviously the future will be blurry both ways if you could always do better, but it's still valuable.\\
You could even try changing your plans until you hit upon the perfect future that you wouldn't change.

Oh and naturally this is easy money gambling since what horse you bet on or what lottery ticket you buy has no influence on the results.
