You're in a litrpg, and one of the powers is a cutscene power. When you activate it, the relevant parties to the cutscene in the area will go through some forced non-combat interactions with each other, biased towards saying expository things, though that might just be â€˜I'll never break to torture!' The actions taken are outside of your direct control, and not reliably biased towards the user or any other person.

You can only activate it at times where it would make sense to have a cutscene in a normal game, which mostly just prevents spamming it on people. When in the cutscene, things that aren't part of the cutscene can't physically affect the way it plays out, though anything that would have (aka. anything that isn't conditioned on the use of the cutscene skill) is generally included part of the cutscene.

Basic ideas for usage: interrupt or stall out magical effects, give unaffected team-members time to get into throat-cutting position, use it to fish for information when spying (at the price of no longer being covert).
