You've been Isekai'd into a toy in the Toy Story universe. Congratulations, death is now meaningless to you personally!

But you must fall down and stop moving whenever humans could be observing you; the imagination magic that animates you is sensitive to both direct (eyeball/eardrum) and indirect (camera/microphone) observation. The exception is when your relationship to your kid is at stake AND the observation will not result in the unmasquerading or toys in general. Also, audio and touch observation are less important to avoid than visual.

Also, you can wear out, or break. Broken-off parts don't work. Modular toys like Potatohead aren't broken when disassembled, and work over vast distances at the speed of light.

What are some worthwhile goals to pursue with your radically different mortality and abilities?
