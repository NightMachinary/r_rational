First thing is experimenting to figure out the nature of being a toy. One of the big things is what grants toys sentience; since I can't experiment in a comment I'm going to assume it's a child's love and imagination, because that's thematically appropriate and extremely inconvenient. This makes coexisting with humans a must.

First big goal is achieving autonomy for myself and toy-kind. Which requires the ability to affect the world without being directly observed by humans. My plan starts with taking over a toy shop - find a small shop with an owner that's not too observant, preferably with few familial ties, preferably with a trade-in program, preferably with an old owner (but, being immortal, you can just wait for that). You can start your own trade-in program by putting up signs on your own when the owner is looking, if you have to. Trade-ins provide more sentient toys (since we're operating under the assumption that toys are not sentient until a child plays with them). Slowly take over the shop's operations so the owner doesn't hire/replace help, so you have more room to work without observation. Upgrade the trade-in program to be a mail-in program since you can do that with less human contact. Buy a warehouse somewhere in the owner's name and expand the mail-in toy trade program. When the owner gets too old to run the business, make sure they close the storefront but don't officially close your business, and take care of them, and prevent any obituaries from being published when they eventually die of old age. If you can forge an identity for a successor, do so, but you might have to find a new oblivious person to be your patsy.

A warehouse running a toy-swap business staffed by sentient toys has some advantages; any toys they receive that are undesirable or have significant cosmetic damage can still stick around and help run the business.

The second goal is toy production. It's profitable and you want the world to have useful toys, like large toys with hands. Also try buying some industrial robot arms, giving kids factory tours, and seeing if you can convince them to play with deactivated arms enough to grant them "toy" status. If you can make your factory equipment sentient then you can avoid a lot of difficult automation and control problems.

Finally you want to start bootstrapping for intelligence. Buzz Lightyear's personality is based on the TV show that he's merchandising for, so if you can control children's television then you can control the personalities of the toys you produce. So something about hard-working, cooperative, intelligent people with humanist views. It's a lot easier to write a super-intelligent character than it is to actually be super-intelligent, so you can seed the cast with some of those too. When kids see that, buy the corresponding toy, and eventually send it back in, you now have smarter people to write future seasons. The show doesn't even have to be that popular to start either, since you can also write creative talent as an informed ability, and when you get your creative characters back as toys they can take over the show writing.

Then the usual, defeat death for toys and humans alike, etc.
