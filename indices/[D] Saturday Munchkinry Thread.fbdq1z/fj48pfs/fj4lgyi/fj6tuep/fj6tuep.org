We know of one concrete method of sapient toy creation, thanks to Toy Story 4: the imagination of a child creator. Forky the spork-man and his lovely wife are the heart-spawn of little Bonnie.

I'd think the first toy to check is a dog's toy. Does it move and make noise on its own? After that, sneak into a zoo and figure out if the apes have toys that can do things.
