It might sound uncomfortably like mad science or Saruman forming his Uruk-hai in mud pits, but we should explore creating toys. Can toys create toys or does a human have to be involved? What are the limits of what counts as a toy? Can you gradually change your form by replacing parts? Are any specific parts essential to cognition and volition or does the magic work as long as you are recognizable as a toy?

Sid was successful in radically altering toys, though he did not have a useful goal. If you take two toys and mix their parts, what happens to their minds and memories? Can any impact from this be reversed by returning all the parts to their original places?
