Do you have the imagination of a child? I assume that's what it takes to animate these things. I'd believe you if you said yes, but in the interest of making the setting as difficult to work with as possible, I'll assume that you don't count.

And furthermore, an attempt to make a cartoon with CelestAI so that kids would imbue strong AI superpowers onto their imaginary friends would run into trouble where you only get a child's understanding of what a strong AI is like (good with numbers but could be tricked by the heroes), and it's difficult to capture the right intersection of childlike wonder and understanding thought experiments about hard AI takeoffs. But I don't think it's /unsolveable/, and your idea sounds like a good goal.
