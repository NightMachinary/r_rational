Suppose you tied a heavy weight to yourself.

Then, technically, you can walk on the ocean floor (you just can't breathe and will have pressure problems). But with these magic boots, you would only have to hold your breath for the duration of the trip, which is the amount of time it takes to take one step. So could you use these boots to walk across various kinds of underwater terrain?

What about balancing issues? Suppose there is a long thin bridge across a large gap. You wouldn't reasonably be able to cross it due to wind and fear and what not, but could you do it with the boots anyway since you could technically walk across it? If so, could you carry a grappling hook around, throw it across whatever gaps you find, and instant-walk on the rope to the target using the magic boots?
