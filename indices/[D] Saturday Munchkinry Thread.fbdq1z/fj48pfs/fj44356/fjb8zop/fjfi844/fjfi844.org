You have the power of precognition, which is also clairvoyant, in that you can observe the future from any perspective. However, your future vision has an interesting limitation.

It becomes blurry/distorted in proportion to how much the act of viewing the future would destabilize that future. So it's just about useless for viewing anything in close proximity to you. You might be able to see the future inside of your neighbor's house, or you might not. You can probably see the future of a random person's house in another country reasonably far ahead.

The crux is that you always experience a consistent timeline where whatever information you gain about the future is accurate. If viewing a piece of information about the future would invalidate that info, then you don't see it.

So for example, in the case of viewing a neighbor's future, if your neighbor is about to get attacked, and if you would attempt to intervene upon seeing that your neighbor will be attacked, then you won't see your neighbor be attacked. If you precommit really hard to sit in your room no matter what you see, you might be able to view the future where your neighbor is attacked, so long as doing so wouldn't cause you to break your precommitment.

You're basically never going to be able to see yourself or the results of your actions directly, because there aren't many self-consistent timelines where that happens. The odds that, upon seeing yourself do something, you would do that thing in the /exact same way,/ are vanishingly small, now matter how hard you might try to imitate future-you, so when you try to look at yourself you don't see anything. You can't even view someone else receiving a text that you send- the odds that after seeing that, you would manage to send the text at the exact right moment, are also vanishingly small.

Anyway, this power is clearly very strong, but how would you take full advantage of it? You can probably use it to become a great day trader, but beyond that, what would you do?
