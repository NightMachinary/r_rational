Actually I would say day trading is out because your trades are going to affect the prices of what you traded.

Those lottery numbers, on the other hand, are going to get drawn regardless of whether I buy their ticket.

On a short timeline, you are basically looking at clairvoyance. Look 10 minutes into the future to see if my neighbor is a drug dealer. Look 3 hours into the future to see if my girlfriend is cheating on me. Spy on the meeting my manager is in.

Carry a burner cellphone to call in emergencies slightly before they happen for better outcomes.

For your own mental health, never look more than a week into the future. You might see something you wish you could change.
