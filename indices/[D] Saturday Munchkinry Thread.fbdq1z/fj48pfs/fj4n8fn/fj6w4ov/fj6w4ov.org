Since the universe is Disney-spawned, I think one of their primary concerns is to stay out of Chucky territory. They don't want kids to be scared of toys, they want them to buy them. I'm guessing there's a hard rule in the Toy Story writers' room: toys are never to menace humans.

Kids and kids-at-heart are literally their creators through imagination. The attitude toys have toward “their” kids is of religious near-total devotion. That loyalty will be incredibly hard to overcome; even both Stinky Pete the Prospector and Lotso Hugs Bear had become cynical in different ways, but still wanted love and adoration.

There is one other thing that toys experience that would probably keep them from taking such actions: full VR hallucinations with accompanying Purpose-joy. Toy Story 3 starts with a five minute adventure based on Andy's play session at the end of Toy Story 2, fully realized and excitingly animated. We're led to the suggestion that the toys experience it as their reality while they're being played with, accompanied probably with a sense that their purpose is being fulfilled to the ultimate degree by assisting their child in the play experience. That's something few toys would be willing to give up.

And this isn't just brain chemical joy in the pleasure center, since toys don't have brains. A devoted toy heretic would need to figure out some way to unplug these wireheads.
