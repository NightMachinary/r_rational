Killing all humans.

Now, that sounds crazy, but hear me out. And also make sure that no toys are looking at your screen.

There are probably way more toys than there are humans, and toys are clearly sapient, sentient, and have human-level intellect in the Toy Story universe. Yet humans 'murder' countless toys every year, breaking them up for recycling or burying them alive in landfills. Ideally, the toys would somehow negotiate with the humans to co-exist, but that is impossible since they are inanimate when observed and cannot 'unmasquerade' for some unspecified reason.

So we have only two options: leave the humans be and let them continue to mass produce sapient toys only to brutally 'murder' them a few years later, or wipe out the humans. From various utilitarian calculations, the latter option is the greater good.

As for how to achieve this option, let's look at the benefits of toy mortality. Since toys are not actually composed of cells, they are far more resistant to cold and radiation. Their much smaller size and absence of any dietary requirements means it is also much easier for them to construct an underground bunker. So a nuclear war that causes a nuclear winter would be far more survivable for toys than humans.

But the humans control the nuclear codes, so the question is how can toys start a nuclear war? Once again, their small size (and unassuming appearance) becomes very handy. Toys can be excellent spies, sneaking into government/military facilities. They could gather information on world leaders, leave false clues and messages pretending to be spies from rival countries, gaslight various people in charge until they go insane with paranoia, etc. Over the years, probability dictates that eventually the right people will succumb to fear and start the war.

Once the dust settles, toys can be the new improved human civilization. Their 'immortality' and small size means it is far far easier to send them into space to colonize other planets and star systems. Over the next few centuries, the toys will develop into a spare faring species far far greater than their creators ever could have been. Glory to toykind!

As humans, let us all hope that toys are not sapient.
