I mean, you might now be able to see your neighbor being attacked, per se, but if you knew your neighbor had enemies, you could see them approaching and be ready to come to you neighbors defense. If you detect your enemies crossing the threshold onto your estate in 24 hours, you wouldn't necessarily have to deal with them before they cross your threshold, but you could be waiting with snipers when they do. You could resolve to stay in your room until they cross said threshold. You could use it to see a banker type in his password a minutes from now, and then break into his accounts in 2 minutes.

You could also use it to stop certain events. You don't need to see 9/11 happening, but you can see the planes being hijacked. You could know where Hitler would be, and take advantage of that to kill him, etc etc. Another use is exams, see what is on the exam, study it before hand. The future sight isn't as important as the clairvoyance, because if you see a minute into the future wherever, you are able to take advantage of that.
