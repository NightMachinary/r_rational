Has anyone done seven-league boots?

From Wikipedia [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-league_boots]]

"Seven-league boots are an element in European folklore. The boot allows the person wearing them to take strides of seven leagues per step, resulting in great speed. The boots are often presented by a magical character to the protagonist to aid in the completion of a significant task."

My idea for the boots is a magical item of 2 pieces (left and right boot) that you activate by clicking your heels together 3 times with even intervals. Then the next step you take, effectively teleports you 34km (7 leagues) in the direction you hold the other foot (the one on the ground). 2 uses per day, one for each foot.

1. You can only arrive at a destination via boots, if you can walk there. 1.1. Obstacles divert you, but things like hills you can reasonably walk (not climb) over do not. 1.2. 34km is not a straight line, subtracts terrain and elevation costs.
2. Boots ignore anything that might otherwise stop you, if you actually walked.
