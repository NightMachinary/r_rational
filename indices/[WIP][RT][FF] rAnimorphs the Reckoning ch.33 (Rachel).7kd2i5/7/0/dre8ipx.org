  So this part was confusing. The word "shape" is used twice, but is it referring to the same thing in both cases? And what is it referring to? (I read back over this and couldn't figure it out). In general, the ending of this chapter was much harder to understand than the ending of the last chapter (perhaps that's by design).

  This is also confusing, because it sounds like Ax is dead ... but then later, Ax is referred to as "unconscious." So was Rachel looking at someone else? Are we supposed to know who it was?
