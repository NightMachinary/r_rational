I am so confused right now.

In positive new, the Marco/Rachel shipping intensifies.

That... seems like a really, really dumb comment from her. The characters have been pretty good at questioning everything so far, and going "maybe everyone is secretly a robot / an alien / someone else morphed", and now seems like a pretty obvious time to apply it.

Stargate rule n°1: if they've missed a check-in and their team is missing, they're a Goa'uld.

Okay, this is at least the second time that happens (don't remember when the first was). Is there some sort of emulated Marco in Rachel's brain? Because this is starting to sound like way more than an imaginary voice and like something with an actual personality.
