I don't know - Garrett strikes me as being the sort of person who's /really/ precise about what he means. If he didn't have good reason to think that that was Visser Three, he would have called out "That's not Jake" instead of positively identifying the Visser. (Possibly using thought-speech shenanigans?)

Mind you, it clearly /is/ David's body here, and I suspect that it's probably under control of one of the Visser's remote Yeerk-clones, not the Visser himself...
