Well. So the bracelet is paying off.

My prediction seems to have not come true: no time-stopping intervention happened in this chapter. On the other hand, could Tobias be alive? I thought he was dead at the end of last chapter, but now that I think about it, I don't recall him being part of the Leeran hypersight.

I don't get why Visser 3 doesn't just nuke everyone from space, or just come in shooting with the blade ship, since he knows exactly where they are.

  They had at least three hyperdrives now

They should use a hyperdrive to blow up Visser Three's Mars operation.

  I spun the knob, pressed the button, and---with the last of my strength---threw it toward the almost-invisible shape.

  TSEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW---

  The shimmering crystal shape froze in place

So this part was confusing. The word "shape" is used twice, but is it referring to the same thing in both cases? And what is it referring to? (I read back over this and couldn't figure it out). In general, the ending of this chapter was much harder to understand than the ending of the last chapter (perhaps that's by design).

#+begin_quote
  Oh, god. Ax.

  I shoved myself to my feet, my body still fluid and unstable. I looked down at the shape of---

  Dead.

  Definitely dead.
#+end_quote

This is also confusing, because it sounds like Ax is dead ... but then later, Ax is referred to as "unconscious." So was Rachel looking at someone else? Are we supposed to know who it was?

So I'm really sad that everyone seems to be dying, including /all my favorite goddamn characters/. Sure, having the good guys always win in stories is less realistic, but on the other hand, that's not necessarily a bad thing, as stories are specifically /for fun/ among other things. You've clearly been planning these events for a long time though, so I'm just going to ride this out.
