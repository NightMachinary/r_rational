Alphanos' interpretations below are the intended ones.

As to your other questions, V3 didn't strike from space because a) politics and b) he is now aware of Telor's mutinous wavering and doesn't trust them to carry out operations like that. He didn't go himself because he's /super/ prioritizing the Chee and can only /kind of/ be in two places at once.

As for using a hyperdrive to /blow up Mars/ ... that's ambitious, and I don't blame them for having not quite thought of it yet. Remember that despite my slow update schedule, the in-story timing of all of these events is RUSHRUSHRUSHRUSHRUSH, and hopefully they can be forgiven for small mistakes and an inability to completely think everything through.

Re: Tobias, no comment. The pieces are there; if it's too hard or not interesting to put them together, they'll be explained in later chapters. He was definitely part of the hypersight scene, though less prominent than Jake and Marco.
