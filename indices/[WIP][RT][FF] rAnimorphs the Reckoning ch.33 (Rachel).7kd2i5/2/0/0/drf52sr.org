I think I was still in denial.

Edit: Actually, I have a better explanation for it: The thought scream heard at the end of the chapter is Garrett's "secret weapon", and only possible if he's in morph. Since it's being made, and assuming he's the only one who can make it (at least; he was the only one who succeeded in doing so on-screen), it means that maybe he was wearing morph armor, and still will have a chance to demorph back to being fine.

Please say he's fine.
