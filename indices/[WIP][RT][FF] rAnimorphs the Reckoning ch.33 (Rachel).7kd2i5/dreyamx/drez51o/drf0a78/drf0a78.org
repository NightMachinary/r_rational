  there's really - I claim - only one set of 'next things' that make sense.

I... don't really see it? Anything could happen, depending on which characters survived this chapter and the previous one (which is a little unclear), which decisions they and V3 make, which resources V3 has access to, and what he's done in his free time so far.

More than that, this last encounter could have gone in any number of ways based on purely random (that is, non-chekov's-gun-ish) factors:

- The Visser-Bot could have opened with his Andalite blaster and basically sliced every protagonist into carpaccio in 10 seconds, before getting within stabbing distance of Rachel.

- The Visser-Bot could have opened with an antimatter paintball (seriously, how comes nobody ever uses that thing?) and blown every protagonist into meat soup in 3 seconds.

- Rachel could have decided to hang back, keep their ship invisibility on, and blown up the VB from above once he was identified.

- Rachel could have double-tapped the VB before trying to rescue the others.

- Rachel could have decided to set up Garett or Ax as a backup sniper just in case.

My point isn't that any character behaved really incompetently (although they kind of did) but that there's a million different ways things could have gone down and could still go down. Maybe the gods can anticipate all those things, but as a reader I object to the idea that the events are flowing logically from one to the next.

  If you think of this result as having been orchestrated, not by me but by /a character in the story/

I... don't really like that idea? I'm probably not alone, there's like a billion different "Why Contessa and Shards and Jack's power suck in Worm" threads to be found; given that we don't understand the gods' motivations, that their intelligence is too vast for us to comprehend, and that their interventions are mostly off-screen, there's not much visible difference between "this was orchestrated by gods" and "this is railroading".
