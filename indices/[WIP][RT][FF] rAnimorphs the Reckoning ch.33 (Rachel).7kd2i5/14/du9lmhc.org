m8 you better not have killed everyone. Especially not Rachel or Garret. Especially not Rachel. Nuh uh. She was my favourite character in the originals as a kid, and you've written her so well that she can actually be my favourite as an adult. She thinks in a clear, focused way. She's also more reasonable about things, while also having the same determination that she had in the original series.
