It's kind of weird none of my internal imaginary voices are based on ANYONE but myself. Maybe it's because I don't trust anyone else enough to let them have a say in my own head. When I was a kid I had a lot of internal imaginary voices, and most of them from people who were very critical of me and didn't provide useful advice. Even my close friends don't get an imaginary voice representing them in my head.

My imaginary voices seem to fall along a continuum of left/right and forward/back, which seems to correspond somewhat to my intentional system and automatic system, but I don't know why it's split in two different axes. Furthermore wall I can tell when the interaction is going left/right and front/back, it's hard to tell in retrospect which thoughts are "left" and which are "right" and same for front/back.
