  Note that V3 is the type to cooperate with clones of himself, for the most part, even though he's often not kind to them in the end.

If there's a chance for this to come up in an interlude chapter, it'd be interesting the hear you write one of V3's clones that knows/ strongly suspects it is going to be sacrificed for the greater good. It's not obvious to me that the Visser's absolute drive to survive wouldn't be present in a mind-continuity sense in his clones, I'm surprised they aren't more interested in their own personal survival instead of the wider V3.
