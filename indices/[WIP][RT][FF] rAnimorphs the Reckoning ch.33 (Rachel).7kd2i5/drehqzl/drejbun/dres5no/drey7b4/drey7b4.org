I doubt this will ever have a chance to be further clarified in text (it was in the previous chapter, but in a blink-and-you-might-miss-it sort of way), so ...

A V3 /clone/ Yeerk (as opposed to a blank copy that he controls directly) controlling the body of David, and that clone V3 wasn't part of the Leeran hypersight conversation and thus doesn't know that morphing is dangerous (and V3 didn't tell it; just said "Go, kill").

Note that V3 is the type to cooperate with clones of himself, for the most part, even though he's often not kind to them in the end.

Also: Garrett has had a chance to hear Visser Three's spoken word inflection/cadences via the recordings of his landing and speech (in the prettylite body).
