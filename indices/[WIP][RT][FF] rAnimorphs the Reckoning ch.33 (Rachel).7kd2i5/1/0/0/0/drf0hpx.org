That's fair. And I'm definitely doing some illusion-of-transparency bias on myself, here, when thinking about how the next chapter I have planned "makes intuitive sense."

But when I sit in the shoes of the characters that are /clearly/ still alive, and I look at the resources they are /known/ to have, the next actions that will be written into the story feel, to me, like the things I would do myself in that situation (and it doesn't feel like there's a wide open space of possibility).
