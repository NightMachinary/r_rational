I think we know Tom is alive, Garret and Ax and Rachel might be alive, but I thought there was no easy way to fix damage to your real body so they're probably in a bad way at best.

Jake and Marco and Tobias I would have said are clearly dead and aren't coming back unless Tom or someone sacrifices themselves by perma-morphing.
