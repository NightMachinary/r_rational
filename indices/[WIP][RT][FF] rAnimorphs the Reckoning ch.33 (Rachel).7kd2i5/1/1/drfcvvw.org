I trust you as an author, and I'll be with this fic until the end. A lot of the problem is the the time between updates, which can't really be helped given that you are not a full time author. It's like watching an intense action scene, except that every few seconds, the stream pauses to buffer.

I am definitely /not/ going to read any of the spoilered text in your comments or the ensuing discussions.
