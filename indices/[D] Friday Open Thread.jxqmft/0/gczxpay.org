I have a story I'm still writing, and I got to the point in the story where the self insert for me and the summoner I'm working with purges the depression from my soul.

I have to say, as someone with depression, putting your depression inside a story and then arranging for it to have the crap beaten out with teamwork of it feels good. Even if the method, out of context, is utterly ridiculous.

Actually, it feels EVEN better that it is ridiculous. I told depression to take a nap, and then had a pile of nearly helpless babies all punch it for one damage while it was sleeping, and that's the kind of undignified end it deserves.
