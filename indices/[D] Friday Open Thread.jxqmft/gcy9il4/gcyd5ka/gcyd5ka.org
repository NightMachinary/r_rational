The one problem I have with these ideas is that its a lot harder to bring change then people thing. Just because I know stuff is gonna go down does not mean I can convince people to do something about it. And for all you know your earlier history makes things that slightly different (so maybe instead of 9/11 its 9/12 for example). The best thing you can do is self improvement.
