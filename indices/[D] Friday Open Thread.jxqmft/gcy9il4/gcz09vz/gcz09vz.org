If a couple hundred million dollars could swing an election, the world would look pretty different. But given that you know which area was in dispute, you could really concentrate your effort there, and so the 2000 election seems particularly swingable. Funny that you think the pandemic would still happen in 2020, you really must think the butterfly effect is not a thing or something.
