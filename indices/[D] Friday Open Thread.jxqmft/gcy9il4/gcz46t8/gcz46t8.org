Thats hard because for a random kid to be able to make a change you would have to assume that things dodnt happen as intended. Which might be true or it might jot.

Look at the reports of thr US having some fore knowlge of pearl harbor. Maybe they did maybe they didn't. Every event is like that I think. So it is hard to say what I could actually oush on to change things. Which would be intresting.

Honestly, young me spends birthday money on tech stock instead of pokemon cards. Rich off it.

If I get involved with MMA early. I could have been fighting in the 2000s with people that have never seen a leglock before. I could have ended up a co-host of the Joe Rogan podcast after being a champion athelete despite being wildy mediocre. So I would be rich and famous.

Being set for life with money I could then do just EA stuffs. Which I guess would be having a vauge memory of market crashes allows me to become super wealthy. So I could do alot of ea.
