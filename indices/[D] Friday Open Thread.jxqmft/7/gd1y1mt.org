[[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php][Warning, deep Archives]] This gem of a page is like TV tropes, just with a singular focus on space related matters.

Extensive discussion and links to the latest NASA ISRU scheme, comet exploitation, solar system astrography, discussing Hard SciFi aspects of novels, calulating deltaV of fictional ships, extensive excerpts from scifi works to display an interesting concept a SciFi writer spun out of thin air.

You want to write a SciFi novel and think you have an interesting spin on Starship Financing? Check out the sections on starship ownership, including historical overview of nautical insurances and a list of ideas of your fellow precursor authors.
