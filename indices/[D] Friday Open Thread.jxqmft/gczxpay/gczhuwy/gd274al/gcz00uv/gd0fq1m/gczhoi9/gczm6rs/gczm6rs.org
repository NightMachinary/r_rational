I'd add a knowledge of drag, and also heat and mass transfer. Drag calculations would help one know if one can knock things over. Heat and mass transfer is immense in this case: can one dilute poison gas? or cause evaporation of water? or cool things down? or put out fires? or make infernos?

Practical use example: Wind at your back while running would not only make you faster but make you more comfortable as well, by evaporating water from your skin. Having drag favor you instead of hinder you might make sprinting relatively effortless.

These considerations likely fall under 'engineering.'
