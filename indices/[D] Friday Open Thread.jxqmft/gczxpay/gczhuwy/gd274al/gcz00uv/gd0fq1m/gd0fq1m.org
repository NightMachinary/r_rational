Brainstorming fairly widely:

- You mention Biology-Respiration, but that is a special case of chemical reactions involving air.
- Concepts of flow, like laminar versus turbulent
- Helicopters do some weird things: autorotation, vortex ring state. General principles of flight, including lift, thrust, stability, and control surfaces. Ground-effect. (The physics of sailing ship sails are also a bit non-obvious if I recall? Tacking to sail into the wind, if nothing else.)
- How aerokinesis and force/thrust interact (momentum-conserving or not)
- Net thrust generation by only pushing air away from front of craft. If a vacuum can be tolerated, that alone is 14.7 pounds of force per square inch of cross-section. A DBZ one-man space-capsule thing would get, what, at 6ft diameter, 239 thousand pounds of force, is that right? In excessive of 250 g's initial acceleration (drag notwithstanding)? (/"The NHTSA standard for a sudden impact acceleration on a human that would cause severe injury or death is 75 g's for a "50th percentile male", 65 g's for a "50th percentile female", and 50 g's for a "50th percentile child"/).
- Air-hockey or hovercraft effect: using air-flow or a bubble of air to reduce or avoid friction
- Cushioning a fall (or the reverse: launching)
- Buoyancy in air, air buoyancy in water, adding bubbles to water to reduce boyancy
- Transmission of sound
- Sound barrier, sonic boom, pressure waves, overpressure/blast waves/explosions
- Scattering of light, lensing, schlieren photography, rainbow effect
- Re-entry-style 'burn up' (apparently from compression of the air rather than friction with object? TIL)
- Convection
- Plasma and ions; liquids
- Moving ions are affected by and generate magnetic fields
- Particulates
- Air/fuel ratios, stoking
- Dust explosions, relighting candles by igniting the 'smoke', gasoline fumes
- Backdraft, firestorms
- Tornadoes, water spouts, dust devils, hurricanes/typhoons
- Lightning, volcanic lightning, thundersnow
- Hail formation
- Impact winter, volcanic winter
- Pressurized air can be deadly dangerous
- Bubbles in blood stream is dangerous
- Vacuum-sealed, air-tight
- Whistling
- Superfluidity
- Solar wind, cosmic wind, northern lights
- Accretion disks, Van Allen belt
- Transitions between phases (wild difference between liquid volume and gas volume, or density; latent energy; triple point; pressurizing to the point of condensing; refrigeration using both pressure change and phase change; sublimation)
- Mole (the unit)
- The exoskeleton with artificial muscles powered by the pressure created by hydrolysis; other reactions that consume or produce pressure
- Partial pressure
- Dissolving gasses in liquids
- Zero gravity
- Relationship between temperature, molecular weight, and velocity
- Uranium enrichment via mass-based separation via centrifuging gas
- Something something Jupiter's red spot and blue poles
- Viscosity, and its increasing relevance at small scales like for bugs
- Scent, scent-tracking, 'down-wind'
- Ballistics windage (and, not really related to wind, but I mean I guess air is not exactly anchored to the ground, so sort of?: Coriolis/Eotvos effects cause 'curving' of ballistic paths and thus I assume of the paths of air particles as well (between particle-particle interactions))
- Windmills, turbines
- Sand-blasting, power-washing

That- That's about it.
