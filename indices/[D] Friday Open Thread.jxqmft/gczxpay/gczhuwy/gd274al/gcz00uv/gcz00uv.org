I posted this on the last Friday Open Thread, but a few days late to the party. Trying again today!

I thought it might be worthwhile to create a document summarizing a bunch of knowledge that could be useful for writing a character with the power of Aerokinesis. Here is the outline that I've thought up so far:

- Gases -- State of Matter

  - Ideal gas law, vacuum, etc.

- Atmosphere

  - Composition
  - Pressure & Temperature
  - Layers

- Wind

  - Wind Speed (definitions and measurement)
  - Wind Power.

- Weather -- Other aspects of.
- Biology -- Respiration
- Geomorphology -- Aeolian processes and features.
- Mythology -- Sky, Wind, & Weather Gods.

What do you humans think? Any constructive thoughts and feedback? Or emotionally-withering criticism?

+P.S.: Is there a way to do sub-bullets in Reddit? I don't see anything about it in the formatting help.+
