  Some kind of pandemic was bound to hit us. Maybe SARS v2.0, who knows?

FYI, COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its mechanism is a “better” way of killing people, so it's SARS 2.0 literally in two ways, structure and function:

  Benhur Lee, MD, a professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says the difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 likely stems from an extra protein each of the viruses requires to activate and spread. Although both viruses dock onto cells through ACE2 receptors, another protein is needed to crack open the virus so its genetic material can get into the infected cell. The additional protein the original SARS virus requires is only present in lung tissue, but the protein for SARS-CoV-2 to activate is present in all cells, especially endothelial cells.

The result is that SARS 1 was a respiratory disease, but SARS 2 is a circulatory disease that also attacks lungs. Apropos to the sub, this conceptually shows a good way to do a sequel: amp up and modify the original threat in a surprising way.
