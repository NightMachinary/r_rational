If I went back to my childhood with arbitrary levels of future knowledge I could swing the 2000 election, probably? If for no other reason than I could become fantastically wealthy pretty fast in the stock market and then throw that money into moving the race.

That's pretty much the single biggest inflexion point for the world in my lifetime and it's hard to see myself making any other choice.

Also I would do and say so many fewer cringy things. I would be so much kinder than I was as a kid, so much better a friend. Because honestly, I can put in the work right now to get into better shape (and I am) but I can't unsay the hurtful things I did or said when I was a child.
