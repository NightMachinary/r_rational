I have discovered what I think may be the arithmetic inverse of the unfalsifiable statement. I call them hyperfalsifying statements.

An unfalsifiable statement is one which could still be true no matter what plausible evidence you could hypothetically collect. There is no test you could do to determine whether you live in the universe where it is true, or false. Souls are unfalsifiable, as is the invisible pink dragon in my garage.

A hyperfalsifying statement, however, is one which allows you to reject all other philosophical or epistemological positions with equal efficacy, if you take it as a given. For instance, it is true that human reason is a flawed tool for determining truth. It is also true that we must necessarily involve reason in the process of doing literally anything other than being a vegetable with our sensory inputs. Therefore, if you take the true statement, "Human reason is flawed" as an axiom, it is impossible to hold any other axioms, because literally all of them must go through this flawed, untrustworthy tool. Therefore, "Human reason is flawed" is a hyperfalsifying statement in the context of epistemological debate UNLESS you burden it with a bunch of caveats that effectively draw out an epistemology anyway.

I realize hyperfalsifying statements are as useless in constructing our view of the world as unfalsifiable ones. But they're useless in /new and exciting ways/ which I, for one, hadn't considered before. So I decided I'd write it up here.
