So I've read a few time loop stories here. Mother of Learning of course, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past, RE: Trailer Trash, and such.

What all would you do if the present you was inserted into past-you's body at some earlier point in time? What starting point would you pick, and why? What would you change about your own past and relationships, and what might you change about the world?

I'd likely pick the end of 5th grade for myself. I don't think I'd go for band class (with the clarinet), and probably just study guitar on my own. I'd have also done more to help my parents, and such. I would have tried to get in shape earlier, back when it was easier.

I've had ideas for at least 3 (original!) SF novels rattling around in my head, so having plenty of free time to work on those would be good. Even if I published them now, I don't think they'd have much of an impact, but back then (when the market was much, much smaller), I'd have a much greater chance of success. That in turn would provide an infusion of cash to invest in various stocks (tech companies of course). For example, I'd be able to ride Microsoft to its 1999 peak, and then shift that over to Apple, along with investing in the usual suspects (Google, etc.).

I'd also likely try to influence politics a bit, and try to get climate change and pollution more widely accepted. The Koch brothers would be a problem there.

Preventing the Sept 11th, 2001 attack seems like a good idea, and would be an "easy" way to prevent a lot of unnecessary suffering. I don't know that the Iraq invasion could have been prevented without also keeping GWB out of the president's office, so I'd have to interfere there as well, most likely.

I'd also likely try to push for greater energy independence. I like the present work with small modular fission reactors, and I don't see any reason why that couldn't have been pushed forward a couple decades. I'd also push Thorium MSR technology, but we have yet to see that pay off, so I'd want to hedge bets there. Ditto for Fusion.

There's some other social things I'd push. I would be good to find at least one major city that would be on-board with decriminalizing drugs, and pushing for treatment instead of jail. If that alleviates poverty and promotes growth (and the entire process is well documented), that could also move things forward by a couple decades.

I'd probably move to New Zealand or South Korea before 2020, for obvious reasons.
