  Funny that you think the pandemic would still happen in 2020, you really must think the butterfly effect is not a thing or something.

Since you mention that, maybe move to NZ by 2010.

The exact circumstances of Covid-19 are certainly subject to the butterfly effect. The reactions by the various world governments and their constituents is a lot more stable. Some kind of pandemic was bound to hit us. Maybe SARS v2.0, who knows?

Even without 45 in the White House, undermining the hard work of the public health officials (and yes, there are a variety of paths I would pursue to ensure that never happens), you'd still have the right-wing media calling it a hoax, and "freedom-loving patriots" not wanting to wear a mask or exercise some common sense.

Steering the entire country in a better direction (less bigoted, etc) would be too much for anyone, even with a lot of valuable foreknowledge.
