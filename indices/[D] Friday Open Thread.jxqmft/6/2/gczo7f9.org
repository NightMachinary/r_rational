Am I allowed to do research first? A few hundred [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)][zero-day]] exploits might be handy.

Ideas that in principle could be discovered earlier are most useful. Bitcoin, but also wheeled luggage, floss sticks, upside-down ketchup bottles, and the like. The simpler the better.

For maximum good I could memorize the critical insights from a few hundred research papers and email them to the researchers that made those discoveries. That would jumpstart their progress with relatively little effort on my part.

Art wouldn't be as easy to short-circuit. It's hard to memorize entire works, and the plot points of novels aren't sufficient; you need good writing. Even if I memorize the notes and lyrics to the most popular songs of the last x years, without starting fame I can't disseminate the compositions. Also I'd still need musical talent to actually sing or play myself.

(Speaking of which, that is a major self-improvement I'd make: learning to play an instrument.)

I'd try to get in on the ground floor of every major website. Dates are important here: Youtube couldn't happen before adequate bandwidth, for example. Timing and function are more important than the name of the organization, so this requires I keep my ear to the ground. I might just use the dates and basic functionality to narrowly beat them to the market.

With sufficient money, I don't need to write anything myself. Just pay others to do it, and use my foreknowledge to guide the enterprise. Hidden failure modes might torpedo some of my companies, but I only need a few major successes.

With all the power these activities afford me... hmm. Well I haven't actually thought that far!

Alas.
