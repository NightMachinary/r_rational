Yes! I actually starting trying to wrap my mind around wind drag over a year ago... and then found other concerns to distract myself with. But part of my difficulty was in trying to track down coefficients of drag for the human body (from a source other than Wikipedia). I found one really old scientific report that /looked/ like it was going to provide coefficients for several different positions, but then just didn't, as far as I could understand it.
