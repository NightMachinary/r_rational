Wresting is still super popular outside our kinda bubble though.

Wrestlers still do make a wish visits to childrens hospitals. Its hugely popular. Micrsofts new gears of war game, a flagship title, has wreslters as bonus content.

I don't think I can buy sumo action figures and a basho playset at Japanese walmart. I would be pleased if I was wrong though.
