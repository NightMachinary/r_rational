HPMOR [[https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/119][Chapter 119]] is happening right now, and noone is paying it much attention,

With analogy to the fact that the coronavirus vaccine has just been [[https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/11/the-fdas-vaccine-advisory-committee-will-meet-dec-8-10.html][forwarded to the FDA for emergency approval, but instead of giving themselves as short a time as possible, they're waiting until December to hold their first meeting.]] It's a shame we don't feel the urgency the same way HJPEV did.

To add to this, I think the expected utility of a covid vaccine is comparable to the stone over the course of a year,

  Once you know how it works, the Stone can do one complete restoration to full health and youth every two hundred and thirty-four seconds. Three hundred sixty people per day. One hundred and thirty-four thousand healings per year. That should be enough to stop, all the wizards everywhere, and all the goblins and house-elves and whoever, from dying. Of old age, or anything else.

134,000 deaths per year is about 3 months of US covid deaths at current rates, with an [[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200923124557.htm][average of 10 years of life lost each]]. Now each philosophers stone healing probably gives you a lot more life years, say 100 since we're talking about wizards (how long do goblins and house-elves live?), so 13.4 million life years saved per year.

The covid epidemic is expected to most likely kill [[https://goodjudgment.io/superforecasts/][2.7 to 7.4 million people by next March]] , I.e. 27 to 74 million life years lost. So if a vaccine prevents a decent fraction of that it could be more effective than a year of stone use (assuming the qualities of life in each scenario are equal).
