  Under Domenici's new bill, all federal funds will be withheld from the medical industry until it "gets serious and starts cracking down on death."

Question: what do you all think would actually happen if someone managed to pass this into law? (Specifically, if no research grants within the field of medicine would be given unless they could justify their research in terms of solving [some component of] age-related mortality?)

I'm guessing we'd just get clever about calling all diseases "diseases of age", like algorithms are patented as "business methods."

It's a neat idea, though---economically incentivizing the pursuit of immortality. I wonder if there are other, more direct methods of doing the same.

Maybe outlawing inheritance and adding an exponential term to interest rates based on actuarial tables---making money compound more, the longer its owner lives than they "should" (in sound health of mind and body, with all the money going away if someone needs to assume power of attorney over them.)

Or, to be even more direct, a plain-old X prize of a billion dollars to the first person to live (again, in sound health of mind and body) to 120. And then another for 130, and so on.
