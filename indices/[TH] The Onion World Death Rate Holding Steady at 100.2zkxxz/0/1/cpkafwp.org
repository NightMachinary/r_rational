It's not actually a useful thing to track now (since it /has/ always been 100%), but you could theoretically keep track of a "projected mortality rate" (actuarial mortality rate?) based on things like the statistical presence within the tracked population of genes that code for the telomere-shortening versions of mitotic proteins instead of gene-therapeutic variants, etc.

Each gene therapy and eugenics procedure we will come up with would bring down the /conservative projected/ mortality rate, though only by the slightest amount; it'd be the very few who would be immortal just from fixing the most direct causes of aging in them (effectively, the people whose lives manage to keep their body's core functions operating well enough to live to 110 /already/, would end up living much longer if aging-related weakness and frailty wasn't a consideration.)

The actuarial age-related mortality rate would drop much faster, though---I'm not sure the curve involved, maybe inverse-exponential?---because it would be taking into account life-extension therapies we hadn't discovered yet, but which we would have in time to save the people then in need of them. If we actually get on the track of the Great Project, there'll likely be some sort of Moore's Law-like effect to it, with a linear progression of extensions given a constant number of researchers. Unlike Moore's Law, though, there'll be a definite point where we have "enough" life-extension that the actuarial age-related mortality rate will drop to zero---which is to say, people would just inevitably die of something else before they die of old age. (Just figuring out how to grow replacement bodies and do brain transplants, and also [[http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/278/278ra33][how to clean detritus like beta-amyloid plaques]] out of brains, would together have this one pretty-well sewn up.)

The big question, to me as a futurist, ends up being whether we'll even /bother/, though: if we end up all uploading, we don't need to solve these problems.
