Technically incorrect - the population of people currently alive does not count towards the mortality rate, since they're not dead yet. Actual mortality rate is closer to 94% given about 115 billion people in history, of which about 7.3 billion are currently alive.

(Amusingly, the total mortality rate went noticeably /down/ during the latter half of the twentieth century due to the big population boom, and has continued to fall.)
