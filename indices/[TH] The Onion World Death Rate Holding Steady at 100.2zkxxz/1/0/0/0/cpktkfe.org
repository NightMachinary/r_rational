  A lot of "progressives" work from hope not thought.

I think it depends which "progressives" you're talking about, and where you live. I can list large amounts of left-wing proposals that /have/ been subject to extensive research, refinement, and experimentation. I can also point to left-wing "proposals" that are basically just the first thing a bunch of dumb hippies came up with at a protest.

So it depends.

But I do think that being labeled "forward thinking" or "progressive" is not /evidence/ that an idea is bad. To the contrary, it tends to evidence that even if the person proposing the idea is wrong, they are at least /trying/, rather than simply assuming that either the status-quo or the past /must/ be the Right Thing, /simply by virtue of having already existed/.
