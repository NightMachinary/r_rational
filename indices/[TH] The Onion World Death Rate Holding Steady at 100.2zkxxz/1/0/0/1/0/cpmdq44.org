I get the impression we have different ideas of what we are referring to with the terms hope and thought. I'm using them in the political vein that lots of us old grumpy bureaucrats and project managers use when criticizing well intended but poorly implemented policy.

Where I am using hope I am talking about the declared intent and intended effect of an action, especially when the unintended second order effects are a negative, and or of greater magnitude. From a planning perspective "hope" is a four letter word. This is along the lines of the programming aphorism

  "Don't think; know."

Where I am using Thought I am talking about modeling the first and second order effects and or understanding the implication of taking an action, before you do it.

I'd appreciate to know the connotation and denotation you are referring to. I'm always willing to learn something.
