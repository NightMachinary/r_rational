  I'm not about to give Taylor an understanding of higher-level math or physics (or economics, for that matter). Not accounting for wind resistance in a physics problem that involves accelerating the air itself is a completely reasonable mistake for a fifteen-year-old.

Maybe I should've made a new top level comment instead of a reply. I don't think that her method could produce strong enough winds to threaten to drag desks around. Her ideas about what strong winds could do seem accurate.

On the other hand, I think opening a portal to the upper atmosphere would be /very/ effective, producing winds of about mach one at the portal boundary.
