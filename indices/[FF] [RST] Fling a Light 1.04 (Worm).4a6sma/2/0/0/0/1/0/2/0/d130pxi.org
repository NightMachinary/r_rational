So two other ways of thinking about it, to hopefully convince you even air will accelerate at g in the frictionless case.

First think of fluid dynamics. At the very moment the portal is opened, the air at the bottom will be slightly higher pressure than the air at the top, so whe the portal opens it will be sucked through (and the air at the top pushed down equivalently) . Gravity will continue to supply ~2m of head between the portals and with no friction the only place for that energy to go is into speed.

The other way to think about it is imagine the gap between the portals is filled with a stack of boxes. Now you may think if they're packed tight they wouldn't fall. But consider what would happen if we removed, say the middle layer. Obviously, the one above, with nothing to support it would begin to fall, an all the other layers would fall with it. Negating air resistance, what would happen to the space - it would have to remain the same size as all the boxes are resting on each other. What if we instead removed the bottom layer? Again everything would fall, and the middle layer would fall exactly in line with where the gap was. So, imagine putting them together, nothing changes everything falls. Without something outside to rest on, there can be no upwards force to balance gravity and everything will fall at g.

Does that make sense?
