For the record vertical wind tunnels (for indoor skydiving) are about 0.6-1.4MW in power. This is electrical power so multiply by a prop efficiency of around 80% at design speeds to get aerodynamic power. So an exit portal a few thousand meters in the air would accellerate the air to approximately human terminal velocity in the area around the portal - unfortunately in the wrong direction to use as a blast.
