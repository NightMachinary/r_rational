  I think we can all agree that if the air was in a frictionless tube bewteen the portals it would accellerate at g.

I'm not so sure about that. (This is only for a fun thought experiment, not for nitpicking the story). If the portals are in vacuum, I can see a small object falling endlessly (as long as the potential energy for sending the object back up to the higher portal is supplied from somewhere). But this is a volume of gas that spans both portals. The gas trying to fall through the lower portal will be sitting on the gas at the higher portal. So will the gas accelerate at all? I suspect not.

  A portal to the depths of the ocean would provide pressurised water

Excellent idea ! Also a similar idea from Stargate SG1/Portal: Have a Tinker fabricate a stationary gigawatt laser and use the portals to wield them at will.
