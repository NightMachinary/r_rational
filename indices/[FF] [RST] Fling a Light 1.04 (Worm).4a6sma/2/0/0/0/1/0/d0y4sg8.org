So, I think we can all agree that if the air was in a frictionless tube bewteen the portals it would accellerate at g.

Next, we have two problems, friction with the surroundings and that the portal doesn't cover the whole floor. Given the fact that the portal is not a laval nozzle, the fastest the air can move through it is the speed of sound. So this gives the upper limit on the energy gained per second. This power is Area of the portal x Velocity (300m/s) x Density of Air (1kg/m^{3)} x height change. For a portal 1m in diameter, and a 2m high room this is: 471W

My desktop fan is 40W, so our 1m diameter portal with *supersonic* air flowing through it develops the same power as 12 of these. Needless to say the air would not be able to reach supersonic speeds, but ignoring that lets just assume we develop the full 500ish W. Taylor here would be able to cause quite a bit of a mess, a lot of noise and possibly scare the terrible trio but wouldn't hurt them with this trick.

How could she actually hurt them? Water is 1000 times as dense as air and has a speed of sound 4 times as fast. (Water jet cutting can cut through steel with an abrasive. People are squishier) A portal to the depths of the ocean would provide pressurised water, though you'd have to set it up ahead of time with Taylor's limitations (Maybe in a sealed strongbox, then you make a second portal from the box to enemy number 1). Moving the upper portal higher would also work (there was that height of room coefficient) though in a non-closed room you'd run out of air quickly. So actaully the best way might just be to open up a portal to the upper atmosphere behind your victim and let the explosive decompression deal with them. (Let alone actually just dropping them through a portal).

[Off topic] I just had the idea of using portals to below the ocean like those [[http://youtu.be/zsrciLXhqRo][water jet-packs]] to make flying possible if a bit wet for those below.
