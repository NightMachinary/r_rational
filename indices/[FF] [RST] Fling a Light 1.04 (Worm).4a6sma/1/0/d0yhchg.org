At present, I have enough ideas to fill the story entirely (though they aren't all mine). Also, I get the impression that I'll be getting more than enough from this subreddit. For example, I'd underestimated the wind speed generated by a portal to the upper atmosphere, which might be important later on.

I'm still not 100% sure about some of the plot details. There are things that need to happen, but how they happen is going to depend on other things. I've got a "bag of tricks" for Taylor, so to speak, and a list of things she's going to want to do, plus an ending, a bunch of antagonists, and a plot outline. I'm terrible at following my own plans, so even that much is probably going to mutate.
