I'm not about to give Taylor an understanding of higher-level math or physics (or economics, for that matter). Not accounting for wind resistance in a physics problem that involves accelerating the air itself is a completely reasonable mistake for a fifteen-year-old who is presently being duct-taped to a wall. I think a strong breeze is underselling it, though, seeing as she created (transferred?) almost a megajoule of energy, which is about as much as you'd get from a stick of dynamite.

The link is for her claim that 500 mph winds would rip pavement out of the ground and throw people around.
