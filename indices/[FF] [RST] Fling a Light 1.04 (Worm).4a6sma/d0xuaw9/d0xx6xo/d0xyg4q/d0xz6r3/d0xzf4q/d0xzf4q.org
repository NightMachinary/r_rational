Well, I'm not a physicist, so I don't really know. However, when I type "megajoule" into Google, I get this:

#+begin_quote
  approximately the kinetic energy of a one megagram (tonne) vehicle moving at 160 km/h.
#+end_quote

If we assume that, as you said, almost all of the energy is being lost to wind resistance, that means that we have as much energy as a car driving 8 km/hr through a classroom every second over the course of 20 seconds. Since a car can obviously move a desk, I declare this problem solved.

(That was a joke. I genuinely have no idea how to do this kind of physics.)
