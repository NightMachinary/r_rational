I really, /really/ doubt if she could actually make 500 MPH winds using her method.

Sure, it would work if she sealed both ends of a frictionless tube, but there is huge (and exponentially scaling) resistance from both the walls and from the wind that misses and hits the floor beside the portal. I don't think she could even generate a strong breeze using that method.
