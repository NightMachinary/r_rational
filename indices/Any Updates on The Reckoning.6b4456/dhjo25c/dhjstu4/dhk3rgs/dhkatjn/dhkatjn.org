There's been some stuff with getting sick and being in my final semester at college, but mostly it comes down to "Running a story with 100+ characters to keep track of is hard, and while I made adequate preparations for the story, it became progressively harder in a way that I didn't anticipate."

(The biggest thing is that, as much as I knew that the characters would throw off my plans, I didn't know that they would throw off my plans /this much/. Basically the only parts of my outline that remain intact are those that involve characters who are still more or less isolated from the others and haven't been affected by the butterflies yet.)

Anyway, I'm working on resolving that, since being on hiatus for the past couple of weeks has shown me that I can't just ignore the problem and hope that things will get better without changing my strategy.
