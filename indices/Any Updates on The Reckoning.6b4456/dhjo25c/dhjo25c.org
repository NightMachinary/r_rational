Yeah.

1. Guilt/shame/apology/excuses.

2. There's an interlude written and an Ax chapter half-done that are meant to come out Tuesday and might end up coming out Wed or Thu, but for real, it's this week. For real.

3. Since February, the org I work for ([[http://www.rationality.org][CFAR]]) has been doing an unusually intense sprint; we ran as many workshops as we used to run in an entire year, and I was supervising a bunch of brand-new instructors and a little bit of new and experimental content. That sprint is over, and I should be able to catch my breath. I intend to update at least twice in the month of May, and hope to get to the end of this arc and the start of the next one via a few rapid updates (e.g. every week or 10 days rather than every other SEASON).

4. Things in-story are going to start getting crazy (relative to how quiet and sane they've been thus far).
