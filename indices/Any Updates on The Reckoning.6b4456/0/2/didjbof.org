The recent chapter was incredible. Holy shit.

I wish I knew someone who had read Animorphs as a kid just so I could share this with someone. I've tried introducing The Reckoning to people with no background in Animorphs, but no one was willing to try the fan fiction without the reading the source material first. It's a shame because I feel The Reckoning really stands on its own feet well.

Also, have you ever talked with KA Applegate? I think she would love your fan fiction. Your characterizations are so well done that I can't really distinguish your versions from canon---though I feel in a sense your characterizations go so much deeper as well.
