Fan fiction, at it's very core, is fans encroaching on the intellectual property of authors. Some authors don't care. Some authors care a great deal. Most authors only care when it's shoved in their face, or used in an x-rated manner.

However, quite a few authors with hopes of eventually publishing, wouldn't want their names associated with a fanfiction site. Imagine it to be something like having stupid things on Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, or other media when you are looking for a normal job. An editor poking around on the internet seeing what you've written in the past might come across your work on a fanfiction site, and plonk your name into file thirteen, just by association.

If the editor is reviewing your submission, and it's the most awesome story since sliced bread, they probably won't /plonk/ you. But if it's a typical first novel, with warts, that they are not quite sure about, /plonk/ might happen if they see you were active on a fanfiction site.
