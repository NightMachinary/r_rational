I would say to take a look at Archive of Our Own as you continue to develop this. There are little flaws (usually relating to particular functions, like the inability to send PMs) but the basic layout is great and it's easy to navigate.

Whereas this... Well, as it stands it looks like a clunky Wordpress-styled site. Sorry.

EDIT: Some Googling for "sites based on Archive of Our Own" just let me know that it made TIme's 50 Best Websites of 2013. Interesting to see that it was on their radar.
