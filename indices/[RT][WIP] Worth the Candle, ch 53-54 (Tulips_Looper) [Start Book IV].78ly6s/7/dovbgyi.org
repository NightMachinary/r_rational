So the next threat Juniper's party faces is... the narrative itself?\\
More meta than I expected. I like it. (though this is just a theory at this point, of course, which I also like)

Also, Juniper+Fenn continue to remain a source of joy.\\
In fact, I like everyone's reactions at their romance, from Grak's grumpiness to Solace's sincere happiness/amusement. Even the locus seems to approve, though you can never tell for sure what that doe really is thinking.
