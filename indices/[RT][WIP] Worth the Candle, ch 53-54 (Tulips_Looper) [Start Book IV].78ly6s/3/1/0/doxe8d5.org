I was thinking they paralleled hyenas myself:

  But perhaps the strangest thing about female spotted hyenas is their reproductive anatomy. Internally, there's not much to set them apart from other mammals. But to say that their external genitals are far-out is to put it mildly.

  The clitoris is enormously elongated to form this fully erectile pseudopenis through which they urinate, copulate and give birth," says Holekamp. This is a sentence she has clearly delivered before because she fires this volley of explicit words at me in less than 8 seconds: I timed it. "It's the only female mammal that has no external vaginal opening," she adds, just to confuse me further. "That is something that is totally unique"

In my defense, dwarves being that far from baseline humans is what brought this to mind (iirc birds/reptiles/amphibians & platypodes have cloaca?), and this is another mammal species!
