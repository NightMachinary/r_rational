This chapter reminded me of a story I wrote a while back based on D&D. It strongly focused on NPCs and kinda explored some of the implications of partying adventurers roaming around an doing whatever they wanted in an otherwise stable universe. [[https://kishoto.wordpress.com/2015/12/19/the-narrative-rrational-challenge-dungeons-dragons/][It's here if that kinda thing is up your alley.]]

P.S I do admittedly feel kinda weird about essentially plugging myself on someone's story post but I honestly feel like people that enjoyed the meta level tone of this chapter would find my story an interesting short read.
