No one is safe from the game's ever-present need to heighten drama and excitement. I've no doubt that Juniper's Fenn/Mary love-triangle has been carefully calibrated to produce maximum drama for the foreseeable future. And if that well of drama ever runs dry, well, kill someone off and bring in a new love interest.

If I was Juniper I'd seriously consider putting points in social skills for the sole purpose of navigating the rapidly increasingly complex social situation he's in.
