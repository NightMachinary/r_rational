Fenn fears bond girl syndrome. Well, that is terrifying. Tough, there is also the hilariously meta commentary that Fenn is more popular than Juniper. Which, yes. I like her better.

Potential solves for the Bond Girl syndrome a: Marry her. Asap. Arthurs wife lived, so this might be a workable solve. b: Polyamory! The reason bond girl syndrome exists is that few writers are capable of writing compelling narratives about people in stable relationships. But you can have endless romantic complications if you ditch monogamy without having to kill off any of the participants. c: A /and/ B.

Problem is, of course, I cant really see Juniper think of any of those solution spaces.

Flower Magic: Uhm.. Well, its possible that Arthurs Merlin just rode the power curve of the companion bond way past the inherent limits of flower magic. But that does not mean there is no in-universe explanation. - I am, for example, expecting Fenns scars to magically regain functionality as the power of Juniper increases - , but most of the ways I can think of to cheese a bond with a flower you are not tending, should have been tried hundreds of times in the years since his passing.
