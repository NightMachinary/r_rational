Companion bond improved Flower Magic is a good theory. I was already thinking Uther's game layer abilities might have made it possible. Joon overlooking that it wasn't Uther but Vervain with the ability doesn't seem out of character.

My other guess would be that Vervain had an eidetic memory, which allowed for a greater number of connections. Alongside being naturally talented (likely as a companion character), it seems a rare enough ability to be plausible. I just don't think it's true because it would be an almost /unsatisfying/ answer.
