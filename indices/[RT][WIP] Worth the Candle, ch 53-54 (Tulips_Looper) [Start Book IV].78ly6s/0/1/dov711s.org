This didn't help in /On Her Majesty's Secret Service/. Weddings make a great stage for a tragedy.

Another solution might be punctuated romance. They come together, but then go their separate ways for a period. Both face their own challenges and when they meet it's new once more. On-again/Off-again romances like that can be strung out indefinitely.
