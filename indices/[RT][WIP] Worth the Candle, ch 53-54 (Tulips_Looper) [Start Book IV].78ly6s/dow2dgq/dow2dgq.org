I'm sincerely impressed by the level of immersion you manage with this story, and the tangibility, credibility of the characters. You're actually dropping meta-commentaries, and having the characters litterally discuss the narrative and dissect it on screen, yet when I start reading I almost immediately forget it's a story and fabricated characters and not actual human beings trapped in a convoluted, but real, universe. It's even more astounding as my own thoughts and sentiments in fact echo those of Juniper, dream skewered and questioning the very existence of his companions, and still unable to not feel strong, real emotions toward them.

So, for this, hats off to you, and my deep thanks for such a captivating fantasy!

With that said, I'd like to complain that Amaryllis is getting the short hand of the stick, at least currently, and I find this deeply unfair. And I think Joon should too, but let's say it's the MEN affliction caused by hormones.

So while Fenn is naturally suave and playful and emotionally quite balanced (despite shitty early life, shitty boyfriends, etc.), Mary proved to be almost totally emotionally impaired (whatever the cause, for sure being an object of power and royalty didn't help). And maybe for the wrong reasons, she decided to warm up to the perspectives of a personal, intimate relationship, which I imagine most frightening when you've spent your whole life carefully, coldly avoiding that precisely. And there it is, of course, she made a real effort to change, she actually did and now it's all for nothing, or for worse even. The all important hero at the receiving end of her brand new, cumbersome feelings decided to ditch her for a flirtatious, attention craving thief, absolutely unappreciative of her development as a better person.

Note I have nothing against flirtatious thieves, it's just to underline the biting irony of it.

In short... Shit, I feel sad for Mary... It's like the only thing that could make her feel lonelier, with a little bit of crushed hope on top.
