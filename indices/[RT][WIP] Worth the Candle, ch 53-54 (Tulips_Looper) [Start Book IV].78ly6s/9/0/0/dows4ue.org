I didn't give full thought to it but if someone was a Herald, it could happen in a number of ways. For example, if the party is attacked by a group of townspeople while walking through the forest, it would be because a Herald went out and gathered them and then brought them to the party's location. Or if the party entered a town and were immediately greeted by townspeople with a welcoming feast or something oddly specific and out of character, it could be the result of a Herald.

Heralds are dangerous because the Signs don't immediately follow them. A Herald can be in a town and it will still look completely normal for a while.
