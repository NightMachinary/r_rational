(Rereading that, I find myself wondering what the worse situation would have been had the boy actually been a Herald--the first thing to come to mind is that if a quest-giver runs into a bar, it probably means that an Adventurer is /already in the bar with you/ (dum dum DUM!), but presumably the Signs would have already been seen, to say nothing about the Adventurer hearing about the Signs? ...Or perhaps that an Adventurer is about to 'log in' right there, the Narrative descending /in media res/ (a Herald having just come in, without the first few words being caught), with no other feasible hiding space to flee to first (or time to even try)... Incidentally, I have a happy canon in my mind in which Dave is actually speaking tongue-in-cheek, having actually read the module cover-to-cover before, and actively knows about the bartender's trouble-avoidance and is faithfully (and/or out of amusement) not giving hints to the players about who's behind the door if broken open.)
