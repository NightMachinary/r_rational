I like the 'loops' a lot! For us as readers, a more satisfying (than the non-meta ground-level threats) and more concrete (than the hovering strangeness of the Juniper-specific System) antagonist to be resisted.

The underlying question of 'Juniper-because-of-Arthur aside, /why/ Arthur, specifically?' still bothers me, but other than that it's really fun to effectively have characters within a narrative--an eternally cycling narrative!--trying to work out what to do with it. Especially this form, rather than a character wrestling with a beginning->middle->end narrative structure, I don't think I've come across before. ...Presumably upon death, there would be more cycles in that Hell... upon true death, maybe yanking someone new in? Hoping of course that the yanking here was from Arthur sticking a wrench in the gears. ...hmm, presumably even if the entirety of known reality were put under the protagonist's control, a new threat could come from a different 'universe', the scale expanding again and again (fractally) like the different books of Desolate Era...

It would have been convenient if the genre of the cycle/story could be guidedly shifted, the peace of one's domain protected through cycles of romantic conflict or the peace of one's marriage protected through cycles of army-based war. Unfortunately, doesn't sound like the case, though the nice teaser hints that perhaps one relationship could be protected by cycling through others in parallel.

Before I forget, it was fun to think of Hikaru Genji in those terms, unable to have a peaceful happy life with one woman and instead doomed to repeating cycles of chase and acquisition.

I groaned at first at the 'don't be a hero' relationship flag, but now it sounds like an intriguing instance of forced-cycling, relationship conflict (to disrupt a potentially happy, stable resolution) demanded by the narrative engine. Of course, if there's anything like that then Juniper is going to be horrified in the next chapter at the level of direct mind-control the System blatently displays (towards one's loved ones, of all people). Then again, maybe I could be misreading this and it's to do with death or other suffering from external threats, instead. (In which case I would be back to groaning straightforwardly at the aforementioned relationship flag immediately after attained potential happy stability.)
