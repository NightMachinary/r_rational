  Also, it's a little weird how Brin keeps accepting completely random, untested people into his spec ops squad that specifically does jobs he cannot afford to be linked to, without giving said people any training or even basic psychology checks to make sure they won't crack at the next mission.

I get the sense that Brin casts a pretty wide net, and most of the mercs he hires don't survive more than a mission or two. He'll pick a nobody that shows promise and toss them at a situation or two that they can't really make /worse/ (like the Honeypot thing), then once they prove themselves over time they get trusted with more and more sensitive situations. If he does it right, the damage they can do is pretty limited. His assets don't actually know much, beyond the fact that he hired them and what they would need to know for their missions, and none of them are really in a position to be going public with their knowledge.

Regarding the worldbuilding, I tend to agree with you. I quite like that we're looking at things in a time of upheaval, but the timeline doesn't quite make sense for how people relate to a lot of institutions and concepts. Hell, I'm not sure the timeline makes sense at all. Projectors were forced to go public 13 years ago, Ana's been wearing her shitty body for 11 of those years. 2 years seems like a /very/ short amount of time for something as drastic as changing bodies to become such a ubiquitous concept that even the poorest in society are taking part.
