  My point is, I'm pretty sure Ana is getting exploited here.

I think Brin isn't just giving her a body because he thinks that that is the primary incentive for her to be his personal merc, and he just hasn't realized that Ana is crazy enough that she'd probably be more than willing to go on life-or-death missions just to stay in her student assistant position.

  Shouldn't this be "she"?

I read this as left-Hira is drinking something while right-Hira is putting their hands in their pockets.

  Also, it's a little weird how Brin keeps accepting completely random, untested people into his spec ops squad that specifically does jobs he cannot afford to be linked to ...

I think the strangest thing about this whole set-up is that he isn't concealing his identity at all. Like every one of his personal mercs would give up his name under the methods of torture we've seen so far (there are probably quite a few vocations out there that can make people talk too).

I'm kind of curious why Ana can't put money down on a body and pay it off over time like a car/house/expensive-appliance. Seems like the only workaround would be if bodies are so exorbitantly expensive that even the downpayment for the cheapest bodies are still outside her price range or maybe some weird cultural/economics handwaving could be done here.
