  I'm kind of curious why Ana can't put money down on a body and pay it off over time like a car/house/expensive-appliance.

Well, for starter, it's a lot harder to confiscate a human body.

People aren't going to buy a car, refuse to pay it off, then go off the grid with a warrant on their head. A car just isn't valuable enough to go on the run. A human body is, if you're in Ana's situation.

So even if a downpayment system exists, you probably need to show some paperwork to eg prove that you have a stable job, and a backup body you can go back to if your new body is confiscated, and a family that can pay off your loan if you lose your job, etc, none of which Ana has.

(/Brin/ could totally buy her a body and have her work to pay it off, but obviously he has incentives to string her along for as long as he can)
