  I'm struggling to think of why Brin isn't just using Guardians off the books
#+end_quote

The high casualty rate seems like an obvious obstacle. I assume that part of the new government system is that any guardian dying involves a lot of paperwork, specifically to prevent the kind of stunt Brin is pulling.

Also, it's a lot harder to maintain plausible deniability if the high profile agent you sent to a yacht party gets captured and brainwashed, and goes on the radio to say "I'm a known Guardian, here's the secret code of my family's vault for proof, Major Brin sent me on unconstitutional missions and erased all the evidence".

(but yes, it's a little sloppy of him to show his own face)
