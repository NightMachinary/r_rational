But she just wants to get back to her aristocratic family and restore their fortune built on centuries of violent oppression of the underclass!

Okay, she's willing to kill people and manipulate a girl who was nothing but kind to her to achieve that goal, but it's okay because she hates herself and the people she's killing are mostly disgruntled members of said underclass anyway! It's not /her/ fault they refuse to see that the aristocracy that has manipulated them and mind-raped them for centuries has only done that for their own good!
