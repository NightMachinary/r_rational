  A tall woman, the white phosphorus man, the two Hiras, and Ana sat next to me on the crimson beach. Another man leaned against the cliff, with his hands bound and a bag thrown over his head.

How the hell did Ana survive? Last chapter Clementine was about to slit her throat.

  “We lost three people,” said the man. “I knew two of them. Don't be a prick.”
#+end_quote

That remark aside, they're all pretty chill about this.

They just lost of a third of their squad, and came pretty close to getting all killed. Ana and Wes almost getting killed makes sense, because they're amateurs taking on trained terrorists, but the Rose Titan is an experienced special force operator. There's no way she could take these kinds of losses on a regular basis and still be alive by now.

  “You did good, Queen Sulphur,” said the Rose Titan, patting me and Hira on the backs. “All of you, well done. I'll talk to the major, see if I can get you raises.”
#+end_quote

How much /are/ they getting paid?

Because they just took on an entire terrorist base by themselves, facing three supers plus a small army of normals, with prolonged torture on the line if they got captured.

Keep in mind that was a critical operation, that could trigger a foreign invasion if something went wrong. And yet Major Brin acts like it would be a waste of resources to give Ana, one of the key resources of said operation, a body that isn't in the process of decomposing.

My point is, I'm pretty sure Ana is getting exploited here.

  “I don't want their handouts,” said Ana in a flat voice. “Or their pity.” She stared at me, clenching her teeth. “I'm not going to manipulate good people to squeeze what I want out of them.”
#+end_quote

See, this is the exact opposite of the mentality you should have in this type of work environment.

  I sighed. The Elmidde Chronicle, my family's newspaper, cared about integrity. Stewardship. Morality. If people read it more instead of Afzal Kahlin's manipulative whaleshit, none of this would be happening.

It's cute that you believe that.

And by cute, I mean disgusting.

  Left-Hira nodded, sipping from a chocolate ice cream float.

  Hira stuck his hands in his pockets. He's using his Vocation. “If he joined us, he might still betray us or defect to our enemies.”
#+end_quote

Shouldn't this be "she"? I'm pretty sure this is girl-Hira in this scene ("left is a lady"); it could be that Wes thinks of Hira as a guy regardless of body, but still, it's a little confusing here.

#+begin_quote
  “Acceptable,” said Professor Brin. “But you're responsible for him. If something goes wrong, it's on you.” His voice tightened. “And if he goes rogue, I will put him down.”
#+end_quote

I'm not sure of the logic here.

If it's not safe to keep this guy even in a maximum security prison, then it's even less safe to let him live on his own? Also, it's a little weird how Brin keeps accepting completely random, untested people into his spec ops squad that specifically does jobs he cannot afford to be linked to, without giving said people any training or even basic psychology checks to make sure they won't crack at the next mission.

  “I don't accept your apology,” Ana said. Her expression didn't change. “You might still be fooling yourself, but I know exactly who you are, Weston Ebbridge.”
#+end_quote

Ana may have terrible salary negotiation skills, but she's not an idiot.

  The Shenti War had only ended around a decade ago, but they still felt like a mythical enemy, an ancient nightmare brought to life by the Black Tortoise that brought the world to its knees. A foreign government on the other side of the ocean, responsible for the largest war in history, was trying to take over the country.
#+end_quote

Little aside about the Shenti War.

It's interesting that Pith does the exact opposite of most fantasy stories with its setting: it makes it very immediate.

Most stories have a super-important background war that happened A Thousand Years Ago (or an empire that's a thousand years old, etc), even though it doesn't make sense. Eg in western culture, a thousand years ago takes you before America as a country, before the French Revolution, before the Hundred Years war, and before most European countries had anything close to the shape we know today. The idea that the political landscape could stay remotely the same over that kind of timespan is ridiculous.

Pith does something interesting, and makes all the relevant events extremely recent instead; to a point it feels a little jarring at times.

Like, the Shenti War is a decade old. To put it in perspective, "a decade old" takes you to the beginning of the Syrian Civil War (2011); 9/11 is two decades old. Yet the characters talk about the Shenti War like it's a backstory element, like we talk about WWII. It doesn't feel like something the country is /actively recovering from/. When Wes talks about the war, she talks about her mother's recollection of it, and not, say, her own childhood memories.

There are a lot of other elements that feel like they've been around for longer than 10 years. People learning about the Masquerade. Democratic institutions. Non-state-controlled media.

Ana talks about the Paragons like Taylor Hebert talks about the Protectorate; like they're an institution she grew up hearing about, and not like a desperate spin-control by the establishment to keep its superpowered enforcers that would have been announced around the time she was 15 and her new body started breaking down.

I'm not sure whether this is a problem. It's not too jarring, and the worldbuilding is mostly coherent. I think it would fit a lot better if most important event were moved back 10-20 years (so the 20-yo characters maybe remember hearing about them as a kid, but mostly grew up with the new status quo); but that might break other parts of the timeline.
