  I think the strangest thing about this whole set-up is that he isn't concealing his identity at all. Like every one of his personal mercs would give up his name under the methods of torture we've seen so far (there are probably quite a few vocations out there that can make people talk too).

Deniable asset doesn't mean "I don't know who my employer is," it means "the only proof of my employer's identity is my own testimony." If they get caught and are compelled (via torture or mindfucking) to confess that Brin hired them, it doesn't really change much of anything. Brin is the head of the Principality's intelligence services, so any enemy of the state that gets targeted by shady mercs is probably going to assume he's involved anyway. And if their hypothetical captors try to go public and say "look at these shady mercs, Brin hired them, that's what they told me," Brin can just deny it all. He can claim they were hired by his enemies to discredit them, or that they've been brainwashed/tortured to accuse him, or any number of things, because the only proof of his involvement is the testimony of a couple of shady mercs.

It doesn't matter that Brin isn't concealing his identity, because there's no paper trail and no proof beyond the testimonies of those involved.
