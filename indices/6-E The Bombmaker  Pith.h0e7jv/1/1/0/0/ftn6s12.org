Fair enough. Though it seems like it would be arbitrarily easy for him to just wear another body when working outside of the law which might have some benefits (pretty sure cameras exist in this universe and having photos of him meeting with known mercs could be bad) and next to no disadvantages.

Then again, it seems like you could deny anything in this universe, 'that photo isn't of me, someone stole, cloned, or light-projected a hologram of my body', 'I didn't do that I was being mind-controlled by a rare Vocation', 'that paper trail is fake, someone mind-controlled the requisition officer', 'I couldn't have done that, my body was seen at a public location at that time'. I'm struggling to think of why Brin isn't just using Guardians off the books (in temp bodies, maybe even with selective memory wipes and cyanide pills), it shouldn't be hard to avoid leaving a paper trail.
