I think you're reaching pretty hard with most of these. The idea of mind controlling the government, for example, is probably the most obvious threat there is if you know that mind control exists, no need for another story to tell you that. And the rising sea, if it is intended to reference or parallel something else, seems much more obvious a metaphor for... rising sea levels. Like, that's a thing that the real world is dealing with, and it's a much more clear and obvious connection than vague concerns about AI.

Not everything is a reference, and it's possible for multiple people to arrive at the same idea independently. I think it's generally best to assume that's what happened unless given specific reason to believe otherwise.
