My impression was that his level of paranoia was just barely sufficient for the threat he faced (he very nearly didn't catch it), but also that it's crippling overkill when it comes to other parts of his life. So it's less about finding the right level and more about being able to vary it between situations?

Or he just has to deal with so much subterfuge that he actually has to pick between functional but vulnerable and safe but...well.
