Ok this might be totally, completely wrong but if the Pyre Witch's real vocation is a whisper one involving mass memory modification then that could neatly explain the scene with the Broadcast King and a few other things. But I'm just pattern-matching here since in other rational fics, when a character is too powerful in too many varied ways, and the described magic system makes that implausible, it usually turns out to be some kind of perceptual modification -- "I notice I am confused" and all.
