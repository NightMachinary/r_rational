Just noting down the possible meta-references to other fiction I saw for fun, since I've noticed rational fic writers leave them in as a reward to readers.

- The Whisper vocation control thing seemed like it was referencing HJPEV in HPMOR's idea of using the Imperius to control the entire Ministry.

- I thought the rising sea and exponentiality might be referring to AI, especially with Brin's commentary on how nobody else was paying attention, since that's a common theme - probably a longshot.

- Guessing the bird-control network is referencing Taylor's power in Worm, and/or the kid in Ward who got a split-off shard that allowed him to control birds, forgot what his name was.

- Eye of Makara seems like it's referencing Bayesian analysis, I've always thought this would be a cool ability.

Other stuff: I went back and reread the first arc and although you started from a pretty high point, I feel like you've really quickly improved? Which I guess isn't surprising because writing a webfic on a tight schedule and getting comments every 1/2 weeks creates a nice feedback loop. It's not in a way I can pinpoint, everything just flows better and the chapters are hooking my attention more (although that could just be me becoming more and more invested). Every single side-character chapter has been really compelling. When Pith is wrapped up, if you did a write-up, maybe describing stuff like what your process as a writer is, the challenges you encountered, some things in the text nobody managed to pick up on, etc. etc. I would be super interested in that and I think other readers would too? I haven't seen a lot of other authors here do that but it would be cool. Unless you want to avoid giving away trade secrets
