I'm just disappointed that chronomancy classes are arranged in order from smallest to largest. I was kind of hoping for a joke similar to when Zaphod Beeblebrox attempted to summon his great-grandfather at a seance.

  Zaphod: Concentrate on his name.\\
  Arthur: What is it?\\
  Zaphod: Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.\\
  Arthur: What?\\
  Zaphod: Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!\\
  Arthur: The Fourth?\\
  Zaphod: Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third...\\
  Arthur: What?\\
  Zaphod: There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Now concentrate!
