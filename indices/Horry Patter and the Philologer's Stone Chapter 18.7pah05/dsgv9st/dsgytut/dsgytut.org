Yeah, reading that part as

#+begin_quote
  CHRONOMANCY 1

  CHRONOMANCY 0*
#+end_quote

made me laugh at the joke, but then after reaching the “CHRONOMANCY 1*” part I had to go re-read it properly as

#+begin_quote
  CHRONOMANCY -1

  CHRONOMANCY 0*
#+end_quote

which made me somewhat disappointed by the actual thing.
