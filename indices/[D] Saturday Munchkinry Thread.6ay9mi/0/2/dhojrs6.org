1.  Quit the goddamn cocaine and see a neurologist. If there is no cocaine, /still/ see a neurologist.

2.  Manage to sound like a rational adult who can keep a goddamn secret.

3.  Start building chokehold material on Congressional Republicans. Blackmail, extortion, threats to their families -- whatever. You're Donald Trump, you have ties with the mob and with ideological fanatics. You can summon death threats over Twitter. Do it. Make sure the "cuckservatives" fear for their careers and their lives whenever they go against you.

4.  Start using the Republican stranglehold over Congress to build Presidential power with impunity. Don't just fire Comey: get more and more brazen. Since you've already got your own private security people integrated with the Secret Service (that already happened partially IRL), start folding any paramilitaries you can find, make, or sponsor into the existing US military.

5.  Make sure to start provoking riots among your opponents. Make absolutely sure that they get more and more militant, /particularly/ people of color. Use the preexisting prejudice and the existing Republican efforts to criminalize protest to start locking up people of color, leftists, and other dissenters. Intensify the use of prison labor, and share part of the spoils of that exploitation with the white "silent majority" and "working class".

6.  Start expanding the prejudice and partisanship to include a /cultural/ stigma and hate towards blue states and their citizens /in general/. Make it clear they are un-American.

7.  Help the Republican Party to covertly rig or gerrymander a few more state-level elections, enough to get a Constitutional Convention going.

8.  Hold a Republican-sponsored Constitutional Convention. Use your leverage on Republican elected officials and party functionaries to staff that Convention with all your own people. Use the phobia you've whipped up towards blue states and your existing leverage on Congress and state legislatures to make sure that blue states have next to zero input into the Convention -- certainly nothing they can use to resist the next step.

9.  Use the Constitutional Convention to go full Erdogan. Don't just pass arbitrary Presidential powers under grounds of "national security". Pass a retroactive /jus sanguini/ undoing the 14th Amendment, and rendering anyone who can't be "grandfathered in" an "undocumented immigrant" -- again, retroactively. Integrate something like the USA PATRIOT Act into the new Constitution. Make the Presidential position permanent, with new elections being held only the death of the old President. "Grandfather clauses" have been done before for voting rights in the United States, and will be recognizable here. People will call bullshit at or before this point, so you /need/ to have your leverage tightened by this point.

10. If necessary, intensify the populist rhetoric and newly-xeno-phobia against blue-staters to have the Constitutional convention basically disenfranchise any heavily-populated states, or redraw state boundaries to make everything possible red-dominated.

11. Begin rounding up "undocumented immigrants". If necessary, begin the process of separating the impure Blue America away from your increasingly racially pure Red America as a separate, "sovereign" country -- which will inherit none of the United States' military, diplomatic, or economic assets aside from the people you don't want.

I think some steps here might be more difficult than I'm giving them credit for, but if you're competent enough, everything you need is basically there.
