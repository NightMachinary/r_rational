Luckily, America's weakness in foreign affairs isn't represented in the objective function.

But, seriously, I think you're mismodelling the blue-red divide. Polarisation exists where it's allowed to exist. The eternal normie believes what he's allowed to believe, and right now, he's allowed and encouraged to believe that the government is full of evil right-wing racists who hate him and the vibrancy. If that were actually the case, he would not be allowed to hold such a belief, and as a result, most no longer would.

  If you can come up with a more efficient way to keep up that pretense while actually physically murdering the Blue areas, it would work better. Without being able to do that - especially while making palpable economic gains for the lower-class whites you want in your new country - the Blues have a powerful way to fight back.

In the event of significant blue resistance and attempts to hold the economy hostage in this manner, there would have to be a transition period where America's power and influence in the rest of the world is partially sold off to maintain domestic prosperity until the country can be pacified and restored. People who don't identify with the insurrection would be given every chance and incentive to evacuate the blue zones, which could then be pacified with extreme prejudice.
