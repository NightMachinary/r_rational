  Well here we have a difference on facts. I think the "normie" believes what he experiences. You can't tell someone to defy their own experience: he'll guess your teacher's passwords and then act according to experience.

If he professes the required beliefs and is greatly constrained in acting on any other ones, that's good enough. For example, in the process of the Inquisition, all that was needed for a heretic to be spared the faggots and the stake was to profess the required beliefs - no heretic went to his death unwillingly. That's the kind of system I could get behind.

  That's... not going to work. You're still modeling the American economy as fundamentally based in Red areas, with Blues as parasites who can be pacified.

My point is, given ideological suppression, and the right system of disincentives for heresy and incentives for orthodoxy, no matter which side it comes from, the overwhelming majority of people who would dissent in a free system would not do so. And there would be no moral issues about making sure the remaining heretics who wish to die do so promptly.
