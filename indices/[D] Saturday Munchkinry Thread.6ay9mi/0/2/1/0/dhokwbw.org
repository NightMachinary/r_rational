Well, there's a major difficulty here: those "blue" dense areas actually hold most of the economy. If they get organized and unified, they can hold that to ransom. I mean, hell, if they want to, sufficiently knowledgeable anarchist hackers can hold large parts of the Internet to ransom, and down goes all the networked infrastructure and modern conveniences. That's before we get to banks, universities, government offices, tech companies, high-skill trades, newly re-urbanized manufacturing, and even high-value real-estate.

Our imaginary "silent majority" of evil white people might /choose to believe/ that everyone in blue areas is a decadent limousine liberal or welfare queen who lives entirely off Red tax dollars, but AFAIK, that's nowhere near true in reality (even if it's not entirely the other way around, either). There's also a heavy educational and professional divide that will take something like a generation to fully overcome: you have to first purge all high-skill professions of Blue people, and then stuff them with Red white people (while having no remaining institutional knowledge because of the purge).

So you need to build up hatred against those areas while also remaining able to extract wealth from them for an extended period of time. That means you need to keep them /working/ on an everyday basis, which requires at least a pretense (up until you can actually get rid of them) that they're not actually the disenfranchised serfs of a Red sovereignty.

If you can come up with a more efficient way to keep up that pretense while actually physically murdering the Blue areas, it would work better. Without being able to do that - especially while making /palpable/ economic gains for the lower-class whites you want in your new country - the Blues have a powerful way to fight back.

The Blues only partially realize this in real life: socialist groups are still too focused on their old-fashioned image of the Working Class and Oppressed Groups to focus on really crippling American capitalism, while liberals are still deluding themselves that they can stop this train by electing Democrats. Antifascists understand the need for militancy, even violence, but also have little conception of grabbing economic, knowledge-based, and institutional power.

In real life, it's an open game for anyone who can pull their head out of their ass for 10 minutes and assess what they have, what they want, and how they can use the former to get the latter. However, /nobody seems able to do that/, so I estimate we're really going to watch a slow-motion collapse into multiple countries, which themselves will be severely weakened compared to the Obama-era American empire.
