This seems impossible. Most dictators ride on a wave of initial popularity and antiestablishment resentment. Trump only has the latter. The first move would be to become a lot more popular. Presidential approval ratings are strongly predictive of midterm success, and Trump will need strong Republican majorities to enact any such plan. Assuming that by 2018 he has managed GOP majorities over filibuster who have decided to support him, and that he has >50% approval, this seems the way forward. This is for option number 1.

1.  Gerrymandering, court packing, and other methods of securing electoral advantages for the ruling party. Make it even more difficult for third parties to succeed.
2.  Destroy the press. Remake PBS as a populist mouthpiece, cut off private donations and give public media increasing advantages over private media. Give the FCC more leeway.
3.  Pack the bureaucracies. Most bureaucrats are liberal, at least more than Trump. Fire them and hire directly from the universities. To retain stability this will take a long time.
4.  Create a no-tolerance policy for intra-party dissent. If you don't vote with the pack you get the boot next cycle. Don't even let them run.
5.  Wait for SCOTUS judges to die, and replace them with lapdogs. This is of course business as usual.
6.  Challenge and repeal the 17th amendment. This will be exceptionally difficult and is more of a long-term goal.
7.  Create federal laws that give electors more freedom. Proceed to choose lapdogs.
8.  Amend the constitution to weaken the House as much as possible under some pretext.
9.  Amend the constitution to allow a 3/4 majority in both houses, as well as Judicial and executive support to pass amendments. At this point dictatorship could not be more blatant. Hopefully popular support will survive this storm.
10. Get rid of state-level military forces. Nationalize police control.
11. Abolish the House and "simplify" state legislatures.
12. Pull back all international aid and military support. Withdraw from NATO.
13. Invade and sack the northern Mexican states under some pretext. Reparations time! All the African-Americans get their 40 acres and a cow in scenic Chihuahua. Begin organizing territories as states, wait for inevitable partisan movement, and then declare them unmanageable and Presidential Protectorates.
14. Have Jared run in an empty GOP field with the backing of the whole media.
15. Push all racial minorities to the newly annexed Northern Mexican territories. Enact strict immigration laws and quotas. Bring back segregation.
16. Populism, populism. Keep the whites happy with huge benefits and progressive taxation. Indoctrinate the children accordingly.
17. Repeal the 22nd amendment. Around the 4th term have Jared declare himself president for life. Dare anyone to disagree.
18. Surprise! President for life is now a hereditary position.
19. Dissolve the Supreme Court and combine the executive and judicial branches.
20. Ban all parties except the Great America Party.

Note - This is obviously absurd, but the best I can do.
