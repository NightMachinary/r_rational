  Perhaps there's some way of arranging the specks' orbits so that you have windows sometimes?

Relativistic kill rocks all have paths that are very straight lines ending at the planets. Having multiple layers of antiparticles, arranged such that one has to either substantially change vector or stop and wait ten minutes between layers, will allow friendly (slow) traffic to pass while still getting in the way of RKVs. (Of course, then you have to deal with anti-asteroids - that is, antiparticle RKVs - for which you'd need the occasional shield of normal matter, perhaps in alternating layers)

You're going to need a /lot/ of matter and antimatter.
