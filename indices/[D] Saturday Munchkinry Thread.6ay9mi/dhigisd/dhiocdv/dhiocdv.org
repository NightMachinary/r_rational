Decentralized randomly-moving civilization as proposed by [[/u/Gurkenglas][u/Gurkenglas]] is indeed the best solution. Maybe upload everyone into virtual reality to make it more robust, if the technology allows.

If people want to stay in gravity wells... Making their orbits unpredictable would take stupid amounts of energy, so I don't see a way to prevent /a war/. Civilian casualities, though, could be prevented by effective evacuation protocols.

If the technology allows, give everyone brain implants and have constantly-updating backups of everyone stored in randomly-moving space stations. Make instant destructive uploads if the planet is targeted. If it's impossible, maybe extremely-deep bunkers that could be accessed from every building? Patrol a few light-hours around the planet to ensure there's enough time to evacuate. (May be unviable if the techology allows to accelerate RKVs to 0.99+ /c/.)

Wait. Active defense is impossible, but what about a passive one? Asteroids burn in the atmospheres of planets: saturate the empty space in your system with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust][dust]]^{1}, or build a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_shell][Dyson Shell]] and fill it with gas, creating atmosphere^{2}. In this environment, the faster a RKV is moving, the faster will it cease to be. Or use anti-particles if you're feeling bold and have the means of mass-producing them.

Yes, the last idea would make ordinary 'friendly' space travel way harder as well. Perhaps there's some way of arranging the specks' orbits so that you have windows sometimes? Not an astrophysicist, not sure if possible. Or use intelligent dust that would move out of the way or destroy itself on command when you want to pass?
