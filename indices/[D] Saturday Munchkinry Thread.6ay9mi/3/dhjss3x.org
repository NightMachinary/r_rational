Inspired by a post on [[/r/shittysuperpowers]]: you can now superheat your food to 200Â°C, but it never cools down.

With so few limits it's a fairly powerful ability with obvious applications, but in particular I wondered how best to keep an average house warm with it. 200 degrees is enough to ignite most woods which produces a significant fire hazard, and the heating elements would also need to be somewhat portable to keep the house from being too toasty during warm months. I'm thinking of using the power to superheat oily foods which don't ignite at the temperature and then pouring the oil into solid metal slabs. With a right metal-to-oil ratio the elements shouldn't get hot enough to cause fires.
