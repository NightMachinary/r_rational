Get everyone onto space stations and have them move unpredictably. Planets are only used for remotely operated mining operations.

The AI seems sure that there isn't going to be a competitor to itself, unless it was carefully constructed to not want to be sure of that. Rocks sent from its home domain are not feasible to react to an AI project after it spawns, because the project will have at least as long as light takes to get to the AIs domain and back, assuming FTL is also impossible to it. Also moving space stations. I would rather expect the AI to have nanomachines everywhere, avoiding detection and planning to eat anyone trying to launch an AI.

They could ask the AI if it's okay to make brain backups of everyone, with that the entire problem is void.
