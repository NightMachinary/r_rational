Something that I'm trying to figure out for a possible setting, which seems in line with the "puzzle" aspect of SMT:

*tl;dr* There was a "nuclear war" and now you have to figure out how to prevent another one from ever being possible, while suffering from various constraints. IN SPACE.

--------------

The principle behind relativistic kill vehicles (RKVs) is both simple and terrifying: accelerate a large enough rock to a fraction of the speed of light, and you have a weapon that could kill worlds. Gwern wrote an interesting article on the matter, but suffice it to say that any defensive plan that relies on intercepting an RKV is not a very good plan.

Cue an interstellar Cuban Missile Crisis with giant rocks, set to launch if they stopped getting signals from home, and...interstellar civilization. There are, thankfully, enough self-sufficient space stations and minor colonies that humanity is not in danger of going extinct.

Still, everyone is in agreement that this can never be allowed to happen again, and the trauma is deep enough that the people who have been put in charge of figuring out a solution can count on being listened to.

How do you reliably prevent this from happening again?

Relevant constraints:

- FTL is not possible, but ships can accelerate to a high enough percentage of c that things get weird and both time dilation and length contraction are noticeable. The average travel time between two habitable star systems is 3.5 years (as viewed by the travelers) and 25.25 years (as viewed from the point of origin). Interstellar civilization is therefore possible, but interstellar government is difficult and has thus far not been successfully attempted.
- You can't fix this with a superintelligent AI: Another, alien civilization already built one and it ate them. Maybe. Nobody's sure what went on there. What's happening now, though, is plain as day: the AI is content to stay in a relatively small bubble of space doing who-knows-what, but first contact with an extraplanetary intelligence was made when one of its drones landed on Earth, informed us that we were getting close to building an AI like itself, and said that we either needed to cut that shit out or we were going to be pelted with rocks from Heaven. Any AI that can teach or otherwise improve itself is verboten.
