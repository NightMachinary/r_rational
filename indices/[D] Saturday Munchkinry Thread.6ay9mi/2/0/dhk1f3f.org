2) You can run through the air/"multijump" with this: Strap it to your soles, give it mass whenever your shoe needs to push on it and take it away whenever you need to move the shoe. By concentrating mass on a point, you can rotate the sword around that point easily. Should feel kinda like running up a downwards escalator? Depending on how good you are at throwing, you might also try roping it to a body harness, throwing it up when it's light and making it heavy as the rope goes taut, lightening it when it runs out of momentum, reeling it in and repeating. Obviously, advanced technology can use this for a spaceship, possibly even with the lower maximum masses.
