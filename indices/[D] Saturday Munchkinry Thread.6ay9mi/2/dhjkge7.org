You have a nearly indestructible magic sword that can change its mass and it's balance , the sword needs one millisecond to change its mass and your commands travel at light speed.Also it spends " magic energy" to work and it will run out of it in a few millions of years so it can't be used to avoid the heat death of the universe. The minimum mass the sword can have is 0.1g . What uses does this have without advanced technology, and what uses does it have whith it if the maximum mass is:

1) 10kg

2) 100000kg

3) the mass of the sword if it had the density of the densest material that it has been in contact with.

4)1g

Edit: new rule , to avoid black holes now the densest point of the sword can only have a density of the maximum mass of the sword / 0.001 cubic millimeters(which still lets you do gravity tricks in 2 and 3) .
