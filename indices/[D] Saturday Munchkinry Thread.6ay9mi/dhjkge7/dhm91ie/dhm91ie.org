What happens to conservation of mass? If I'm swinging a 10kg sword at 10m/s and increase the mass to 20kg, is the sword still traveling 10m/s or does it slow down? (I would vote that velocity remains constant, as that's a more interesting property for a /sword/ to have.)

*First, with conservation:* your fighting style mostly revolves around "dropping" the sword onto the enemy. A 10,000kg sword falling for a tenth of a second translates to roughly 1/4 the momentum of a car moving at 60 mph. Interestingly, because momentum is conserved, your sword doesn't need to have a lot of mass when it hits, because it will have the same momentum either way. However, if you reduce your 10,000kg sword down to 1kg when it's going 1m/s, then you end up with a 1kg sword going 10,000m/s (which is fairly close to Earth's escape velocity). Either way, it packs a punch, but there's probably a balance to be had in properly keeping control. On the defensive side, flash-mass can make the sword put up a really strong parry, but you have to deal with the momentum somehow, unless the plan is to just not have it stay high mass for long enough to matter (in which case you need insanely good reaction times to actually make the parry).

*Second, with no conservation:* your fighting style mostly revolves around swinging a light sword in for extremely heavy hits, then making it light again to pull back. Same defensive technique as above, but it's a lot easier because you just need to catch the sword and make it light. If range on commanding the sword is long enough, then you can use it as a siege weapon if the mass limit is high enough - even going from 0.1g to 10kg gives you a huge return on energy input. That aspect only really works because the sword is /also/ indestructible - I'd like to stick the sword on the end of a polearm, or rotating around an axle, but those parts /aren't/ indestructible and so present points of failure.

I actually gave one of my D&D players something like this; the Anyblade can take the form of any conceivable bladed weapon, allowing all sorts of neat tricks (though it also changes shape, material, etc.).
