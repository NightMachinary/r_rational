  But, seriously, I think you're mismodelling the blue-red divide. Polarisation exists where it's allowed to exist. The eternal normie believes what he's allowed to believe

Well here we have a difference on facts. I think the "normie" believes what he experiences. You can't tell someone to defy their own experience: he'll guess your teacher's passwords and then /act/ according to experience.

  In the event of significant blue resistance and attempts to hold the economy hostage in this manner, there would have to be a transition period where America's power and influence in the rest of the world is partially sold off to maintain domestic prosperity until the country can be pacified and restored. People who don't identify with the insurrection would be given every chance and incentive to evacuate the blue zones, which could then be pacified with extreme prejudice.

That's... not going to work. You're still modeling the American economy as fundamentally based in Red areas, with Blues as parasites who /can/ be pacified. Any "passification" of Blue areas is a scorched-earth victory /at best/: you'll have to spend /decades/ rebuilding any kind of "domestic prosperity".

Basically, you can try to destroy the part of the country you don't like, but you're actually dependent on it. You'll starve yourself out, Great Leap Forward-style.
