I've just finished reading [[https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/platinum-end][Platinum End]], the latest and recently completed manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, better known as the duo who created Death Note.

Non spoiler review: is this a recommendation? Eh, conditional. The manga's not as good overall as DN in my opinion, mostly because its central conceit is more vague and contrived, and its ambition is higher and harder to live up to. The key concept is very similar: there's a high schooler who suddenly receives from a supernatural entity some special powers whose use is ethically very questionable. The main difference is that unlike Light Yagami, the MC is unequivocally a good guy here, and in fact a very principled person, to the point of almost unrealistic idealism. The powers in question have rigid rules and sophisticated applications, which leads to keeping track of them getting more and more complicated as the story goes on. The first half of the manga is default mind games action, not unlike DN. Is it rational? From the viewpoint of the actions of the characters, kinda; their motivations are simple but consistent enough, and the way they use their powers to maximise progress towards their goals while staying consistent with their own intelligence and morals is believable. There is however at least /one/ character who is utterly ridiculous and over the top and has technology that makes no sense, but thankfully, they don't matter much beyond a few chapters.

The second half is considerably weirder, as the conflict stops being about fighting and devolves into a philosophical debate. That's right, the /entire second half of this 58 chapters shonen manga is basically just people talking/. This is actually an interesting turn, in and of itself. I feel like the authors are not sophisticated enough to make these debates deep or satisfying enough, but then again, they /are/ writing for a very mainstream audience of teenagers, so I think it stands to reason they'd dumb it down a little anyway. I don't feel like they really missed any key point - sometimes I felt like that only for the relevant point to be brought up a few chapters later, suggesting that maybe they simply didn't have space to cram it in before. Regardless, though, this often reads as a very "edgy teenager" approach to philosophy (and in particular the nature and existence of God, which is the key topic of the manga), so be wary if you're easy to cringe. Also, the ending has left many people disappointed, and to me too it felt like it was very poorly foreshadowed. So, be warned of that. Though it's nothing but bold, I'll say.

It still entertained me, and it's certainly a peculiar story. I also think that potentially it could be a starting point for a great rational story - with some adjustments. Or you could already consider it rational-ish in itself. If you feel like reading some slightly shlocky shonen story about superpowers, suicide (yes, that's a major theme too) and philosophy, do check it out. By the way, avoid it instead if you feel like you're depressed or suicidal yourself. It really won't do you any favours.
