What are some rationalist or rational works that deal with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_hacking][body hacking]], whether of oneself or others or even of non-humans?

Preferably a hard sci-fi setting with a focus on medical/engineering accuracy. I'm not adverse to darker interpretations such as the concept of Bonesaw from Worm or modifying organisms for controversial purposes.
