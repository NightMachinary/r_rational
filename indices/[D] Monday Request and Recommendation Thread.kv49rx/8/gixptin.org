Why is Ar'Kendrithyst so controversial on this sub? I started reading it and I don't see any reason for someone who generally likes isekai litRPGs to particularly dislike it. Anyway, I recommend it, though since I like basically everything I read even when I think it's bad, you should take that with a grain of salt.

(I particularly like that the character has close relationships without the other characters necessarily being pulled into his orbit and losing their own agenda. I also love that the main character is a dude in his 40s with an adult daughter.)
