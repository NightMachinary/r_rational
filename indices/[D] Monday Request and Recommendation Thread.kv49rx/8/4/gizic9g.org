I don't actively dislike it, but I tried reading it at some point and absolutely nothing happened for far too long and I dropped it out of lack of engagement. Perhaps it gets better, but there's far too many books in my backlog for me to invest that much time into something that didn't at all hook me.

And I've read and enjoyed Wildbow's works so I'm definitely not one of the people the other replies are mentioning, who are turned off by a grim story.
