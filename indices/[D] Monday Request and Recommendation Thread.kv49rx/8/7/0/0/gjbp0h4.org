  The bad guys are much stronger than the good guys, but it's unclear what they want other than just maybe being mysterious and crazy.

There was an explanation for this in the last 20 chapters or so, and personally, I found it a satisfying one.

The Old Universe suffered a catastrophe and the Gods fled to create a new one. The Old God of Magic, the Big Bad, is a particular brand of solipsistic crazy and thinks all the other Gods and people are figments of his imagination. And also that by destroying the New Universe he can be freed from its prison. That crazy bleeds through to his high priests, who mainline his power in order to cheat the LitRPG system the New Universe runs on, and makes them mostly murder-y and insane.

But when the Big Bad met the MC in the first couple chapters, he got jolted towards sanity by the novelty of meeting an isekai/earth-person, and that plotline is finally coming to fruition in the latest chapters.
