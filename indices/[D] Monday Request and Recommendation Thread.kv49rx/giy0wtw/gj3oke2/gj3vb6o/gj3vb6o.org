  Reading this book is like fishing through a landfill site for diamonds; they're there, just buried under mountains of crap.

This review pretty much sums it up. The author is clearly religious and believes some silly things. But to me those diamonds are valuable enough to endure the parts where he's in the clouds talking about greek muses, and taking the words of some poets as facts.

I also have nothing inherently against things that are supposed to be helpful, specially when the author is not trying to sell anything.

As I said you can tell if it'll be helpful to you in 2 pages, and it's free so..
