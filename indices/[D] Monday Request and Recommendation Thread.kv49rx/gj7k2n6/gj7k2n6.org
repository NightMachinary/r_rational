Does anyone have recommendations for stories where the protagonist is mute, takes a vow of silence, or otherwise does not speak? I recently read Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir (which I highly recommend), and I enjoyed that the protagonist took an observational role forced by an obligation to be silent. I also liked the character interactions there where other characters would speak past her and generally underestimate her because of her silence.
