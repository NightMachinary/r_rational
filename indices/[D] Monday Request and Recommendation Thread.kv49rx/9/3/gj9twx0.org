If you're up for DnD podcasts and care less about rationalism than comedy, Tiny Heist is a youtube show featuring the McElroys and a few others in a world of tiny people, tiny places and tiny crimes. Bugs and lego figurines are staple characters/NPCs, and it has pretty cool worldbuilding, though the focus is primarily comedy. It might still scratch the itch, though?
