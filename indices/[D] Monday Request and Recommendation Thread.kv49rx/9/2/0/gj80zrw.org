Hardly rational, though. Watched it just the other day and it only made me think about how hard it is to do something like "people getting shrunk" /consistently/. For example, what would happen to their mass? In HISTK, they clearly become proportionally lighter, which... well... violates a lot of laws, but I guess that was always going to be a thing. What about their other senses? For example now their eardrums are smaller, which should change their resonance frequency, which should mean they would have trouble hearing normal voices and should hear in the ultrasound range instead. /However/, if the shrinking affects their atoms themselves - which is necessary, otherwise they'd just lose cells and complexity and not be humans any more - then the elastic constant of the material making up their eardrums should have changed too, because an elastic constant is nothing but the second derivative of an energy with respect to a length. I haven't worked out yet what that ultimately means for resonance frequencies.

A few more things - they fear falls, but falls should be entirely innocuous for them, as they would reach terminal velocity and hit the ground at entirely survivable speeds. They should also have super strength, unless they don't because their atoms got smaller too... again, more complicated calculations. How are they even breathing ordinary-sized oxygen and eating ordinary-sized food? They should suffocate instantly as their haemoglobin now can't bind with regular air, nor can those big molecules pass through their semipermeable capillaries membranes.
