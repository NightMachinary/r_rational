Only one: Read the manga. Kidding, but you should, I honestly wouldn't risk getting ANYTHING spoiled.

The few times I have seen AoT recommended on this sub there's always been a lot of nitpicking about it, but honestly it's probably as rational or rational-adjacent as anime can get. It's a story where everything has been well thought out in advance, 64 episodes (12 years of manga publication) in and the very beginning chapters of the series keep on being recontextualized. There's a bit of a long way to go before the end and yet if you start a rewatch with what you know now a lot of the events in the first two seasons hit differently, hell even the stuff that seems to be fairly unrelated to what is currently happening (like some of the character development in S3) is still highly relevant because that's simply how consistent some of the themes are.

Not much else to say without getting into spoilers, but I really hope this series inspires other manga authors to give this much thought to their worldbuilding and characters, anime as a whole could certainly stand to be a lot less 2d than it is.
