For something looking at the more sociological knock-on effects of ubiquitous psychic powers, Shinsekai Yori (From the New World) puts forward an interesting take. Not a lot of delving into the powers themselves, though, as they're deliberately open-ended in strength. It's more about "what kind of society can survive when any unchecked member can easily kill everyone else around them?"

I'd go with either the novel or the anime rather than the manga though, as the latter was more interested in the sex than the plot.
