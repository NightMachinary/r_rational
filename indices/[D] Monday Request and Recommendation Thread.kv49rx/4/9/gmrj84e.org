- (manga, anime) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_(manga)][/Pet/]] --- has a thoroughly designed psychic-centric setting, showcases evolution of the art through generations of practitioners, is rational enough to be recommended on this sub and has realistic characters. Unlike many other Japanese titles (mostly) doesn't ruin its own plot for cheap 11th-hour shark-jumping shenanigans; and unlike most of fictional literature, doesn't try to rely on various types of exploitation porn to attract audience and keep it engaged.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_for_Lya_(novella)][/Song for Lya, A/]] --- a relatively short story by early G.R.R. Martin. Is a bit slow at intro chapters, but well worth the read.
- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14495.The_Mind_Parasites][/Mind Parasites, The/]] --- has some vibes of esoterism and occultism, interesting (if slow-burning) plot and a few unique ideas. Many individual scenes and characters' experiences during them are well-described and memorable.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12923455/1/A-Path-Stained-Red][/Path Stained Red, A/]] --- a Pokemon fanfic featuring a psychic duo of a SI and a Gardevoir. Interesting plot arcs and ideas, well-written and lively dialogues and characters. IIRC had some sex scenes, but that could be incorrect.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Than_Human][/More Than Human/]] --- the "protagonist" is a hivemind that gradually takes shape from 3-5 different people. Is an interesting exploration into the genre and features at least a few interesting ideas that make it worth reading to the end. From the drawbacks: the prose is rather sludgy, and the overall plot / story would probably struggle to entertain the reader when competing against more modern works of fiction.
