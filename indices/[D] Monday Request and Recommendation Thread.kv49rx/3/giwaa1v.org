Anyone have any good recommendation for stories with AI characters? Be it ships, bases, robots, or anything else. I enjoyed /The Murderbot Diaries/ by Martha Wells, the WWW series by Robert J sawyer, or web series like /Post Human/ and /Chrysalis/ (though the former was really influenced by the latter). I've just started /The Last Angel/, which comes pretty highly recommended, and so far seems pretty good.
