There's [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324-ancillary-justice][/Ancillary Justice/]] and the sequels which aren't bad. Feature an AI protagonist who sometimes controls multiple bodies which is fun. Interesting world-building here and I like the narrator who did the audiobooks.

Then there's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat][/Quod Olim Erat/]] which is completed and it's sequel [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23614/the-scuu-paradox][/The Scuu Paradox/]] which also very recently completed which focus on a main character who retired after serving as a battleship AI but decades later, decided to reenlist, this time as a crew member. Interesting stuff here, and very well written by RR standards. A bit confusing at times though because the narrator can be unreliable as her memories are purged or classified occasionally but great suspense and some big mysteries. The author recently started writing the sequel, and has a decently active update schedule.

In a completely different direction, there's /[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion][Prophecy Approved Companion]]/ which is a comedy-ish story about an NPC in a VR-game gaining sapience(?). Very funny, particularly if you're into videogames. This had me legitimately cracking up multiple times through reading it.

Finally, there's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper][/The Cosmic Interloper/]] (self-shill alert!) which has an AI/transhuman main character who gets portal'ed into a fantasy world. On hiatus now, but there's a decent chunk online ~55k words and I'm still planning on getting around to finish it /eventually/.
