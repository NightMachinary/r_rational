It's probably one of my favorite stories, but I also like most things. I liked that it has a fallible mc with great power in a death world. People either found him really naive or really murderhobo, I agree with both. I like the back and forth the mc has throughout the novels. He gets very murderhobo after his daughter almost dies, then loosens a bit, then again goes murderhobo after something else terrible happens, then loosens up.

I especially like the slice of life. It's very nice to sit back with a chapter of mostly cooking, growing new plants, magic creation, and so on, and it never felt like fluff to me. There's always some tidbits of plot development even in the more heavily slice of life chapters. Later on it also has some of the best father/daughter relationships I've seen in royalroad.

I did think the dialogue and characters were stilted in the beginning, but the author finds his style and improves on it. Sometimes the prose is even pretty good! It emphasises the vibrant feel of the world, even though it's pretty terrible overall.

Erick is definitely an op mc. He gains power through seemingly no significant effort. There are story reasons for it, at least according to the author, but maybe I haven't looked deeply enough. I don't really care though. Erick is an mc that sticks to his morals even through the most terrible shit, and that's admirable to me, even if he makes a bunch of pretty shit choices. I'd rather read about a rational world rather than a rational mc, the latter tends to be dry among most rational fics I've read. And the world of Ar'kendrithyst is definitely rational. It feels lived in. The lore is great and fantastic, and the people of the world have their own set of morals and superstitions and beliefs. It all feels like an actual world, rather than a setup or backdrop.

If you couldn't tell, I really like this story. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone though, it's just in the right spot for scratching all my itches.
