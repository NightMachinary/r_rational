DDLC is considered very short by VN standards, like on vndb it's in the shortest length category which is 2-10 hours, wheras the longest category is 50+ hours. That's just the medium in general, proponents would say the length really allows the ability to delve into its subject matter more deeply. You could compare it to the difference between what you can explore in a 2 minute short versus a feature length movie or multiple season TV show, or a 5000 word short story versus a full novel or series of novels.
