I don't know, guess maybe it's just that the prose bores me then. I've played a few other VNs, for example the Danganronpa and Zero Escape ones, which definitely caught my attention more. DDLC had a lot of pretty low quality "poetry" and meandering dialogue, though that might have been intentional to create the purposefully bland atmosphere of the first route before the gut punch hits.
