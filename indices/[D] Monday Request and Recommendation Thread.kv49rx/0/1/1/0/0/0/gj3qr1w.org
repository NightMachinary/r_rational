  You don't have to like DDLC.

You should read what I said again, I do like DDLC. That doesn't mean it's therefore totally above all criticism and any discussion of it must be only in tones of effusive praise. I even acknowledged that it's fine to like jumpscares, but that doesn't mean they're for everyone. People have preferences, and that's okay, and it's okay to acknowledge that.

  If jumpscares are by definition basic and lazy

You should read what I said again, I only pointed to the wikipedia page to point out how they're often perceived. There's a big difference between that and saying that's how they are by definition.

  And even if none of that was true, it is, I understand, the policy of [[/r/rational]], that you should be careful to work around talking in a way that will cause some people to enjoy the work less, especially when many people did enjoy it.

Like I already said, you should read the link you posted again, especially the part about policing this informal policy suggestion.
