I'd also happily recommend DDLC as an experience. I'll add a note that you /really don't/ need to pay that much attention to the poetry minigames that regularly crop up, at least the first-time round. Just click anything; they all end up at the same endpoint and chasing particular 'routes' to it isn't worth the cognitive load until youre looking for the last 10% of content after the main story.
