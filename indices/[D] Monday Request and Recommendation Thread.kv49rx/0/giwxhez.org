Do you enjoy visual novels?^{1}

Are you sad that nothing really exciting ever happened to the adorable characters in Erogamer?^{2}

Have a strong recommendation for playing [[https://ddlc.moe/][Doki Doki Literature Club]]!^{3} It's in my all-time top-five recommendation for its genre!^{4} Just be sure you have 4-6 hours to spare on the day you start playing, because this game is most effective^{5} when played through at a single stretch. And also best played without any spoilers! Just keep in mind the warning you'll see on every page offering to sell you DDLC and that you have to click through to start the game: DDLC is not suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed!^{6}

^{1} And horror.\\
^{2} Unless you count the destruction of their home Earths, but I expect that didn't have much of an impact on most readers.\\
^{3} Also available on [[https://store.steampowered.com/app/698780/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/][Steam]]!\\
^{4} Namely horror.\\
^{5} Unless you /want/ to reduce its effectiveness, in which case you should not be playing Doki Doki Literature Club in the first place because it is /very effective./\\
^{6} The content warnings on DDLC are /understated./ Don't start playing it that day, or at all, unless you have mental stability to spare that day, and at all.
