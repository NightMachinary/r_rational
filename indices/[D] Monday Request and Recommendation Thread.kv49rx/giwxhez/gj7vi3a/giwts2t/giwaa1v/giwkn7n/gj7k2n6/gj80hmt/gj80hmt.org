[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13208672/1/Silent-Partner-Unfinished-Business][Silent Partner, Unfinished Business]] is a What If...? Death Note fanfiction whose turning point is that Naomi Misora doesn't die after Light writes her name on the Death Note. Or rather, she /does/ technically die, but is almost immediately resuscitated. That makes the DN's effect null and void, but she gets significant brain damage in the process, which causes her amnesia (things would be too easy otherwise...) and aphasia - so she can talk, but only in extremely choppy and mutilated fashion, as her own brain's language centres are scrambled. In this state, she still sets out for revenge against her attempted murderer, and from then on, things take a completely different turn from canon.
