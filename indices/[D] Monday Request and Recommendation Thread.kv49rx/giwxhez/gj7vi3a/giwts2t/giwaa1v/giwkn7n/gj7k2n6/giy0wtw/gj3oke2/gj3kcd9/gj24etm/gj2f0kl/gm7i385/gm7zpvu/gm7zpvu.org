I just checked there's a pdf on page 2 if you search 'war of art' and there was a mobi and pdf on page 3. At the worst you'd have to search by author name.

​

Ctrl+F if you can't see it on a page with lots of results. If you search for fiction and it doesn't show up there's this written "also search "war of art" in fiction" in the upper right corner of the page.

​

It should be in the fiction section if it's not a VERY new book, or an not popular self published book. In that case you might have some luck on duckduckgo, search around, use ublockorigin like a smart person and you'll find +99% of things. (You might want to be careful of shady sites depending on how internet fluent you are, you know hover over links before clicking that kind of thing).

​

Although in general if I can't find it on libgen or with a quick search on some other sites on my favorites, I either just buy it or skip it depending on how interested I am on reading it.
