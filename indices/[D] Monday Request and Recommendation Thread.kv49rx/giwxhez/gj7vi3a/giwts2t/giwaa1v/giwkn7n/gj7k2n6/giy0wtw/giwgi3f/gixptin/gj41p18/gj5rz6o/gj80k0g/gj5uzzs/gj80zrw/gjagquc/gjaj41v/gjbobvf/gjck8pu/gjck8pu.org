Egan had uploads using human form, but maximally miniaturized robot avatars on space craft in at least one story, for reasons of mass economy. It was a throw-away bit, since the characters mostly spent their time in virtualities, but as a general idea, very small robot bodies for uploads or telepresence do not break any laws of physics.
