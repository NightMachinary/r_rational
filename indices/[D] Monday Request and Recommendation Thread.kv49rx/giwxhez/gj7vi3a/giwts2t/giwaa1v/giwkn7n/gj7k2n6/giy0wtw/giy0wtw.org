Last week I did my yearly re-read of War of Art, and decided I had to recommend it again because of how good it is. In fact I'm planning on reading it every 6 months now because of how important it is.

​

The main point of the very short 150 page book, is to explain the concept of what the author calls Resistance, how it robs people from achieving what they want. Why people that want to be writers may find themselves unable to write, why some entrepreneurs can't start their business or give up right before launching etc..

​

It's good, the author does a better job explaining it than I can in a couple paragraphs. In 2 pages you'll know if it's valuable to you, and if it is you'll be very grateful to have come across it.
