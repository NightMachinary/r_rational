I enjoyed it but it felt very irrational. Somethings that repeatedly irked me are:

The MC basically becomes an archmage (whatever that means...) with barely any effort. He just has scientific knowledge plus some kind of innate talent. His daughter who is supposed to be a badass seems to put in significantly more work but is also much weaker. He lets spurious allies send people to spy on him and then treats them as his close comrades despite knowing nothing about them. Then he's surprised when they act contrary to him.

I think the core of the complaints is that he acts inconsistently.

Also, he doesn't cleanly fit into any stereotypical story. He's not trying to change anything, acquiesces to many commands, and puts himself at the mercy of “allies”. The bad guys are much stronger than the good guys, but it's unclear what they want other than just maybe being mysterious and crazy.
