The protagonist in Wake of the Ravager. This is a bit spoilery so..

​

He modifies the bodies of his wife and of a friend to their specifications giving them some specifically selected traits from magical beasts.

​

The game Rimworld, it incentivizes the use of brain implants, bionic limbs etc. Some mods that deal with genetics can lead to some crazy stuff. There's one in particular VFE insectoid, part of it adds serums from insectoid dna that depending on the type that's applied you can get random results like improved eyes that offer better vision but take longer to focus, or stronger arms that are more resistant but cause constant pain on.
