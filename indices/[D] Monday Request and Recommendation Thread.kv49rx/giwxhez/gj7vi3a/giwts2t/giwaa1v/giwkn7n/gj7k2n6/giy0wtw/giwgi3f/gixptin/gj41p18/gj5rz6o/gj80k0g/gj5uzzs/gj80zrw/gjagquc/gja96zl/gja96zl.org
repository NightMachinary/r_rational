Jup, and you've forgetting an even BIGGER effect: Time. Muscles provide an acceleration, the speed of your thoughts depend on the speed the signal travels between neurons, etc.

In fact, this all turns out to fit together REALLY elegantly in general relativity, treating your current scale as another thing you cant figure out in a closed system and keeping the speed of light the same, if you're in a spaceship and it's shrunk to 1/100 the size you cant tell, and if you're bouncing a laser back and forth between two mirrors you're experiencing the same subjective time between bounces, and the laser still travel at lightspeed but it has 1/100 the distance to travel, so you must be experiencing time 100x faster.

This is roughly what we observe in actual machines and animals: A shrew will have a far faster heartbeat, faster reaction time, faster metabolism, and shorter lifespan than an element. If you take a system of bodies orbiting each other and shrink all the distances and radiuses you get a faster but otherwise identical behavior, a computer with smaller transistors has a higher clock speed, etc.
