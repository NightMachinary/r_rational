Which parts were you miffed by? I don't really care about the magic bits, since Erick's is obviously the best of the best when it comes to magic creation. His "wins" in the last two books definitely felt more pyrrhic than not imo. They always came at some significant cost, or setback. The cost to Erick isn't that much, since his personal power generally increases, but the people around him suffer.
