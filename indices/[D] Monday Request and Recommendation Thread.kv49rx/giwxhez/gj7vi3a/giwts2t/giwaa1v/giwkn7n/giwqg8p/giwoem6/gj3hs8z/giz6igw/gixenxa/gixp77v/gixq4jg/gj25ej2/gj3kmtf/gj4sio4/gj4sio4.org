I don't remember there being as much of a romance theme in the Pegasus prequels as in: The Rowan, Dalmia, Dalmia's children , Lyon's Pride (going from memory so forgive me if I forget one or two) . With the novelty of industrial FTL tele-kenetics established these series are more character driven and dynastic. There are some significant conflicts, some coming out of the blue, some well set up, but they are fun reads. The worldbuilding is fun, but there are also frustrating questions that are not explored but will seem like things you should see discussed if you are looking from a Hard Sci-Fi angle. Of all of Anne McCaffery's series they are not one I'd expect to recommend here but they are fun fluff reads, and you can usually find them at your larger used book stores.
