So I read the Pegasus prequels a long time ago, and enjoyed them, but I haven't read The Rowan series at all in fact I didn't realize that Pegasus was a prequel series until years later. If I liked the Pegasus books, am I likely to similarly enjoy the later (chronologically) novels? The descriptions make them seem pretty different. That plus the (admittedly slight) difficulty of finding books that old has kept me from reading them, so I guess I'm wondering if it's worth the time/effort to pick them up.
