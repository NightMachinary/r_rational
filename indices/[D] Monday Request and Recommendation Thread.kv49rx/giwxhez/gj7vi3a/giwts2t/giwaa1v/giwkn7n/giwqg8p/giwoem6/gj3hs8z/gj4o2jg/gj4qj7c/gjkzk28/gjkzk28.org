Yeah, sorry, I mixed it up with the OPM webcomic in my head. Domu sounds interesting but also creepy. I've seen HxH, caught with h the manga too. I'm not sure Hinamatsuri and Spy x family are what I'm looking for but they seem like they'd be fun, I'll give them a go.

  So now that you make me notice it, yes, there is a significant lack of overlap between "anime and manga I know" and "works exploring in depth the concepts of telepathy and telekinesis with a consistent power system".

Yeah I was thinking the same thing about myself. Although in the Kekkaishi manga there was this bit where a psychic, Sazanami, shows a younger psychic how to extract slightly more than surface thoughts when reading someone's mind. It was quite expository and I found it really cool. I was hoping I'd get reccs along that vein.

I've gotten quite a few reccs for FTNW and it might scratch my itch, I think; but that sound track is real dope, ominous too though.
