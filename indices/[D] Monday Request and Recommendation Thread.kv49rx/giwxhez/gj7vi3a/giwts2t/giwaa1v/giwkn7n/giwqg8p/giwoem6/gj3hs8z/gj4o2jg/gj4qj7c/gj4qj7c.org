Wait, isn't the manga completed?

About recommendations featuring psychic powers... well, Katsuhiro Otomo is kind of a classic there. "Akira" is well known, but a much lesser known little gem is "Domu", which is about a very childish, murderous old man and a little girl, both with esper powers, fighting out a secret battle within a Japanese apartment building. Not especially rational from what I remember but it doesn't really need to be, besides the premise of "random people have esper powers for reasons". I get the impression Mob Psycho 100 really drew inspiration from Otomo's work.

You could describe the complex power system in Hunter X Hunter as psychic powers, though that would be pretty reductive. Also you probably know of it already. But it's definitely very deep and rational in how it's fleshed out.

Others that I've read include "Hinamatsuri" and "Spy X Family" - both great, but neither very rational or interested in the psychic powers themselves at all. Hinamatsuri is a comedy about an esper little girl being dropped in the lap of a yakuza and disrupting his life and a host of other characters surrounding them. It's pretty absurdist and wildly funny. Spy X Family is about a spy in a Cold War Berlin-like alternative world setting getting a fake family for the purpose of an undercover job; except the woman he randomly meets in a shop and asks to be his wife happens to be an assassin looking for cover herself, and the child he picks up from an orphanage happens to be a telepath. Hilarity and spy-thriller adventures ensue.

So now that you make me notice it, yes, there is a significant lack of overlap between "anime and manga I know" and "works exploring in depth the concepts of telepathy and telekinesis with a consistent power system". Huh. I do support the rec for "From the New World", by the way, that one is really great. Also, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lxke2YUjBcM][it has this beautiful piece of music]].
