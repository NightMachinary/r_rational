You could try [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Legacy][Lost Legacy]] by Heinlein. Not his best work, but kind of fun, and if you're into psychics you will probably enjoy it.

For something more literary, though it might leave you a little unsatisfied in the psychic department...still a great novel...you might try /Bone Clocks/ by David Mitchell.
