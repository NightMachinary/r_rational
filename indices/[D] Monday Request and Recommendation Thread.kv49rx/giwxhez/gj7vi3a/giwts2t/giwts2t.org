So I just watched the recent episode of Attack on Titan yesterday, and it blew my mind. That episode was a masterpiece on all fronts, from the voice acting to the dialogue, from the OST to the cinematography and the story, and from the themes and action. AoT really handles the themes of war well, both sides understand just how terrible it is and just how wrong they are/were, but they are still forced to do it. One of them even acknowledges that his people and those of his enemy, from those in the walls to the ones across the ocean, are the same. He even understands why the other character did everything he did, and sympathizes with him. And the reactions of the other character... I'd say this was one of the most powerful episodes in any show I've seen ever.

I'd really recommend this series to anyone here, although do be warned the MC can be a bit “generic angry shouty kid” at the beginning, although it pays off phenomenally in the latest season. The way it all builds up and interconnects is fantastic too, and really shows the growth of the MC and just out of depth he was in the beginning and was a prisoner to the progression and plot.

Anybody else have thoughts on this?
