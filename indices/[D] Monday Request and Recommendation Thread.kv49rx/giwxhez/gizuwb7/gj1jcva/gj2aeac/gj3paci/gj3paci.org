If jumpscares are by definition basic and lazy, then DDLC contains no jumpscares. If you didn't enjoy it yourself, that's fine. I really would not expect DDLC to be everybody's cuppatea. But DDLC is incredibly short for the incredible impact that it has, and as an author of some minor acclaim myself, I have some idea of the incredible amount of work that takes. I didn't notice a single paragraph, a single sentence, that didn't contribute to the structure of DDLC. As an author, I guarantee you that somebody put in an incredible amount of work to remove every little bit that didn't need to be there, and polish what was left.

I would not have reacted to your original comment the way I did, if I hadn't read it and visualized a reader getting to one of the powerful-hitting moments in DDLC... and remembering you calling it a "jumpscare" and "cheap material", which is an instruction to the reader that they not feel the hit, that only somebody naive would feel that impact, that if they were wise and sophisticated they wouldn't feel as hard-hit by this "cheap material" "jumpscare". It is something that would tend to reduce the enjoyment of somebody who hasn't played DDLC yet.

You don't have to like DDLC. But if you think that it didn't take an incredible amount of labor to put it together, or that the hard-hitting moments didn't require a lot of careful setup, you're almost certainly wrong on a point of objective truth: in the sense that it's almost certain that the author put a huge amount of work into polishing the hardest-hitting parts, and I can point to the earlier setup work. And even if none of that was true, it is, I understand, the policy of [[/r/rational]], that you should be careful to work around talking in a way that will cause some people to enjoy the work less, especially when many people did enjoy it. This Earth does not have a great surplus of enjoyment.
