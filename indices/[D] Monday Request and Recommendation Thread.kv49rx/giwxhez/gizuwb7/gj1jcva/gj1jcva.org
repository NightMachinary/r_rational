I don't think anything happened in DDLC that I'd call a jumpscare in the sense of it not being quite thoroughly foreshadowed, but even if it was a jumpscare, I've enjoyed a number of jumpscares in some of my favorite horror movies? Calling that "cheap material" especially in a work of art as fine as DDLC, but also just in the horror movies I happen to have sometimes enjoyed, seems to run afoul of what I understood to be [[/r/rational]]'s injunction against [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvkv41/meta_reducing_negativity_on_rrational/][excess negativity]] or trying to convince somebody who liked a thing to not like it. (Which, as anybody who's read Erogamer could guess, is a point very near to my heart: to your own you be true.) Any further discussion of specifics should obviously be spoilered.
