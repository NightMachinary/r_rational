It's fine if you like jumpscares, it's not like they don't work for a lot of people. "Cheap" in this case is just referring to the fact that they don't require very much setup and are often perceived as a much easier way to scare people than other methods. Just looking at the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_scare][wikipedia]] page, it's described as "basic" and "lazy" before you even get to the contents box, if you want to get an idea as to how they're generally perceived.

As for the negativity, although I don't really agree with the policy anyway, I don't believe I'm being particularly negative in this instance in the first place. If someone liked DDLC but thought some of it was cheap or gauche then I've provided another potentially interesting rec. If not then the rec doesn't have to interest them. The purpose isn't to hate on DDLC, which I like a lot, but provide context for the rec. By the way, Yud was pretty clear about why he wasn't keen on people to be running around showing off policing negativity in your posted link, and I think he makes a good point in there. Might be worth reading that bit again.
