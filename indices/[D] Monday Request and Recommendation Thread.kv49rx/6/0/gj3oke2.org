May I just say that people should probably take a look at the goodreads page for this book first, before you jump right in. From a brief look at the top reviews, this book seems pretty questionably useful, seems like most top comments there consider it to be self help style and filled with a lot of blatant misinformation. Obviously I haven't read it so, I don't know for sure, but there's a lot of reviews with similar complaints.
