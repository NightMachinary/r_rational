What it says on the tin and then some. What if Haruhi Suzumiya escaped the Dursleys by traveling back in time to help Naruto fight the War of the Roses? Haruhi Suzumiya x Hary Potter x Naruto.

Disclaimer: I don't actually know anything about Haruhi Suzumiya or Naruto beyond what you can't help but run into on the Internet and what I read on Wikipedia while inventing this story.
