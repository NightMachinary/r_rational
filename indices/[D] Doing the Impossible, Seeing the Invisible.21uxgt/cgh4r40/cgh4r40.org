I can't tell if they/he/she think that LW is about rational and common sense and therefore against perceivably impossible things like immortality, or that they/he/she agree with LW stances of some things. Other than that a short ,almost lackluster summary of why some things should be done differently, the whole perception of reality and truth. Good cut of jib.
