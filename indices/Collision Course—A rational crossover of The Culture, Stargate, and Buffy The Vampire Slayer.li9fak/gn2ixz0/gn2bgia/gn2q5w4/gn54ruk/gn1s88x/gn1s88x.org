From the description:

#+begin_quote
  For Halloween, Willow goes as the Mind of a Culture spaceship, and Buffy and Xander, as members of her crew. Then Ethan casts his spell. How will two humans and one small sentient ship, endowed with the heritage of a bright (but apparently fictional) space-faring civilization, respond to the state of the galaxy and world? A "Ship of the Line" multi-crossover.

No familiarity is required with any of the mentioned fictions. It helps to know the basics of The Culture series, but those are explained through the narrative anyway.
