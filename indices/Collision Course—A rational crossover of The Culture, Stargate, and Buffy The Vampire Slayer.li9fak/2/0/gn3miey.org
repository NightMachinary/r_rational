I have felt this emotion so strongly for so many years that I can't watch romantic comedies or the majority of live action sitcoms. My loved ones have told me to not watch The Office out of feat that I may burst into flames.

I should have assumed there was a German word for it, but I always just called it second hand awkwardness. Thank you.
