Oh, it's my story. Man that was a long time ago, longer than I was in college. What a disturbing passage of time.

Anyway, Eliezer appeared in an early review (or pm?) and was like "there's no way you can have conflict here." Basically, I think he was right. My ideas for the story consisted of a bunch of cool scenes I wanted to see, rather than a coherent overarching plot. Plus it was a power fantasy (although maybe that's not so bad, it is our genre after all). Help me think about how to fix this, and maybe the story can resume.

Other than that, I have a jumpchain story idea I'm nursing (yes, and it's another power fantasy), but it does have a plot.
