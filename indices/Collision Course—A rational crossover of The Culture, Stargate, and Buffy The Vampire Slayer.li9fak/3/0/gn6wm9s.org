Did you by any chance ever read Xander Mercenary? [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6928/KevinM+Xander+Mercenary.htm]] ? It's a similar premise in that Xander dresses as Captain Tagon from Schlock Mercenary and the spell creates the Thunderhead-class Superfortress ship known as the Post-Dated Check Loan (affectionately known as Petey). Petey copies himself using local matter so that a version of himself will persist after the spell ends. He continues to treat Xander as his Captain. I was wondering if there was cross-pollination, since your story also involves a massive starship copying itself into realspace to survive after the spell ends.
