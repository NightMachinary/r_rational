Woo, [[/u/PositivePeter]] taking one for the team!

Dialogue is a huge pet peeve of mine as well. I can ignore it if there's really good worldbuilding, because tbh my ideal story is really just a travel guide or history book or something (my main complaint with Arrival was that there wasn't enough infodumping about Weird Alien Stuff), but otherwise, the dialogue is important.
