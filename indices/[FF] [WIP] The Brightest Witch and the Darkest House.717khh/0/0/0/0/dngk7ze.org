Ok, I read through year one. I'll comment here in case anybody was going to check back.

I don't think it got better, it was pretty hard to read and I probably won't read anymore. My two biggest complaints are (spoiler free):

- I wouldn't consider this a rational story at all. The few points of rational-style writing are more like “here's something weird about Harry Potter and I'm going to pick on it” with no real underlying thread of characters actually being fleshed out and motivated to understand the underlying world, and the plot is written in service of what the author thought might be interesting than actually being reasoned out as different people working to their own ends.

- Dialogue is incredibly awkward throughout. This is probably the worst pet peeve of mine, not sure if this bothers other people as much. Conversations just go in incredibly weird directions, rather than being a natural extension of the characters and the situation.
