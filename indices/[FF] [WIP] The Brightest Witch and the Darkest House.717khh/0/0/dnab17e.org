The first few chapters are rather awkward, especially in the dialogue. I think this is mostly a product of the author trying to condense down pre-Hogwarts events and get to the main story. It improves considerably when the story reaches Hogwarts, with better pacing and dialogue. Or, at least, after that point it was rare for the quality of the writing to get in the way of my enjoyment of the story, and sections where that happens are relatively short.
