After I finished watching and parodying SG-1 and Atlantis, I started in on Supernatural. I've been taking a break from that for a few weeks to focus on writing, but tonight I noticed that season 2 of The Flash had started up. I had to go back and re-watch the season 1 finale in order to have context; it was stupider than I remembered, so I decided to write it up.
