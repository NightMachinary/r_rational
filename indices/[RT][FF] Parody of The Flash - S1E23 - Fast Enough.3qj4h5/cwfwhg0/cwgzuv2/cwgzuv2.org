Well, it wasn't very good. I liked your early Stargate "fanfixing" because it went through the episodes and then tried to progressively "fix" them until they were actually good. The latter episodes just ended up being, just like this Flash one, essentially you running really fast through the plot and holding up billboards where you didn't like the plot. It's not fun. It's mildly humorous at best. This is, after all, [[/r/rational]]: we are perfectly capable of spotting all of these plot holes ourselves. What is interesting is seeing how they can be fixed.
