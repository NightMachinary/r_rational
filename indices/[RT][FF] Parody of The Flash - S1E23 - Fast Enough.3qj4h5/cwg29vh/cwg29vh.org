I've figured out how /The Flash/ works: the faster he goes, the stupider he gets.

Hence why he's marginally competent at the beginning, and by the time he can go FTL he's been reduced to running in circles very fast and hoping it fixes everything because he ran at /just/ the right fix-everything speed somehow.
