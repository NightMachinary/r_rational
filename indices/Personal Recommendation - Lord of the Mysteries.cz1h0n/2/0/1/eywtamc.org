Quotes from the translator [[https://www.webnovel.com/profile/1657837878]]

#+begin_quote
  There is a crackdown in China on "undesirable content." That definition is vague, which makes platforms like Qidian unable to know what actually constitutes as undesirable by the government. There are guidelines, but it's not sufficient to cover all possible ideas so many authors come up with. So to protect itself and the author from being rounded up by the police, it uses an automated bot to flag and censor sensitive terms, in this case some mention of a sacrifice. Just 3.5 lines or so.

  The point about the author not being able to carry on is that there's a risk of the government banning the book because of the occult elements.

  Personally think it's a not a big deal for translations in terms of the censorship. But it might be bad if his book gets banned in China.
