I haven't used them but there are several annotation extensions that let you basically mark up the document and share it with people. I've only seen them used academically but you could use them for this if the author is willing to read your notes.

The most popular example I know of is: "Hypothesis -- Web & PDF Annotation"

I wish these were more widely used, it would save time, trees, and the frustration of translating professors handwriting.
