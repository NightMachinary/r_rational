How's the translation? I remember trying to read it when it just got released on shitdian and even though grammar and spelling were pitch perfect the translation itself was garbage - some sentences made no sense. So I decided to skip. Has situation changed, improved? Also I highly rec same author's other work - Throne of Magical Arcana.
