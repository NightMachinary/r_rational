I'm trying to read it on boxnovel right now (only on chapter 4 so far), is there a better translation out there or does the translation get better? So far it's been pretty painful trying to ignore all the bizarrely structured sentences and weird word choices.

edit: every time I read something like this where I'm already making mental fixes to the text as I go, I find myself wishing there was some program or website that allowed me to edit the story as I go and submit it as an alternate translation or something. Does anything like this exist or would it require permission from the author?
