The interlude's are often superior to the regular Cat POV chapters for me. Part of that is that EE has an array of interesting side characters and has a knack for gifting them novel and intriguing voices, part of it is that the interlude chapters are often full of plot and important happenings, but the other part is that the interlude chapters refresh my interest in Cat herself.

Seeing Cat from the outside and the larger than life way she's viewed - part maniac, part genius, part selfless friend and part fearsome power - is a nice change of pace. We get a perspective switch from Cat the self depreciating, self doubting and all too human to a more mythic, larger than life figure.
