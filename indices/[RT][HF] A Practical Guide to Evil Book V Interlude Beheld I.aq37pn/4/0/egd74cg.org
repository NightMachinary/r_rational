The enemy is dug in just inside the city, past the bridges/river. The can be pushed out with Drow assistance, but that's only going to work temporarily, IE if they're receiving reinforcements from over the bridges then they're just going to push right back in and we'll have lost too many troops to stop them. Cat can't go outside the city to blow up the bridges/unfreeze the river because the other side has cavalry and all Cat has is light infantry until the sun goes down, so they're going through the part of the city that leads to the bridges but isn't occupied, because it's on fire.
