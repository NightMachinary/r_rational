Have we been shown so directly yet that she's no longer Fae-style bound by oaths she made? She promised Hakram no drinking while on campaign (although it's possible that one was fulfilled when he rejoined her and not made again before they split to go to the Everdark and Callow, I suppose).

If the oath was still being kept, though, not only is it no longer binding for Cat but the Sisters also feel no need to enforce the terms on her, which would have consequences for the Drow bindings.

I could be way off base, but is she trying to bring a temporarily allied force back to Callow with no levers to ensure they remain allied? She's First Under the Night now, but that's a title she was granted and it could be taken away for any or no reason, as far as I understand. Didn't we spend a large part of book 4 trying to figure out how to settle the Drow in Callow without the possibility of them becoming a major threat by keeping to their natures?
