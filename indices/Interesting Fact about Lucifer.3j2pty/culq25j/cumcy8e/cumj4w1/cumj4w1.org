The trilogy is titled /His Dark Materials/, fwiw.

Also interesting in that the closest character to the Lucifer archetype has been missing for billions of years, and the Rebellion is going just fine. It's much more about the less powerful characters and the system too; the great leaders on all sides are almost irrelevant when it comes down to it.
