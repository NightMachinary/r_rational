A thought: Alternate Character Interpretations for $DIETY are often pretty similar to what you'd see from a close-but-not-quite UFAI. Hell: someone decided that their SAI should punish wrongdoing. "Chosen People": someone decided to avoid walking all over everybody by setting to defend their family, followers, or countrymen. Various bigotry: someone decided to hard-code their beliefs.

That said, I agree. Many of the alternate character interpretations for the Lone Power bugged me and I think you hit the nail on the head: there's a trap where they end up being death worship wrapped up in nice words and arguments.
