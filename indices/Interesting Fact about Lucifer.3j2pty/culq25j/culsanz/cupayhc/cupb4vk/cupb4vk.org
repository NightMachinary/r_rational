Well, certainly treating it as /one-dimensional/ is bad, but it's obviously a measure over a many-dimensional space. There are small subspaces that we label "good", and yes, basically everything else is /less good/. And then our brains have separate ways of labelling things that are Bad rather than Lacking Good, and the sections of action/state/history-spaces that are intense in those qualities are labelled Evil.
