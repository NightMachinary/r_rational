What exactly do you find 'wonky' in the evil as lack of good argument? Basically it seems like because you find the scale hard to read it doesn't make sense. My dog can't read a thermometer but that hardly means that temperature doesn't exist on a continuous scale (sorry not comparing you to a dog, but if some omni-potent/scient being is the one making/reading the scale we would be less than a dog in comparison presumably). Anyway, I might not be able to judge an ultimately evil act against one slightly better, but I know when something shitty is going on just like my dog knows when its hot outside.

I agree that a strict reading of the bible would lead you to a God who purposefully created evil, of course. So if that's your reasoning it makes sense. But people making theodicy arguments almost all believe that the bible stories (especially the early ones) are metaphor, not history.

I'm also not religious but I would believe that it is inevitable that if you create a creature with truly free-will that it will eventually chose to exercise that freedom even if it meant not living in eternal bliss anymore. I think many would rather explore the unknown or not just do what Daddy tells them for all eternity. I am sure after a billion years of orgasming, a bit of pain might be a welcome new experience. Which makes the story of someone saying "Fuck you dad I don't want to live under your roof anymore and damn the consequences" make perfect sense to me.
