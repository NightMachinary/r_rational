  Like, one of these created the universe, and the other decided to muck it up by introducing evil.

Sorry for nitpicking, but in standard Christian theology that's not what happend. God created Satan. If you think Satan introduced evil, and not the people that do the evil, then Satan isn't responsible either - God is, because God created Satan (and did so while being almighty and omniscient - he knew the consequences and had the possibility to do it better).

There's whole theology branch trying to justify existence of evil, and AFAIK the best argument is "there's no evil as such, evil is just lack of goodness, like shadow is a lack of light, so God didn't created evil - it was always a possibility".

I find this argument wonky (it sugests evil-good scale is like Kelvin scale of temperature - there is ultimately evil act, and everything else is better, and also you can take evil deed, scale it enough times and it becomes good). Also it makes it hard to distinguish evil and neutral actions. Anything suboptimal and better than ultimate evil is similar in kind.

But if you don't accept this argument - the alternative is to accept that God introduced evil, through Satan, which in turn did it through people.

Also regarding the speific example of cancer - Bible says openly God did this when he expulsed people from Eden "you will no longer live forever - you will bear kids in pain and die of sickness".

This (together with the "I'm jealous God", "don't conspire with foreign gods", "the tree of knowledge is dangerous because people could become gods", "tower of babel - I'll destroy that") makes it very easy to read it as totalitarian system propaganda made into mythology.

There's fundmaental tension between God being so obviously more powerful than anything else in his universe that there can be no doubts who wins, and him being so scared of people and other spirits. It just begs for this interpretation.
