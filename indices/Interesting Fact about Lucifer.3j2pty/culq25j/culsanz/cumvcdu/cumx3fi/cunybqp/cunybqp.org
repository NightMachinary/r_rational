Offering awesome-sounding deals where you get Phenomenal Cosmic Power, which should be refused because they're Evil and any deal they offer is always playing into their hands ... sounds like the devil to me, yeah.

But those are much better deals than I've ever heard of the Devil offering, I gotta admit. I'll definitely have to check the series out.
