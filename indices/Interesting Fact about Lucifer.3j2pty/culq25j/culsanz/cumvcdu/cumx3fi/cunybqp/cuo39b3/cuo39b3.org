  But those are much better deals than I've ever heard of the Devil offering, I gotta admit.

They're still not very good deals. Examples include, "Devote your species to My service, and I will make you conquerors of the cosmos^{also} ^{a} ^{totalitarian} ^{hive} ^{race} ^{whose} ^{primary} ^{source} ^{of} ^{nutrition} ^{is} ^{fully-conscious,} ^{self-aware} ^{dissenting} ^{individuals} !" Or, "Work for me, and I can help you take your planet back from the filthy mammals^{but} ^{you'll} ^{be} ^{maladapted} ^{for} ^{life} ^{on} ^{your} ^{homeworld} ^{so} ^{everything} ^{will} ^{hurt} ^{all} ^{the} ^{time} !"

Hmmm... Duane pulled that trick twice. Interesting. It's still offensive /both times/.
