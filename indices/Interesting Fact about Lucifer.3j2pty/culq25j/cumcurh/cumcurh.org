Sort of cheating, but Cradle of Filth's album /Damnation and a Day/ is a reimagining of /Paradise Lost/. The protagonist is Feriluce, and he's joined throughout the story by several allegorical female characters.

One of the curious elements in PL's treatment of Satan is that, at one point, he nearly relents and returns to God, but God reaches down and hardens his heart, causing him to remain an adversary. Similarly, Feriluce realizes his mistake fairly early in the story ("An Enemy Led the Tempest") and eventually wants nothing more than to be left alone to love Faith ("Thank God for the Suffering"), but any joy he finds is constantly taken from him by a vengeful God and a jealous Michael.
