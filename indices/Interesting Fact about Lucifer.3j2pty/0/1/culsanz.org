Alternate Character Interpretations are one thing, but I often find myself /slightly/ worried that our pop-literary canon spends so much time and effort finding ways to cast the [[http://www.youngwizards.com/ErrantryWiki/index.php/Lone_Power][Lone Power]] as heroic and [[http://www.youngwizards.com/ErrantryWiki/index.php/One%2C_the][the One]] as the /real/ bad-guy.

Like, one of these created the universe, and the other decided to muck it up by introducing evil. It should be remembered that Evil is not [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy][a cool leather jacket or a short skirt]], or even [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill][free will]]: Evil is cancer killing your mother tortuously over years. Evil is people having to live flea-bitten and psychotic in train tunnels because there are no care programs.

On the other hand, said pop-literary canon seems to do so because priests need to justify their positions of authority, so Ultimate Good gets cast as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns][/having the right king in charge/]].

(Sorry for ranting: these kinds of thoughts tend to come of reading Iain Banks books and David Brin's blog and sometimes just [[http://www.scottlondon.com/interviews/saul.html][the internet at large]] and realizing that, welp, that whole Enlightenment thing we go on about was /really recent/ and /hasn't actually fully won yet/, and still needs defense more than "interesting" subversion.)
