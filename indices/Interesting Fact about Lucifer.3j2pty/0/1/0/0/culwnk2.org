  Satan is usually subordinate to God and part of God's own Path to Victory divine plan (though that part varies heavily by denomination).

This is the big one to me. In almost all cases, Lucifer is inherently understood as *less powerful than God*, and as God is omnipotent, any evil which Lucifer performs is inherently accepted by God simply because despite having the ability to, he has not prevented or reversed it.

Then there's the fact the as God is omniscient, he knew exactly what Lucifer would do when (before?) he created him, and still chose to allow it to happen. So even if Lucifer created evil, God allowed and allows it to happen and so is equally or more complicit.

Hell, under most modern legal systems between parental liability for damages caused by children and vicarious liability of employers from acts of employees, God would be responsible for all of it.

Most sympathetic Devils are either Byronic Anti-Heroes fighting against a much more dangerous evil than themselves, people who have Become the Mask, or guys with the worst PR department in the world. Most of the time they are still assholes, but they are passionate and most importantly /human-seeming/ assholes, usually fighting an alien or apathetic system or being. In almost all of those cases as well, they are not responsible for the creation of evil or death, though they may use it was a weapon or take advantage of it under Pay Evil unto Evil terms.
