Judaism has no character representing Lucifer or the Lone Power. The "morning star" in Isaiah is a reference to a Babylonian god who was being insulted. "Satan" is taken to be, roughly, its literal translation: "accuser", God's prosecuting attorney. Judaism believes a Source of Evil would contradict monotheism.
