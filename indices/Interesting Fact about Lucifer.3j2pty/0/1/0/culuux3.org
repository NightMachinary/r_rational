In Christian mythology, Lucifer is almost never the Lone Power. He was an angel who fell from Heaven after a failed rebellion; his primary sin was that he wanted to become higher than God. Further, Satan is usually subordinate to God and part of God's own +Path to Victory+ divine plan (though that part varies heavily by denomination).

So you can see where the alternate character interpretation comes from. Very few Christians believe that Satan was responsible for bringing death or sin into the world; he's mostly just a guy who really, really hates God and humanity. Those are both pretty sympathetic.

Edit: I am sort of curious how the view of Lucifer in Christianity compares to the view of Lucifer in Judaism, if you have any insight.
