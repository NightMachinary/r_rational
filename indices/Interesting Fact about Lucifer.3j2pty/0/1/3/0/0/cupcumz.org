I'm not religious either (but I was, and I strugled quite a lot with these issues when I was 18 or so :) ). Now that I rethink this I kinda start to see the point of that argument. It's the trolley problem. I shouldn't have started this discussion with cashed thoughts from 12 years ago...

Everything below about the evil-good scale is based on my cashed thoughts from the time I was Christian, leaving it here but it kinda makes no sense when you dispose with the sins and punishment:

#+begin_example
   The 1-dimension was irrelevant, what's important is that it has no distinct good and bad states, it's arbitrary.

  I found it very hard to think in that way, and I suspected all people do. It just feels wrong to have no qualitative distinction between "not giving to charity", and "beating up someone".

  The whole concept of sin requires some cut-off point, after which you are OK. With evil-as-shadow there is no such point, you could always do better, so why you can be punished for some things and not for other? If it's a problem with our brains and not the reality - then it's still harsh on humans to create them with faulty morality-meters and then judging by how well they were able to reprogram it.
#+end_example

End of cashed thoughts based rambling.

Still the point that Roman Catholic theology (and many others I suspect) invites "Satan = good guy rebel" interpretation stands.
