  I haven't read the Young Wizards books, but it sounds like the One is the traditional Christian-mythology Devil, and the Lone Power is God, just with the serial numbers filed off.

Uh, no. Duane (author of the series) has explicitly stated she came up with the core worldbuilding concepts after having come across a line in Talmud that she liked, and the books themselves make explicit reference to a character trying to talk to the One by /praying in a church/.

It's a much, much more Manichean theology than IRL religion allows, but if you read the books, you would see that it does more-or-less align itself with the way religion reads things, just... with a lot more good sense than usual.

(For example, many races, when they reach their Choice (eg: they achieve full sapience and become moral/spiritual agents, and thus have to choose whether to act for the Bright Powers or the Lone One), actually attempt to abolish death via some massively overpowered reality-warping spell. /This actually plays right into the Lone One's hands./ One of Its /favorites/ was a species who decided to try to abolish entropy by /stopping time/, and had to be frantically talked out of it by an intervening wizard.

It never says, straightforwardly, "Take my option so you can suffer and die more." It says, "Choose My service and I will give you the power to dominate the world, and whatever you want, you can reach out and take."

This is why it's /very rare/ for a species to Choose rightly by just refusing the Lone One's offers outright, /seeing correctly/ that what's really being offered is /death as a lifestyle/, even though the few instances shown in the books are shown to have achieved nigh-utopian lives that way.)
