I think you have it backwards.

The story is that God created Eden; a perfect world, where there was no hunger, or death, or pain. And the Adversary, greatest among God's creations, rebelling against God, persuaded Man to disobey God; thus ruining everything forever.

I haven't read the Young Wizards books, but it sounds like the One /is/ the traditional Christian-mythology Devil, and the Lone Power /is/ God, just with the serial numbers filed off.
