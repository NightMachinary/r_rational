I dunno, I think it's been stated in-text that the right to steal a body mid-battle is exclusive to Paragoners, and explicitly denied to Ana, whom they want to control and manipulate by dangling possible salvation infront of. Given Lorne's assholishness, I could see Ana taking advantage of the situation and Lorne's friend's death to gain a body causing a dangerous end to the group's cohesion.

Also, Ana has clearly pre-decided against stealing Green Hands' bodies for herself, and may not have realized in the moment that this was an exception.

Finally, Ana has claimed previously that she is used to the current body and will fight better in it, which at this point begins to stagger belief and we may have to suspect is her lying to herself.

But I agree that it's clear that for authorial reasons Ana will not get a new body yet, and having Ana's own reasons for not taking this body be so opaque is frustrating. Better, perhaps, would have been if Paragon had given her a body for the current crisis on a purely temporary basis. Her unwillingness to run away and attempt to steal the body or, body-swap into another and end her ability to work with Paragon to fight Commonplace would be more believable.
