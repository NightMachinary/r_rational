  The man's chest stopped moving.  He's not breathing. I reached out towards Deon's Pith.  Even though he'd been swapped into a healthy body, his Pith had become no more than a few wisps of lightning in his skull.  He sustained too much permanent damage to his brain.  We had taken too long.

Why doesn't Ana transfer into this body? It feels like she should really be able to, and everybody should /really/ be considering it.

I think the subtext is that she can't transfer because the body stopped breathing? If so, that needs to be made a lot clearer. And it's a bit hard to justify, because it takes a few minutes of heart failure for brain damage to settle in. Neon's Pith is dead, but the body should still be fine.

I don't know, for the last few arcs Ana has been obsessing about her imminent death and her need to get a new body. It's really offputting that now that they have a lot of opportunities to steal one they don't even consider it.
