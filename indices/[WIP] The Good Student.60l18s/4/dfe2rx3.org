Was almost put off at the beginning by it all sounding a bit clinical and robotic in tone, but a little further in and that's becoming characterful rather than feeling like poor narration.

Now it has more of a sense of "Whatever bull this world tries to pull, he's going to casually dissect and dismantle it, by a greater command of the facts".
