This is actually really good, far better than I expected!

It's a bit of the usual Royal Road fare, but with actual good writing. The plot so far is rather interesting, the characterization very good, the world a little bit generic but also unusual in some interesting ways.

I'm actually really excited to see what comes in the next chapters. So far almost every one has been a treat to read.
