Thanks for posting this. Despite the plot starting out like every cliched South Indian movie ever (rags-to-riches + poor-boy-wins-rich-girl), I find it emotionally compelling. Takes me back to my childhood in South Asia where high school final exams are almost a matter of life and death. The grades one gets in this last exam literally determines the course of ones' life. That part really isn't a fantasy in large parts of the world. And there have been documented cases of dirt poor kids taking the top rank in their state.
