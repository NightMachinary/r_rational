It's a rationalist (EDIT: rationalist-themed, not really rational because plot-driven) [[https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0][sci-fi story in Russian]] (sadly, there're no English translation) by Nick Gorkaviy, an astrophysicist who works in NASA.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/21tsox/rthsf_astrovityanka_russian/][I posted about it once]].

It features a girl (who was raised by an AI on a spaceship) and is accepted into rationalist school on the Moon colony, and also a boy who is second to her abilities but madly in love with her.

The pair struggle with politics and also scientific problems, then uses their brains and the AI to win and bring singularity.

The main weakness of the story is wish-fulfillment aspect --- but it's primary audicence is teens, despite there being deep scientific knowledge discussed.
