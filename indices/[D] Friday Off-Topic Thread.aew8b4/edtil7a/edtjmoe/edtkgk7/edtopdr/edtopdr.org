The system doesn't matter /that/ much, because you'll almost always end up in a circumstance where the GM has to adjudicate the rules, and in my opinion, it's better to have a good GM adjudicate the rules than for people to go looking through books in order to find the specific place that the game designer has written down their own method of adjudication. Where things get shaky is when you have either a bad GM who's no good at the adjudication-of-rules aspect of GMing, or where the system you're using has rules that either don't make sense within the context of the world you're roleplaying within, or where they contradict each other.
