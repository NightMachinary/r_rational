The main tinker character simply has zoomable (and maybe microscopic) vision. Sure that could be handy for making tech, but not handy enough. It doesn't provide any ideas or expertise like an actual tinker power, it's just inbuilt lenses.

As far as I'm aware, we don't actually see any other support characters, at least none that have their tech shown. I'm not up to date though, so idk.

Personally, the way I prefer thinking about it is: IT'S THE FUTURE. Maybe tech is just good enough in that time that someone /can/ whip up an exoskeleton in their garage. That'd work well for a story about quirkless Deku, since he doesn't have to be an implausible super genius anymore. This is ignoring the fact that in this model of MHA, wealthy enough people without strength and resilience quirks aren't wearing power armour.

I suppose you have to be able to ignore a certain amount of holes to enjoy a superhero story, though. Which I do, usually, I guess just not this time.
