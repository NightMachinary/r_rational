  The thing is, Batman/ironman have unspoken tinker and brute powers

So do humans in MHA. It doesn't avoid having these things, it just has them in addition to normal superpowers. When intangible man and blood boy can both fight as if they have super strength, despite *not having super strength*, then that's just as bad as if not worse than ironman and batman, since it's contradictory. Especially contradictory when, in universe, people without Quirks are said to be much less capable fighters. If blood boy can easily break through thick pieces of ice the way he does, without a strength quirk, why can't Jonny mcnoquirk? It's just sloppy.

It doesn't make it a /bad/ show, but it is something I dislike a lot. Your comment kinda treats MHA as if the above isn't true, so I guess here you go?
