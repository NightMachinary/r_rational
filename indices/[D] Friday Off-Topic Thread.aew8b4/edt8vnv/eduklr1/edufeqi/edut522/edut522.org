So last week I went on my first date ever. I think it went pretty well, and we'll be having a second date once exams are over.

I like her, and for whatever strange reason, she seems to like me, and honestly I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm kind of terrified I'm going to screw this up, so any general relationship advice would be much appreciated.
