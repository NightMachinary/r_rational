Yeah, I guess it's part of the appeal, which is a little perverse.

Sometimes I get torn between wanting to watch more videos because they make legitimately interesting, insightful points, and wanting to stop watching because Lily's anger is often contagious, the kind that makes you want to send hate-mail detailing every single thing the youtuber got wrong (and lots of people do that, in mail or video form).

It's also a very morbid kind of fascination, watching someone pour so much of her heart into something that clear brings out the worst parts of her and damages her fragile sanity.
