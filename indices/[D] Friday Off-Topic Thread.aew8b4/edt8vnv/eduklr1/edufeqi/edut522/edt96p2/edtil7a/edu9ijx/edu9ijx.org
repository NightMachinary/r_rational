Is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer][Goblin Slayer]] rational fiction? For those unfamiliar with the work, it is a Light novel/Manga/Anime; I am thus far only familiar with the Anime and my discussion mostly concerns that. The story revolves around the titular Goblin slayer, and his pursuit of slaying as many goblins as possible in the generic fantasy world that the characters inhabit.

​

Why is it rational fiction? Well, the sidebar lists 5 features of ratfics, so I'll try and go through them one by one.

​

  Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

​

I wanted to address this first. Goblin Slayer takes place in a near approximation of a video game world, with an adventurers guild, quests and ranks, though it is not an explicit video game. Many rational/ist fics take place in deconstructions of such environments and GS is not much different. Essentially, GS asks the question of what would happen if the Lvl 1 enemies of a video game were real. How would a world deal with massive numbers of weak enemies? A video game never really stops to consider what might happen to the village once the hero moves away, and this is essentially what GS looks at. Against undefended villages and naive adventurers the goblins are shown to be an extreme menace, for despite their individual weakness, in large numbers they are highly dangerous, and will raid, murder and rape their way accross any humans they find.

​

This forms the central driving point of the plot, though it is also one of the main weaknesses as far as GS being a rational fiction is concerned. The story depends on the average character essentially considering goblins to be a non-entity, so easily dealt with as to be ignored. This allows them to raid and slaughter with impunity. Yet, if they were actually killing rookies and torching villages so often, they would surely be regarded as a much more dangerous threat and there would be many, many Goblin Slayers seeking out and destroying the pests.

​

Nonetheless, the deconstruction still works, and there are other aspects which contribute to it being rational.

​

  Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
#+end_quote

​

This is the most obvious aspect. As a near video game world, there is an adventurers guild, and 'ranks' obtainable by stronger adventurers. The Goblin Slayer has one of the highest ranks possible and is regarded as an elite adventurer (if also a figure of fun due to his obsession with the 'weak' enemy). Despite this, the character is shown to actually be a fairly mediocre fighter, and anytime he comes across a physically superior enemy he is usally beaten in one on one combat. Sure, against the average goblin he will slay without trouble, but the likes of Goblin Champions, Goblin Lords and so forth are shown to provide a great challenge to the man.

​

Invariably, Goblin Slayer triumphs not through force of arms but through intelligent strategy and tactics. Most of his goblin slaughters are not one man masssacres but the simple application of fire, or poison, or similar. Early in the series, a powerful troll is beaten when GS uses a 'gate spell' to open a portal to the bottom of the ocean, and the water pressure that is released simply annihilates the troll in front of him. At the end of the current season, GS organizes the defence of a town, successfully deflecting a goblin attack with almost no casualties, and defeating the golbin lord by crushing him between two "Protection" barriers cast by the priest MC.

​

The Goblin Slayer is not a completely rational character, as he is shown being able to recover from what would otherwise be lethal injuries through sheer force of anger, or something, but it is a fantasy series so some absurdities are to be expected.

​

#+begin_quote
  Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
#+end_quote

​

This is less well done. The Goblin Slayer himself has a very clear and obvious reason for his genocidal ambitions against the goblins, but thus far the other 4 main characters are not so well defined (though the anime has had only 13 episodes thus far). The priest is not shown to have any real motivation. The Elf archer seems to want to have fun adventures? The dwarf and the Lizardman are both unexplored, thus far. I will give GS a pass on this for now, but perhaps any readers of the LN or Manga can comment if it improves in the future.

​

Given the above, obviously whether or not an intellectual pay-off is reached is not going to be clear just yet. I can also state that aspiring rationalism is not part of the story. Otherwise, I think it qualifies quite well as a rational fic
