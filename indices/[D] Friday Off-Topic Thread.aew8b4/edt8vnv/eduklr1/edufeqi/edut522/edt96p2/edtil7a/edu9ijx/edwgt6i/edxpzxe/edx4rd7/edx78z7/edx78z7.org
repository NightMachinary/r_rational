Fair points regarding feudal fantasy and average ability. I fear the setting isn't consistent enough to support any serious political discussion, though.

What about that ocean-portal exploit? Pretty destructive. If this is something the protagonist got for a favour, imagine what kinds of weapons he could have acquired if he convinced the mage in question to fully support him.

  Similarly, Goblin Slayer might well be badly unsuited for a political or military position, and so his current application is the most effective that he can achieve

He seems to be very good at tactics and munchkinry. Off the top of my head, the most obvious path to power for him is: start going after more dangerous/"prestigious" threats, meet other powerful adventures, impress them with your skills, make friends/form teams. Use acquired money and influence to improve gear/abilities, take down ever-more dangerous threats; hit recursive improvement. Once your team is sufficiently powerful/large/tight-knit, ensure that they're spending at least a fraction of their capital/time on eradicating goblins.

This has to be better than what he is actually doing.
