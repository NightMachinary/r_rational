A fair point, though it does depend on the assumptions that these paths actually exist in the GS world. Though the generic fantasy setting does include "chosen heroes" and "ultimate evils", there is nothing to suggest that magic users have access to massive destructive power, or in general that Goblin Slayer could dramatically increase his lethality beyond his preferred methods of poison and fire.

And powerful, organized militaries or influential politicians are both things that might not be found in a feudal fantasy world. It's safe to assume a mostly monarchical system is present, which would probably form a large barrier to amassing political influence or military independence.

Not to mention that not every effective altruist will be best served by earning to give. There are always going to be those of average ability who simply cannot rise to high levels of income, and so more traditional altruist routes such as working for a charity can still be the best place for them. Similarly, Goblin Slayer might well be badly unsuited for a political or military position, and so his current application is the most effective that he can achieve.
