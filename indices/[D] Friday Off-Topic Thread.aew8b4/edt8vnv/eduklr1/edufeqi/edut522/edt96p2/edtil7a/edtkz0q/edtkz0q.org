The subreddit has a discord, [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][here]], which has a #looking_for_group channel. We spawn new channels for people who want to use it for roleplaying games. (If you want to advertise, I would do it in #general first though, then coordinate in #looking_for_group, and also get people from here.)

I've been playing D&D (and other systems) for a little more than twenty years now, with the majority of that time as DM. I like it a lot, but I find it difficult to run a game as DM and actively work on writing a project at the same time, because I'm switching creative effort between the two of them, and they're both heavy on the time investment.
