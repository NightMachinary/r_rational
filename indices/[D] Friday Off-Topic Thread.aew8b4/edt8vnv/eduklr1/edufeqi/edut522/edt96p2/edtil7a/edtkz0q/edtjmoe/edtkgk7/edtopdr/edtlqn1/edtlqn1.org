  Also it has a lot of crazy spells and magic items and their interactions that you can explore, but I don't know how gurps works, it might have that too.

One failing of GURPS is that its default magic system arguably is just as bad as D&D. However, GURPS also has several /non/-default magic systems (most prominently Sorcery, which is just the standard trait system with a new coat of paint, also known as "Magic as Powers") that can be considered to stand on a level with the rest of the system.
