  I'm not sure this is actually the case

He stated this in one of the earlier episodes, if I recall correctly. Someone implied that he would be unhappy if goblins were gone, because he would be out of a job, and he replied that no, he would prefer if they didn't exist. It's definitely what he /intellectually/ believes in.

True, he is driven by revenge, and killing goblins personally may be emotionally satisfying to him, much more satisfying than winning arguments with politicians would be. But part of being a competent, rational person is being able to master your emotions when they get in the way of doing what you honestly wish to do.

Besides, the struggle between doing something which /makes you feel/ like you're doing good, and /actually/ making a lasting positive impact on the world, even though the process doesn't feel as enjoyable --- wouldn't it make for an interesting story?

  I believe he has considered teaching others how to kill goblins more effectively, but I think he is concerned that since goblins have a high capacity to learn and grow if they survive long enough, if he introduced his tactics on a wide scale and some adventurers used them inefficiently (i.e. not being 100% thorough in killing every single goblin in a horde) because he wasn't there to watch over them, then those tactics would no longer be effective

That seems self-defeating. By that logic, he shouldn't do anything either lest he misses a goblin at some point and ends up teaching them something. By that logic, there could be no improvement over the present situation whatsoever.
