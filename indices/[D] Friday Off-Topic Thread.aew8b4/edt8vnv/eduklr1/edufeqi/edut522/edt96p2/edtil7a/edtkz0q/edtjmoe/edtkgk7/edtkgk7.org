Hmm, I've never heard of it, thanks for the link, I'll check it out.

DnD seems to be much more popular and well known though(easier to find players). Also it has a lot of crazy spells and magic items and their interactions that you can explore, but I don't know how gurps works, it might have that too.

Rationalist stories seem to be more interesting in crazier / less rational worlds. I think it would be much harder to write a rational Game of Thrones / Death Note fanfic (they're rational'ish enough to begin with) than a rational Harry Potter fanfic.
