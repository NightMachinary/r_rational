Think of dating as a long game of subcommunication. You're trying to communicate interest in her, desirable characteristics, not being a creep, the ability to have a fun conversation, etc.

However, saying those things /explicitly/ ("I'm smart, I read a lot of books, I don't do weird things, I have good hygiene") /actually/ communicates awkwardness so you have to demonstrate them, subcommunicate them, etc.

Have fun!

Don't be too pushy but don't be afraid to go for a kiss if the timing feels right and your date isn't trapped with you-- that could be scary for them.

Keep things light-hearted and fun.
