Probably my favorite thing about My Hero Academia is that Deku /earned/ his quirk. Tons of shonens give their "ordinary" protagonists secret special powers that undermine their theme that anyone can be a hero if they believe in the power of friendship, hard work, love, blah blah blah. See: Naruto. (Started from the bottom now we here, except the bottom is winning the genetics and ancestry lottery.) Yeah, Deku has his own secret special power, but its not his because he's special or because of destiny, or whatever, but because of the choices he made and the choices All Might made.

I really appreciate that; it's very meritocratic, compared to an often very aristocratic genre. What I'm wondering is, though, why is that so uncommon, even if you look in Western works aimed towards young boys and girls? Why is it so often that works give their protagonist some inherent specialness specifically because of who they're descended from? See: Harry Potter. I won't claim that /most/ works are like that, but enough are that, in the context of our modern, republican societies that it weirds me out.
