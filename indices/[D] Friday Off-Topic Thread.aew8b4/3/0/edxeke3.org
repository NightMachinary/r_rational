Don't get too attached and be aware that dating usually gets easier as you get more experience, and your first time is rarely your best.

If you're the kind of nerd that reads rational fic and asks for dating advice for reddit, there's a decent chance that you have the kind of brain that produces all sort of inventive, unconventional ideas in new situations. Now, what you want to do is take that creative, quirky part of your brain, and /ignore every single thing it tells you to do/. Do boring conventional things, like going to the cinema, eating in moderately classy restaurants, or hanging out in parks. Try to say inoffensive, generically pleasant things. Don't mention fanfiction or effective altruism or AI safety unless your dates goes there first.

Over time, you'll figure out how to be creative and unconventional without coming off as an a maladjusted creep, but your second date /isn't the time for that/.

Otherwise, talk about your common interests, your studies, or whatever conversation subject you think your date will be interested in. Be straightforward about your feelings, and don't think dating has to be an intricate of N-dimensional chess. Know what you want, ask her (delicately) what she wants, and try to find common ground.

Read the first few pages of [[/r/relationships][r/relationships]] to get a mental map of the big red flags to avoid. It won't teach you how to be popular, but it will give you a pretty good idea of what are the worst case scenarios.
