Congratulations! I'm happy to offer you some general tips.

- Don't let your own flaws catch you by surprise. Get ahead of any possible mistakes by being completely self-conscious as possible at all times. That way you'll be as guarded as you can be against any potential screw-ups.

- For related reasons, your date will really appreciate it if you do the same for her. A little bit of constructive criticism about her clothes, hair, and makeup go a long way!

- Don't be completely negative! Be sure to pepper in some positive comments as well. Little things like "You're doing great, have you dated before?" and "You're on track for sex tonight" will ensure that she's doing her best to please you.

- When kissing, lead with the tongue and go in deep. Kissing is all about tongue.

- Wear a condom so you don't have to kill the flow to put one on after you both start getting naked. ;)

- Remember, she's just as nervous as you are! Take the pressure off of her shoulders by looking at and even flirting with other girls. She'll be relieved to know that even if she doesn't impress you, you still have other options.

- Use more tongue than you think you should even after reading the previous tip about it. Seriously. It's a lot of tongue.

- Find out soon into the date what her favorite fanfictions are. If you share the same tastes, great! This can really move the date along. And if she has wrong opinions, at least you can end the date early.

- Women are attracted to a man's natural smell. Don't bathe and don't use deodorant. When you get close to her, she won't be able to think about /anything/ but the way you smell. ;)

- Lube up your fingers before the date so you don't have to kill the flow when you both start getting naked. ;)

Or if you're feeling intimidated and want to take things slowly, disregard the above, steal a few neat date ideas from the internet, wear something that looks decent on you (ask a female/gay/fashionable friend to confirm), and just try to be your best self during the date. If your best self is nervous and excited to be dating a cool girl, then that's totally okay! Though you do gotta relax a little eventually, can't be panic-sweating all night. ;)

- A giraffe's tongue can stretch as much as 20 inches. She should feel like she is kissing a giraffe.
