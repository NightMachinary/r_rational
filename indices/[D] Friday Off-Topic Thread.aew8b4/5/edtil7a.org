Hey, everyone! Do any of you play DnD?

I've never had a chance to play before, but a few days ago I have discovered online communities that play DnD over discord, played a few games and it was *amazing*, the most fun I've had in a long time. It works super well, people are helpful and friendly, and it's ridiculously awesome.

I'd guess that playing with rationalists would take it to a whole another level, can you imagine rationalist DnD game focused on logically extrapolating rules of the world and finding creative solutions to problems?

I'm super new to this, but I really can't get enough of DnD. Do any of you want to play? Do any of you DM?

I want to get to know more people who are into this, my handle is =lumen#7925=, feel free to friend/message me!

Turns out there's a thing called "one-shot" games, where instead of running a long campaign you get to play one self-contained episode that lasts 2-5 hours. That requires way less scheduling and time commitment than a long-running campaign (think a short story instead of a tv show). The best servers I could find are [[https://discord.gg/vPFH5sQ][D&D Friends]] and [[https://discord.gg/Qw7u4jY][The Drakaise Battalion]], they sometimes run 4-5 games per day!

Also if you guys will be interested, we could make a rationalist DnD discord server, just for funzies.
