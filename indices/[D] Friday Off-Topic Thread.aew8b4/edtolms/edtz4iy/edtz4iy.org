I liked [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhCpMLiarFk][this video that talks about the representation of autism in The Big Bang Theory]] and thought it made a lot of good and interesting points from the perspective of someone who has actually worked with autistic children. I tried watching several other videos that popped in the "recommended videos" section afterward but didn't like them due to a combination of not being interested in the subject matter (most of them were highly specific, "let's talk about this particular episode of this particular show" for a lot of shows that I don't watch) and not finding the presentation interesting or entertaining enough on its own to make me want to watch a video about a show that I don't watch.

"Angry Youtuber rants about [TV show / movie / insert entertainment property]" is not a genre I am a fan of to begin with so it's less a case of "I don't like Lily Orchard" and more a case of "Lily Orchard seems to be doing something that is not my cup of tea, but probably appeals to a large segment of people." I think a part of it might be that I get the impression that Lily Orchard does actually seem to be genuinely angry about a lot of the things that she rants about, which might be an odd think to remark on since that is ostensibly the point, but of the "angry Youtuber rant" videos that I /do/ like, a lot of them are things like Red Letter Media's Harry Plinkett, where it feels like the "angry rant" character is mostly a schtick created because the creator thought it would be entertaining. (Harry Plinkett literally is a fictional character created by a guy who apparently thought it would be more entertaining than just saying things in his own voice.) With RLM; the "angry old man" is a facade created by someone who mostly seems to be having fun with subject matter, and it's obvious that most of the extreme anger is intentional hyperbole for the sake of comedy. With Lily Orchard, the rage and negativity feels a little too real to me. There are probably people out there for whom genuine rage is a big part of the appeal, but I am definitely not the sort of person who enjoys encountering genuine rage, even if it is rage on the side of something that I happen to agree with.
