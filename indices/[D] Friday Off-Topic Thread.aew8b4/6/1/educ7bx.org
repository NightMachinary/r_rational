Personally even tho i like GS quite a bit i wouldnt really say its rational unless i see further evidence the author concidered things on a deeper level. As the things are now the whole "subversion" is surface level at best and doesnt deconstruct or reconstruct enough of the genre to fully be rational. Especially when its an adventure story with a gimmick for now. It is implied that the in story world is based upon narrative and so the story is more META but for now we havent seen a lot of consequences of it and from the spoilers i have received the readers had like only a couple of chapters defining that.
