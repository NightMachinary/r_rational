  His goal is "exterminate goblins", not "be killing goblins", yes?

I'm not sure this is actually the case. He's driven by a desire for revenge, and he seems to enjoy killing goblins. It probably wouldn't be as satisfying to him if he wasn't doing the killing personally. I believe he has considered teaching others how to kill goblins more effectively, but I think he is concerned that since goblins have a high capacity to learn and grow if they survive long enough, if he introduced his tactics on a wide scale and some adventurers used them inefficiently (i.e. not being 100% thorough in killing every single goblin in a horde) because he wasn't there to watch over them, then those tactics would no longer be effective.
