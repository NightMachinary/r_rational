  Is Goblin Slayer rational fiction?
#+end_quote

Well, Goblin Slayer himself is definitely not a rationalist. A combat pragmatist, sure, but not a rationalist. Source: he is failing to accomplish his goal.

His goal is "exterminate goblins", not "be killing goblins", yes? In this case, he goes about it in a laughably inefficient way: by actually going out with a sword and personally killing goblins one-by-one.

As opposed to, say, swaying a powerful sorcerer to his side and getting access a WMD with which he could destroy dozens of goblin settlements a week. Or joining military and rising in ranks until he could personally send out troops on systematic extermination campaigns. Or becoming a politician and swaying the public's opinion, making them (and other adventures) more aware of the threat of goblins. Or fully focusing on determining the origin of goblins and destroying it.

Instead of doing any of the things that would let him make /actual, tangible/ progress towards eradicating goblins within his lifetime, he is "eradicating goblins" in ways so unproductive he'll barely make a dent in their population by the time he dies of old age (at least, unless plot gets involved; I haven't watched past episode 6).

It almost makes me want to write /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism][Effective]] Goblin Slayer/, a rational fanfiction.

Regarding your actual question: I think it's rationality-adjacent in that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] enjoys Combat Pragmatism trope and this work's premise is "fantasy combat pragmatist vs. goblins", but that's the extent of the show's rationality.
