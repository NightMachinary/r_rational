FYI, the weekly threads have been changed:

- Monday: Recommendation and Request
- Wednesday: Worldbuilding and Writing
- Friday: Open Thread
- Saturday: Munchkinry

This /should/ take effect in the coming week. I made the changes last night, but forgot that you have to send automod a message to get it to pick up the changes to the wiki page. PM me (or another mod) if there are any problems.

(These changes were based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a99qt2/which_weekly_threads/][this thread]], plus me trying my best to gauge how much activity each thread was getting. I might alter the schedule more, depending on how the next week or two goes.)

Additionally, if you didn't catch it in either of the posts on the subject, the writing challenge is coming to an end, with the final challenge, "Endings", being the next one.
