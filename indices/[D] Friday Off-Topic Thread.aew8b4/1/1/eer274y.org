  The fun thing about this interpretation is what it suggests about what the job of a "Pokemon trainer" really is. You're not a human with pets who puts them through pit-fights. You're a literal coach+manager for self-motivated animal martial-artists, there to 1. feed them the resources and training they need to advance, and 2. act as matchmaker to schedule fights for them as often as possible. When you don't do these things, your Pokemon will get upset, and perhaps demand to be traded away to someone that will. Just like a professional athlete would, in the same situation.

This is basically how I've described what an actual "rational sapient pokemon world" would look like, yeah. And I would love to read a good story like that, though I think it would very quickly break the traditional "fantasy" of pokemon for most traditional fans of the franchise.
