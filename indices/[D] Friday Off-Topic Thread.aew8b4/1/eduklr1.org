I know there are a few well-respected ratfic interpretations of the world of Pokemon here.

Has anyone considered, though, a different treatment of Pokemon: a /xianxia/ treatment?

- Pokemon is a world where humans cannot cultivate†, but certain types of cute, fluffy little animals can.

- The ability to cultivate is what makes these animals "Pokemon" rather than animals. Regular, non-cultivating animals also exist---people and Pokemon both canonically eat animals, but only rarely do either eat Pokemon.

- A Pokemon's "evolution" is simply it moving through the traditional xianxia stages of cultivation (building its foundation, forming its core, etc.), and reshaping its body as it does so.

- Pokemon---at least evolved Pokemon, but perhaps many non-evolved Pokemon as well---are as intelligent as humans. They cannot speak any human language, but they do /have/ intelligible language (judging by some in-setting characters' abilities to interpret for them) which they use to communicate complex thoughts demonstrating a human-like awareness of the world. So they really are cultivating in the sense human cultivators do (i.e. honing their skills and their understanding of the universe.) They're not simply growing in size/power with age like xianxia /demon beasts///spirit beasts/ do.

- As in xianxia, the top cultivation stages are impossible to "stay in" all the time---thus mega-evolution, Z-moves, etc.

- Rare Candies are literally 灵石 (spirit stones/crystals), consumed to increase one's cultivation.

- Various rare materials must be internally refined to enter a new cultivation stage when following a certain Dao. For example, a Moon Stone.

- Pokemon who consciously /consider themselves/ cultivators in the "pass down traditional cultivation arts" + "/noblesse oblige/ to protect the ordinary people of the world" sense, are called Fighting-type Pokemon. In the Pokemon setting, humans have learned various martial arts /from/ these Pokemon, rather than the other way around. It is likely that Fighting-type Pokemon have a whole sect-based martial world going on somewhere.

- Dark-type Pokemon are evil/demonic cultivators. They aren't inherently evil; rather, they are the same "type" as Fighting-type Pokemon, but they have learned a particular cultivation path---a particular Dao---on which they can only advance by committing evil acts. Those that choose to not do evil are abandoning their Dao, and will not grow stronger. There is a natural enmity between Fighting-type and Dark-type Pokemon, just as there is between orthodox and unorthodox cultivators.

- Normal-type Pokemon are a lot like Fighting-type Pokemon in their physical make-up, but they don't have a society and traditions that allows them to share and pass down any fancy qi-manipulation arts. Really, "Fighting-type" should be called "Qi-type"; while "Normal-type" is more deserving to be called "Fighting-type", since regular body-practitioner skills is all they have going for them.

The fun thing about this interpretation is what it suggests about what the job of a "Pokemon trainer" really is. You're not a human with pets who puts them through pit-fights. You're a literal coach+manager for self-motivated animal martial-artists, there to 1. feed them the resources and training they need to advance, and 2. act as matchmaker to schedule fights for them as often as possible. When you /don't/ do these things, your Pokemon will get upset, and perhaps demand to be traded away to someone that /will/. Just like a professional athlete would, in the same situation.

† Well, okay, the gym leaders of the Psychic-type and Fighting-type gyms often /seem/ to be human cultivators, at least in the anime. Maybe there are lots of human cultivators, and they just don't come up much in the life of a Pokemon-obsessed 11-year-old protagonist.
