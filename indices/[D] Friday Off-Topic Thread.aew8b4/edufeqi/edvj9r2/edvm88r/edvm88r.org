  I was hype for amateur batman/ironman, but he basically gets a powerup on a silver platter.

The thing is, Batman/ironman have unspoken tinker and brute powers. No actual human could do what they do, and pretending as if one genius is capable of creating that much advanced technology cheapens the work of the scientists and engineers in the real world. So honestly, I actually prefer properly superpowered heroes, because at least they're honest about the dumb luck that brought them to where they were. That's life-- it's chance that decides your starting position, but it's you that decides what to do with it.
