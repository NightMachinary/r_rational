Lotteries don't pay out for [[http://www.palottery.state.pa.us/Games/How-to-Claim-Your-Prize-Games.aspx][four to six weeks]]. (At least, the first example I found doesn't, and I started with a relatively high prior that others don't either.)

I'm not clear on how quickly you can cash out a stock and actually get liquid cash from it, but I would imagine it's in a period of days. That means that day trading could work, although I believe there are some laws there that would prevent you from getting large amounts of money quickly. The problem with this is that you need money to start the process, and the butterfly effect of your large-scale trading will rapidly invalidate your "future" knowledge.

Another option would be to memorize enough information that you could convince James Randi that you're a precog. [[http://web.randi.org/the-million-dollar-challenge.html][The JREF money gives you $10,000 instantly and the other $990,000 within ten days.]] There will also be check-clearing time on top of that, so you can't collect the money until at least the second half of your loop.

The simplest option, of course, would be crime; if you're smart and careful you can probably manage to not get caught for four weeks. Robbing a jewelry store might be your best bet, as during the day they have relatively low security for the the value. Obviously, you'd need to have one or more well-heeled fence(s) lined up first, since you need to get rid of your stolen goods quickly.
