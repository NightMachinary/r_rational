Work on my memory. Remembering things is going to be key, may as well start with well-known memory techniques.

Political power - learn the plans of a bunch of important groups and how to exploit knowledge of those plans to cause good things - preferably long-term decreases in existential risk.

Money; if you don't end up a billionaire you're not trying.

Time loop theory. These things seem handy, and if it happened once it can happen again. Look into that.

Meta question - how possible is it to iterate research though the time loops? Probably really difficult. Potential fields to try anyhow: AI, intelligence enhancement, helping groups work together better, identifying possible astronomical threats.

Personal skills: it's probably worth it to become very healthy, charismatic, and gain a fashion sense, among other things.

Overall, the money does seem to be what will have the biggest impact.
