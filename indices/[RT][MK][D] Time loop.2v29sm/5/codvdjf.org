First, I figure out how to live in a relative degree of comfort, so that I can avoid stress while planning.

Second, I begin to work on fixing my psychological issues. Human minds aren't built for eternity, or repetition. I do not want to go insane or become suicidal. I want to be happy and content. I also want to avoid boredom.

Third, I begin making and executing plans for enjoying myself and improving myself and learning. Also, I investigate the time loop itself.

This continues indefinitely or until I learn what caused the time loop, at which time my plans might change. I might eventually decide to end the time loop, but from my current standpoint that seems like it will take a very very long time.
