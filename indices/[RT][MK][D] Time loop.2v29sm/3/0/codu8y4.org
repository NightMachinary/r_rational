The loop causes muscle memory and regular memory to be preserved just as well as if you had just went on to the next day after the loop. Additionally, when the loop occurs it has the same effects for memory and cognitive processes as a full night's rest (converts short-term memory to long-term memory, and you awaken at the beginning of the time loop feeling refreshed).
