As a past thread has shown, a decent number of people on this thread have password codes for timeloops. A couple of loops (or a couple dozen) on each person, and I can hopefully convince them to give me their passwords and gain their help at the beginning of each loop with just a word. I'll also use some of the money from the lottery trick to reward them for their help.

Also, how much muscle memory is preserved from loop to loop? How will regular memory hold up? Fiction takes this stuff for granted, but I am going to test it in detail before I figure out what to do next.
