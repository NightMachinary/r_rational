First, find a simple way to get a lot of money in the first few days so that you are free to do as you want, then spend the rest of the month doing long-term research and study.

I'd recommend scratch-and-win lottery tickets for tens of thousands of dollars, but I'm not sure what would be the best thing to research, especially since you can't carry notes across loops.
