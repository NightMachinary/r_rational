Hm. I guess you could spend a few loops trying to find some acceptable high cash victim to rob. It's not /nice/, but if you can't some more victimless approach to getting rich quick it might have to do for a while. Credit card fraud, perhaps. Again, you might need to experiment a bit before you find a way to make millions at the beginning of a loop.
