Quantum states being reset each time escalate into major parts of the macroscopic events of that month being reset each time. Who you come across in the street changes every time, so every time you're cycling through new situations where there is some probability of you getting in a fatal accident which you can't figure out in advance because the probability is determined by quantum-mechanical effects.
