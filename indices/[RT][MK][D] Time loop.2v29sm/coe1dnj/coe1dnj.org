How does the time loop interact with quantum mechanics? The weather is determined by the results of quantum interactions from as little as a week ago, depending on where you live, and I'm sure there are other chaotic systems that escalate even sooner - like human minds. Even if the world would always do the same quantum things until you show up - if that's even a coherent concept - then your actions might still randomise events every time because you change the world every time you decide to do something different in it.

So the predictability might break down rather quickly after the first few days, in which case over the course of numerous cycles random events like car accidents and perhaps even embolisms and heart attacks become decidedly nontrivial risks, and tasks like predicting the lottery become impossible. This would make many objectives here inadvisable, because after 10^{4} repeats there's a decent chance that you'll be dead.

Disregarding that, academically, you can do searches of (non-quantum) search fields for which you can remember a way to break up the search field into the same ordered list of sub-searches which take less than a month to perform, your current position on that list, and the results.

Assuming you're young enough that your brain is flexible, you can also train skills over the course of an arbitrary number of cycles, get the results in that field, and then train the next skill with no harm to forgetting anything but the results.

You should therefore be able to solve the protein folding problem, room temperature superconductivity, probably the Grand Theory of Everything (assuming enough data can be collected on earth, given your eventually perfect knowledge of cosmic rays that hit the earth that month), perhaps technical stuff like AI and airplanes and fusion reactors (though the 'remembering' load of that is kind of big).

AI seems the most important, to me. So the solution is to find a reasonably trustworthy AI research team (nudge nudge, wink wink), and work with them to first become an AI expert, then to make it so you remember better and more important insights each time. I wouldn't expect this to converge before finding the actual answer, so if a solution exists, it would be found.
