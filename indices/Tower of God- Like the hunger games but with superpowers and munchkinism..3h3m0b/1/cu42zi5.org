I read everything available a few years back, and have been thinking of reading all the new stuff.

It's really, /really/ good. The world is huge, the story is long, and it keeps getting longer. I wouldn't say it's very munchkiny, but it's certainly full of intelligent (and dickish) characters. Everyone has motives, too. None of that evil for evil's sake. It's a great read. It will also grate on you in a few years when you remember how good it was but don't want to dedicate a week to rereading but you don't even remember where you left it last time.
