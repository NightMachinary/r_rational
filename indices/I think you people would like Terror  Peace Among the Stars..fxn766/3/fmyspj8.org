It's pretty good. It seems to be slightly out of tune with how 40K power scaling between factions should work, but then again everything in the franchise has its own interpretation of /that/ horrible mess.

There are some interesting plot points regarding antimemes, souls, and philosophical zombies, but it can be a bit hard to follow in places. I had to reorient myself by reading an author's note in the thread at one point when things were getting a little /too/ high concept and I couldn't follow what they were trying to portray with the in-character perspectives on philosophy.

The fact that it's a sequel to another fanfic threw me off as well, because to be frank some of the stuff that came from the previous fic just seems ridiculous [[https://Inquisitors_helped_turn_a_genestealer_into_the_Chaos_Goddess_of_Friendship_apparently][spoilers here]], but that setup does work well with some of the philosophical ideas that were discussed.
