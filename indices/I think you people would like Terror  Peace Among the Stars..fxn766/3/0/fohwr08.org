That 'spoiler here' thing didn't happen (interesting way of making a spoiler, haven't seen it before), Amica's origins as far as the story is concerned is said right at the start in Hope and Silence so you can read that without reading the rest if you don't want to, the comment about "genestealers make terrible parents" was about a different later thing.
