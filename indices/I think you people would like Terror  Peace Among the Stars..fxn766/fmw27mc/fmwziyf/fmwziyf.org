Yeah I've read that one fully too. You might wanna read the one this story is a sequel to too, I'm not sure I'd call it rational though, atleast comparatively and it's not nessesary to this one, it's still a good story and there's a few places where this story investigates questions that the first raised but sort of glossed over. It's called Hope and Silence in the Hive.
