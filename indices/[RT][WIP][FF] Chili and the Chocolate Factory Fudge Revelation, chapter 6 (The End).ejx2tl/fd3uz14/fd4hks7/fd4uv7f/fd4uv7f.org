But last we saw of him, he wasn't crushed. The sixth ticket hasn't even been won yet. There's a scene missing.

Obviously, this is the point, we're being robbed of a satisfying marble, etc, but I wonder what the point of the point is. There is a clear and deliberate parallel between Charlie Bucket and the author. They wrote a whole tirade about how him doing a thing makes him an awful person, and then did that exact thing. Why make the people reading this into a billion losers, so to speak? Why write a story where you, yourself, are the villain? Why /not/ just do literally anything else with your time?

Reading back over this, it sounds like I'm upset, but I'm honestly more confused than anything.
