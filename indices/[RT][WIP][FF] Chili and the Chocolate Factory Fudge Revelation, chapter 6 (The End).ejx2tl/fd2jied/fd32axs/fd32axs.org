It does kinda bring up an interesting dichotomy between the audience of a fiction and the audience of a news story.

Like out here in the real world, everyone /knows/ that Wonka's factory is a mystical, questionable wonderland - but in the fiction, nobody actually knows what's going on in there. We all know about the tour that the original five went on - but in the fiction, unless someone wrote a tell-all book afterwards, the only thing anyone would know about is the resulting injuries.

We all have an expectation (because this is a fiction) to eventually know the full details and inner lives of the characters involved; but if this were a news story, it would cut out at some point and the rest would remain a mystery.
