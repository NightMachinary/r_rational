The best comparison I can think of is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmFfTJlIvhQ][Lucy and the football]]. At a certain point, it's Charlie Brown's fault. Like, what the hell did you expect man, put that pattern recognition to work.

I can't remember when, but after a certain point reading these stories I figured that if I was going to keep reading and enjoying I'd have to make peace with the fact that I'd be eating a lot of shit. And I think I've made that peace at this point. Given the chance to go back in time and stop myself from reading this, or any of Korridor I wouldn't do it. But, still. Good grief.

At one point, Teddy compared their stories to the opposite of pearls before swine, and I thought that was very apt. We're surrounded by pearls. We're drowning in pearls. Pearls are being produced at a fast enough rate that I could spend the rest of my life doing nothing but consuming pearls and not catch up. I'm several chapters or volumes or episodes or gameplay-hours on loads of pearls right now, but damn if I'm not reading this shit the moment I know it's available.
