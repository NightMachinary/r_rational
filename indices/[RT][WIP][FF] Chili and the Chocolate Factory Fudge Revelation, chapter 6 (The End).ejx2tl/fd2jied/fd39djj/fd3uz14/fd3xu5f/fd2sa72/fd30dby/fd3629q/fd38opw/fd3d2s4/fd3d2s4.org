Link? I can't find any reference to a story of that name existing.

EDIT: I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/b95r0w/ship_poster_by_teddyteddyteddy/][this]] referencing "Sludge Preformation" but all links in the thread are dead so I'm not really sure what anybody is talking about.

EDIT2: Found [[http://webfictionguide.com/listings/game-by-god-sludge-reformation/][this]] but again no working links. Checked Wayback Machine but whatever "korridor.rip" was it seems to be blocked from archival.

EDIT3: Found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvlxwu/what_happened_to_game_by_god_and_monsters_and/][this thread]] with a bit more info.
