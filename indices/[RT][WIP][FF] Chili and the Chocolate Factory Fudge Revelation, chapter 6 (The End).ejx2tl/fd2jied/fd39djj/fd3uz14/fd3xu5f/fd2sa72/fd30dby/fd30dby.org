I never thought I'd ever read something that would make me genuinely go '/oh wow/' in, uh, six chapters. What an excellent ending, lmao. Definitely not the one I was expecting, but it's the one that makes the most sense, and quite possibly the best, most "realistic" take on the original Willy Wonka challenge I never thought I'd see.

"The point is not to make one winner but a billion losers" is /especially/ poignant. Who thought about the millions of disappointed young boys and girls spending all of their cash on chocolate bars to win some absurd candy lottery in the original book? /All/ of that tragedy and heartbreak, all those tears shed when the final golden ticket was found by some nothing kid who didn't put in near as much 'effort' as you or your friends did? Certainly not Dahl. When you put it in /that/ perspective, Wonka turns into a genuine fucking monster, lmao. Just, /mwah./

(Of course, 'that's not what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was about,' but this /is/ a ratfic after all. Exploring aspects of the source material that were underappreciated and taking them to their logical conclusion is the entire point!)

My only gripe with this story is that I feel like the medium fundamentally takes a bit of oomph out of the ending -- seeing it marked as COMPLETE in six chapters when, IMO, /expecting/ another chapter and /not getting one/ because 'we're the losers' makes up a substantial part of the impact. But I guess if I saw a fic this short that did such a great job of worldbuilding and setting up a premise within its first two chapters, I'd be intrigued to see how it could "properly end" (lol) so abruptly. YMMV, I suppose.

And as a bit of a sidetrack I suppose, I found it pretty funny that the girl introduced last chapter would be the most likely to 'win' the Bucket challenge by force of narrative convention, as opposed to our seeming protagonist in Chili. Shy, likely good-hearted, with loving parents -- prime protagonist material. (Though I'd imagine Chili shoving her into a chocolate river or something when nobody was looking.)
