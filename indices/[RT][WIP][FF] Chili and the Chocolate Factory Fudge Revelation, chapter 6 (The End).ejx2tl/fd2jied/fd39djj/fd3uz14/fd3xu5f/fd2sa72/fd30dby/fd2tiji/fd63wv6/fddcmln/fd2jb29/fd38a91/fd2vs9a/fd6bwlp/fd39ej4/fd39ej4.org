EDIT: STREAM NO LONGER LIVE, THANKS FOR JOINING! We had a lot of [[https://imgur.com/a/25G0DQI][fun]] and might do more r/r related streams in the future.

+PRO TIP: We're still having a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ejgkla/d_friday_open_thread/fcycjiq/][Roald Dahl movie stream]] today at 3PM EST (so a little over 3 hours from this post), but it'll be more of a Chili wrap-up party than a comprehensive stream, I guess. You're all encouraged to join.+
