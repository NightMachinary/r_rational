Question for anyone still here:

Assuming this /is/ the final ending, do you think that gaizemaze is using this last conversation to paint themselves as Bucket, laughing at us for having the audicity to want to LIKE something and KNOW something?

Or do you think they're painting themselves as JUROR, choosing to end the story before common sense would dictate because they believe it makes a better story?

I'm having a hard time deciding.

On the one hand, the reference to JUROR is almost explicitly applicable as the author trying to defend themselves against the accusation of doing the same thing Bucket is.

On the other, the derision 5Gpants directs at Bucket for not giving any answer to /his/ riddle is just as applicable to the author of this work for getting us invested in the same riddle and then not giving us an answer either.

I keep re-reading it and flip-flopping back and forth between the two positions. Is the author trying to crush the marble by not revealing the answer, or to just make a better marble by ending the story?
