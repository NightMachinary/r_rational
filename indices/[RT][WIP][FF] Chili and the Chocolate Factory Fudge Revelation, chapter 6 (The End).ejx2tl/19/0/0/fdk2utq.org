But why?

Let's take it line by line.

#+begin_quote
  5Gpants: so imagine being a person who figures this shit out
#+end_quote

The rent is /about/ the author having figured this shit (the reason people are so satisfied with a story that comes to a well-planned conclusion that reveals all its secrets) out. Check.

#+begin_quote
  5Gpants: and imagine having the power to make those little marbles

  5Gpants: and you go and say, you know what

  5Gpants: i'm going to make little marbles on purpose
#+end_quote

This story is a "little marble" as defined in the rant. Check.

#+begin_quote
  5Gpants: and i'm going to get people to like them

  5Gpants: and i'm going to get people to like them a lot
#+end_quote

There's been a shit-ton of excited discussion of the Bucket Riddle in this sub. Check.

#+begin_quote
  5Gpants: and then i'm going to take the marble, right before that feeling of understanding can come, like right right right before
#+end_quote

Had this been a traditional story (e.g. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), the next thing that would have happened would have either been Chillenial Lee solving the puzzle, or Chili doing the same. The former was planning to reveal the secret behind the solution; the latter is our POV character and would have had to solve the riddle in front of us.

Chapter 5 ends "right right right before" the Bucket solution was going to be revealed. Check.

#+begin_quote
  5Gpants: and i'm going to crush it
#+end_quote

This chapter, being the end of a work tagged as "completed," tells us that we're never going to get an answer to the Bucket riddle. Check.

I can make an argument for why gaizemaze /is/ Bucket, or why he /is/ JUROR, but not for why he /isn't/ one or the other. I can't even think of an argument for why there's necessarily a distinction between the two.

So, why, then? Why do you think he's JUROR and not Bucket?
