I think it's a story about a boy getting invested in something he has no chances of solving, and what's the better point to end the story on than the moment when his newfound hope to win the lottery is crushed?

Of course, it's Teddy's work, and so there's meta layer about getting the readers invested in the universe we have no chances of seeing fully, because we know it's Teddy and it's going to end abruptly. However, I'm not sure if this meta layer is the main one, or if it's just being used as a means to put us in the shoes of Chili and the rest of approximately 7 billion losers better, because it feels to me the core theme is the danger of lottery narratives and, worse, lottery narratives masking themselves as something you have actual input on.
