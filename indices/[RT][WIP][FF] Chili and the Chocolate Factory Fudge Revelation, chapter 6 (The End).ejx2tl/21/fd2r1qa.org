I rather enjoy this ending if that is what it is. The recent trend in fictions that play with the audience is enjoyable. It really shows a fickle and playful attitude from the author.

My only dislike with this series is that it doesn't work as well read aloud as the original Dahl books did. It's mostly the chatroom sequences that throw this out. I see their purpose, especially when they dictate the audience feelings, they just don't read aloud well and even feel a bit clunky in my head. Likely my personal bias showing.
