It's unusual so I like that. When you read so much fiction another story even if good is routine.

I imagine it's how film critics feel when they like weird movies that no one else likes. Points for interesting.

As of yet this is meta stuff is not an overdone genre for me.

But I guess I'm less annoyed because I knew there was a chance and because I have an optimistic outlook when things go bad.
