At least half the reason I like the ending rant is that it matches pretty closely to my experience. I've been off-and-on suicidal for probably half my life, and while that's gotten better in some ways over the years it's also gotten worse in other ways.

5Gpants really captures how I feel about marbles some of the time, and while 5Gpants isn't real, they were written by somebody who /is/ real; and while I know, on a rational level, that my experiences are not unique and there are many people who have or had a situation analogous to my own, the effect of that is nothing like the effect of knowing that /this particular person/, in order to write 5Gpants, had to be able to at least /imagine/ what it's like to feel these things, and that this particular person /can/ (though they won't, because we likely won't ever talk with each other) say, "I feel this. You are known."

EDIT: I also appreciate that the author effectively telegraphed "This story won't be finished" in the first chapter and, in that light, actually did more to "complete" the story than I actually expected. I thought the story would just go on hiatus forever until it was mysteriously deleted one day, but instead we got a closing device which at least attempts to capture something interesting (i.e. the outside perspective of the ordinary person who will never know what happens inside the factory).
