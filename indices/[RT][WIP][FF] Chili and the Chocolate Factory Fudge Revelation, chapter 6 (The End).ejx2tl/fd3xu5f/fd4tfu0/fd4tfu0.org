I don't particularly understand what's so good about this ending that leaving people impressed. Apparently this author is known for doing things like this?

The message of "fiction ignores the boring and bad aspects of the real world" isn't particularly deep. A twist isn't good if it takes your story somewhere less interesting than its original trajectory.
