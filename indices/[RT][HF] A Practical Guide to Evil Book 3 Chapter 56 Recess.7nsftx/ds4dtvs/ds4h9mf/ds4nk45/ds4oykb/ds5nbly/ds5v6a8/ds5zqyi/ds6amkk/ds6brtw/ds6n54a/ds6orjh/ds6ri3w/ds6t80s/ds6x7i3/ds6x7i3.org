  I mean, what else would you be looking for? Cat's not going to come out and say "On reflection, I'm pretty sure my world has more gay and ace people than some hypothetical alternate world I've never heard of."

Ok that actually made me laugh. No of course not. It being a coincidence felt really off to me, as I said in the other comment, so I wanted some way of letting the reader know that they were more common because it being a plot point didn't make any sense at all. It could be that it is more common for Named to be lgbtq+ for whatever reason, maybe just because it's yet another quirk, and that would be fine because most of the relationships we know of are among Named, and if it's exclusive to Named that's a way to comment on it, or it could be that they are actually more common among the whole of the populace, in which case having a high lord make some incredibly crass comment about repopulation problems due to people's sexuality preventing them from participating, and Cat 'educating' him with her sword would be funny as all heck.
