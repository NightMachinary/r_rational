OK, so that's a different argument than "chance doesn't play a hand because it's a rationalist work." That argument didn't make sense because it's typically /irrational/ to assume that nothing is coincidental. Your position now is that chance can't play a hand because the setting is explicitly built on story tropes, right?

I would argue that just because story tropes are built into the setting does not mean that coincidences cannot exist in that setting. The serial's various LGBT+ characters aren't native to Arcadia, their characteristics and actions aren't 100% dictated by story. /Their/ world seems to operate as a sort of hybrid of realism and tropes, wherein tropes can be applied to existing scenarios to push them toward a desired outcome. I don't see that as mutually exclusive with "statistical anomalies that are just statistical anomalies and not some kind of plot clue."

We also have to consider that the tropes we've seen affect outcomes in this setting are of the grand, deeply-ingrained, mythologically significant sort. The rule of three, the theft of fire, the slaying of the maiden-killing beast, etc. I'm not aware of any trope of similar weight that relates to an improbable concentration of non-heterosexual folks playing an influential role in the protagonist's struggle.
