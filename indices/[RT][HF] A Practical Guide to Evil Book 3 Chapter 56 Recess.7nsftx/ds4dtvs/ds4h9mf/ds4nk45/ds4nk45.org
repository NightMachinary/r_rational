I feel it could go either way. Masego always struck me as asexual, in the sense that he simply doesn't even think about sex or romance unless it's in an academic sense, let alone desire it. Archer though is very obviously a sexual creature, and she's getting Masego to grow closer to her. It's possible that this will lead to him developing feelings for her, kinda like how Warlock is seemingly a sociopath but still developed feelings for a select few individuals (Black, Sabah, his husband, his son).
