Well, I certainly wouldn't trust Warlock to resurrect Nauk.

On that note, it's kinda disappointing how crazy the Calamities are. It seems like they're all willing to kill her to save Black, yet she's precisely what he wanted - a worthy successor who shares his methodology. Trying to kill her is like spitting in his face.

Don't get me wrong, it's good to see they're flawed people despite their power, it's just... what are they trying to achieve? Either come to terms with Black's death or legitimately try to kill her. Making threats achieves nothing. Is the narrative causing some of this conflict? It's like they're throwing a tantrum cause the story isn't going their way, yet they're not actually willing to change it.

On the final note, I hope when Cat picks up a new Name it will accommodate the Winter power. Becoming a fae, even partially, would be a huge disadvantage considering how often she depends on changing the narrative to win.
