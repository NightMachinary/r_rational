I don't think Warlock is going to intentionally do a shit job restoring Nauk, since it was Masego who asked him to do this and if he wanted to be a dick to his own son he could have just said no. But I wouldn't be surprised if he snuck some kind of Trojan horse bullshit into him to use against Catherine later.
