I don't think there's a single person left in Black's entourage that doesn't hate Catherine for what she is. Sabah liked anyone that joined their pseudo-family, everyone else considered Cat a mortal threat to their leader from the moment she took the Squire's mantle. Warlock and Ranger are simply more outspoken on that matter than Scribe, Assassin or the Dread Empress.

They aren't wrong either, evil characters killing their mentor is Career Planning 101. Doubly so for someone like Warlock who got his Name this way.
