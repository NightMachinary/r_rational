Not really. Warlock never liked Cat because he always had suspicions that the story between Cat and Black will end with Cat killing Black. All this time to the Warlock it seemed to be a far off concern. Sabah's death and Black's behavior splashed a metaphorical bucket of cold water in his face. So now he realizes it's a very, very real possibility. That and he and Black both are still very raw over Sabah's death. He's not thinking straight at the moment.
