Unless Cat gets a surprise first strike that's fatal, Warlock would win every encounter. And I highly doubt Warlock is ever without some kind of magical protection up. Warlock has more power, more experience, more ruthlessness, more range... pretty much all Cat has is better melee skills and strong (but fickle) Winter power.

... one possible way she could win would be *Speak*ing to Warlock and commanding him to kill himself. Or even to stand still long enough for her to decapitate him. Or by Black telling her what his Warlock contingency plan would be, and her following that.

Hm. Guess I revise my estimates to 8/10 for Warlock, 2/10 for Cat, and 11/10 with rice.
