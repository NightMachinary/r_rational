Haha, rice. Yeah you're right. But in that enclosed tent in close quarters inside Cat's own camp with all of The Woe (sans Thief) and Black merely a few feet away?

Situation wise that would not be a curbstomp battle though Warlock might win if he disrupted the spell structure around Cat's soul but that wouldn't kill Cat instantly and in those precious few seconds she's still alive she literally has the full power of a Princess level Fae. She also has TAKE and BREAK.

So why wouldn't she simply imbue all that power into her aspect BREAK and BREAK the Warlock's Name before she bit it? Its already been shown that you can write "instructions" on Names which is what Cat did with the Lone Swordsman when she just a regular non Fae titled transitional Squire and the Lone Swordsman was a fully realized Name.

It stands to reason that she could BREAK the Warlock's name with the full power of Winter at her behest.

Those odds are only applicable if Warlock is calm (which he is not at that moment) and prepared (I hazard a guess not as well as he should be for a Named like Cat).

I put it at 10/10 for a mutual kill.
