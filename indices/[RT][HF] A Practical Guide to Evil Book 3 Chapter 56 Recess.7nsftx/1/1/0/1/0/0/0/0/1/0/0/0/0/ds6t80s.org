Does having a ton of named LGBT+ characters, and nobody in-universe finding that unusual enough to comment upon, not count as "showing"? Not that I'd have any issue with it just being a coincidence, but if you wanted to interpret it as a sign that non-hetero orientations are more common in this 'verse, I think there's enough there to support that conclusion.

I mean, what else would you be looking for? Cat's not going to come out and say "On reflection, I'm pretty sure my world has more gay and ace people than some hypothetical alternate world I've never heard of."
