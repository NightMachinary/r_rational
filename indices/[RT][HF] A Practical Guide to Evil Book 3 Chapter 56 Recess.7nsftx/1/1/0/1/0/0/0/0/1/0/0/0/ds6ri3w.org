Because the reader is from Earth. Unless otherwise shown, things are implied to work the same as on earth, take the figurative language in almost any chapter, or the example that sticks out to me the most being when Cat is commenting on Laurean fisherman's sons having rocking swimmers bods, which we assume is referring to muscle toneing and not the acquisition of say a fish head and gills. I was asking that it be otherwise shown.
