Doesn't it? Aren't statistical anomalies a feature of any realistic setting? Doesn't rationalism deal with chance and probability? If anything, isn't it more believable that some things are just a coincidence than that /every/ statistical anomaly must have an explanation?

You seem to believe that it's a flaw in the work for an apparent statistical anomaly (assuming, perhaps erroneously, that heterosexuality is as dominant in this setting as it is in ours) to exist without being a piece of the greater puzzle somehow, and I don't understand why. A rational approach to our own universe requires accepting that some things are just a coincidence; I'm pretty sure assigning undue significance to improbable outcomes is a typical example of irrationality in rationalist discourse. So why doesn't that apply here?
