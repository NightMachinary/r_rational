  OK, so that's a different argument than "chance doesn't play a hand because it's a rationalist work." That argument didn't make sense because it's typically irrational to assume that nothing is coincidental. Your position now is that chance can't play a hand because the setting is explicitly built on story tropes, right?

My position hasn't changed I'm just doing a crap job at representing it because I'm distracted IRL but trying to keep conversation active while it's still relevant. I was trying to get at chance not being a device the author uses because the reader is expected to come to the same conclusions as the characters, as well as there being little room for chance within the narrative due to stories, but clearly missed the buck both times I tried to type it out lol.

You have a point actually, thank you. I think I was confused by the token gay character trope (but that doesn't normally have a narrative impact does it?), and assuming that nothing is ever a coincidence with master planers because 'nothing is a coincidence with master planners'. It felt really awkward to have that opinion, hence why i spoke up about something so minor. I haven't really had much time to mull over it all, I just got caught up.
