Will there be an attempt to explain why this is so in the story? The statistical anomaly of this many characters having a different orientation is unsettling in a story where you should be actively analysing for all sorts of things. It's an out of place red herring IMO. What someone could make of it I have no clue, but it sticks out like a sore thumb and distracts the reader from the rest of the story if they pick up on it. It could be something as simple as 'Named are quirky, and orientation is definitely something that sticks out, and it's super well know or whatever' and it would be fine i think, and if someone is still bothered by it that's sadly probably got nothing to do with reason.

An admirable thing to do and I'm actually enjoying seeing this in characters, and learning what it means for their personality or whatever makes me put my phone down and think at the time, but it's my biggest issue with the story so far and it could be smoothed over with an offhand comment.

Also, just picked up the story in early December and holy crap is it awesome! This is a genuine inspiration to me, I'm just not sure what to do with that because I'm not inspired often. Keep up the awesome, at this point if you stop the story I might die!
