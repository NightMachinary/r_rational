Allosexuals can have platonic friendships too, though. Archer could be pursuing that with him (even if she wouldn't say no to a romantic/sexual relationship if he were interested). I see it as a developing close friendship, potentially as intimate and meaningful as a romance without being one.

This might be wishful thinking on my part. I know that there are people in real life who are just /mostly/ asexual or aromantic. And in the future, when the general population is aware that ace/aro people exist and aren't just broken, frigid, sociopathic, etc, it would be cool to see characters all along those spectra represented in fiction. But right now seeing /any/ ace/aro representation is rare, and having Archer turn out to be an "exception" to Masego's orientation would kind of undermine it here. We already hear "you just need to find the right person" constantly, and a canonical romance between Masego and Archer would essentially validate that frustrating stereotype (edit: but only if it involved sex, romance alone doesn't undermine asexuality).
