In single combat, I'd bet on Warlock eight times out of ten. Ten times, if he actually plans it instead of blindly lashing out.

Cat has raw power, but Warlock has more as well as decades of practice using that power in combat. I'm pretty sure Cat isn't yet at the level where she can survive things that level cities or topple mountains.

Now, if Black and/or Masego get involved (on Catherine's side) that'd be something different...
