I wouldn't agree with the no build up line. Tension had been present (from the Warlock's side at least) from the moment Cat became Black's Squire and took up the Squire Name. It increased and became mutual when Warlock threatened Cat and now with this it has intensified. Powder Kegs have been filled and gathered. All it takes now is the Spark.
