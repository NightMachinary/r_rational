Depends on the starting conditions.

There, in the tent, in melee range? /Cat/ all the way.

She simply needs to invoke any of her Three Aspects while drawing her sword. All his complicated magical wards and such are (broken/cease functioning for a time/have their control subverted) for the fraction of the second it takes for her to decapitate him. I think this is one reason he didn't push it or try to attack her in any way, honestly.

In any other situation, involving just the two of them? Warlock, 100%. If Warlock has time to prepare for you, he's going to win.

If there's a situation where there is so much as audio communication available between her and Black? Cat, again, because Black will stop Warlock, even if only as a distraction for her to finish him, though quite likely as part of one of his contingency plans.
