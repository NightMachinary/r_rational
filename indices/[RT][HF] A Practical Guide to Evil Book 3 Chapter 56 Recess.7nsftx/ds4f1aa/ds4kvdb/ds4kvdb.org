I think in terms of pure destructive power, Warlock is far superior to Cat. At the same time, Cat has a lot of skills which are directed at single strong opponents (such as Take).

Honestly, it would probably depend on how long it takes to break down Cat's soul. If it takes little effort, she would be boned. If it takes significant effort I would bet on her to win, assuming Break works on sorcery.
