There's no way he DIDN'T do that. Remember it's been shown that he has a vindictive streak as he toyed with the other Calamities. Draining Black's wine, messing with Ranger's tea etc. With them it was all good natured fun.

Now, however, he's very pissed off at Cat and he is a confirmed sociopath in the perfect position to screw Nauk up in a way that wouldn't be immediately apparent to Masego (despite his upgrade Masego is still not on Warlock's level when it comes to Arcane knowledge) but would trigger in a situation where it would hurt Cat the most. It's not like he'd lose anything in the attempt. Black wouldn't be overly pissed at him and Masego wouldn't go against his father over Nauk (for Cat maybe but definitely not Nauk).

Such an act is completely in character for him.
