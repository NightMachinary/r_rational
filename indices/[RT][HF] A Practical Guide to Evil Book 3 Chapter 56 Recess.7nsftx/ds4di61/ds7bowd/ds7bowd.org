Am I the only one who is pissed at Black for not instilling the big picture into his peers? Bonus points to commentators coming from a Leadership/Management/Mentoring perspective. Black has done a lot right in building up the Calamities, except he knows villains die, and they all seem rather fragile to his mortality, which seems a pretty big leadership fail.
