FanFicBias decided to try writing a few chapters of a rational Shikamaru in the regular canon setting of Naruto, hence the first three chapters. I assume that FanFicBias liked what he wrote and chose to leave up those chapters while he restarted all over again on chapter four. Think of chapters 1-3 as a proof of concept with all later chapters as the actual project.
