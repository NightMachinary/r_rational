I just want to drop in again and say that these are among my favourite stories, without qualification.

The stakes feel real. The characters feel /real/ (and like real adults, not real kids or teenagers). The trauma and loss... also feels pretty real. It's often both painful and cathartic to read, so I usually wait for a clear morning, but love it all the more for waiting.

Thanks again - I'm looking forward to more :-)
