Aww, thank you :) The first couple of books do start out a lot slower, and lower-stakes (I like how it /slowly/ builds up to "the entire future humanity is at stake.") And, yeah, one of the things I've enjoyed most is taking the premise of a really super weird setting and exploring all the implications of it!
