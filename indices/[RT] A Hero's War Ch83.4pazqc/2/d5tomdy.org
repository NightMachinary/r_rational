This is a story I really enjoy reading! I have a nitpick: Noether's theorem states that conservation of energy is related to the time translation symmetry, not the time reversal symmetry as is suggested in the text. So if energy is not conserved, Cato should be on the lookout for something working on one day that doesn't work the same way the next day, even though everything about the experimental setup is the same. (Of course, possibly Cato is just remembering Noether's theorem incorrectly.)
