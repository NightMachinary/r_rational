I've tried starting this story once but the first arc was rather underwhelming: the giant worm thing had a striking resemblance with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremors_%28film%29#Plot][/1990 Tremors/]] beasts, the non-humans were portrayed as rather dumb (e.g. they've never figured out that it would be targetting them by movement), etc.

Does the story get better later on, and if it does --- from which chapter would you recommend reading it?
