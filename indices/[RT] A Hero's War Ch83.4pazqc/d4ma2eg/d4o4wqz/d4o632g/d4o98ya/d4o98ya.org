Your link is broken, I think you tried to use spoiler tagging but did it wrong.

First, I will say that I really enjoy this story and it's definitely in the top 3 stories I'm following right now. However, I think the pacing and writing have gotten a bit worse in the past few chapters. There's a bit less detail being put in to events and concepts, and some of the writing is a bit confusing, especially the scenes involving relationships and some of the recent letters.

I am worried that your world's expansion and change might be as difficult for you to keep up with as it is for its citizens, maybe even more so. It's really interesting seeing all these new developments and plot lines, but it would be sad to lose the quality and level of detail of the previous arcs.

Anyway, thanks for writing this great story, and I hope you continue! I'm always looking forward to the next chapter
