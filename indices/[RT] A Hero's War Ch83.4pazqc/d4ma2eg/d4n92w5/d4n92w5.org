I love your story alot! Keep it up! Though i have some question in mind. Do Cato have plans to issue a new currency for Minmay bank?

I love to hear more about this as in the past banks helps safeguard money for merchants travelling from one place to another without the risk of transporting large amount of coins (e.g. Minmay -> Corbin) to do transaction. Coins such as Rime and Telins takes time and resources to be minted. Banks plays a huge role in financing new technology that Cato is churning out and as the cost grows, Credit is needed to finance large projects. Banks could be used as a diplomatic edge for foreign relations (e.g. World Bank/IMF/AIIB). Providing loans and aids may ease talks and bring advantage to Minmay. I'm Excited to see how Minmay becomes a gamechanger in terms of Inath's progress, politics & technology!
