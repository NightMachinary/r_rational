Hi there, I'm the author of this story. Quite surprised to see it here! And honoured. Never thought this matched the writing style I expected of this sub (given that I've read HPMoR and SD, and Three Worlds Collide).

I must admit that I certainly did not write this story with the same level of planning that had to go into stories like Mother of Learning (much less SD or equivalent). While I do have a clear idea of the magic system; the culture, characters and even plot aren't charted out to the level of detail in those stellar examples. Sorry about that. /bows/ Also, a large part of the story 'runs' like a simulation. I look at what previously happened, then crank time forwards a little and write down what I think would happen. I know this doesn't bode well for a coherent storyline and I have had to delay introduction of a number of important plot points, but we'll get there. (this practice also generated a few plot lines, eg. Morey's slave rebellion never appeared in my notes until Wind of Hope when I realized what his reaction would be when he got to Illastein)

Yes, I do admit that the first arc is easily the weakest arc. If I was re-writing, I would merge the first and second, ditching the tremor attack. Some of the interactions might change, Banage might eye Cato more as a chess piece than someone useful, but ultimately almost nothing changes.\\
(tremors need to exist for a different reason, there's a magic system clue hidden in it, so I can't scratch the monster entirely; although I am questioning the necessity of that section of the magic system)

If you wanted to skip it, I suggest reading chapters 1, 2, 4, then the Cato's Notes 1 and continue from there. 4 is especially important.

Reading previous threads, regarding the character voice in letters: I understand that Cato and Morey sound the same. It is a known weakness of mine, that characters don't really have a distinct voice beyond rough archetypes, and that section could do with some re-writing. Well, many sections need re-writing.
