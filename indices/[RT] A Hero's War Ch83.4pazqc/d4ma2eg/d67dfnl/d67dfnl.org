When I first saw the description of the Tremor's internal anatomy and method of attack I quickly guessed the following, which has had more low-key support in other matters revealed gradually over the course of the story. I'll spoiler it on the chance that I've stumbled upon the right answer.

All in all I'm really enjoying this one. It reads to me as great worldbuilding and logically thought-through fantasy written from the general perspective of classic science fiction.

I like how it takes a very even-handed perspective on things, showing that while technological progression and industrialization are ultimately positive things, some of the consequences of it are not so good, and the heroes have brought with them some of the nastier aspects of Earth's history as well as the good things. And the main characters sometimes make decisions that I don't really agree with, but that's really interesting too, since you've created situations where the calls really aren't obvious. And it takes into account the sense that very few things are completely one-sided, which is something I don't see in a lot of stories.
