Thank you very much for your praise! I have to admit however that the magic system received far more development than the worldbuilding.

In fact, the magic system predates the plotline of the story by nearly two years RL. (I have used the same magic system in my other fantasy writings, the only published one being Twin Faces of the Sky which is incomplete)

I welcome your speculation on the mechanics of tremors but will neither confirm nor deny the correctness of it. To have someone speculating on the mechanics of my magic system is awesome! So awesome that I won't give away the answer so you can do it some more! =P
