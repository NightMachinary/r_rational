Thank you for the story. From the amount of details given in the story, I'd wager simulating the universe must be a very enjoyable mind game, if one is capable of playing it.

  If I was re-writing, I would merge the first and second, ditching the tremor attack (tremors need to exist for a different reason, there's a magic system clue hidden in it, so I can't scratch the monster entirely; although I am questioning the necessity of that section of the magic system).

I'd suggest at least leaving Cato to stumble upon a dead tremor in the first chapters for discovering their strange internal structure. It gives the readers a nice riddle to be thinking over while advancing in the story ([[#s][e.g.]]).

Here are two additional suggestions in case you'll eventually decide to re-write or re-use this story:

- I feel like the medieval society managed to adapt way too quickly to technological changes --- even if no precise dates are given, it feels like all the changes managed to happen in span of only several years (the last chapter indicates only a year has passed between Landar's two fights (ch 28--82) with her father, for instance). I don't think older generations would be able to embrace the knowledge as well as they did, even with Cato's explanations. He'd have to train a new generation of children to use the flexibility of their minds, or something like that. And even if the know-how and expertise were there, building so many things in span of a year just doesn't look feasible, even with magic.

  - same with moral changes in society: things like prejudices, perceptions of human rights, etc would be much more of a problem and technological advancement by itself wouldn't fix them. I really liked Nik Gorkaviy's approach in his [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/80290][young-adult trilogy]] (Russian-only, unfortunately): in it, the protagonists had to carefully consider how each new introduced technology would affect the current balance in society, motivate people to educate themselves through various means (just putting the knowledge out there wouldn't be enough), micro-manage in some cases with the help of a friendly AI, etc.

- The story could become a better young-adult recommendation if the scientific concepts touched in it had some non-obtrusive explanations about them. Not sure what would be the best way of achieving this, however. Footnotes, perhaps?

Also, two questions, if you don't mind:

- how are you planning to control eventual terrorist attacks and use of WMDs by individuals? I guess you could build a magical internet, link it to the forthcoming power grid and make the grid defend city structures and enhabitants against sudden hostile attacks (similar to how PvP systems work in some MMORPGs). But even then defending against high-power attacks seems to likely to cause a problem.
- same with the environment: even if you can “firewall” whole cities against damage using power grids fed by citizens and mana crystallisations, how are you going to preserve the environment when any amount of power from 2 to 100 thousand magical units was shown to both cause significant amounts of damage to the environment and also be accessible to individuals by the end of the magical revolution? The planet could get really messed up not even a century after the story's current events.
