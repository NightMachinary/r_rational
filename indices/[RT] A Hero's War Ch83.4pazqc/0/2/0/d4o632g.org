Hi, thank you for your comments!

I may have not managed to convey it accurately, but the only inventions that are widespread is the farming tools (this with government decree). Factory work and machines are limited to a rare few cases that are specially built (eg. Razzi's paper mill, Kalny's "not-palm oil" and canning operations, one Ironworker steel foundry), with a few off-screen copycats. The industrial revolution is in its infancy, barely even started. For the most part, most of the stuff are at 'working prototype' stage, where Cato and partners work to create a few working things to show it can be done, then Cato moves on to another project.

Your point on quick embracing of technology is valid, it's only been two years since Cato appeared. In fact this arc was supposed to be about that (interchangeable parts don't work well with a guild with rank-based mastery). I... got distracted by the visit to Iris Clan.

No idea what to do about better explanation of scientific concepts.
