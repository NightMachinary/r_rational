Thank you very much for reading! I am glad you are enjoying the story.

The alt text of the link is the spoiler apparently. I copied a formatting guide. How do I spoiler stuff anyway?

I do think that my per chapter pacing needs to slow down. Not writing speed, but... uh... plot speed? Essentially, too many things are happening to capture all of them in ~4k words per chapter. The number of possible side stories are quite insane:

- Kupo and Tulore make and test antibiotics (also about medicine and the political intrigue behind the Order of Pastora)

- Ka and Clan Two, and the cooperation with Fort Yang repelling Night Cryer attacks

- Danine, her little gang, the two lovebird hunters and discrimination against demihumans

- There's another one with Amarante and Vorril (+ the conflict against zombies) but that's small

To a large extent I am sacrificing all the sidelines to push forwards with the main two, only catching up later at the end of each arc.
