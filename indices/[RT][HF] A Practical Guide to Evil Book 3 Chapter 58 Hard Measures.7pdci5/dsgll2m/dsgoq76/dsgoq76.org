Because Cat's binary thinking has rephrased Good and Evil as Passive vs Active in a bloody, violent way. So now she calls herself evil, but has rationalised it as being able to decide the course of her own fate.

'If we all cross the same finish line the only thing that matters, the only thing that can matter, is how we get there.'

'So what if we all cross the same finish line? Down here in the mud is what really matters. What we make of it. And if I only have so much time kicking around Creation, then I'm the one who's going to decide how it's spent.'

So close, yet so far Cat. That was the point the priestess was trying to make.
