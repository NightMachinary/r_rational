Let's hope that Akua really needed those spies now, because crippling your force by removing twenty-something officers (including one senior officer) just before the battle can't be good. At least, neither Catherine nor Hakram said "no way that could possibly go wrong" when discussing their move.

As for that talk with the Sister, I don't know what to make of it. Said like this, Cat's way of thinking sounds like "IDGAF, YOLO". Never been a winning argument. Unless the point was to make it extra clear that Cat is Evil, so deep into that path that she can't even understand why people would want to be Good?
