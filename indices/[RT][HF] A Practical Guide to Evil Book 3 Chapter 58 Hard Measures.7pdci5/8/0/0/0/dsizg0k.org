Cat controls supply within her own legion. I really really doubt that a lot of magical stuff slipped past her and Ratface and Masego and Juniper and Aisha. Just Cat, sure, but all of them at the same time? Plus every other high-ranked Cat loyalist?

Then there are distribution problems. Suppose traitors somehow got the materials. Now they gotta distribute them to all soldiers so that they would drink them, and insure they keep doing that for a while. I doubt food is cooked in a single place for the whole legion (seems to make more sense to have one kitchen for 2-3 hundred people instead), and each such place probably has dozens of cooking pots, so this means they have to consistently put poison into dozens of pots all over camp without getting caught. How many traitors do you think there are, several hundreds? How do they insure nobody defects and sells the scheme to Cat? How do they insure they never get caught? They can't very much kill anyone who notices, because that would /definitely/ be noticed.

It just isn't plausible.
