The last-ditch effort of Good has failed, as expected. Does Cat get these kind of redemption chances (2nd one now!) because she's a Squire and hence can transition into Good? Or is it related to the continuous fight for Callow's soul, which has never been on the side of Evil?

The real question is this: was this the temptation to lure the protagonist from her rightful path or a last chance at redemption before a tragedy? It very much felt like an inverse of a scene where the main character is tempted by some great evil only to fully commit to the side of the good.
