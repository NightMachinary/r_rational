Well that was interesting. I'm not sure if that is an ambiguous end or a dark end. On one hand, he can chill with the locus, on the other that might be exactly what the scenario maker wants? Given enough time to chill with the locus, it would eventually rule out the hell scenario, the Bethel torture scenario, and the delusion scenario.

This brings up my worry about if the ending of Worth the Candle can satisfy the mystery boxes of the DM and game layer satisfactorily, but I think at the very least Alexanderwales would have a plan from the beginning... he's not just going to JJ Abrams it. Still I think it needs to avoid making the characters non-sentient constructs and avoid making the story event entirely superfluous while also addressing the constructed nature of the world and the DMs involvement.
