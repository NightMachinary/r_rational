It seems pretty much certain Joon is in a dream. According to WtC chapter 2, the game layer appears any time Joon closes his eyes for at least three seconds. However, based on the bad dreams he has after Fenn dies, like in Chapter 120, it's also clear that the game layer does not appear while Joon is dreaming. As such, the loss of the game layer and his magical senses should immediately make a dream/nightmare the most likely explanation.

Even so, being trapped in a dream/nightmare state is not mutually exclusive with many of the other possible explanations. For example, as Amaryllis notes in chapter 144, Bethel has the Dagger of Dreamspeech, allowing her to enter the dreams of anyone sleeping inside of her domain. The dagger is also mentioned in Chapter 105, which has an added note that it makes it possible to 'kill' people in their dreams rendering them comatose, though it leaves unclear what would befall their soul/spirit. If Bethel has acquired an entad which allows her to make people sleep, like the pipe Yarrow used to put Joon to sleep, she could grab Joon while he's vulnerable and endlessly torture him in a permanent nightmare state.

Similarly, the dream/nightmare state does not exclude being taken prisoner by an Anglecynn fireteam or being in Hell. There's presumably a multitude of ways to make people sleep and then induce or interfere with their dreams to psychologically attack them. There's also the Lord of Dreams mentioned in WtC chapter 148, which wasn't even addressed as a possibility in this sequence.

Waking up is definitely going to be tricky. There's no evidence in the canon that Joon can use magic in his sleep, though it seems possible that he may be able to learn to do so. The reaction that he got from 'Grak' in this story would suggest that he has perhaps already started to learn to use magic in his sleep, so it may just be a matter of learning to have a 'lucid dream' of sorts, where he's able to access the game layer and use magic even when he can't wake up.
