  Joon is apparently able to use magic
#+end_quote

The only indication he was able to use magic is Grak (he didn't have the proper sensory feedback to his magic, it was only Grak telling him to stop that indicated that he might have any). Aerb's normal magics don't work in hell, so if it was hell, the demons could let him flail around trying to use magic and fake someone telling him to stop trying to use magic. Detecting when he is trying to use magic (for instance, Grak's instruction to use vibration magic) might be hard, but it is a lot more tractable than fully faking his magic.

There are a few options that aren't presented as hypotheses:

- The game layer glitched out transporting Juniper to a glitchy simulation of his life on earth with glitchy emulations of his companions. The companions each having a (incomplete) explanation is a result of the game layer or DM trying to pull together an explanation while the glitch is fixed/the system reset. The problem will get fixed soon, Juniper just needs to not try anything that could disrupt the fix (hence Grak's and Valencia's explanations along with the peaceful final meeting with the Locus).

- Juniper accidentally fulfilled the conditions to enter the Land of Dreams and is being tormented/trapped there. We know the Dream realm is a thing from a brief guide to Aerb and I think it was Raven mentioned that Uther previously fought with the Lord of Dreams. (edit found the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/38858003#workskin][chapter]] its mentioned)

- This is a normal dream/nightmare, but next to the locus. The locus was trying to give Juniper a solid night's sleep but in the process prevented Juniper from waking up normally. Locus shenanigans also stopped Juniper from accessing his magic in this dream. This explains the final interaction being with the locus.

- The DM forked Juniper and is screwing around with a copy. For fun, or maybe to stress test it, or maybe to check Juniper mindset without his power, or maybe to prepare a return to home module for a future adventure.

- And for completely off-the-wall low probability explanation: Juniper is reality warper. He accidentally banished himself to a world of his own creation (either faking Arthur's involvement, or retroactively drawing him in, or having sent him to a world of his own creation in the first place). The game layer is a result of his reality warping powers bleeding through and trying to help him. The DM/narrative is his subconscious pushing back. His reality warping is acting up again, throwing him into a mixed up reality and shuffling around different possible explanations.
