I'm the kind of person who despises ambiguity, so here's my attempt at puzzling it out. Regardless of whether the author even had a final answer in mind, there's still evidence that can be looked at. Spoilers hereon ofc.

-- *A large amount of information about Aerb has been created, including knowledge of tech that doesn't exist on earth (according to Amaryllis).* That doesn't happen during psychosis: Joon is not an inventor and can't create that sort of thing ex nihilo.

So Maddie's hypothesis could be confirmed as false if Amaryllis could whip up working blueprints or otherwise produce information beyond what a psychotic person is capable of. There are other limits to what the human mind could generate that he could push at, like getting Amaryllis to do math that he personally couldn't do or to draw on an immensity of Aerbian culture that no one person could come up with themselves.

-- *The game layer is at exactly no point mentioned by anyone other than Joon.* Amaryllis's hypothesis already holds the least weight (really? Mome Rath never had anywhere near this kind of power), but if it were correct, there's no reason she shouldn't have had her own layer. This is a light shift away from the hell hypothesis, since the devils /would/ have been able to drag knowledge of it out of him, but no one ever brought it up.

-- *Bethel is out of character.* She's not that crass or profanity-laden in canon, she talks like a calm, collected empress. This is a shift towards the hell hypothesis, since Joon probably should have been able to come up with better dialogue if he were generating the delusions himself, rather than a devil trying to figure out Bethel secondhand. I'm assuming this is watsonian because I like to assume things are watsonian.

-- *Ten years is a long time.* Given the amount of pull Amaryllis has, the pressure Valencia can exert in the hells, and the importance Joon has, there's a possibility they could yoink him out somehow, time travel, create a clone that the game layer hops to, etc. So docking a couple of points from the hell hypothesis.

-- *The way Joon died in the hell hypothesis is void snipers.* The DM isn't pulling punches much, but he still controls what comes after the players. And frankly, this is an absurd threat to send against a DnD group. An unknown entity assassinates you for unknown reasons using an unblockable sniper rifle. You don't see them. Your players are just like "..okay?" They feel cheated, they don't feel like they had a chance to react or any agency. Would the DM let this happen anyways? Possibly. Still docking mild percentage points from the hell hypothesis.

-- *The DM is running using Joon's style.* Related to the last point, Joon wouldn't rob his players of all agency, cause he's not a shit DM. This would just be a twist campaign where going to hell or being imprisoned is the adventure hook. Which is what lends the most positivity to this story tbh. It is incredibly likely that Joon has an out.

-- *The game layer is sacrosanct.* The only way Joon could be prevented from seeing it is on /his/ end, by rendering him unable to perceive or recognize it. A delusion entad shouldn't be sufficient to prevent Joon from seeing it, as it wouldn't be directly opposing the layer, but devils could probably figure out a trick and they'd also have the chance to learn about the layer over the course of years. This is the strongest evidence for the hell hypothesis over the prisoner one.

-- *Dice Guy doesn't show.* Joon dying or going to hell is the sort of thing he'd show up for. I get the sense he's the type to want to get closure if Joon's story were truly over or to talk it over if it were taking on a new bent for ten years. However, devils could erase the memory of Dice Guy unless Dice Guy specially prevented that, so slight nudge towards hypothesis prisoner.

-- *Joon is apparently able to use magic.* I think this would be hard for devils to simulate as I understand it, they'd have to be literally reading his mind and replicating the magic effects he thinks of, or using their own delusion magic. Bump towards imprisonment.

So if I had to put money down it would be on the prisoner hypothesis. The game layer not existing is a strong push towards hell being true, but the rest of the evidence seems to push towards imprisonment.
