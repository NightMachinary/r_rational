Honestly, I'd really like a fic that just takes the premise of the first chapter, and runs with it, instead of the rest of the hypotheses. What a cool fic premise. Perhaps with some low key magic existing top in modern earth, street magic style.

I'd also love to see that premise used to insert them into a crossover fanfic setting. Harry Potter would be cool. Nasuverse/Fate might be even cooler.
