It was a small thing compared to all the other good converstaions and parts in the fic, but I really liked how Lio points out the absurdities in everything. He notices both the pun in his name and Araya's name and the fact that most magi actually understand the scientific method better than the average person.

I also liked the character development of the various magi characters.
