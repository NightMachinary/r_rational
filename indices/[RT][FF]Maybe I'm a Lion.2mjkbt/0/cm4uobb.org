It's a fanfic in which Lio Shirazumi gets infected with Blacklight virus from prototype games. For maximum enjoyment you should probably read/watch Kara no Kyoukai first, but it's not required. All you need to know about Blacklight and Blackwatch you'll get from the story.

High points include:

- A believable explanation of how Blacklight actually works.
- Main character using science to puzzle said explanation out.
- Lio starts out mildly insane, as per canon, and gets more rational as the story progresses. Though it's kind of up in the air how much of Lio is even left by the last chapter.
- A teaser for a debate on the nature of embodied intelligence and personal identity between a blacklight runner and Touko Aozaki. The debate itself is not actually in the fic yet, but it will be in the future, I think.

This fic is not yet finished, but the 450 kilowords written are well worth a read. The characters are fleshed out, the the worldbuilding is thorough and the writing is competent.
