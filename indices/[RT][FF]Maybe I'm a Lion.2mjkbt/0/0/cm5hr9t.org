I really like this fic. Dullahan does a great job here. It is also possibly the longest work fitting into one calandar day in-story (I think second place is Ulysses at a 'mere' 265,000 words).

I'd recommend watching KnK over reading it - the adaptation is faithful, which is to say that in both many elements are severely unintelligible and weirdly unexplained while others are overexplained so the plot overall hangs together only if you don't look too hard, but the anime has a great Kalafina soundtrack and great aesthetics, while the light novel merely has a very mediocre translation; The anime shares the Hellsing Ultimate trait of having >50% of the images be suitably pretty to be desktop backgrounds.

The author's stuff he's working on currently to take a break from MiaL - One Week - is complete and utter nonsense unless you've absorbed way too much Nasu bullshit, but if you are in that demographic already (as I am...) it is fucking hilarious. Some of it is hilarious anyways, it has the very best Jenga game in all of fiction.
