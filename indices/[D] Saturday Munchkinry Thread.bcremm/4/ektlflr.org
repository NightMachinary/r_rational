A powerful angel just imprisoned a demon inside your body.

You feed off the demons powers, making you functionally immortal: you stay young forever and cannot die expect through deliberate suicide. The demon is trapped inside its prison and cannot interact with the outside world except on the first 24 hours of every year, when the demon gets control of your sense of hearing and sight, making you see or hear anything it wants you to.

The demon works by HPMOR!Sorting Hat rules, it's as smart as you are and knows everything you know, but it hates your guts and want nothing more than getting you to commit suicide or, if that is not achievable, make your eternal life as miserable as possible.

It cannot trick you into believing that what you're seeing is real as your other senses are still working normally, but it can drag up anything you secretly feel guilty about, make you relive memories you'd rather forget (and even subtly tweak them if it wants to) or it can just play into your insecurities and try to talk you into believing that you are a terrible human being.

It is November 31st, so you have one month before your first encounter with the demon, how do you prepare?
