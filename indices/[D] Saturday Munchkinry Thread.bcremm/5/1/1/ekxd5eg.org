  Velocity magic - the obvious solution would be to drop down the Boundless Pit and teleport away after you get it. The fall wouldn't take that long and the Pit is deep enough. I honestly can't tell how survivable that speed at low level would be though.

Surely that would only work if the speed required for Velocity magic is below terminal velocity? Since it only takes 12 seconds of free fall to reach terminal velocity, you likely wouldn't even need the Pit. Given this fact and that the speed needed to get velocity magic increases each time someone achieves it, it could be well above terminal velocity by now.
