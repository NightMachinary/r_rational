I'm a been lurking on this subreddit a while, but this actually my first time posting here. Mostly I've delurked since I find this scenario interesting.

*Also this whole post is pretty much a giant spoiler for the serial up to the latest chapter*

The only non-excluded OP combo in the there that we know of for sure is the recently revealed still + soul magic so that would be what I would go for. I'm mostly just going through the book, but there really isn't that much about mechanics and the world(at least that I remember) to really diverge.

*The rough roadmap would probably look like this:*

Get through tutorial with maximum possible MEN but keep a few points for other requirements of various magics.

Going into the desert town is mostly a waste of time. Convince Amaryliss to skip it if you can, otherwise go through as quickly as possible avoiding confrontation with the gold mage (should be doable, maybe), if you can't avoid it abandon Amaryliss for now.

Uniqities didn't contact you until late in the story, but it is implied that they would be approachable under right conditions. Use them to get to Atheneum of Sound and Silence as soon as possible.

Next you need the soul magic. It is somewhat reasonable to assume that as with spirit magic(also get this while you are there anyway), you can unlock it in Library. This part hinges on getting hold of Raven and getting her to take you there. Then convincing her(or the other librarians) to show you enough Library magic to unlock it (which shouldn't be a problem).

Get good enough with soul magic to do the sacrifice. Raise Spirit high enough to get rid of the level problem. Raise as many skills as high as possible.

Enlist Bethel to help you steal the artifact preventing sleeping. Raise Still magic to 100 and other magics as high as possible with what you have left. Rob them blind.

Use your temporary OP powers to level as quickly as possible so you are not helpless if you fall unconcious.

Game Over, mostly.

*Problems I see with this:*

- The physical attribute was needed in the Tutorial but could you get by with blood magic instead. Could you convince Amaryliss to show it to you as you met her?

- Can you avoid Harold if you go soon enough? If not, you would be toast. You could leave it for after Library, but you would not be able to kill the antimemetic monster(you could just run for it though).

- Do we know how to contact Raven? Could we find out?

- This really needs cooperation of other people, you will probably need points in SOC.

- ROB would most likely not appreciate cheesing it.

/Optional Extras that should'nt take too long and should help if you canÂ¨t get long enough with minimal combat:/

- Unlock all of the magics that do not have onerous requirements.

- Gold Magic - this seems really good and the problem here is not unlocking it but getting to keep it. For our purposes, you can get enough gold for the first few motnhs, after which it mostly doesn't matter. You will either have completely OP powers which will make getting enough gold until you win trivial or you will be dead. And that's assumimg that the meta stilling doesn't work on the gold counter.

- Velocity magic - the obvious solution would be to drop down the Boundless Pit and teleport away after you get it. The fall wouldn't take that long and the Pit is deep enough. I honestly can't tell how survivable that speed at low level would be though.
