Mental processes easily. Most activities that I do are mentally-limited, not physically limited. Reading, typing, writing, thinking, etc. Additionally, for physical processes, actual muscle strength/speed is not my limiting factor; heat is. The faster I run, the faster I'll overheat, so any added muscle/speed would allow me to maybe sprint faster over short distances, but over long-distances I'd still be limited by heat.

With faster mental processes, I'd probably switch to a job which (relatively) minimizes social and physical aspects while maximizing use of enhanced mental ability, like software development, aerospace engineering, etc. and use faster mental speed to complete projects faster than anyone else would be able to in order to get paid 'rockstar' salaries. Or potentially just start making indie games.
