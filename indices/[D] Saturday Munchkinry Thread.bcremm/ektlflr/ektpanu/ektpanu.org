Well, one thing you really wants (and honestly always want) is to build a strong support network. Since the biggest threat to you is committing suicide and mental health issues, you want people in your life who can assure you that you are a valuable human being. That being said my second defence would be to find a way of not being able to hear the demon on those 24 hours.

​

Option 1: I start looking for a doctor who are willing to drug me senseless on the first day of the year.

​

Option 2: How does the functional immortal work? Does it involve regeneration? Can you deliberately stap your eyes out/blow your eardrums, thus blocking the demons ability to talk to you, and then regrow them later?

​

Optioin 3: Humans have up towards 21 senses. Start depriving yourself of sight and hearing and train yourself to pay attention to your other senses. Then do a 24 hour experience that overstimulates your other senses, making it easier for you to ignore the other senses.
