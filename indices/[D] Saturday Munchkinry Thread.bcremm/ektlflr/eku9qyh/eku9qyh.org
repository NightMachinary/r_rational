  make you relive memories you'd rather forget (and even subtly tweak them if it wants to)
#+end_quote

Does this affect your own future recollection of said memory, or just that one instance? Because if it's the former, the only sane option is enough GA to knock you out completely.

Failing that, in all likelihood you won't even be /you/ anymore by the end of the 24 hours.
