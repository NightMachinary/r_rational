Build what is essentially a time lock safe into my flat so I can't be tricked into leaving. All comms are cut off at the door (no wiring at all and the walls are a Faraday cage).

Then look for ways to incapacitate myself for 24 hours. Too long for a sleep, even chemically assisted, without supervision. Plus if I'm functionally immortal I assume it's from demon magic bs, so he could negate or not the effects of the drugs (under fatal threshold = "accidental exposure", demon removes drugs. Over fatal threshold that I've chosen to take, deliberate suicide, demon doesn't interfere, death).

I think I'd just tough it out - I'm already plenty good at living with my memories, thanks, and am stubborn enough that an external influence has much less chance of getting me to kill myself by acting rather than just waiting.
