Hmm, didn't really think about the consequences of destroying the brick. I was originally going to say it loses anomalous properties (but that seems limiting), so instead i'll say it retains its original properties, the thrust of each smaller piece is scaled by its mass to give the same 50m/s^{2} acceleration as before, and you're able to direct each piece individually limited only by your multitasking abilities, (think of it like tracking the balls in a game of pool, so you could probably direct multiple brick shards in their own general direction, but you wouldn't be able to make a floating sculpture from a brick dust cloud)
