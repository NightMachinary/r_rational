So that's effectively counteracting surface-earth gravity for a 15kg object? If the brick is destroyed, do I lose the ability forever, or can I control the previously-brick particles? Do I have to apply a uniform force to all of them, if the latter, or can I specify rules for them to follow? (e.g. apply a force toward something so they coalesce)?

Besides the usual reverse-engineering, I'd say collaborating with public and private space agencies to launch small satellites could easily net me a few billion over a decade or two, now that the tyranny of the rocket equation has been locally crippled.
