  This ability has no range limits, although your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.

You have a superweapon the likes of which the world has never seen. Maybe. I need a physicist on this.

Send the brick into space, where there is no air resistance and so you can accelerate it to whatever speed you wish, subject only to the laws of relativity (which I don't really understand). 50m/s^{2} of acceleration, constantly applied, will let you get to about 1/10th the speed of light in a week. With enough time, I think you can slam the brick at near lightspeeds into things you want to destroy, like satellites, space stations. Maybe even Earth cities.
