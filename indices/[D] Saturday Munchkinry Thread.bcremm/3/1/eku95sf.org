I'm not sure how porous a brick is, but I'd imagine it'll be similar to being trapped in a room with no door and no windows. So I guess I'll suffocate slowly and painfully.

If the brick is being externally steered as a single unit (which it was in my example), moment of inertia is basically ignored, so shifting the center of gravity doesn't matter.
