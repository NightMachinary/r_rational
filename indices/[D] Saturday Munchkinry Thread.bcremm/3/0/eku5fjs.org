You start reevaluating the life choices that brought you to this point, while praying to your diety of choice that whoever is controlling the brick doesn't do something that'll end up with you dead, such as throwing the brick into the sun, achieving light speed by accelerating in empty space, or use you are a meteorite.

I would imagine though that you could easily break as soon as the brick is in the air. You weight 75 kgs and can multiply that pressure by making a jump, and I doubt that the structural integrity of one (presumably thin since the brick is hollow) can withstand the heavy weight on the small surface your feel touches. Just make sure you're not too far up into the air.
