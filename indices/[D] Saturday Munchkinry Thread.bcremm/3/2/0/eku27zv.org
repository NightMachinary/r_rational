So the average brick is about 7cm high, let's say this one's a bit bigger and is 3 inches high. You're one inch tall, and the brick is 1 inch thick on the top and sides (with probably some extra thickness on the corners for stability). Add another quarter inch of extra void space so your head is not scraping the top of the brick when you stand.

So, can a 75 kg human break through the brick? I don't know. What's the strength of a ~25cm long ~1in thick sheet of brick with a point load on it?
