*3) How would you munchkin your powers in a flying brick?*

- You are trapped inside an ordinary sized, hollowed out clay brick and have been shrunk to an appropriate size.\\
- It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.\\
- You weigh a little over 75kg
- With a thought, someone else can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.\\
- You are instinctively aware of the brick's owner's position relative to yourself (and the brick).\\
- You can move freely in the hollow area of the brick to unbalance the controller's control (they cannot anticipate your actions)
- Being shrunk, you have powers commensurate with being a human that has been shrunk ("super" strength, very dense). All the major downsides of being shrunk (e.g. not being able to breathe or speak) are silently accounted for.
