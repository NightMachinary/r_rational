My guts goes towards the mental speed improvement but honestly I'd be worried that conversations with regular people would become even more tedious than they already are, so I'm not sure it's worth it. If the mental improvement allowed me to solve problems I couldn't previously solve it would be different but it only allows me to solve problems that I already could solve, just with 1/3 less time spent.

Physical speed does have the advantage of increasing metabolism so I can eat more delicious food.

If I could turn it on and off at will I'd definitely pick mental speed.
