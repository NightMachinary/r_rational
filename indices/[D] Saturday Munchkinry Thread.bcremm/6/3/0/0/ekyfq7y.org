Smarter is just a very overloaded word. Does it increase your mental processing power? Your memory capacity? Your pattern recognition? Your reflexive intelligence? Your neuroplasticity?

If it did all of those I'd take it in a heartbeat.

If it just allowed me to solve problems/learn skills that were 50% harder than what I normally could I would definitely take it as well.
