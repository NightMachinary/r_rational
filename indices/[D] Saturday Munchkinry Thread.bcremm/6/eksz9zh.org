Would you rather be able to at will accelerate your thoughts and perceptions of the world by 50% (i.e ”mental processes”) or the speed with which you and parts of your body move (i.e. ”physical processes”), with no accompanying change to the other in either case? Assume that all changes are purely biological, with no supernatural tomfoolery --- to the extent that there exists natural human variation in these abilities, your muscle fibers, neurons, etc. have been subtly altered to result in the above speed-up. Mental processes here would entail things like processing visual information (incl. reading) and contemplation, and would effectively provide you with 50% more subjective experience, but the world around you (incl. e.g. people talking) would appear as if to move 33% slower; physical processes could include things like running (so your so-so 6 min mile would become a very impressive ~4 min mile, excluding the effect terrain deformation or whatever has on running speed), digestion, and recovery from injury, but not e.g. the “mental” components of sleep, though you may feel more “physically” refreshed on less. However, this turbo boost may require a period of adjustment, as your current sense of coordination has been tuned to moving at slower speeds. Required secondary powers would also be in effect (e.g. moving faster means generating more force, so you might also be a bit stronger, insofar as needed).

Having chosen an option, what would you do with it?

And alternatively, if you had to choose an option to /permanently/ apply to yourself, which would you choose? If any at all.
