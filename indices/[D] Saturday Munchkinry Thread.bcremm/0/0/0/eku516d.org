Thing is, if you suddenly have magic, then you are in a world where magic exists. Thus, there are considerable odds that those prizes are some sort of trap. Actually, there are only two significant possibilities here - either the world changed, and powered people are going to be crawling out of the woodwork, or you should be really concerned about how the heck the Masquerade is enforced.
