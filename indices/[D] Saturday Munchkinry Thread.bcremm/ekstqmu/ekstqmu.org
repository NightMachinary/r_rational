*1) How would you munchkin your powers as a flying brick?*

- You wake up one day and realise you have the powers of the archtypical generic flying brick superhuman.
- Through a series of improbable coincidences and some hasty experimentation, you've discovered the following:
- Flight: You can fly, though you've only tried going at low subsonic speeds. You don't know if an atmosphere is required.
- Durability: The first few times you tried flying you accidentally fell 9 stories. It hurt a little, but you didn't seem to sustain any injuries.
- Strength: You slammed a fist on your table and the table broke. You tried picking up your refrigerator and managed it easily without breaking a sweat.
- Speed: You can /at minimum/ sustain a sprint to comfortably keep up with the vehicles on the road, though you could definitely fly faster,

And that's basically it as far as you know.

- You don't really know your upper limits.
- Apart from a few stunned eyewitnesses, no one really knows of your abilities (you are not notable).
- You don't know how you got these abilities, whether you can do anything else, or who else may have them. As far as you can tell, everyone else appears ordinary.\\
- Your reaction times seem to be similar to a normal human.\\
- You don't seem to require consuming additional calories as a result of using these abilities.\\

Apart from turning a generator crank up and down really fast, what would you do? How would you attempt to safely discover/test their limits? Would you attempt to keep a low profile? How would you best utilize your abilities?
