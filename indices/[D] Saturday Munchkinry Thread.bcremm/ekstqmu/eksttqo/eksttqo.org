*2) How would you munchkin your powers of a flying brick?*

- You telepathically control an ordinary sized clay brick.\\
- It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.\\
- With a thought, you can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.\\
- You are instinctively aware of the brick's position relative to yourself.\\
- It can generate thrust to continuously accelerate at up to 50m/s^{2} in any direction, but is otherwise subject to normal physics, velocity limits would depend on various factors like air resistance.\\
- This ability has no range limits, although your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.
