Rather than being used to get into orbit, this brick would be incredibly useful after being placed in orbit. As [[/u/sambelulek]] mentioned, this gives you 150 N in any direction, /with no reaction mass/. That last one is the key, because it means that your delta-V is no longer limited by the amount of mass that you can carry with you.

As an example, the Voyager probe weighs 825.5 kg, so the brick could give it a continuous acceleration of 18 cm/s^{2}. This doesn't sound like much, but you could accelerate to the current cruising velocity of 17 km/sec in 1 day. Imagine being able to send a Voyager probe anywhere, for no additional cost beyond reaching orbit.without needing to wait for appropriate launch windows. After the probe is accelerated, the brick can be retrieved to be used for the next probe.

The Apollo missions have more mass, about 14 tons, which gives 5 mm/sec^{2}. A Hohmann transfer to Mars takes about 1.4 years. With continuous acceleration of 5 mm/sec^{2}, flipping around at the halfway point, that can be reduced to 85 days. This could be further reduced with aerobraking, some conventional acceleration, etc, but that would be a rough estimation.
