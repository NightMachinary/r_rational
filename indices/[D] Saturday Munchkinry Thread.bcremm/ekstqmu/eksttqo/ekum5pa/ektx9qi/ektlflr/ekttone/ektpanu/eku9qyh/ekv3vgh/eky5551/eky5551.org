My fist thought is to just pull a couple consecutive all nighters in the days prior to try and sleep though as much of demon day as I can. If i'm unconscious for most of it and what I am conscious for feels enough like a crazy dream I imagine that'll blunt the worst of the impact.

​

A bit more munchkiney though, how specific is the suicide rule? Am I vulnerable to only self inflicted harm or to specific things people use to commit suicide, and how indirect does it have to be before it stops counting as self inflicted? Do i suffer injuries but just always recover or am I immune to damage? Can i just have somone else tape a plastic bag over my head until I pass out then remove it once the allotted time has passed?

​

If the bag thing works I imagine that I can get somone to do it provided I can demonstrate i'm actually immortal which i have a whole month to experiment with and work up to an efficient demonstration.
