Option 1 sounds like it can be bypassed if you can get appropriate dugs - if you understand your limits (and they exceed normal human limits), then you can probably survive drugs at doses that would kill (most*) humans.

*I'd note that if there's one demon then there could be more, but there are already recorded cases of people who can survive ridiculous amounts of drugs.
