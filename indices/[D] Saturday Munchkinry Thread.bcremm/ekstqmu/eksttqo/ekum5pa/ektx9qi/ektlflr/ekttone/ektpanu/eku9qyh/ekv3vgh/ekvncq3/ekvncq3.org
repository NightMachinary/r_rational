Agreed, mostly - I wouldn't trust myself to be unable to use the contents of my house to kill myself, even if I was locked inside. Having never experienced the demon's persuasive powers, or the tricks they might use (would I want to kill myself to end some torment? Or would he fool me into thinking my steak knife was my toothbrush? Either one is dangerous...) I can't be sure. Facing the prospect of functional immortality, I would not leave that up to chance.

I do have to assume that I would subsequently be able to survive whatever memories of the day would be remaining.

I would lock myself in a room/vault so no one could come in and unlock me, clamped down to a gurney with padded, sturdy restraints, put my head in a helmet, and set a timer for 24 (maybe 30-36, to give some reaction time?) hours, after which the restraints would unlock.

One thing I would NOT do would be to check into a mental health facility. Yeah, they're really good at keeping people from committing suicide, but I have zero trust they'd let me out after the episode was over.
