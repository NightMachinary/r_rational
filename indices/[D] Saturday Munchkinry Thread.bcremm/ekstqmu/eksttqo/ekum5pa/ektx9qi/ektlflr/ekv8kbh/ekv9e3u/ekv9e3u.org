First thing that comes to mind is taking note of the parachute-tattoo and unlocking skin magic. Then, saving the first-cowardice girl and convincing her to help you grind some basic fighting (and maybe throwing, with rocks on the ground) skills so you're not /completely/ helpless.

Not sure how blood and bone magic would work, but maybe try to mess around with zombie bones for a boost, and get Amaryllis to explain blood magic for a quick cantrip.
