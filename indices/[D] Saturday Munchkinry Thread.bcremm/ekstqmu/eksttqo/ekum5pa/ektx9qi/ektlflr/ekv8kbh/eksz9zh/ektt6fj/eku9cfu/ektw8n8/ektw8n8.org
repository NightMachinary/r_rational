Important question: Does this age you?

If I choose 50% physical speed, does that effectively cost me a third of my remaining lifespan?

Since the power is apparently purely biological, I would suspect that this is the case.

The question then becomes, what's the limiting factor on your age? Check your family records, if they suffer from things like heart disease, then your limiting factor is likely physical. If they suffer from things like Alzheimer's, then it's mental. Choose the power that doesn't cut short your lifespan.
