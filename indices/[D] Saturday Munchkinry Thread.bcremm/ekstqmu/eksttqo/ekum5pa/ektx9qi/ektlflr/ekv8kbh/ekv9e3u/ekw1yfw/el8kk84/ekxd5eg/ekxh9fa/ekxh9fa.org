Looking at it now, the needed speed (over 600 miles per hour) is much higher than the terminal velocity so simple freefall wouldn't work. Though MC had a skill along the lines of Tinker(Inventor, Mechanic?) and it doesn't seem impossible he could build aerodynamic shell that would work. The issue than is the survivability of the shell, and Joon and getting the skill high enough(or commissioning the shell). It wouldn't be as easy as I made it out to be though, shame.
