*4) How would you munchkin your powers around a flying brick?*

- You telepathically control an ordinary sized, hollowed out clay brick that is trapped inside your abdominal cavity. (Your organs are fine, and the brick was sterilized before insertion.)
- It weighs a little over 3kg, and is as durable as a typical well made fired brick.
- You weigh a little over 75kg
- With a thought, you can command the brick to accelerate in any direction.
- You are instinctively aware of the brick's position relative to yourself. Mainly because you can feel it moving around inside you.
- It can generate thrust to continuously accelerate (itself) at up to 50m/s^2 in any direction, but is otherwise subject to normal physics. (So it will achieve much lower velocities since it has to drag your body around.)
- This ability only works while the brick is inside your body, and your proprioception and control of it propagates at lightspeed.
