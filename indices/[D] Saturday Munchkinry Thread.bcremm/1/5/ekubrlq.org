I'll put a strong armor on it, connectible to various extension I can design later. For instance, a connectible plank would help me ride on it, solving commuting problem. A camera would make it stealthy drone, I can produce high quality video with minimum noise. Youtube love drone footage. A connectible tray will improve (or worsen) my sedentary lifestyle, coffee will come to without me having to fetch it from the kitchen. It will need fine control, but 0 to 150 Newton range of force give me plenty of freedom.
