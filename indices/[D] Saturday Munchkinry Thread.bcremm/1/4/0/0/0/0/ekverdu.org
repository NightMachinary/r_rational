Depends on how long-range it is. Anywhere within the solar system, and the 5g acceleration of the brick is enough to get it back without any issues. [[https://space.stackexchange.com/a/841/20145][Here]], somebody did the math on how long it takes to go to each planet with 1g of acceleration. Divide those values by 5, and you get about 3 days to go to Neptune.

Outside the solar system, it would be a pain to get back. For those, you would accelerate the probe, then bring the brick back. The probe would then be either a fly-by, or aerobraking, depending on what you are aiming at.
