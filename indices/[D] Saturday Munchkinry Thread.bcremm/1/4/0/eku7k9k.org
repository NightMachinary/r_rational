Anything combined mass that can provide a net acceleration greater than 9.8m/s^{2} after air resistance can carry objects into orbit, although as others mentioned an improperly shielded object risks burning up in atmosphere.

Though if you want to enter a stable earth orbit with low impulse, you'll probably need to start with a very large orbit in order to have the time to accelerate fast enough.
