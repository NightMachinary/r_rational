I use it for moderation. On my alt account I'm a mod of two niche subs I won't link here (NSFW), every time someone breaks one of the rules they get a down vote, a warning and the comment/post gets removed.

When they get to -5 karma as tracked by res i can be sure that their disruption to the community is worth less than what they're contributing, so I'll switch to temp bans.
