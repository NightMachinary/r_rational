When I upvote someone, I use Reddit Enhancement Suite to mark the subreddit, because it's interesting to see if I have any other subreddits in common with the person.

I've noticed that, no matter what the first subreddit is [typically [[/r/rational]], [[/r/kaiserreich]], or [[/r/geopolitics]]], the second one is almost always political.

How do you use RES?
