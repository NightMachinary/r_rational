I tag content creators with what they make (good in their threads/communities, super fun when you see them show up somewhere else), people who told a particularly funny joke with a fragment of the joke (mostly to make my future self laugh), people who promote ideas about racial hierarchies as "nazi" (handy if they show up dogwhistling later), and people who confront those with something positive.

The +/- vote tool is also super cool. Though there's no way to sync it between computers that I know of, so it's been less handy for me lately now that I'm using two.

My favorite tag story involves tagging a user who spilled their guts about their life story, which shared a lot of uncommon hardships with mine, then seeing them become a regular on [[/r/rational]] several months later. (Not saying who since that's like, two people's privacy, but if you think that's you, hi! You're cool!)
