I use RES to tag people, some for modding purposes, some just for general curiosity. I tag people from my (small) city if they post in the state subreddit or the city one, so that if I see them elsewhere I can think to myself, "hey, small world!".

The ability of RES to hide read comments is one of the only things that makes coming back to longer threads actually useful.

Tracking upvotes and downvotes on a person colors future interactions with them, in a way that I /generally/ endorse. It also helps names stick out a little bit more, because if someone has a [+30] next to their name, I'll make note of them.

There are a bunch of features of RES that I take for granted, and don't even remember aren't a part of the standard reddit experience, like Live Preview, which I forget is a thing until those rare moments I'm looking through reddit while signed out.
