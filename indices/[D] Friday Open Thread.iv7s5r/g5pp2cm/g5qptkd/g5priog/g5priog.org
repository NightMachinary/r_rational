On a more serious note, I tend to mark people I've gilded. Not sure why, but it's a habit at this point (36 instances according to my page). I think I've seen another post/comment by a gilded person only twice so far (and one time it was [[/u/RamsesThePigeon]], who is super active on many large subreddits).
