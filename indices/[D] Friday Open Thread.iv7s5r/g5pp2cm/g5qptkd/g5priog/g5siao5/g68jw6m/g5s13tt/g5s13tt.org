I started out using RES for marking people: When I was active on a fanfiction sub I marked people who said they were or were not open to a certain type of story recommendations, that way I would remember not to recommend them things they wouldn't like. I eventually started marking fanfic authors, content creators, people who participate on certain subs, people who recommend a certain kind of content, etc.

I also make frequent use of RES's ability to hide comments and to customize filters for posts on different subs. For example, RES is great for filtering out spoilers for stories I haven't read yet on [[/r/Parahumans]].
