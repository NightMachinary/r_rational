  Tracking upvotes and downvotes on a person colors future interactions with them, in a way that I generally endorse.

I wish it had the option to hide the totals for people with less than say, -5/+5 vote differentials. Highlighting people with strong +scores is nice because they're usually insightful or funny people, and people with strong -scores is nice because it's usually the result of something absolutely heinous that might need rebutting, but +1/-1 "was polite once" / "told a really tired joke" gets a very similar visual treatment.
