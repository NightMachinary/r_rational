Does anyone know what happened to alternate history (the website)? And if there's any backup for it?

I've found more than a few recs to it, but it seems like the all of those links are dead now. It also seems to have less crossover for fics than usual (versus fics on SB and SV being frequently crossposted). I've been a fanfic/webnovel reader for years now, so it's surprising and sad to discover a dead fiction hub only after it seems to be gone.
