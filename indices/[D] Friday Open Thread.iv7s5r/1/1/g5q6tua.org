There's nothing out there as far as I know, and no easy solution.

You could manually copy-paste each chapter to a doc, then convert that to a PDF

or go [[https://pdfcrowd.com/][here]], convert each webpage to a PDF, then go [[https://combinepdf.com/][here]] to combine them, but the end result will look like [[https://pdfcrowd.com/genpdf/f7d89599785324f8bc1325d2b3976fdb.pdf?name_inline=docfuture_tumblr_com_post_34751426243_doc_prologue.pdf][this]], which you may hate.
