From my comment in the linked thread, here are my recommendations minus stuff you've read:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/][2 year emperor]] is great

Oh and also [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/][the gamer vs RWBY]] was great; it's long as hell but the main storyline's unfinished.

There's also [[http://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html][Zombie knight]] that's sort of like this, though the powering up is a bit bumpy.

[[http://brainchip.thecomicseries.com/][Transdimensional brain chip]] is worth a mention, though it's not a fantasy setting.

Also, this isn't in that comment but [[http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character.9848/][these]] two [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character-for-real-this-time.20591/][stories]] are pretty good--"no matter what happens, I still won't become an anime character."
