I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Antropology]]. It's about Hermione Grange being sorted into Slytherin.

I also really love [[http://ttshieronym.tumblr.com/][To the Stars]]. I think it's worth to read even if you aren't into Madoka Magica.
