Fair enough, so what I've read thus far is (for the most part) HPMOR, FIO, Luminosity, Bluer Shade of White, Metropolitan Man, Wildbow's stuff, Nat 20, The Arithmancer, Blindness, Pokemon Origin of Species, and most of the MOR meta fic. At present I am looking for fanfic rather than original, and things I have deliberately given a pass include Time Braid and Animorphs the Reckoning due to lack of knowledge of canon, and Branches on the Tree of Time for lack of interest in the premise. Hopefully this helps.
