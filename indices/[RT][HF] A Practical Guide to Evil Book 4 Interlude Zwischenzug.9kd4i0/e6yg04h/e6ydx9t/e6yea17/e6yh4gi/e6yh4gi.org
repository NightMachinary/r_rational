Vivienne has an...interesting outlook. Her perspectives tend to strike me as almost playground-level social psychology, though she does have occasionally useful insights. She spent most of this chapter confident that her proposal would be rejected out of hand, not because she had doubts about the plan itself, but because she thinks Hakram and Juniper don't like her.

She also has the distinguished role of Cat's "conscience" regarding Akua, which I think says a lot about her--Akua's threat isn't her charm, it's her rationality. None of the Woe are going to side with Akua because she's polite, they'll do it because she says something that makes perfect sense at the time. Vivienne's value here is not some inherent resisitence to evil, it's that her stance on Akua is to stick her fingers in her ears and go "NA-NA, I CAN'T HEAR YOU," which is hardly an endearing quality, despite its usefulness in this particular instance.

Basically I hate her.
