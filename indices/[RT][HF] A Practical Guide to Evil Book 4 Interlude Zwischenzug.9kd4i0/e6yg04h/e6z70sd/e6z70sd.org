Thinking about it, I actually see why this is upsetting her so much. But I think it comes from her misunderstanding Names. For a lot of people, Named are superhumans who do impossible things. Vivienne expects herself to be better than her obstacles, because she's Named. But she's got it wrong. Your Name is supposed to make you more of what you are, so leaning into it makes you better at those things... but if you try to do things that aren't part of you or your role, it doesn't help.

When has Vivienne been at her peak? When she's been leaning into Thief. She stole a sun. She stole supplies. Before she joined the Woe she stole a harbor full of ships. She is great at stealing things.

When has she been failing? When she's not doing what she's good at. She tries to fight Hakram ages ago and was slapped away like a wimp. She went against the fae and got burned. She battled at Second Liesse and got hurt for it. She tries to stab Malicia's entourage and got electrified.

It's been stated plenty of times, but Thief is not a combat Name. I feel like most of the characters (and Thief herself) say that and mean "she doesn't have any combat tricks," but they all assume she's still Named and thus is strong. But as soon as she steps outside of the role of a non-combat Thief... she's not the Thief. She's Vivienne, and she's practically powerless. She tries to fight, but really when it comes to combat a Thief should really only good at avoiding getting into it or in getting away ASAP. She tries to plan and lead, but a Thief is more of a lone wolf profession - my guess is that she takes to the Jacks because she's "stealing" information, so at least it's tangentially related to the role. She's forcing herself to jam a square peg into a round hole, because she expects her Name to make her better in all areas. But instead she's just fracturing her role. She's right to fear her Name is slipping. The way I see it, she can either focus on doing Thief-y stuff, or angle for a new Name that has some combat or leadership Role as well.
