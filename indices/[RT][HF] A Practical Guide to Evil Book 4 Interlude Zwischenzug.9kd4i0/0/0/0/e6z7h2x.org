Good point. Thief is trying to be Rogue, as in the RPG sense, with a bonus to backstabbing and sneak attacks and all that. Nope. She's just Thief, not Rogue and certainly not Assassin. At the same time, she's a passable spymistress, but not a Named level spymistress specialized for it, unlike Scribe.
