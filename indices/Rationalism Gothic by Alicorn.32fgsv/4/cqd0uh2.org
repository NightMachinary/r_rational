  Politics is the mindkiller. You do not need to come up with thoughts about politics. They would only kill your mind. Rest now.

  You donate to effective charities to signal virtue to your friends. They are impressed. You feel cold. Friendship isn't about affection. You signal louder and louder to nothing and no one. You have never done anything real. You are not real.
