That's why I said for every awakened slayer. When the new slayer died, another came from that, so you have to medically kill the newest one, and undo that. Slayer powers is all you need for people, Buffy doesn't miss anything else than having already used her death makes new slayer thingy, but all the new ones can do that once.

Bending some steel beams: Yes, only the newest one counts. But you can just /temporarily/ kill the newest one to create a new slayer. Do that until you get thousand slayers.
