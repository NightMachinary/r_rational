Canonically, Buffyverse has at least two real, functional afterlives.

That. Changes. /Everything/.

In one, you get tortured for all eternity. That's your failure state right there. It seems like even people who don't "deserve" it can get dragged into that one. Not. Good.

Another is so great, literally so /perfect/, that being removed from it and having to return to Earth is like being shoved into hell. It isn't clear if that one is just for certain people, but it seems not.

In any case, that sounds a lot like something worth exploring, at least to visit. I'd be at worst cautiously optimistic about that.

Certain holy artifacts work, so at least some of Christian religious doctrine works. And some of the value judgments regarding good and evil seem to be metaphysically enforced. Need to test to see if Pascal's wager has some teeth in the Buffyverse. Suicide just to get to heaven, for example, is out until you've got some really concrete seance results under your belt or you're literally being dragged into hell already. Which seems to be a pretty common thing.

Seems like high-priority is reading up on soul magic and ways to use mystic technobabble to enbiggen yours while ensuring a ticket to the right afterlife. Wish machines capable of warping all of space/time exist in canon, so maybe get smart and find one of those.

In fact, I'm not sure staying on Earth in the Buffyverse is min-maxiable. Lots of chances to get dragged into hell, not a lot of power multipliers that don't risk that very same fate. But if you figure out a way you can pimp your soul and rule in heaven...
