It beggars the imagination that no one turned into Superman / Batman / Spiderman that night.

In any case, this curse sounds like the greatest thing since fire as far as transhumanism and muchkinry goes -- "okay, folks, everyone decided what you're going to be and got your costume on? Okay, good, casting Janus curse in 3...2...1...."

On the subject of Buffy!Halloween, if you read [[http://schlockmercenary.com][Schlock Mercenary]] and like Buffy, then this story is a lot of fun: [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-6928/kevinm+Xander+Mercenary.htm][Xander Mercenary]] It's very much a cotton-candy / guilty pleasure fic -- the spag is a bit flaky and the main characters aren't ever particularly challenged, but it's a blast while you're reading it. It starts as a SM/Buffy cross, then pulls in SG-1 to good effect. Later on (in the sequel? I forget) the author starts pulling in absolutely everything, including PowerRangers and Ghostbusters. Stop reading when you get there.
