  No new experiences, just an eternal feeling of bliss. And really boring.

Not actually what was said there. Reads more like a reduced or downgraded mind forced into a worse sensory suite, more than anything else. See, she never said what she actually experienced there on an ongoing basis. She also didn't say she did nothing or achieved nothing. Just that her Slayer duties were finished, time had a different meaning, and she knew everyone she cared about was safe (that her dramatic sacrifice that dumped her there had worked).

Now here she's talking to Spike, so why would she blab on about all the great heaven things she did that are now lost to her? Just to give him even more emotional hooks to use against her? Nah.

Nothing suggested it was a pointless or goalless place to be. One can always explain away something like that as being a pleasure simulation, a consequence-free VR trap, or a enhanced and enticing sensory experience with no ultimate point, unless the protagonist comes out the other end with functional Heaven Guns or some such.

But I think from context that the point of this wasn't that she was tricked by the Powers That Be or some Slayer Heaven lie and was detoxing hard, but that she was paying a deep cost, having lost something that was real and good to such an extent that it was almost indescribable.
