I think we have only one likely confirmed afterlife, at most.\\
We only ever see people bodily taken into Hell/hell equivalents.\\
Buffy died in a rift in the fabric of the multiverse, so we have no idea what happened to her soul other then it spending time in a state of (deceptive, soporific) serenity.\\
Re-souled vampires show no signs of remembering an afterlife.\\
The only possible occasion where someone died and returned with purpose (implying active thought and interaction with surroundings as a soul) is Joyce in Conversations with Dead People, which may or may not have just been a convoluted First Evil scheme, or else something weirder.
