I agree , the drugs analogy is apt ; but wouldn't it be like being a passive observer of what your altered self is doing?

I think we can equate it to several brain damage (it's fact that people undergo behavioural and personality related changes). Consciousness-wise it might be an unanswerable question , we don't know because we arent the subject in question. I think in-universe the only way would be un-vampirizing the subject , but that might not be what the curse does , we have slightly more than weak evidence that it is the case but no confidence in it.
