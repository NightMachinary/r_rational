We do see a vampire "un-vampirized" a few times, but I think it's vague enough that it could just be "humanizing" an existing vampire's body.

Drugs ... well, when you remember being on drugs, you don't remember a non-drugged version of yourself watching and objecting while your drugged self goes on, right? You remember it seeming like a great idea to put your pants on your head, or whatever. (That certainly seems to be how it is for Angel, who remembers being a /bad person/ and is fairly traumatized by it.)

On the other hand, we don't actually /know/ that a "vampire with a soul" isn't more analogous to Spike with his chip than the original person. After all, the "demon" is still there, whatever that means.
