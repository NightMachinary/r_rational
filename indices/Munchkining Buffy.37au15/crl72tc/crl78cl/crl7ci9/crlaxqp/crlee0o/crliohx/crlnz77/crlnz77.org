I'm not up-to-date with the buffyverse but aren't vampires for all intents and purposes biologically dead? If you are biologically dead then 1) the mind must be dualistic 2)Happiness doesn't really work only with chemicals

I think it's subjective. Given the wording "true happiness" can mean everything and nothing , the problem is on whom definition it's based. If it's on the cursed subject then good! Just genuinelly believe that "true happiness" is impossible and you're fine. If it's on the curs*er* definition then only eating a really good sandwich could bring you back to a raging psycho.

If it was me i would probably self-medicate with drugs that cause "bad" mood (if my first assumption is wrong) while researching the more i can on the subject.
