Nope. She ... um, spoilers I guess if you're just now watching the series ... dies /again/ later, and no new Slayer is called. WoG is only the most-recent Slayer "counts", Buffy is now just a person who happens to have Slayer powers.

With that said, I've always felt that the existence of a "curse" that basically /cures vampirism/ was criminally underused by the cast. And I mean criminal as in "you just *killed* /more people than I can count/ who could easily have been saved and added to your baddass good!vampire army".
