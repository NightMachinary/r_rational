  With that said, I've always felt that the existence of a "curse" that basically cures vampirism was criminally underused by the cast. And I mean criminal as in "you just killed more people than I can count who could easily have been saved and added to your baddass good!vampire army".

Headcanon: most of the time when you try that, the good!vampire kills himself/herself. It's not really useful as a way of doing anything other than getting rid of vampires, which you could already do with sunlight, fire, stakes, +and Ripple energy+.
