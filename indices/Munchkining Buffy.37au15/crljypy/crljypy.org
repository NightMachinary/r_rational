Willow ends up doing rather better than that. Uhm, in fact, Willow generally does fairly well on the "Exploit the heck out of the metaphysics of the crapsack universe you are trapped in" front.

so, it'd be more interesting to explore other themes that are not covered by canon but implied by it - like anthropics. The number of "End of the world" scenarios which was averted on the show was just ridiculus to the point where the only reasonable theory is that one of the powers that warp reality hits the reset button every time earth gets destroyed.
