In theory, yes.\\
In practice, the plan hits a snag when you reach a Slayer unwilling to trust you enough to die on request. Like, say, Faith.\\
Then you either give up or start killing Slayers against their will, which is it's own can of worms if the entire series is anything to go by.

Spoiler Season 7+: Also the 100% awakening of all potential Slayers seems to have a bunch of weird metaphysical repercussions.
