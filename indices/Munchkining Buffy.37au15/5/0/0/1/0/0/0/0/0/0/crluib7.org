My hypothesis is that when a person becomes a vampire their soul is ripped from the body and put in stasis. The vampire then gets a new "soul" which is not a human soul but a lesser demon soul and which gets all the memories of the human. As the example of angel shows, human soul and demon soul have very different personalities. If the human soul returns to the body, it is updated with all the memories from the demon.
