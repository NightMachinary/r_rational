Well, it's magic, obviously; but it seems like things like hobbies, memories, and preferences carry over. The only real difference is that there's a bit flipped on the "morality" function, and a couple of episodes mention they get a confidence boost.

I mean, you can "take the morals out of someone" by turning them into a sociopath without turning them into a p-zombie, right? Vampires are like sociopaths. Except they actively want to do /bad/ things now. Otherwise, completely the same.

It's extremely debatable whether this counts as "death" or what, but it's reversible, and you keep the memories, so I'd count it as an altered state of consciousness. Like taking drugs.
