I see , sorry I am not up to date with the buffyverse (last time i watched the series was several years ago) so my hypothesis and conclusions haven't the best data to work with , i just assumed soul=consciousness given it's what's supposed in christian mithology , which i suppose is the one used in the tv series.

So basically vampirism makes them activelly want to be dicks , i can live with that.

I however can't reconcile it with the concept of the afterlife , your morality can't experience things , your consciousness/mind does.
