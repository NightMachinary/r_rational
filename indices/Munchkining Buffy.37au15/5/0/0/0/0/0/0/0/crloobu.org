Vampires don't have a heartbeat, but they still produce saliva and breath (if they want to). And they can be poisoned. And some semblance of digestion still goes on (they can eat normal food, they just don't choose to). So some biological processes still work.

Also, you can knock them out by hitting them on the head (I think I remember this happening at least once to spike). Which implies that the brain still functions mostly normally and can black out when trauma occurs.

The problem with medicating to avoid it, is that even he isn't "quite sure" how the curse works. So if you make an incorrect guess based on incomplete knowledge, you would lose your identity. So it's a huge risk.
