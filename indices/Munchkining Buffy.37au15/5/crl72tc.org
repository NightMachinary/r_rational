Yes, that should work, although SPOILERS FOR SEASON 7

In Season 7 they delve into the mechanics a bit (or rather, make them up). Supposedly there is a proportion of the female population (size unstated, but fairly small) who have the potential to become a slayer. If all of them die, the Slayer line ends and no more Slayers will be created.

Also, at the end of Season 2 we discover that to curse a vampire with their soul all you need is an orb of thessela and Willow. Said orbs are common enough that Giles has one as a paperweight. So why not do that to every vampire, or at least as many as you have orbs?
