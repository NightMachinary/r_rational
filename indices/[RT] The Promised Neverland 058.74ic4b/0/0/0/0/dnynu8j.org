I'll admit to actually having worn coats like that in the past, though only for short intervals at a time; in my experience, you don't need glue if you're willing to adjust from time to time. Given that there's no wind in an underground shelter, he should be fine.

Then again, with the amounts of gun violence the final page foreshadows, he might be in for a few wardrobe malfunctions...

EDIT: Scratch that. Reading the TvTropes page, there's apparently an official statement by the author of One Piece that the marine admirals' capes don't fall of because they're kept on by justice. In that case, I nominate Not-Minerva's coat to be held in place by assholeish insecurity.
