[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatCape][TvTropes]] seems to think it's more of a "cool dude" than an "angsty dude" thing, which fits, as it rejects the traditional norm of how coats are supposed to be worn. It also seems to be a "military badass" thing in anime, as even some of the more rules-abiding marines in One Piece seem to do it.

Of course, if you use TvTropes examples as your only guideline, you're also free to speculate that it means that the character is a Nazi sympathizer, given that Goering apparently wore his coats like that :/
