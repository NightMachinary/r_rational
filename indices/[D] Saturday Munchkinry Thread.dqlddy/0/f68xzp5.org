I've been working on an entropy-defying magic system that I would be interested in seeing Munchkined:

Roughly speaking, the concept is that if you perform an appropriate ritual, you can "recover" the negentropy that gets used in some area, and then later release it to achieve what you want. Some examples:

If you collect the negentropy from burning some wood, then if you later encounter something wooden that has burned or is burning, you can "unburn" it using your negentropy, which will partially restore it. Any details in the wood that cannot be inferred from the remainder are, however, going to appear from the wood you collected the negentropy from, and not the wood you spent the negentropy on; as you can only restore the negentropy that you collected. (Such details may include wood microstructure, which you maybe don't care about, but perhaps also carved text, which you very well may care about.)

Another example: if you hit a wall with a branch, the kinetic energy is going to dissipate into the wall as heat. If you collect the negentropy from this, you can later go to a different surface, and reverse the entropy to make this surface suddenly send out a burst of kinetic energy equivalent to what you initially hit the wall with. Note that this is not storing the energy, but rather, you extract the energy from the heat of the wall. (Similarly, in the unburning example, you would be extracting the energy from the heat of the air around you.)

Third example. Now we get to the "dark magic side": If you wound a person, you can store up the negentropy that this wounding used, and use this to later heal similar wounds. Note that this will not always work; for instance, if someone has received a brain injury, then using this magic to restore the brain would restore brain from the person you wounded, and not the person you're healing, as this is the person you collected the entropy from.

To define the rules more formally: If you do some ritual (haven't decided what yet, but it's probably going to be relatively elaborate and immobile for balance reasons), you can "store up the negentropy that's used" in an area (haven't yet decided what it's going to be stored in, probably some crystals with negentropy capacity proportional to their volume). Later, if you encounter some situation whose starting state is similar to the end state of the ritual, you can use the negentropy to "reverse it", with physically-possible but thermodynamically-impossible interactions happening until the end state of the situation is similar to the starting state of the ritual.

I haven't yet decided on all details yet (e.g. range, difficulty of doing the various things in question, etc.), because I haven't yet been able to figure out how extreme things this system allows, and so how much balancing is needed. I'd be curious about how much you can Munchkin it under various levels of restrictions; so feel free to try out relatively low or relatively high restrictions compared to what I described, depending on what you'd find most interesting.
