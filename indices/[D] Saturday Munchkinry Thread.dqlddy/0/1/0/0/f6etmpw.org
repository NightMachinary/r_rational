I'm talking about the problem we've discovered with [[https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/transplant/programs/reconstructive_transplant/hand_transplant.html#finding_donors][hand transplants.]] They work, but on top of tissue matching you need to match skin tone, race, gender, etc. as closely as possible, or you might psychologically reject the hand due to body dysmorphia. Your brain becomes convinced the hand isn't part of you and wigs out. This problem would become even worse if you replaced your entire body. Everything would feel out of place.
