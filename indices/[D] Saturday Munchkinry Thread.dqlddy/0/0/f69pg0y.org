About your branch example, for a lot of impacts the kinetic energy will dissipate through loss of potential energy from the objects deforming. Would you be able to harness that negentropy as well? For that you can build up a stock of "physical deformation repair" negentropy for a given material, which you can then use to do things like repair armor/weapons in the middle of a fight, or for more mundane examples perform proactive maintenance of structures through infusions of repair energy.

For the wood example, do you still need all the products of the reaction (ashes, smoke??) to reverse it, or is matter created ex nihilo from the template of source negentropy? If so, there probably needs to be some kind strict definition on what chemical reactions can be used to extract negentropy from, or you'll have to deal with the knock-on affects of harvesting negentropy through creating solvents of rare earth metals (which can then be precipitated out and reused) to create more of the same out of nothing.
