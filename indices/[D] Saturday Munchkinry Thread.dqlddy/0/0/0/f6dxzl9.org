  Would you be able to harness that negentropy as well?
#+end_quote

Yes. I don't think the specific examples you mentions seem particularly broken/Munchkin-ish (ability to magically repair things is a pretty standard magical thing, no?), though, but I wonder if one could figure out some broken things based on it.

#+begin_quote
  For the wood example, do you still need all the products of the reaction (ashes, smoke??) to reverse it, or is matter created ex nihilo from the template of source negentropy?

If one was to be physically strict, one would need /everything/ to be present in a nice way. However, such strictness would probably not make for a very interesting magic system, so one will have to take some creative liberties and allow some things that "feel like" they should be allowed, even if in a very strict physical sense they shouldn't be.

I'm not as informed about how combustion works as I should be. As a result, I don't know what the smoke and ashes correspond to in terms of the initial wood, and I don't know what happens to wood smoke in the atmosphere (does the atmosphere contain the same chemicals as wood smoke, just dispersed more evenly?). This makes it hard for me to know how big of a creative liberty it would be to allow "unburning" without having smoke or ashes present.

(Part of the smoke is presumably the carbon, which is a pretty central part of the wood. But this carbon will also be present in the atmosphere normally, no? So at least this element would not need preexisting smoke to unburn.)

For the specific case of "unburning", I don't think it makes much of a difference, though, as you need /a lot/ of heat to do the unburning, which likely means having a fire next to it to generate said heat. This fire could then provide the smoke and ashes needed too. (Hmm, and I guess it could also provide the negentropy, though as mentioned I'd make this system require elaborate rituals to extract the negentropy, so it may be more practical to have it pre-collected.)

#+begin_quote
  If so, there probably needs to be some kind strict definition on what chemical reactions can be used to extract negentropy from, or you'll have to deal with the knock-on affects of harvesting negentropy through creating solvents of rare earth metals (which can then be precipitated out and reused) to create more of the same out of nothing.
#+end_quote

While trying to work out how to handle this might be interesting, I think I would handle it by taking the creative liberty of just handwaving it away; pretending that the rare metals don't exist or aren't necessary, rather than figuring out a system that avoid exploitation. It'd probably be very difficult to create a magic system that doesn't break when one does very careful exploits in terms of marginal increases and decreases of minerals, energy, etc. that happen as a result of the magic.

(Though I am still interested in hearing ways and ideas for how such marginal increases could be exploited, so I can be prepared about them when thinking about how to develop the magic system.)
