Necromancy is the obvious use of this.

This isn't a Muchkinry idea...but one idea that immediately springs to mind is the risks of using necromancy with this system. An Evil Wizard kills a random guy in order to resurrect his equally evil son/spouse/partner...but the brain is too damaged and the resurrected guy ends up with the mind of the (perfectly nice) victim. Lots of plot possibilities here.

I also wonder what happens if you do something with a massive impact, like cause an avalanche, torch a city, start a forest fire, spread smallpox...
