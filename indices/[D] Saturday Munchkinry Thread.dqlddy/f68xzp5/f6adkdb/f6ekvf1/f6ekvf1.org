A lot of those would definitely be good examples of what the magic system would allow, but I don't really think they're overpowered enough to be considered Munchkin-ish? Some comments:

  Curing dysphoria? (Big maybe, might just replace gender dysphoria with total body dysmorphia)
#+end_quote

I'm not sure why you think it might be replaced by total body dysmorphia. Is it that you going with a sort of body-map model of gender dysphoria? Because if so, I would decide that this wouldn't cause body dysmorphia, both because it makes the resulting magic system more interesting, and because I don't find the body-map model of gender dysphoria plausible (but that's another story...).

  Compressing a bunch of people into one person for the purposes of evacuation or other situations where limited numbers of "real" people can survive.
#+end_quote

By this it sounds like you mean transferring the people into the person, rather than having the person carry their entropy in the crystals or whatever. If that's what you mean, I don't think this would work because it would require a much bigger brain than there's space for in their head. However, it would be possible for the one person to carry their entropy crystals, which might be an interesting dynamic.

  Super wierd, lossy immortality for the rich and sufficiently innurred to dysphoria.
#+end_quote

Since the ritual to collect the entropy is difficult to move, it would probably more be like a static field that covers an area than it would be a mobile thing. This suggests that it might not so much be for the rich so much as it would be for whoever lives in this place.

  I imagine a world where this is possible wouldn't have a traditional death penalty, as replacing the condemned with more valuable resurrection targets would be strictly correct. The punishment for attempted murder which left the victim recoverable could involve being replaced by your victim.
#+end_quote

This makes me think, the whole possibility of recovering targets would create incentives for murderers to leave their targets irrecoverable in order to prevent there from being witnesses. Also, I guess legal systems might do weaker punishments of the murderers make sure to keep their targets recoverable, e.g. by capturing their negentropy.
