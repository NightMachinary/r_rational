On reversing brain damage...

A sufficiently motivated person could ritually destroy someone's brain to save up their whole self. Then, they could find a brain dead body and return the person they killed to life. Possible applications of this include:

- Curing dysphoria? (Big maybe, might just replace gender dysphoria with total body dysmorphia)

- Torturing an enemy by dropping them into an incompatable body.

- Faking your own death by actually killing yourself, then coming back.

- Escaping from a dying body into a living one.

- Compressing a bunch of people into one person for the purposes of evacuation or other situations where limited numbers of "real" people can survive.

- Turning the bodies of dying enemy soldiers into vessels for your own soldiers who almost died.

- Super wierd, lossy immortality for the rich and sufficiently innurred to dysphoria.

I imagine a world where this is possible wouldn't have a traditional death penalty, as replacing the condemned with more valuable resurrection targets would be strictly correct. The punishment for attempted murder which left the victim recoverable could involve being replaced by your victim.
