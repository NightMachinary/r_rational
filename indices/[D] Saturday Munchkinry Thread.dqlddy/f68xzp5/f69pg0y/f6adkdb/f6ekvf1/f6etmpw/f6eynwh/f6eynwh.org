I'm not surprised about needing to match blood type etc. with hand transplants due to things like immune system rejection, but I've never heard about it causing body dysmorphia. Do you have a source for that? (I can't see anything talking about it in the link. The only form of rejection it mentions is immunological.) It seems like people might prefer that skin tone, race, gender, etc. matches just so it looks natural even if they could live with it not matching.
