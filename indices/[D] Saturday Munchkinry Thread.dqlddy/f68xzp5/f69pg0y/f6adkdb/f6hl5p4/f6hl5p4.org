You say that this ritual is 'difficult'. But /how/ is it difficult?

Option the first: The ritual requires a prepared space, with runes carefully placed and crystals aligned with each other, which takes a terribly long time to set up - but once it has been set up, it can be re-used indefinitely. Every wizard worth his salt has a 'ritual room' set up, ready for use (possibly multiple times a day) and junior wizards might rent the usage of senior wizards' ritual rooms (if they don't have their own one yet).

Option the second: Each use of the ritual requires costly reagent and rare incenses; also, the runes need to be re-drawn every time, a lengthly process. It's not worth the bother of setting up a dedicated 'ritual room' because you need to re-do the setup every time /anyway/. You're lucky if you can store up one batch of negentropy a day.
