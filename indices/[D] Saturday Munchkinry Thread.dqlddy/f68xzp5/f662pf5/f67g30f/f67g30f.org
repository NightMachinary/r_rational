Once a week you are granted one minute of time where you possess your body one year in the future. The future you possess is one year without these peeks so it's like your power just stopped for a year. You don't have memory from the year in future you can only remember what you normally would so only through research can you learn. How do you abuse this power? What plans do you make? Where can you take it?
