Nine anomalous masses of [[http://molview.org/?cid=67126][parabanic acid]], ranging in size from exactly two molecules to half an eyelash, appear at random around the world, displacing any matter in their way as they materialise, from rock to rainwater to rarefied air.

Each molecule therein is anomalous in that it can't be allowed to vibrate or rotate with energy corresponding to a temperature of ≥500 K for more than 8.57 μs straight, or Something Very Bad will happen. You can't create new anomalous molecules of parabanic acid, but breaking any bond permanently removes the anomaly for that (now ex-)molecule. Normal and anomalous parabanic acid are indistinguishable.

The anomalous masses eventually settle in spots undetectable to human senses, conveniently missing places that'd overheat them into doing Something Very Bad. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, because they're basically 10<sup>−31</sup> of the outer crust, but the news will get out eventually, and you never know what /bright ideas/ those media consumers will come up with.

Your problem: If you were evil and highly creative, how would you trigger Something Very Bad? Since you aren't that evil, how best would you mess up such plans? Bonus points for low-tech answers. Assume ordinary physics, save for the given violations, /which are irreproducible/.

This fictional world has modern resources plus these relevant modifications: * AI for media creation, engineering, organisational management --- above human level * Microbots, but no nanotechnology * Universal communications --- radio or better available
