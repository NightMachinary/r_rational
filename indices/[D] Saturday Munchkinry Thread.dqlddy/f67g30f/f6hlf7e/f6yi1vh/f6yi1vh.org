The lottery will fail. It is a system so chaotic that the differing gravitational influence from you going to buy a ticket where you did not before will alter the outcome. Stock rises that came about from the release of information about events already in motion or inevitable is the best bet - that is, companies that saw their value go up because their mining operations struck gold/oil, their new product was much better than the market had anticipated or the like.
