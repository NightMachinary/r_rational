In essence, every week I split off a timeline where I know that the timeline is doomed and the only effect it will have on the prime timeline is what information I can relay back to the past.

Relaying technology advances back is almost pointless, a year isn't enough time for groundbreaking advances that aren't already in the works, so at best I could identify the next big thing before it's a big thing and make some money off the stock market. Stock market manipulation in general is something I can do, and a modest pile of money would serve me well whatever I end up doing.

The /real/ takeaway from this, though, is that I spin off doomed timelines where I know they're doomed, and that changes the risk/reward weights of a lot of things.

Step 1 is proving the validity of my power, which shouldn't take more than a week and a sufficiently-controlled experiment. Now I've proven to whoever it is I've approached that I'm the real deal.

Step 2 is whoever I've teamed up with doing all sorts of crazy risky things that might go horribly wrong, with a timeline of one year. They compile the ruinous but productive results at the end of the year and show them to me, and I relay the information back to them with only a week having passed.

Imagine a tech company investing all of their wealth in R&D on every crazy idea that they can think of, and at the end of a year of that I tell them which ones worked. I clear the fog of war on innovation.

Imagine the US government violently destabilizing a foreign government to get access to their files, and at the end of the year I relay all the most important information back to them without anyone being the wiser. I clear the fog of war on military intel.

Heck, imagine the US government destabilizing a foreign government and having me relay /whether it worked or not/. After I tell them the results they know if their plans will work or not, out to one year of consequence. I become the lynchpin that topples empires, and at no harm to myself.
