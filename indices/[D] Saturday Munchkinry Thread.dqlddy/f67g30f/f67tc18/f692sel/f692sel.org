Yeah the destroyed time-lines are a key feature as you can be a little bit more callous with your actions without having to deal with the consequences. Unethical research like MoL is possible without actually doing anything. Society changes as you can work on a plan for the year each week and just look at the final results. One thing that I just thought of was if you die somehow you'd just lose one minute without learning anything so you can't save yourself from anything sudden or very large like a meteor or nuclear attack. It feels like a reasonable power to be successful without being over powered.
