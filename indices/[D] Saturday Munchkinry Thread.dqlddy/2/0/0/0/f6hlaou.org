  One thing that I just thought of was if you die somehow you'd just lose one minute without learning anything so you can't save yourself from anything sudden or very large like a meteor or nuclear attack.

This could be dangerous. If you /miss/ your minute you'll think you're in the Doomed Timeline and set things in motion that should not be set in motion in a non-Doomed Timeline.
