Your view is a little too cynical given the power involved here. I don't doubt that the first government he tries to collaborate with this power is going to hold onto him at all costs, but it would be more of a gilded cage rather than a guantanamo torture dungeon. Trying to physically coerce you into cooperation under shitty conditions is likely to just kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, since they have no way of validating any actual future intel.
