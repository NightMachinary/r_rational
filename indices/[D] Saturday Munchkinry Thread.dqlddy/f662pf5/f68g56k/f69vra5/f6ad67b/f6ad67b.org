It's a combination of all of those factors, besides biological elimination. Chemicals exposed to chemicals they can interact with will do so, energy will speed this up. These tiny spots of acid will appear, and react quickly with other molecules and themselves. They have high relative surface area (due to tiny volume), high reactivity (due to being an acid), lots of things (minerals) to react with, and will be relatively warm. I don't have access to a computer at the moment to learn about this acid specifically, but unless acids are very pure, not provided energy, and are in an unreactive container they tend to break down quickly. There's probably public chemical stability tests for parabanic acid available

Also by your definition acids in general would be quickly inactivated, they are constantly breaking and reforming bonds with hydrogen even when we consider them stable. Acids are essentially molecules with hydrogen they have a very weak attachment to, how easily they give hydrogen to others is what determines the strength of an acid.
