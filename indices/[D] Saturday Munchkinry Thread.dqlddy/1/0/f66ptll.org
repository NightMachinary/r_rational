  The anomalous masses eventually settle in spots undetectable to human senses, conveniently missing places that'd overheat them into doing Something Very Bad

This is very suspicious and munchkinable. I will focus on the quoted fragment right now.

I'd try to somehow extend the 'human senses' so they cover the entire Earth (or at least the entire accessible Earth) so they don't appear anymore.

Probably some kind of brain-machine interface.

But again, hey, how do they know which places are OK to settle and which are NOT OK?

Maybe I could trick them somehow, mislead the mechanism that determine which places are OK....

Is their 'is place OK to settle' mechanism able to see the future? Will they appear in front of incoming lava stream?
