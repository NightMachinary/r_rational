  It's a bit like being a rational actor on the front lines of WW1.

I think that's where a new MacGuffin comes in. It doesn't need to be the solution to all the world's problems (and shouldn't be), but if it can just get the mad science chemistry or the weird teleporting mass thing within reach early on it would make for a story with actors who had some agency.

If you are the first guy on an engineering project to put together a tank in WWI, what you do suddenly matters a whole lot, even if the first tank out is kinda shit. Same with the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Hunley_%28submarine%29][American Civil War and the first sub]]. That's an interesting story even if it doesn't swing the tide by itself, with only a half dozen or so decision makers.

And hey, it would be nice to read a rational fanfic where that /wasn't/ enough to win the day and people still died, like happens in AoT all the time.
