I agree with your post's points about the magical, physics-defying things that happen in the world being strange, but I don't think that precludes a rationalfic!AoT story. As long as the author has a good set of offstage rules governing the events, it's possible to have rational characters and irrational NPCs interacting to create a rationalist or rational story.

Remember, just because it's rational doesn't mean it has to obey our interpretation of physics. In the as-yet-unwritten rational!Gurren Lagann, Simon still goes beyond the impossible and punches reason to the curb. Simon's irrationality was cultivated by Kamina, who saw that irrational thought gave Simon power. Sometimes, the rational course of action is to be irrational.
