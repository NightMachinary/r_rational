The Mobility Gear is, by far, the coolest part of the show - *cutting out the spiderman cables would be like writing HPMOR in a non-magical world.* Yuck. I say take their existence as given, then analyze /how/ they might work, and ask what sorts of clever tricks /and/ clever challenges might these mechanics present!

As for intelligence of the characters: the true bad guys and their motives still have much to be revealed. The government and some military officials are off to save their own skin, and are content to let the rest of the world burn - this is despicable, but quite realistic. It's even rational, according to the problem of collective action - they can let someone else save the world while they stay safe. Meanwhile, among the heroes and villains we see so far, no one holds the idiot ball to my notice. Heroes take their job very seriously, and don't take stupid risks. So points there.

Honestly, there's not a glaring hole to correct in a Rational AoT, as far as I can see. Have more fun with the 3D Mobility Gear, replace cowardly government officials with ruthless and forward-thinking individuals, have the humans better prepared, and step up the threat from the baddies accordingly.

Also, if you're on the fence, watch it. I never watch TV anymore, but my word, that show is amazing, and it was all I could do not to binge it.
