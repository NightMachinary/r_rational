Timelooped is right, there's a lot of background wonkiness and secret reasons going on in the background of the manga that make it a bit early for this kind of criticism.

That aside, generally speaking I would expect humans to make underground tunnel systems, unless titans showed both the ability to sense humans underground and the capability and intelligence to dig well. You might even see a slightly gurren lagann-esque underground human expansion thing going on.

The only possible easy answer to the titan problem as a whole is some kind of plague or bioweapon. Again, wonky physiology magical stuff going on with the titans might nullify this in the canon, but if titans were just huge, dumb, predatory animals, it could work extremely well. You'd need to develop it in a sect of humanity completely separated from the rest and in secret (potential to wipe all of humanity out significant), but it's certainly feasible.
