AoT has a recently crapsacked world. Tech stagnation isn't really their fault, as they get stomped down to almost nothing and have only 100 years to recover. If anything, them being able to make those huge walls and maintain gunpowder and complex pneumatics at all is what is unrealistic. It is hinted that humanity surviving was intentionally allowed by some intelligent agency, in fact.

What with all the magical, physics defying stuff going on in the plot and world building, I'd just invent a new titan-esque thing to base a rational plot around for a rational fic. I'm not familiar enough with the story to give other than obvious ideas, but it seems to me that the usual flesh-only supercomputing, high-energy exploits, and a universe that plays fast and loose with mad-science chemistry would be a good place to start.
