Agreed, I find the 100 years cowering behind the wall to be entirely believable. 99.9% of the population of earth appears to have been wiped out - that's more than enough to usher in a new dark age. We had 1,000 years in europe without developing much military tech to boast of. Also, yes, in large populations, you always have a core of ambitious competent people who move the important levers, but in a single city, there's no guarantee you'll get people competent and ambitious and motivated and who actually succeed at getting a large amount of peasants to follow them.

How they maintained as much technology as they did? That is a little more tenuous, but there clearly was an organized effort (or otherwise an act of "god") to build those walls and set up the society, so the military was almost certainly in place from day 1. The only highish-tech items you see are pneumatics, gunpowder, and railroads - all very important strategic tech. If there's any knowledge that'll survive a dark age, it'll be knowledge of religious or military significance.
