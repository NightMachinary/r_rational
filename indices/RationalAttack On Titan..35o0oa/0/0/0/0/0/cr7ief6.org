  It's a bit like being a rational actor on the front lines of WW1. You might be making better decisions but the end result is in favour of you getting killed just like the rest.

A better comparison might be, speedrunning a platformer versus speedrunning a racing game. In most games, minimizing time isn't the explicit goal, so there's usually easy exploits around saving time because the developers weren't thinking in terms of preventing that. Racing games, meanwhile, were designed around a zero-sum time-based competition, so there's (usually) no low-hanging time-saving fruit.

Likewise, military settings already assume that everyone is sensibly using decent tactics and strategy and maintaining decent OPSEC/COMSEC and running an R&D department and doing siege and trench and guerilla warfare where appropriate and performing espionage and trying to sway the locals with propaganda, etc etc. So there's no low-hanging killing-the-other-guys fruit in a military setting. (So when there /is/ a shortcut, it's usually more an intersection of military with diplomatic or economic interests. All the Vorkosigan total-war-is-imminent scenarios resolve this way.)
