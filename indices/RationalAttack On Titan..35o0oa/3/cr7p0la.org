The titans as portrayed in the series are very stupid. Stupid enough to walk into a wall of spikes to try to get at the humans above it.

After the fall of the outer wall, there were 250,000 people who could not be fed, and were sent out to be eaten by Titans. 250,000 people killed in the most brutal fashion of the series. The most elite warriors in the army tend to have killed an average of 10 titans, for perhaps 1000 titan kills in the entire army.

This means we have 250,000 people who could have been used as fishing bait - humans attached to hooks of sufficient size to suspend a titan from - and killed 200,000 titans instead of 1,000, without being any more cruel than the leadership in the series. Given how stupid the titans are, there are probably ways to do this which aren't 100% fatal to the humans being used.

--------------

The area around the gates is the worst defensible place in the city: a large, flat open terrain where the titans can roam free and humans are bound to the ground. That makes no sense: the gates are a bottleneck and a known weak point (after the fall of the outer wall, but also because common sense) and should therefore be designed to be the most easily defensible.

The entire city should be designed to be inconvenient for Titans. In the series all the rooftops seem to be conveniently at arm height. Buildings should be too high for Titans to see over, removing tactical information and allowing them to be more easily attacked from high ground.

Underground tunnels should also be commonplace, too narrow for Titans to enter and too deep for them to break into.

Use giant tree forest wood in construction. There's enough of it to go around.

tl;dr: AoT is running on rule of cool, at the cost of making leaders tactically incompetent.
