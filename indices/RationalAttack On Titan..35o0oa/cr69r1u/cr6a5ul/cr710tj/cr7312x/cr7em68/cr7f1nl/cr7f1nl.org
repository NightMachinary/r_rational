I don't think [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws][Clarke's Thid Law]] is meant as a statement of fact so much as more of a way of explaining outside-context problems to the layperson. It is so outside everyday experience that thinking of it as "magic" comes naturally to the untrained. The threshold for "sufficiently advanced" is too subjective and too general to be useful as anything beyond a starting point. Much like the concept of "magic".

EDIT: added link and made specific reference to which of "Clarke's Laws"
