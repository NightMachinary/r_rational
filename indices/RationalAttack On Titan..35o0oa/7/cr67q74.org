Flanking helicopters with harpoons on chains with heads designed to, on command, carve out a shape of that point on the neck? Make the ends detachable on command in case a titan gets a hold of a head. If it weren't for the Irregulars, this should already be enough to keep control of any connected shape with no forests or the like near the border.
