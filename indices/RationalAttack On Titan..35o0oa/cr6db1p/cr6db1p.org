(Spoilers below)

As far as wall design, it would change every few decades. There would be pockets of Titans within the city that were sealed off and exterminated in the process of reconstruction and likewise there would be instances of individual towns getting isolated and surrounded.

The 3D gear has to change, but not as much as most people are thinking. The very specific weakness of the Titans means the gear as shown is in fact almost optimized, given the tech we know human society has. It's mentioned that projectile blades don't have enough power to penetrate the neck, even when aimed perfectly. The Titans burn hot, making ropes or even chains not viable for more than a few seconds, especially when combined with their strength. If you dig a trench, it will fill with living Titans and the next wave will walk over their heads.

The Titan-shifters complicate things, as usual. If you can't get rid of it, roll with it. Titans don't get their mass from our universe, but rather an adjacent hell-dimension. That's why they burn hot. The heat is leftover from the punch between realities. That's also how the shifters can grow fifty meters in height and why they leave their Titan bodies behind when they change back. This makes the walls being made of abandoned shifter husks especially practical, as its a fast and seemingly infinite building material that can be molded by the intent of the architect in a matter of minutes instead of months.

That's all I've got right now.
