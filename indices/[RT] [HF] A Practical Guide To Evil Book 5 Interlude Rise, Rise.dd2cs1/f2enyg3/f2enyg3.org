Hm. I seem to recall that Cat couldn't even think of Hierophant by the Name 'Apprentice' after he was no longer of that Name--how can former-Thief do so of the Black Knight?

I've been wondering whether this 'Malicia' is really just the Dead King being really /really/ good at acting (more so than anyone's guessed), in which case learning about the whole thing is going to come as a huge shock to the real Malicia.

I'm also wondering about how long he's going to sit on the Intercessor information before finally revealing it to everyone. Hopefully not in a "Hah-hah! I TRICKED you into bringing your war to the very heart of my citadel, just so that I could tell you all with no one listening in!" long-lasting gambit.
