I can sympathise with the very real problem that, if you could use gene editing to fix people's various health problems, people who did /not/ have access to it would then be disadvantaged. If gene editing was accessible based on wealth, then we have a problem, because that basically creates a superior race of rich supermen. However, if gene editing was, as it should, free and available to everyone, then the problem is a bit different. Parents refusing to use it, like the ones in GATTACA, would frankly be more akin to our antivaxxers than anything. They're just making things worse for their children for no other reason than a vague, fallacious idea of what's "natural". However the children themselves should not suffer for it, and mechanisms need to be in place to guarantee that. This includes avoiding meaningless discrimination.

That said, of course, "you can't be an astronaut if you suffer from heart disease" is NOT meaningless discrimination any more than "you can't drive if you're blind" is. Even now, astronauts are pretty selected human specimen - I think most people just couldn't become astronauts even if they tried (example: I'm asthmatic, I'm shortsighted, I have back problems, and no matter how hard I try I can't seem to build any serious muscle. I probably wouldn't make the cut no matter how much I tried, and that's still assuming I started younger than I am now). So if anything gene editing would /increase/ the amount of people who have access to the occasion of being astronauts, not put obstacles. The protagonist simply happens to have two fucking dumbass parents who are entirely to blame for most of his woes.

Still waiting for "GATTACA 2: A member of our crew had a stroke in space, what the fuck do we do?".
