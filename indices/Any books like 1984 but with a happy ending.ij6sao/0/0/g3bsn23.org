I guess, a really bad dystopia that has an actually feasible society. Most dystopian books are poorly written and focus more on character development than actual world design, the plot is then shafted five times to hell whenever the Mary Sue needed it to and the dystopian world then wraps up everything cleanly in a Disney ending.

Rant aside, yes, a rational dystopian (or anti-utopia) book with a happy but reasonable ending would be nice. Plausible villains, a feasible society, heroes who understand, accept and revile in grey philosophy/non-dualism/etc. to achieve the greater good and an ending that isn't rushed and quickly tied up lazily.
