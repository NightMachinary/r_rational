I'm pretty sure Brave New World sounded a lot more like a dystopia in the 1930s than it does now. There are certainly elements that stick out as ahead of its time, and elements that are retrograde. (The African baby factory is more productive than the English one but they're trying!)

In general large parts of the book seem like they're written about eugenics gone too far (the social crusading movement, not the Nazi racial purity fetish). As we face the excesses of individualism now, the fears of the book seem far less relevant.
