I never read Brave New World, but from the bits and pieces I heard of it it doesn't sound /awful/, for a dystopian world. I think with dystopia there's also an issue of separating things that are genuinely horrifying from things that are just /different/. Describe our world to a medieval man, it would sound dystopian, and he likely wouldn't think all the planes and modern medicine are worth losing your soul in such a godless era.

This usually especially strikes me for "yeah, in this future everyone is actually, genuinely happy and lives in peace... but it's all built on a LIE" dystopias. Like, yeah, sure, you think our world doesn't also exist by perpetuating and believing fundamentally fictional social narratives? There's worse original sins for a society than believing e.g. in a fictitious past. If I lived in such a society, and someone "brought me the truth", and then I saw my entire world collapse again into chaos and violence because of it, I'd be pretty pissed.
