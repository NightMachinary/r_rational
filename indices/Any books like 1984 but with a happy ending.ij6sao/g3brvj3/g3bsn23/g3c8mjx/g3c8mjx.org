/The Stone Dance of the Chameleon/ by Ricardo Pinto is a fantasy (very low fantasy) dystopia with a happy (well, maybe) ending. That being said, the dystopia is not really the focus of the books as such.

Honestly, /I/ can only really recommend the first book, but it comes strongly recommended. The others are not bad as such, I just didn't enjoy them very much (if you just ignore the shuffling grasping of the idiot ball in the last ten pages it stands very well on its own).

Ian Irvine's /The Three Worlds Cycle/ is pretty dystopic. Honestly, considering your wishes it is a rather good fit.
