I did not find those well written. At all. To the point where I couldn't even finish the series despite my friend's recommendations. When I was first reason, something seemed a little off to me and was making me dissatisfied with the writing style, but I couldn't quite place it. Then there was a particular scene that crystallized the problem for me.

The main character is attempting to sneak into a building. He does so by ascending a wall empty-handed during a high wind. He spends several pages doing this, and at absolutely no point in the entire process is there a single bit of actual tension. You can tell the author tries, but those attempts boil down to "the wind rose, and I was worried I was going to lose my grip. But then I didn't, and I kept going". By that point in the book, you know that there is a zero percent chance he fails to scale the wall or be unsuccessful in his mission, so the attempts to add tension feel useless. The entirety of the first two books have that same feeling.

TL;DR: I liked the concept of the books, but it was poorly executed and I cannot recommend.
