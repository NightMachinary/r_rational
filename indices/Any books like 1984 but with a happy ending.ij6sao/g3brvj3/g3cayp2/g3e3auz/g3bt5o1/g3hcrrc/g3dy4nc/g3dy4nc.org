For a blast from the past, there's Johnny Zed (John Betancourt 1988), a sorta cyberpunk revolutionary book. They more or less win the revolution, and things do sorta get better, but they are kinda mired down by all the work of actually governing afterwards. There's no, "and everything was totally better after the revolution" type ending.
