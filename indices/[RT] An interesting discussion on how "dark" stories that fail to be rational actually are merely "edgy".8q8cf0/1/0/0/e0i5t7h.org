This is true. That said, when it comes to roleplaying characters in particular (which I understand to be the topic of the screencapped thread), my experience is that characters motivated by sadism are almost universally badly written edgelords. Inexperienced or lazy writers who want to write dark, violent characters gravitate toward "cruelty for its own sake" as a motive because it's easy, so the archetype is dominated by bad writing.
