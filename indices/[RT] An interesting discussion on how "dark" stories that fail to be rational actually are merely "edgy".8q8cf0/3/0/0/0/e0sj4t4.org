  Stories are often about incredible situations

That doesn't give a free pass to do whatever you want though. Good worldbuilding gives a few "incredible" axioms or changes to the world that we're asked to swallow without question, and then in return, as readers, we expect everything else to flow according to logic and probability within that framework. Anything else is an asspull or plot contrivance.

For example, even if all of a sudden human cloning becomes readily available (a setting we're just asked to swallow), that doesn't make it more likely to run into two unrelated sadists.

Now, if the axiom was "humans now each develop a superpower but this superpower can influence their personality", /then/ it might in fact be more likely to run into two unrelated sadists, so it's okay to have your character do so in this case.

"Well it's [fantasy/fiction/scifi]" is never an okay justification for random unlikely things to happen just for plot convenience. I'm not saying I'll automatically drop a story if this happens once or twice (since it's near impossible to avoid completely), but every time it does happen (like meeting 2 unrelated sadists), it's still a negative point for me against the story and will lessen my enjoyment.
