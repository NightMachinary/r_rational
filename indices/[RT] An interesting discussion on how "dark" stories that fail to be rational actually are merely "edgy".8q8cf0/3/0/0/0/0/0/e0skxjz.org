I think what you want to say is that "the anthropic principle is applicable to fiction" and I agree with that which is why I said it isn't a dealbreaker, but which would you rather read about:

1. A story where 1 unbelievable thing happens, leading to a series of believable but interesting things happening
2. A story where 20 unbelievable but interesting things happen

The difference is that in #1, it doesn't break suspension of disbelief after you've accepted the first incredible event/axiom/setting. It allows you to then /predict/ what's going to happen later on in the story with some amount of credibility, to use evidence to figure out what's really going on in the story world from partial descriptions and scattered facts, and to look forward to a satisfying resolution.

Whereas #2 allows asspulls and plot contrivance whenever and causes you to stop trying to think to deeply into the story because /anything could happen/.

If you don't strongly prefer #1 over #2, I'm not really sure why you're on this sub.
