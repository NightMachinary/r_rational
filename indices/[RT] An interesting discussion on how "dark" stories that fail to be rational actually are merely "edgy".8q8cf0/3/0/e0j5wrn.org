Elfen Lied's edginess is aggravating cause its stretching probability beyond its breaking point.

Sadism on the whole, is rather rare. and the gruesome pointless "i really want to cut open a puppy" is really really fucking rare. To the point that if your story includes 2 unrelated characters with the trait, its already stretching credibility.

Elfen lied gives this character trait to every non mc the girl ever interacts with, at which point the viewer starts wondering how this society ever functioned.
