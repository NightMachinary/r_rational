How would you describe your definitions of darkness and edginess? A lot of people consider edginess as a bad attempt at darkness or darkness just for the sake of it, which is why we get the above conclusions. Even with this definition I agree with you, a text can be both rational and edgy, but I wouldn't /expect/ someone to write that combination and for me to enjoy it. An example of it does not come to mind, so I may simply have misjudged my expectations.
