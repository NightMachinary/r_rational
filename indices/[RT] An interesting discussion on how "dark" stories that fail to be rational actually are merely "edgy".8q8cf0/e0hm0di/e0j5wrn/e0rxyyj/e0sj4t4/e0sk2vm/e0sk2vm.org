  Good worldbuilding gives a few "incredible" axioms or changes to the world that we're asked to swallow without question, and then in return, as readers, we expect everything else to flow according to logic and probability within that framework. Anything else is an asspull or plot contrivance.

Yes but even in good world building we understand that we're still probably reading a story that is incredibly unlikely. If we were to choose a random spot in the universe and observe it, we'd find nothing worth writing about. Most stories are built upon particularly momentous or unlikely occurrences. The farmer boy being destined to be King, well 99.999999% of farmer boys are not destined, but who is going "Well this really ruined my credibility".

  "Well it's [fantasy/fiction/scifi]" is never an okay justification for random unlikely things to happen just for plot convenience.

That's not my justification and I didn't mention genre at all in my post. My justification is it's fiction. It's a story you are reading. By necessity it must be unusual otherwise it would not be interesting.

  it's still a negative point for me against the story and will lessen my enjoyment.

The odds of two sadists meeting might be infinitely small, but the story of that event is not of the same interest as one where a sadist meets another person. Every combination of a deck of cards maybe be equally random, but you'll only hear about it when someone draws a royal flush, because that's the only interesting situation. No one will tell you about the time they drew a 3, 6, K, 7, and K...
