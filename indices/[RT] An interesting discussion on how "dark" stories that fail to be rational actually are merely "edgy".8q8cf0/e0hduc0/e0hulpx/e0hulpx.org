  in 'Dark' stories, characters, including the bad guys, act like logical, rational human beings; all the cruelty has a purpose, a guiding intelligence behind it that makes sense

I agree with this, with the caveat that sadism must be considered a valid, rational reason for cruelty. Not that sadism in itself is valid and rational, but that sadism exists, and sadists will be cruel just for cruelty's sake.
