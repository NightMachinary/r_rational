I know this isn't cool to admit, but I love me some edginess in my stories. That said, I can't stand it when it's the only noteworthy quality of a story or done for its own sake. Like, for example, I enjoyed Akame ga Kill because despite its edginess, it didn't take itself seriously all the time and never tried to sell itself as something it wasn't. Elfen Lied, on the other hand, just tries too hard to shock the audience and takes itself way too seriously for such a ridiculously stupid narrative.

I really don't think edgy and dark are two sides of the same coin, where edginess is a failed attempt at darkness. Imho, it's more like "dark" is a type of theme or atmosphere and edginess is a stylistic choice in how to present your story. You can be incredibly dark without being edgy and you can be edgy without being dark. It's just that edginess if often confused with dark because they both work well together.
