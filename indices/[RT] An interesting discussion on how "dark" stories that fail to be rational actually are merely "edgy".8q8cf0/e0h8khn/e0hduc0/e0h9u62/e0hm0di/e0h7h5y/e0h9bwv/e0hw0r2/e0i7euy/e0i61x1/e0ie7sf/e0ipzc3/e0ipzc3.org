For me personally it's not a huge deal. I'm a programmer and I've created a small utility that lets me drag boxes on the screen and it will OCR the text and read it aloud. I have some residual vision so I can draw the boxes correctly. It's mostly my non-technical and totally blind brethren that I'm concerned about.

I appreciate the looking out, though, and think it's a great idea to do a transcription if another text in an image pops up. I could even probably do a transcription myself if pressed, though I couldn't promise that the formatting would be correct.

Anyway I could probably have provided more context in my initial answer. But this kind of thing happens a lot and sometimes you don't have a long response in you. The point isn't to make people feel bad or be self-righteous, it's just so we can read text that's posted like everyone else.
