For some reason people dissing Game of Thrones about things like this, without putting an obligatory "(but the books actually are dark and are pretty good you should check them out!)", annoys me. I know it's unreasonable, but after too many incidents of people hating on the show, and thinking that means they can also hate on the books, means that just seeing GoT hate in general annoys me.

But back on topic, I don't find all of those ideas completely idiosyncratic. Truth be told, I think that the original poster in the threads ideas on Dark and Edgy are actually something we, as the rational subreddit, should support.

The original posters idea could essentially be summed up this; in 'Dark' stories, characters, including the bad guys, act like logical, rational human beings; all the cruelty has a purpose, a guiding intelligence behind it that makes sense. In 'Edgy' stories characters are cruel for no reason, even when it works against their own self-interests. Essentially, Edgy is what happens when Dark stories are written irrationally.

And I think I agree with that.

The other posts below it are a bit sketchy tho.
