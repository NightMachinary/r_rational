1) What is the user experience? 2) "Oni" by Bungie; Spore 3) Sunless Sea

Limb/limb interactions are SUPER HARD. Weirdly, Oni did it super well way back in the day. Spore's probably the next example, ever, of that kind of thing.

Sunless sea is a game where they tried their first concept at combat, built up much of the rest of the game (the real meat of the game, combat is just a side dish), and then had people try it. People didn't really like the combat system (which wasn't done at the time), but the devs said; Ah, well, let's try something new. And the new system was damn good.

BDD is about making sure you're focusing on the thing you actually care about: the user's experience.

What does this level of detail bring to user's experience? Why do you want it in the first place?

From your perspective, will you get stuck trying to make it, and, will you get demoralized if you STOP trying to make it?
