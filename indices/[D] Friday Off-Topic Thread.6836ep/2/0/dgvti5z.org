How many centuries?

Pasteurization is probably the big one, since it's easy to demonstrate and doesn't take much knowledge. That's 1864, so you can probably beat Pasteur to the punch. Germ theory of disease is probably another big one, but there you have to actually prove it, and good luck getting anyone to listen to you about it if you have a 21st century education and no accreditation (do you even know Latin?). You can also find cowpox (black spots on the udders of cows) and inject it in people as a crude smallpox vaccine, which would make a name for you (again, assuming that you can get permission and you're not just a mad scientist).

There are other things that would help you a lot, but which you're probably not intimately familiar with unless you've done your "prepare to be sent back to any century" homework. The Hall-Heroult process of aluminum production and Bessemer process of steel production can make you a ton of money. Knowing how to produce a current and run it through quartz to make a precision timepiece would also make a ton of money. These all work better if you have some basic knowledge of engineering though.
