Steam-powered boats (plus paddle wheels and screw propellers), non-steam engines (Otto and maybe Stirling and turbine, plus fractional distillation of petroleum into artificial analogs of then-common "naphtha"), and basic flight mechanics (lift and maybe wing warping, not to mention stability/dihedral and proper control surfaces) all were invented/discovered between around 1925 and 1775, weren't they? Those aren't too hard to explain from memory.
