Most of those, same as electricity. I can kinda describe how they work from memory (and maybe you're better), but IIRC they all took quite a lot of experimenting to go from kooky idea to functional prototype. You need people who already trust you enough to commit the time and funds, even through initial failures.

Petroleum distillation is a good idea though. Should be relatively easy to demonstrate.
