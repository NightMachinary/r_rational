If you're sent back in time a few years or decades, you can quickly make a name for yourself with accurate predictions.

If you're sent back to the middle ages or earlier, you can dazzle the world with simple tech like gunpowder, printing press, stirrups etc.

What if you're sent back just a few centuries though? I must admit my knowledge of history quickly goes hazy, and I couldn't recreate electricity or much chemistry from scratch.
