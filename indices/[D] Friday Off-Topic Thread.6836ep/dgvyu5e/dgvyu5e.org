I just watched The Road and the utter irrationality of the protagonist drove me nuts. I don't know what I was expecting exactly, but for me a story of a person making their way across a post apocalyptic landscape should contain some sign (any sign!) of intelligent decisions they're making about how to survive. I guess it was just totally the wrong film for that, but by the end I was fast forwarding just to see what happened (answer, not a lot) and shouting at the TV. I feel stupid now for not giving up earlier, but just wanted to share my frustration!
