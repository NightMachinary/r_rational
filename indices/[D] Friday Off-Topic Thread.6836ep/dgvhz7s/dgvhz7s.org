The more I hear about Joseph Cambell's story circle structure the more I dislike it. It's more of a tautology than an insight. If the main character doesn't want to go on an adventure and nothing makes them do it then there's no story. Not all protagonists protest, so saying that some do and some don't isn't an insight.

Second, not all protagonists change, particularly in older stories. Take any Greek myth, for example. Characters don't change. They either succeed and they're heroes or they anger the wrong god and are punished horribly forever.

If you try hard enough you can brutally shoehorn any story into that structure but that doesn't mean it's insightful.

I admit the reason I see it as annoying instead of false but benign is how pretentiously named the phases are.

Then there's the other stuff he said like that all humor is derived from fear and he gave plausible reasoning but it seems difficult to impossible to test scientifically. At this point I'm just kitchen sinking so I'll stop.
