Is anyone here into photography? I recently got my first interchangeable lens camera (a used sony a6000 for ~$300 -- chosen for its light weight to shave some precious ounces off on backpacking trips) and have been having a blast experimenting with it. It seems like there's so much more that I can do now compared to the cameraphones and point-and-clicks I'd been using before. I mostly like taking photos for a few reasons -- 1) it forces me to think more explicitly about how something looks, which enhances my esthetic appreciation of that thing, 2) it's fun to produce pretty photos, both by taking them and in post, so it sort of becomes an outlet for artistic expression that I can share with others, and 3) to provide a record for future generations, grandkids, etc. I love seeing old photos of my mom and grandparents, and so wish to take advantage of the greater opportunities open to me in documenting my life, travels, etc.

I'm also interested in expanding my capabilities. Have any distinct things helped fellow photography enthusiasts here improve? Beside just shooting more: I mean stuff like books, videos, etc. I made an [[https://www.instagram.com/phylogenik/][instagram account]] a little while back to post my photos, too, if anybody wouldn't mind offering a critique (most photos on there are from older, less fancy cameras, though).

Speaking of IG, it seems to be largely filled with fake users who'll spam untold numbers of photos with generic comments ("great shot!" "wonderful capture!" "wow!!" "ðŸ‘ŒðŸ”¥ðŸ‘ŒðŸ”¥ðŸ‘Œ" etc.) in the (understandable) hopes of getting more exposure (though the follow-unfollow thing is a bit annoying). They're pretty easy to spot currently, given how basic their underlying instructions are, but given the expansion of e.g. machine learning technologies I reckon it won't be long until you start seeing ones with more sophisticated [[https://cloud.google.com/vision/][image recognition algorithms]], fancier chatting [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06155][capabilities]], etc., even ones that can generate [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05396.pdf][their own images]] from randomly selected words and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v1.pdf][artistically style]] them into something more pleasing. Hell, I'm half tempted to try coding something like that up myself, just for the experience, erosion-of-social-trust be damned (ethically it would best be pretty explicit as to its fakeness, though that would get it fast banned). I wonder how the advent of these new techs will change the social media landscape? Is the future just going to be thousands of bots chatting to each other ad nauseaum? Will we see a return to smaller social groups whose legitimacy can be verified in-person, as large media followings become increasingly meaningless?
