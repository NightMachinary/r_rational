Thanks! That shot was at ISO400, 15s, and f/2, shooting with a Rokinon 12mm on a Sony a6000 body (so crop sensor -- 18mm equivalent). Plus some post in Capture One. I had longer, brighter exposures, too, but at that point the brightness of the atmosphere was the same as that of the faint stars, and while in principle it might be possible to recover that marginal increase in brightness I wasn't able to finagle it easily. I can go up to 25-30 seconds before getting noticeable star trails, but I was also impatient waiting for the image to process so I decided to bump the iso instead.

Here's another photo I took that night: [[https://i.imgur.com/WMUD5qg.png]]

I was having trouble exporting from C1 -- it kept changing the image, making the stars dimmer, which it also did on the photo on IG -- so the above imgur link is to a screenshot lol.

RE: bots -- they don't bother me, per se, at least when they're unobtrusive. The spam comments and follow-unfollows are minor inconveniences, and ultimately I want more people to see my pics, so spam comments might even help there (with how instagram chooses who to show your photos to). So with hashtags the bots serve as somewhere between a minor help and a minor necessary evil. Plus, given the IG landscape currently, popularity is pretty well detached from quality, so they just become another element in the broader game.
