Off-and-on. It sounds trite, but I like taking photos of light: fire, sunsets, etc. I fall out of photos because of the work involved in post; I like taking photos on my phone because I take only a few, and then post /one/, without any processing.

A friend has gotten big into photography, and he's found other people to do guerilla shoots with. Find some photographer friends, pick a fun(ish) location, grab some people to stand in front the camera, play.
