I haven't read Cambell's books, only heard about the theories themselves, but does Cambell actually say that all stories fit his structure, or just that it's A structure for framing stories?

Because if he said that all stories follow it, like saying "all humor is derived from fear," that's overgeneralizing for sure, yeah.
