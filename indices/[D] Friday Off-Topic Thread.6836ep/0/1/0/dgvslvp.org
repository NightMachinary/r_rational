Yes, Campbell says that, in really pretentious terms that I think you'd dislike. I do agree with a major part of the argument - that story structure is a base product of the human psyche, and that most stories will share many similarities due to emergent properties of the human mind. But if you read Campbell, you see him making broad blanket statements without qualifiers, backed up by (at best) broad interpretations of mythologies and (at worst) discredited Freudian psychology.
