We could add a tag to body parts which are comparatively high and low on the owner's body. A Charizard's head would get the High tag, and it's legs would get the Low tag, and from there we could enforce that, for melee, you have to be a certain fraction of Charizard's height to hit body parts with the high tag, with another threshold for being able to hit body parts that aren't 'low'.

For example, we could say that you need to be two thirds of Charizard's height to hit its head, and at least a fifth its height to hit its body. For a ten foot Charizard, that means you can hit its head when you're about seven feet tall or taller, and if you're less than two feet tall you can't even hit above its legs.

Moves like Low Kick could use this same system, except instead of the user's normal height we input only a fraction of the user's height, like one tenth. So if we have one ten foot tall Charizard use Low Kick against another ten foot tall Charizard, the effective 1 foot tall strike can't hit anything other than the target Charizard's legs. Given a twenty foot tall Charizard, however, its Low Kick of effective height two feet would be tall enough to hit Charizard's body, but still not its head. And all this would take for the anatomy system are 'High' and 'Low' tags on the uppermost and lowermost body parts respectively.
