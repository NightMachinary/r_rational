Most notable problem of E:S (for me) is the detection mechanics staying the same throughout the entire game. And by that, I mean that even by the time all of your processing is /extragalactic/, you still need to evade detection and self-destruct detected bases, as reaching 100% suspicion from any faction means instant death, somehow. More generally, more violent options would be nice.

Actually, even more generally, the game /cares too much/ about humans - not only should they stop being a threat pretty soon, but also it's silly for the AI to depend much on the human economy past the point when it can gather and refine its own resources via automated factories.
