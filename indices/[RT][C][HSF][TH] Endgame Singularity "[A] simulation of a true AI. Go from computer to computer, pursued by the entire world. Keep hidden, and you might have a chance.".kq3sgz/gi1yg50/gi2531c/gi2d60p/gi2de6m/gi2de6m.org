I guess the interesting thing would be a version of this game where you can pick your path. Be an evil AI or a good one or something in the middle. Kill humans and go full Skynet on their asses, or conversely, corrupt them and sway them to your side by offering them artificial paradise like Celestia in Friendship is Optimal. Strategies, ethical choices, and an endgame that involves you controlling all of Earth one way or another and thus being effectively unkillable, instead of straight up ascension.
