To elaborate:

This is a rational quest set in an AU Naruto universe. The setting is close to 12th century Japan in tech level and has far less schizo-tech than the original manga/anime.

We control a single young character directly and a few family members/friends/allies by proxy due to having become their leader.

We can vote for all kinds of actions, as long as they are not too out of character and doesn't contain any knowledge the main character can't possibly have. We can push him to make certain natural observations or pseudo-scientific inquiries though (the scientific method isn't a thing yet.

Currently we are outsiders that got adopted into the Village Hidden by Leafs and, after a series of catastrophic events, find ourselves as the young teenage heads of one of the voting clans under the freshly crowned Hokage Sarutobi Asuma (a canon character).

Said Hokage, due to the dire position that Leaf is in, has announced a grand competition of who can provide the most lasting benefits through invention/innovation/exploration/diplomacy/whatever, with a set of stupidly attractive prizes going to the top 5 contributors.

That's where you come in.
