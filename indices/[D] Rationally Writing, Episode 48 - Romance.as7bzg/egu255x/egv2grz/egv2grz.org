  On the subject of "opposites attract," I think the point that this cliche may be gesturing at is the idea that some relationships work better when you have two people whose abilities complement each other... Perhaps the sentiment behind the cliche "opposites attract" is more artfully expressed by the cliche "You complete me."

Yes, but this is all about compatibility, not attraction :) I don't think people /do/ tend to seek out those who complement each other: if anything that's a happy accident to the mostly random whims of physical attraction and the less random similarity that tends to call people to each other. All common sayings tend to sacrifice some accuracy/truth/wisdom for pithiness, but I think "Opposites attract" is particularly bad for how much it misleads vs offers insight.

  I've seen this happen in a number of on-screen romances (usually with a male lead and a female love interest) where you have a character who is interesting and dynamic and is competent and interesting in their own right, and then as soon as the relationship begins, that side character becomes solely defined by their relationship to the main character.

Oo, yeah, good point that we didn't raise in the podcast. A good way to tell when the romance has been shoehorned into the story is when exactly this happens, and there are interesting gender dynamics involved in why this tends to happen in fiction far more to women than men (even if kids aren't involved) which I don't think is entirely explained by most protagonists being male.

  One of the things I've found useful for building relationships in fiction (not just romantic relationships) is the idea that people usually measure the length of a relationship in terms of the number of encounters that two characters have had, rather than the duration of time they've spent together, in part because it's hard to measure the relative time spent in various scenes.

This is all a great point too, and it reminds me that one thing we didn't touch on in the episode is romance for side-characters rather than protagonists, and how it's much harder to build a compelling and detailed romance for side characters, but that that they also tend to be more easily accepted as long as they're not /too/ incompatible because it's assumed that a lot of the bonding time was "off screen."
