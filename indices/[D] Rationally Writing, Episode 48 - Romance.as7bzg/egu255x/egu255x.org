On the subject of "opposites attract," I think the point that this cliche may be gesturing at is the idea that some relationships work better when you have two people whose abilities complement each other. For example, having a company where you have a technical co-founder (a Steve Wozniak who is really good at making a product) and a non-technical co-founder (a Steve Jobs who is really good at selling a product). In the context of a more traditional marriage, this might look like having one dedicated stay-at-home parent and one parent who is a dedicated breadwinner. You could have a relationship where an extrovert is able to help their introvert partner "come out of their shell," and the introvert might help their extrovert partner become more emotionally grounded and offer some stability. I've seen a lot of relationships work well with one extrovert and one introvert, or one person who is highly analytical while the other is highly creative. Relationships on the page tend to work best when characters differ along at least a few axes, and it's common for people to seek out partners who have traits that they themselves lack; someone who sees themselves as unstable might be looking for a "rock," or someone who sees themselves as boring might be looking for someone who can lead them toward "adventure." Perhaps the sentiment behind the cliche "opposites attract" is more artfully expressed by the cliche "You complete me."

I agree with the point made in the podcast that a good relationship is one where two people come together and the resulting union is more than the sum of its parts (because they make each other better people). Conversely, I think you could define a bad relationship as one where two people come together and collectively become less than the sum of their parts. I've seen this happen in a number of on-screen romances (usually with a male lead and a female love interest) where you have a character who is interesting and dynamic and is competent and interesting in their own right, and then as soon as the relationship begins, that side character becomes solely defined by their relationship to the main character. They stop being the "cool scientist who does R&D" and instead just play the role of "main character's girlfriend." Or you have two warriors marry and have children, and then have the man say "Okay, I know you've spent your entire life with an axe in your hand and a bow on your back, but now it's time for you to stay home with the kids and do domestic things while I go off to fight in the war."

Probably the easiest way to avoid this is to let the characters keep doing the interesting things and exhibiting the cool traits that made the audience like them in the first place. Another more elegant way to do this is to allow them to change roles as the relationship develops, but ensure that the new role gives them a chance to exhibit their best traits, or do other interesting things. Instead of demoting a female love interest from "warrior" to "woman who stays at home while her husband goes on adventures," let her play the role of a fiercely protective "mama bear." Or if you'd rather transition her away from solving her problems with violence, make her into a matriarch where can play an important role and deal with interesting struggles. (Or swap the roles and let the man stay home with the kids, as The Incredibles 2 recently did.)

One of the things I've found useful for building relationships in fiction (not just romantic relationships) is the idea that people usually measure the length of a relationship in terms of the number of encounters that two characters have had, rather than the duration of time they've spent together, in part because it's hard to measure the relative time spent in various scenes. And you can sometimes disguise a single encounter as multiple encounters simply by changing setting partway through. For example, if you have a 2000-word scene that takes place in a single location, you can introduce a venue change halfway through. (e.g. instead of spending 2000 words having a conversation in a cafe, you can spend 1000 words having a conversation in a cafe, and then spend 1000 words having a conversation as two characters walk down the street. This is the same amount of "content," but it will feel like more time has passed, making the two characters feel "closer.")

I've found this works in real life, too, as a possible explanation for why some Greek letter organizations on college campuses hold most of their recruitment events off-campus, so instead of having an event that's "Let's sit down for 2 hours and socialize," it's "let's spend 15 minutes chatting while we wait for everyone to arrive and sort into cars, then spend 20 minutes driving to the venue and having a conversation in the car, then spend an hour at the actual venue doing the official recruitment event, followed by an unplanned visit to the donut shop that's next to the venue for the recruitment event, and then another car ride back." In the case of GLO's, one of the benefits of this is that each venue change gives you a chance to mix the social interactions letting the prospective new members meet more members of the GLO by having them drive back to campus with a different group of people that they drove up with, but two hours of venue-hopping feels more dynamic than two hours of gathering together in a single room. There's also the fact that context-shifting gives you an opportunity to see more facets of someone's personality.

There's an episode of the Ezra Klein podcast (I forget which one, but I think it was discussing atomization in modern society) where he notes that one of the big things that helps to grow relationships is spontaneous encounters, when you run into someone you know when you weren't planning to meet with them. He offers this as an explanation for why people in modern society have a harder time making friends (we live in bigger cities where we see our neighbors less often or not at all), and why college campuses are one of the few places in modern society where people /don't/ seem to have this high level of difficulty making friends. (If you went to a private college where your class was <2,000 people, and everyone has the same class requirements, and everyone eats in the same dining halls, simply by chance you're going to encounter the same familiar faces over and over again through sheer happenstance without ever having to plan to meet up with them.)
