Consuming media often doesn't actually help deal with the reason for being sad, it only pushes it out of my mind for a bit. What has helped me much more was usually talking to people, whether in real life or on the internet.

That said, for pushing sad thoughts from my mind I like violent games like DOOM, or complex games like Into The Breach.
