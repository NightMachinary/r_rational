When I'm wallowing: An endless cycle of my YouTube homepage recommendations until I'm angry enough at myself to switch to wordless music(Slow techno, video game soundtracks) and try to get small things done. Or lots of Facebook and Reddit if I'm away from my computer, similarly stuck on a loop of checking them repeatedly for "one more thing" that will motivate me.

When I'm trying to feel better: I listen to pop science podcasts or fiction audiobooks, avoiding anything "productive" or requiring focus, and go on a slow run away from home until I've made a plan and relaxed. If I'm panicked or angry on top of the sadness I run fast, I find being very out of breath gets rid of more intense emotions temporarily (you go from wanting/thinking complicated things to just wanting to catch your breath, and you can achieve that goal!).
