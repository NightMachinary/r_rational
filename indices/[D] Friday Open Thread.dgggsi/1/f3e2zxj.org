I accidentally fueled an existential crisis in a friend of mine last night. I thought we were having an engaging and thoughtful philosophical discussion until she started to repeatedly ask how she knew I was real; being completely serious and increasingly worried.

Has anyone else had an experience like this? What happened after?
