I draw a major line between "hard" sci-fi and "space opera" as he calls it.

Star wars and most sci-fi setting dramas are the latter.

Hard sci-fi generally has little if any action that exists purely for dramatic. It explores ideas, it asks 'what if' and provides thought experiments for scientific and philosophical edge cases.

Blindsight was a good example of this.
