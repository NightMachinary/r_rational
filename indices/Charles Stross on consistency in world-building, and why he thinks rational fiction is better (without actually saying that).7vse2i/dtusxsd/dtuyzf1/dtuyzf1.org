  There are bits like this in pretty much everything that I've read by him

Yep. He's my go to example of an author who has, in fact, Done The Research. I don't know if it's otherwise rational, but his worldbuilding always feels, well, tightly coupled with reality. Partially it's the fascinating and complex and relevant detail, where he's actually researched something and brought back pieces of it to intertwine with the plot.

But it's also that, like some rational fanfic, his work often feels like a deconstruction. Because he starts with some common trope or setting and then /takes it seriously/, pulling apart the assumptions underlying the genre.

Like the Laundry Files. Start with Cthulu being real, but we don't see it, that implies a masquerade. Add in the national security implications of lovecraftian threats to get a government agency, and voila, super secret agents with magic! But hold on: have you /seen/ the bureaucractic /nightmare/ that is the British Civil Service? You think this is gonna be James Bond with added spellslinging? Haha, no, the /real/ threats here (in book eight) are the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act of 2010, and the insidious threat of /private outsourcing/.

Or the start of the Family Trade: here, come be wisked away into a portal fantasy where you're the long-lost princess of a medieval realm! Where they have stong opinions on women's rights, because medieval realm. And trade in hard drugs, because smuggling is the easiest way to monetise an alternative reality. So it's a crime family, and you've just joined the mafia. And if your family-by-blood can go there, but most people can't, then it's probably a genetically linked trait. Right? So then /those/ things combine into a brutally strict breeding program and poltitcally contentious genetics research inside that crime family... And then you know what happens to crime families that deal drugs? The DEA goes after them. And American law enforcement discovering alternate realities? Hey, it's our best friend 'national security implications'! Set just fifteen years ago in the time where America was freaking out about terrorists and starting wars... Suddenly our whimsical lost-princess isekai story is something else entirely.

  (I would probably say that kind of showy, ostentatious worldbuilding/research is catnip for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational][/r/rational]], but I'm not sure that general tastes are so aligned with my own.)

It's catnip for me at least. I love that style of writing. The thing that first /really/ grabbed my attention in HPMoR, for example, was when Harry learned about an alternate currency based on gold and silver and immediately started thinking about the abitrage opportunity. That sort of thing is excellent, and the alternative -- where you just have that currency in your setting without thinking about it, or import your worldbuilding straight from 60's sci fi -- it just isn't. It's a failure to think, putting neat narrative above how reality would actually go.
