I'm a regular reader of his blog (and his books) and think that he expresses opinions like this pretty regularly. There was a part in /The Rhesus Chart/ where the narrative turns toward the minutia of blood procurement through the NHS, and I always got the sense that Stross was one of those authors that got some visceral joy in doing that research and presenting it to the reader as a backbone of reality threaded through the fantastical -- and without those sorts of things, writing would be lifeless and dull, and maybe not worth doing.

There are bits like this in pretty much everything that I've read by him, and I think that he short-sells it a little bit in this article by saying that it's about backbone -- but it might be that he sees some of his signature digressions as burlesque and includes them anyway. (I would probably say that kind of showy, ostentatious worldbuilding/research is catnip for [[/r/rational]], but I'm not sure that general tastes are so aligned with my own.)
