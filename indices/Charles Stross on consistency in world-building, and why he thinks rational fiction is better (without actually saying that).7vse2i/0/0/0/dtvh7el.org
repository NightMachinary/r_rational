Eh, tbh sometimes he fucks things up and then it's glaring. Singularity Sky was pretty much ruined for me when I noticed that the whole elaborate "time travel-but not really" trick a lot of the plot centered around did not make any sense whatsoever the way it was described. I can normally look past stuff like that but here it clashed with how enormously self-satisfied he apparently felt with throwing words like "space-like interval" and "causal light cone" around without properly thinking about what they mean.
