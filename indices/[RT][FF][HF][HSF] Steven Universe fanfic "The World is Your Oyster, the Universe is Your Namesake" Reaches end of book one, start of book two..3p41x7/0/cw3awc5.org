Minor Nitpick:

I was rereading the first chapter and the font's off in this sentence,

#+begin_quote
  “Yes. *Meta-', Greek prefix, means about or after, so* metacognition' is to think about thinking. Self-awareness.”
#+end_quote

If you meant to only use it for part of the sentence where part of it is bolded, then I think you shouldn't include 'so' in it as well. It broke my immersion in the story very abruptly.
