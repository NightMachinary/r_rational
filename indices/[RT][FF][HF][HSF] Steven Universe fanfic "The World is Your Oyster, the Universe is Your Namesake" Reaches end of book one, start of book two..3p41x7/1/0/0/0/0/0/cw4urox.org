The biggest twist thus far (IMO) was basically hiding in plain sight, and I think a rationalist would have predicted it well in advance; IDK if the fanbase caught it or not since I stay away from the fanbase. A lot of the other "twists" aren't really Shyamalan-esque things so much as gradual plot development and exposition.
