One variant of this that I have enjoyed playing in RPGs is the very clever but does a poor job of considering the long term consequences of their actions variety. Good at coming up with creative plans for solving the immediate problem that they are faced with, but often having longer term consequences (for example when the web of lies finally collapses) that are totally ignored.
