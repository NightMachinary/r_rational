Several people have pointed out that nominally intelligent but irrational characters are rife in media, but the hard part isn't just making a Lex Luthor or Dr. Strange, it's rationally constructing a character who's believably very intelligent but also irrational.

I think this is quite doable, because such people exist. Issac Newton is a perfect example; blisteringly intelligent, but going in the wrong directions an awful lot of the time.

As you point out, in order for a very intelligent person to be irrational, there has to be something blocking their intelligence from engineering its own rationality. As far as I can tell this usually manifests in two ways: Hardware and Firmware.

Hardware is when they've got a pathological mental state. This was a big factor with Newton--he poisoned himself pretty badly with mercury and other chemicals that left him more than a little crazy. He had pretty bad paranoia that manifested in his lashing out at friends over imagined offenses and engaging in very odd practices and behaviors.

I've heard that there have been some studies that posit a link between extreme intelligence and mental illness. Mathematical modeling of neurons suggests that humans are about at the limit of how far you can push that processing architecture before error rates start to soar. In other words, if you get someone whose brain works abnormally fast, it will probably encounter an abnormal amount of errors. Can't find the source for that right now, though, so take with salt.

The second way brains malfunction, which is usually present along with the first but doesn't necessitate it, is Firmware. In human terms, epistemology. Without an epistemic basis conducive to rationality, the ability of even a very intelligent mind to self-correct toward that state is severely hindered. There are smart people who gamble, are religious, or [[https://www.quora.com/Pseudoscience-What-are-some-of-the-craziest-ideas-held-by-Nobel-Prize-winners][work very hard on pseudoscience]].
