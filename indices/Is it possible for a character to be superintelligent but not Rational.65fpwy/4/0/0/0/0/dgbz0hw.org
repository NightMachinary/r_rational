My two pence: There is a large difference between not dismissing something and supposing it to be true, particularly in the face of all available evidence plus Occam's razor.

Edit: A further line of thought might claim 'a sufficiently aloof deity is indistinguishable from an uncaring universe' and argue that a system qualified to be referred to as 'religious' revolving around faith and prayer (where the faith relates to the willingless as well as the ability to respond to the prayers) would at most be parallel to and unrelated to any coincidental reality. That is, even if Oxlep seeds life, and in one of those cradles a person happens to decide their deity's name is Oxlep, and with faith in their heart prays "Oxlep, please interfere and save us from drought and angst and malice!", the Oxlep religion would be a mistaken path even with the existence of an Oxlep reality. One could then respond "But a deity might really have set up a software mind-copying and virtualised afterlife structure!", then "In that case it's again unrelated to religions in which jealous gods withhold a pleasant afterlife in the absence of faith", "But such a deity might actually build in such requirements!", "Then, in the absence of sufficient evidence, the deity is indistinguishable from an /evil/ deity, rather than an uncaring universe,", "But then rational to take the path of believing just in case,", "But then which option to choose, and in the desire for truth why think 'indistinguishable from evil deity' rather than 'indistinguishable from uncaring universe' if arguing from imagining what sorts of existences we want to become"... the line of thought before the edit is much more succinct.
