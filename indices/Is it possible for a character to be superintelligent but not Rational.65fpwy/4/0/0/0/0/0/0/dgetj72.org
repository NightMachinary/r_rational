  if they sincerely believe that they have encountered evidence of a supreme being, then to act on that alleged evidence does not look to me like a failure of rationality

It seems like a /severe/ failure of rationality to privilege the hypothesis of personal contact with the divine, over that of your mental hardware having entered an error state. Regardless of the fact-of-the-matter (which I don't have direct access to), I'd hope to remain skeptical of a proffered messiah until they managed to do something to outweigh the /entire/ probability-mass of other explanations for the same evidence. And that "tweaking my mind to directly have an experience I would describe as 'contact with the divine'" would no more qualify as such evidence, than the singing of a Siren would qualify as a evidence that I am rationally justified in choosing to steer my ship into some rocks.
