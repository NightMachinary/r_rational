Your argument seems to revolve around the idea that if a deity exists, then it has remained uninvolved in human affairs and is therefore meaningless - which seems like a curious claim in the context of a discussion about epistemological errors, because believer after believer has claimed the opposite, that they have indeed experienced contact with the divine in one form or another. Of course, you are quite at liberty to consider them factually mistaken; however, if they sincerely believe that they have encountered evidence of a supreme being, then to act on that alleged evidence does not look to me like a failure of rationality.

Occam's Razor, meanwhile, is a tricky thing to wield correctly in this kind of debate. It can really only be properly used when various explanations would all be adequate to explain observations - but in this case, the adequacy of various explanations of existence is part of the subject of debate, so by the time you swing the razor, you have already made a decision about the answer. Your bottom line about the reasonableness or unreasonableness of God was already written.
