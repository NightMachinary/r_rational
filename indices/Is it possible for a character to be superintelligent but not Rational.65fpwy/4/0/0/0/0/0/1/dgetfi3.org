Second part: Ideally, I would hope that the razor is part of the decision-making process, rather than a separate quantification brought in(/swung) later as justification. Here, incomprehensible motives(/modus operandi) on one side, versus simple underlying rules (on which are built complicated wetware, with some bugs) on the other. Neither (as with Russell's teapot) can for the moment be objectivey ruled out, but one can at least attempt to weigh them on a scale.

First part: Indeed, I was attempting to respond to the base idea of cradles of life built. If we bring 'getting things right' to the level of active interference, then we reach the question of 'why is there so much suffering/injustice?'. Then, 'evil/lazy/incompetent' versus 'non-interference (hands-off)'.

Middle part: There we have the Scrooge perspective: "Why do you doubt your senses?" "Because a little thing affects them." Rather than subjective feelings only, though, this can be approached in terms of the entire range of content, including perceptions of outside verifiable information communicated (one can also note the anthropic view there of a lottery winner reporting foreknowledge of winning, while vast numbers of non-winners had not-inferior 'foreknowledge'). --It comes down to that, when a researcher is looking at data, there is a point at which they must set aside their own hopes and impressions and biases and fallible pattern-matching and submit the data to an impartial statistical test, to ask "Is what I'm seeing real?". There are those who do not accept the answer if it's not the answer they expect, but if such expectations were reliable then there would be no need for the test. Such people may torture/'massage' the data, or try lots of different tests until they find one that coincidentally gives them an answer they're happy with, but those cannot hope for meaningful answers from their work. When your statistical test tells you that there's nothing there, that your data is not /convincing/--that it is not sufficient to convince everyone else--then one must accept "If it isn't sufficient to convince everyone else, then it shouldn't be sufficient to convince me, either.". Granted, I'm using a somewhat loose term for 'everyone'.

A sufficiently-motivated deity could, of course, interfere in precisely those ways that would not be credible, altering and potentially improving the world in lots of small ways that no one could justify to others or to themselves were verifiably meaningful, rather than an overlap of noise and coincidence. A deity could indeed limit it to those ways, forsaking large-scale easy-to-recognise communication, much like aliens could indeed choose to abduct only those people who no one else would believe (instead of opening communications on a global scale). However, if a powerful existence were willing to go that far to make itself implausible to the bulk of humanity, then what hope for the bulk of humanity to judge it plausible despite that, and what motivation to judge it plausible in the face of that overt implausibility?
