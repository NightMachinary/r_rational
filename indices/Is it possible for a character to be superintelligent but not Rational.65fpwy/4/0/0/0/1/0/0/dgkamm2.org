I...can't really tell if you're serious. If it's rational to indulge in paranoia based on blatant and /effortlessly/ dismissed fictions, then what on earth is /irrational/ at that point? The guy my dad treated who kept trying to bite his fingers off because the Buddha told him to was behaving quite logically--at least, logically based on his beliefs. That particular gentleman had an obvious mental illness, but epistemic errors characterized by religion are quite sufficient to engender similar behaviors in perfectly sane but--I maintain--still irrational individuals.

And you're correct. I forgot about The Book of Abraham. But...on an object level, that's probably one of the worst arguments one could make for the rationality of religion. The cosmology would've embarassed a schoolchild /of that time/, the provenance is possibly the most obvious hoax one could come up with, and the authority presenting it has so little credibility based on his other claims that if he said the sky was blue I'd be inclined to double-check.

This is what I meant by "fairy tales with modern sci-fi set dressing"--not HPMOR. Just because a hypothesis (Elohim is a Kolob-dwelling alien who seeded Earth with life) isn't /directly/ contradicted by our current understanding of science, doesn't mean one is rational to believe it's true. I'll cite Russel's Teapot as a concise metaphor for why this is the case.
