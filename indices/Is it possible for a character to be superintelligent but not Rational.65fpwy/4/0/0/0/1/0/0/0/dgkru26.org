  blatant and effortlessly dismissed fictions

Ah, I was responding more to the absurdity of the laser toast approach. If you want to focus more on the absurdity of fearing manticores, then sure, you can examine the evidence for and against manticores existing. However, this doesn't apply very neatly to the discussion about religion, because the very nature of claims of personal contact with the divine is that they cannot be demonstrated to others, yet may be considered good evidence by the individual.

In other words, you won't be able to achieve mutual agreement on whether religion can be effortlessly dismissed, because the two parties aren't working with the same evidence.
