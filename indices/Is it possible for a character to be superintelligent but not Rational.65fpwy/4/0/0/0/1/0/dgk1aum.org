  If I'm deathly afraid of manticores

Well, in that case, it's rational to take whatever action will be most likely to repel manticores. I couldn't say exactly what action that might be without knowing more about manticores, but it seems likely that there are options that would give a better expected return than making toast. If you can get data about the effectiveness of each type of manticore repellent, then it's possible to run the numbers.

  that's not what /any/ religions claim.

No? Perhaps not put exactly that way, but the idea that God was once comparable to ourselves, and progressed, learning and growing over an unknown period of time to reach the point of being able to form planets and stars and even galaxies from raw materials - that is sound Mormon doctrine. I wasn't speaking of a hypothetical religion.

Sure, HPMoR is fantasy. But achieving that kind of godhood - technological sophistication and psychological refinement that make interstellar and even intergalactic projects feasible - that is, ultimately, a real ambition, yes? You're not dismissing Eliezer as a quack for aspiring to it?
