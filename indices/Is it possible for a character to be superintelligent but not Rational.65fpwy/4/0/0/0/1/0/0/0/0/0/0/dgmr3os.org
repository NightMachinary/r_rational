What would you consider irrational, then? By your standards, there would seem to be no pursuit of pseudoscience, conspiracy theory, delusion or zealotry that could be considered irrational. No one intentionally acts in a way they believe to be at odds with reality, after all. Even the profoundly insane are just reacting 'rationally' to flawed stimuli.

My whole contention is that it is the way people evaluate evidence--that is to say, their epistemology--that determines the degree to which their beliefs themselves can be considered rational.

By my standards, someone who believes the earth is flat, even someone who was taught this their entire lives and only recently stumbled across the notion that there's some controversy over the matter, is irrational. There is simply no way someone with a healthy epistemology can look at the evidence each side can bring to bear on the topic and maintain the belief that "flat" is the way to go. There are simply too many established facts that directly contradict the flat earth hypothesis--for example, the fact that flights from Buenos Aires to Johannesburg take about the same amount of time as flights from Los Angeles to Beijing.

Hell, there are even experiments one can do personally that unambiguously demonstrate the curvature of the earth. There is just no way one can genuinely hold this position without a "mental failure mode".

Yet people still have "evidence sufficient that they are convinced" of the Earth's flatness, so they must, by your definition, be rational. Is this not the case?
