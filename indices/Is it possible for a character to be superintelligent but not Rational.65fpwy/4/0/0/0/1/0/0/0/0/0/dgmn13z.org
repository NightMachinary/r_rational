I'm sorry to hear that you've suffered through those kinds of experiences. Hope you're doing better now.

We could probably discuss quality of evidence issues for days on end, but I suspect we'd go in circles, because whether internal or external, claimed religious experiences tend not to be demonstrable to others. So, as a case to convince others, they have little or no weight, certainly.

On the original topic, though, of whether religion is a mental failure mode: I'd still maintain that if someone has evidence sufficient that they are convinced, then it is /more/ reasonable for them to act on that evidence than ignore it. Unless and until they have reason to suppose that their evidence was inadequate or flawed.
