  so glaringly wrong that they can't possibly be examining the evidence rationally.

Well, I wouldn't go so far. Ptolemy's crystal spheres were an incorrect idea, sure, but does that mean everyone who accepted the idea was failing to think? I'd instead assume that they simply lacked information. If, upon being presented with a superior theory, they reject it out of hand due to emotional or political attachment to the old theory, that is when they have problems (though technically, depending on what they value, their rejection might strictly speaking be "rational" - just not scientific).

So yes, most or all religious belief systems must be largely wrong, where they contradict. That's cause for any believer to have a humble and open-minded attitude toward belief systems that they disagree with, certainly - but not necessarily cause to discard the whole field.

  religious belief is inherently irrational

First off, "irrational" is probably the wrong word, since religious belief might well help someone achieve what they value, depending on what that value is. But I'm pretty sure you meant that religious belief is inherently unscientific, that it cannot reasonably be expected to be correct. We both value truth, so rationality then requires a reasonable possibility of truthfulness. Yes?

Is it really so unreasonable to suppose that /someone/ has already achieved HJPEV's goals of agelessness, space exploration, stellar manipulation and harvesting, and reaching "a /shockingly/ high standard of being so incredibly, unbelievably rational that you actually started to /get things right/, as opposed to having a handy language in which to describe afterwards everything you'd just done wrong" - and that the earth is the result of such a person building more cradles of intelligent life? If we can aspire to someday as a race be capable of such things, how can we dismiss the possibility that someone else might have already succeeded?
