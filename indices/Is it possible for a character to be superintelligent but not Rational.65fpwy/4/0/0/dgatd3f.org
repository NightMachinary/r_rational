For starters, the fact that there are very smart people making religious claims in multiple, mutually exclusive religions is sufficient evidence that most of them must be wrong. If Mormons are right, then Hindus and atheists and everybody else are so glaringly wrong that they can't possibly be examining the evidence rationally. If Hindus are right, then the same goes for Mormons et al. This holds true for pretty much anyone whose level of religious belief is any stronger than humanism with metaphors.

That's not to say I'm backing down from the implication of my statement that religious belief is inherently irrational. The healing power of prayer (as just one example) has been as thoroughly debunked as the healing power of homeopathy or acupuncture. It's disingenuous to be willing to accept the pseudosciences pursued by the Nobel Laureates I linked to as obvious markers for irrationality but claim that religious belief is somehow a bridge too far.

If we can't dismiss religious belief out of hand because nothing can be 100% certain, or because some religious people /do/ think critically about their beliefs, or because it's impossible to prove a negative, then the same goes for telepathy and astrology.

Is it possible I'm wrong? Obviously. It's possible I'm wrong about literally everything, and I'm frequently demonstrably wrong about a lot of things. But strong religious belief has all the markings of a self-reinforcing, anti-rationalist epistemology structure, and if it just so happens that one of them is coincidentally correct in spite of that, then the usefulness of rationality itself is debunked.
