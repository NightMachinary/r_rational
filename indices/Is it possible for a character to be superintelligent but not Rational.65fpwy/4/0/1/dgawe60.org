Religion would be the /perfect/ example of an intelligent person being epistemically irrational, were it not for the fact that the analogy is both lost on and offensive to everyone who isn't at the point of understanding why religion is irrational, which is most people (including most non religious people).

A better go to for "failure mode" is probably the monothematic delusion, except... it's too bizarre for most people to relate to. So opposite problem.
