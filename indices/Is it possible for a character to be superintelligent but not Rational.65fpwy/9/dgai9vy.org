Not the way you'd like them to be. "Superintelligent" typically means "Thinks better than a human" and "Rational" means "Thinks well". They're evaluative claims that include the observer's standards of good thinking. If you have very high standards for what qualifies as good thinking, then you can have a non-rational superintelligent character, but that is trivial since "rational people" is probably is an empty set in that case.

As other commentors have noted, you can have characters that think fast but not well, or characters that know lots of things but apply the knowledge poorly. I would avoid explicitly labling your contrasting properties as "rational" and "superintelligent", though.
