This sounds a lot like a manwha I picked up a while back called The Gamer. Main character basically for REASONS OF PLOT^{TM} gains classic-era RPG character properties (inventory, numerical stats, skills, etc), and decides to dump most of his points into INT. Has a massive mana pool and can memorize and recall facts instantly and in great detail, but outside of his personal specialty of essentially being a korean MMO grinding addict, he's actually not that bright, having left WIS almost completely at base stats.

He seems pretty internally consistent, often having to brute-force problems with more magical firepower rather then by outwitting his foes.
