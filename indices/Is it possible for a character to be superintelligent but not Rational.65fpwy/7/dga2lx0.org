Is it possible\plausible? Yes. Will including such a character harm the story's quality though? Likely, if done incorrectly or with a wrong character (especially with the protagonist).

Here are several ways in which I see such a combination working:

- high intelligence that's running on inefficient principles:

  - highly intelligent but not rational character --- the high intelligence in this case could be defined in terms of memory, reaction time, imagination and visualisation, abstract thinking, reading speed, “processing power”, etc. The Intelligence attribute in /[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay][The Games We Play]]/ was kinda responsible for these kinds of things, for example. And it's possible for the character to have all these enhanced qualities and have no idea what to do with them, how to use them efficiently, rationally, and wisely.\\
  - highly intelligent but not wise character --- depends on how Intelligence and Wisdom are defined in your story, but overall still workable.
  - highly intelligent character with an ineffective worldview system and principles --- a prejudiced or biased intelligent character, for instance, will have some blind spots and a pattern of making certain types of bad decisions (e.g. Voldemort).
  - highly intelligent character with certain psychological inhibitions --- e.g. an intelligent character with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness][learned helplessness.]]
  - highly intelligent character with severely limited worldview --- The protagonist of /[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/202735-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts][The Girl with All the Gifts]]/ is like this at the beginning of the story (then it slowly slides into being an [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute][InformedAttribute).]] She was described as being very intelligent, but all the information about the outside world she could get was the unbalanced and measly bits and pieces received from her teachers, so she didn't have much ground to work on.

- highly intelligent character that has bad emotional control --- an intelligent but lazy character, or one that can't make themselves stop caring about revenge even when it's harming their long-term goals. Or one that's having problems with focusing on delayed gratification.
- highly intelligent character that has an outbalancing mental disorder --- paranoia, for example, or delusions.
