This sort of character appears commonly in fiction; it's the 'mad scientist' archetype. They have the raw intelligence to solve whatever problem attracts their attention... but even if they aren't actually 'mad' in the sense of being afflicted with a mental illness, they tend to be obsessive and narrowly-focused.

Such a character may well come across as inconsistent, if written poorly. To get around this, you need to demonstrate their reasoning to the audience, especially if it's flawed. The mad scientist shouldn't make mistakes simply because he picked up the idiot ball. Instead, perhaps he got bored partway through and went to do something else... or, inversely, was so totally focused on his one specific project that he neglected to handle some critical but mundane detail.
