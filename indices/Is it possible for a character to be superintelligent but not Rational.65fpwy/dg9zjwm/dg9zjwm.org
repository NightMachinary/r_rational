Being superintelligent will let you guess the consequences of actions and predict events with uncanny clarity, but it doesn't in and of itself help you understand what you want. At the least, deception should be fairly easy to spot, but without introspection from such superintelligence implicit assumptions will still go unchallenged and contradictions can lie in wait until they make a problem 'unsolveable'.

It should be trivial for a person with superintelligence to start noticing internal inconsistency through introspection, but with the INT/WIS divide you're dealing with I have to assume such influences are forbidden. Thus, your character is not just superintelligent but also forbidden from using that superintelligence for introspection. Perhaps they're limited to just normal human cognition for such a task, or their seeming internal contradictions can only be removed through buffing WIS.

The rules that human brains tend to come packaged with sort of derive from our core values, but also from expected context. Certain lines that you can't help but see as sinister, for example, because our brains come packaged knowing that most usages of that line are sinister, so it's okay to just automatically read the line as sinister. If it's not sinister, this leads to dissonance in the sense that we 'know' that it's a sinister line but can't see any reason for that. Superintelligence should let your character realize that it's just /usually/ a sinister line, but not automatically, and note that the reflex cannot be trusted, but with the INT/WIS divide all that can result is they notice confusion but trying to analyze the situation is like slamming their head against a brick wall.

If you want a descriptive way to present it, you might be able to say that he looks inwards, but gets caught up in the minutia of his thought and the workings of his thought processes are far too intricate for him to comprehend, leaving him frustrated and unable to solve the problem, as if his own intelligence became a trap ensnaring his attempts at introspection in a web of detail and useless information.
