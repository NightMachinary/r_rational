There's a comic called The Gamer where the main character did that literally. But his intelligence is mostly just used for getting lots of mana rather than actually solving problems, so it doesn't feel like much of an example.

In Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, he often runs into problems from not having enough wisdom. For example, he came up with some theory for how magic didn't really depend on the words you say and that it was just to make you focus on the spell, put tons of work into this whole set of experiments for it, and then found out that he was completely wrong on the first experiment. He just assumed his theory was right and wanted to test details of it.
