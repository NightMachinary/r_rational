I really appreciate this comment. It's quite well thought out.

I think if we look at people who accepted Ptolemy's crystal spheres or those who currently accept a fairly strong form of most religions, we can say that they're failing to think. That's hardly a damning insult; I don't pretend I would've gotten to the heart of the heliocentrism question if I'd been born in that time. But if we say they were 'rational but unscientific', I think that renders the term 'rational' pretty much meaningless.

This ties into your point about religious belief helping people achieve what they value. I think "pragmatic" is a closer word than "rational" for that, but even pragmatism implies intent.

If I'm deathy afraid of manticores, but believe manticores can be warded off by laser-etching Art Garfunkel's face onto a slice of bread every morning, that behavior isn't somehow rational just because I'm acting in my best self-interest /assuming all my premises are true/, or because I get toast for breakfast as a happy side-effect.

As for your final paragraph...I mean, I can think of a few reasons why that's improbable, but more to the point that's not what /any/ religions claim. Saying we can't dismiss religion because maybe God's a metaphor for an alien Johnny Appleseed is entirely dismissive of the actual claims of those religions.

Ultimately I think the best brief summation of my problem with this argument from a rationalistic perspective was from Dara O'Briain:

"Just because Science doesn't know everything doesn't mean you can fill in the gaps with whatever fairy tale most appeals to you."

And I'd point out that that extends to fairy tales with modern sci-fi set dressing.
