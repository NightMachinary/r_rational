Setting aside that all religions I know of claim a lot more than personal emotional contact with the divine as evidence for their truthfulness, I'd argue that those qualia aren't some special category of irrefutable evidence even taken on their own. A rational cannon-accepting Catholic can't assert perfect certainty that /their/ religious experiences are more meaningful than those of a Sufi Muslim, for example, yet one of them /must/ be misattributing those experiences--which of course, makes it quite possible that /both/ are.

I've had experiences so intense--and unfortunately, in my case, horrific--that I had a hard time imagining that anybody else had ever experienced anything like it. Then a buddy described something very similar he'd felt on shrooms. I'm not.../thrilled/ that I apparently have pharmaceutical-grade psychedelic waking nightmare hallucinations even when sober, but I think it would be irrational of me to let the intensity of the experience persuade me that the galaxy really /is/ sentient, or that it wants me to kill myself, for that matter.

And yeah, someone could say that their experience of God's grace was like that times infinity, and I could say my nightmare was like that times infinity plus one...but maybe if we're being rational, we'd both just throw that out as non-evidence.
