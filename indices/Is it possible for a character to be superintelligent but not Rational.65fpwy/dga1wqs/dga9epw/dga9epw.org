I don't think the HPMOR example is him being irrational.

I mean he had a hypothesis and he tested it. That's the basis of scientific inquiry. It doesn't mater that he was wrong.

I guess maybe your point is that he put too much effort into thinking about future tests to try in the event that his first test was a success?

Even if that's the case I still don't think that's exactly irrational so long as he didn't use up time/resources that he absolutely should have been spending on something else.
