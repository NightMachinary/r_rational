They were so caught up with the fact that they /could/ that they never stopped to consider whether they /should/.

It could be written as the type of personality which is easily sidetracked by intellectual possibility. Or one which has little to no self-awareness (or will), and thus tends to do what they're told (or what's suggested) without regard for longer-term consequences.

One literary example which is sort of in the same ballpark is Terry Pratchett's [[https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Leonard_of_Quirm][Leonard da Quirm]]; the sort of person who doesn't bother to check if they're about to walk off a cliff because they'd probably be able to figure out a solution to falling - or gravity - before they hit the bottom.
