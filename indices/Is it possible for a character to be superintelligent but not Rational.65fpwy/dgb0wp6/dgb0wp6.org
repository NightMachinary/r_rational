Larry Niven's Pak. They're superintelligent but have some nasty hardwired goals that make cooperation almost impossible. The Pak homeworld is covered in radioactive craters. The Ringworld almost gets destroyed like twice because basically every variety of Pak has the same problem. Louis Wu ends up having to trick himself to get rebuilt as a human to keep his Pak nature from messing him up.

OK, maybe this could be "Larry Niven can't write superintelligent characters" but they're not completely unconvincing.
