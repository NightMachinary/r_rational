Unfortunately, that study completely omitted perchlorates in the martian soil. This is because while the publish date was in 2014, the experiment was done before the curiosity rover's discovery of high concentrations of perchlorate in martian soil in 2013.

Either that, or they willfully omitted perchlorates from their study.
