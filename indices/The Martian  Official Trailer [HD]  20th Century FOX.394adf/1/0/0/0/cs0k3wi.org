Andy Weir, the author of the book, said the sand storm is the only major fib he pulled in the book. Martian sand/windstorms don't really have the speeds they do on earth.

They are running because the high winds are threatening to knock the ascent vehicle over. That's why the mission is aborted and during the trek to the AV Watney is presumed killed and left behind.

edit: speed might not be the right word. Force might be better.
