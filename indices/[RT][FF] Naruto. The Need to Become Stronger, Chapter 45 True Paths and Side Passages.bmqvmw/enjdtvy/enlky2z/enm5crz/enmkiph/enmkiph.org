I suspect a lot of people take strange events in NTBS for granted because they happen in very similar ways in canon, and so they assume that these events are just copied over and you're not supposed to question them. I try not to have things happen because the plot demands it though, and so when really weird coincidences occur it's usually because something strange is genuinely happening.

Anyway, there's absolutely no need for you to feel guilty, but yes it does bother me a little that people read so much trash and have so little patience for stories like NTBS. But then, from an objective perspective, maybe that just means that those 'trash' stories have a hidden quality that NTBS does not. I mean, if I didn't write the kind of story that most people want to read, well then, that's on me :)

  Re: Kakashi's fights, and combat in this fic in general, I think you do a great job of avoiding "puzzle fights" (Naruto v. Gaara excepted) where the whole thing is about putting together some weird interaction to get past someone's unbeatable defense or whatever. Your fights are very interactive, and don't feel gimmicky at all.

Thanks! People really liked the Gaara vs Naruto fight though, but that's probably just because there was *finally* a payoff where Naruto could go all-out and show everyone what he was really capable of... only to end up making matters worse as always, of course :)

(see, it's my own fault for being an elitist who refuses to give the readers what they want!)

I actually really enjoy having that bit of variety though. Literally every single fight in NTBS is totally different from all the others. Naruto's first real fight has him running away from a superior enemy while attempting to save an innocent villager. His second fight is a hidden attempt to convince onlookers that rationality is an advantage. His third fight is an effort of his best friend, Sakura, to stop him from risking his life against Gaara. His fourth fight has him putting up a show while his real body is acting to kill his opponent while being chased through the Village. And now in this arc, we just had Shikamaru fight a doomed 5 vs 2 battle that shows the importance of preparation and teamwork, followed by a 1-on-1 fight with Kakashi against a madwoman who might be sent by his true enemy in an attempt to engineer his death.

Every single fight is completely different in nature, with different stakes, different terrain and different fighters, and I think that's a big part of what makes them so fun. :)
