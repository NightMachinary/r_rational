Another thing I've been meaning to ask:

Is there some trick to mind-reading with genjutsu (in particular with the Sharingan)? Hypnosis/suggestion can be cleverly achieved by simulating subvocalized thoughts. If you buy the [[https://predictive-mind.net/][Predictive Processing]] account of cognition, the ceiling seems high on mind control by faking internal and external sensory stimuli. But how do you read someone's mind with illusions? Is it just an extra power that genjutsu has, or does it follow from legible laws governing how chakra works in this setting?
