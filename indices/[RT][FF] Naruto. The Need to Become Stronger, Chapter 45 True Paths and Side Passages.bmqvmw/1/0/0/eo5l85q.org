Ok that makes sense. I was thinking of genjutsu as basically being light/sound release illusions (with only only distinction being that the effect is generated locally in front of the target's eyes (etc) rather than eg around one's own body. But it sounds like genjutsu interacts with the target's mind more directly.

If genjutsu is somehow correlating one's brain with that of the target, it makes sense that one can both "read" and "write".

So, a ninja gets their chakra into your brain, and then you flare your chakra to expel it?

And for reverse genjutsu, is it that you have access to their chakra and specifically chakra that is currently "linked" to their brain, and then you use your chakra to manipulate it? If it's just access to their chakra, you could cast a genjutsu on someone through their shadow clone or fireball or whatever, yeah?

I can also imagine reverse-genjutsu as taking advantage of the correlation the attacker set up, and manipulating one's own brain to produce the desired effects (eg they expect to see one's greatest fear, but they see an empty void).

How are you thinking about it?
