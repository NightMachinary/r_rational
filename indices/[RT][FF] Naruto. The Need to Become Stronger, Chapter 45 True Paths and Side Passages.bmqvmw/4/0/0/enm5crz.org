All of that makes sense re: Kakashi and his thinking there. I'm not sure why it struck me as strange before, because now it seems really intuitive that he would be thinking something like this. I'm a bit convinced myself.

Regarding update pace: I can't believe I'm saying this but I hope you take your time with editing. I really think this is a fantastic story, so I'd be pretty bummed if it ended up worse forever so that chapters could come out a few days sooner. On the other hand, I've been visiting this subreddit multiple times a day hoping for an update, so getting one a few times a week would be pretty hype.

I don't know why the story is so much less popular than like MoL or even Origin of Species. I guess I shouldn't expect people to be rereading things all that much, so it makes sense that a lot of readers fall off. I'm also not sure why there's so little discussion, and I feel a bit guilty for not commenting more. I imagine it can be discouraging, if you think you are making something awesome but it isn't being received that way. (I may just be projecting though.)

Re: Kakashi's fights, and combat in this fic in general, I think you do a great job of avoiding "puzzle fights" (Naruto v. Gaara excepted) where the whole thing is about putting together some weird interaction to get past someone's unbeatable defense or whatever. Your fights are very interactive, and don't feel gimmicky at all.
