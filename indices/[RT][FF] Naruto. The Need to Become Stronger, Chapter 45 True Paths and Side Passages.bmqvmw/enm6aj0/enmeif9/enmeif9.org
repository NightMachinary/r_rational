Thanks for the link. My interpretation of genjutsu is based on information theory 101, as also explained in HPMOR:

  "Information theory 101," the boy said in a lecturing tone. "Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and only if the possible values of X have different probabilities given different states of Y. The instant you hear about anything whatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from nonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a process which behaves differently in the presence of truth and falsehood - that's why 'faith' doesn't work as a discriminant, while 'make experimental predictions and test them' does.

In canon, you have genjutsu techniques like the Hell Viewing jutsu which work by digging up the target's greatest subconscious fear. That is already a very basic form of 'mind reading', though of course most ninjas don't know about science to see it that way. Kakashi takes this to the next level when he implants [[https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Suggestion][suggestions]] in Zabuza's brain using his Sharingan, which is a form of 'mind writing', and then Sasuke really drives this home in Shippuden by having a three-way conversation /inside Naruto's mind/ with him and the Nine-tails.

And it /makes sense/ that illusions would be able to do all of that, from an information theory perspective, because there is no such thing as action without interaction: There is no such thing as one-way communication, in other words. If you punch a wall, then the wall also punches you. If you don't believe me, ask your hand.

And if you can communicate with someone, then it should also be possible to read their mind while keeping your own thoughts hidden. That's how genjutsu works, after all: You sneak your chakra into their brain and manipulate their thoughts without them noticing it. And that's also why reverse-genjutsu works - if you /do/ notice that the enemy's chakra is in contact with yours, then by definition your chakra is also in contact with theirs, and that means you can instantly cast a genjutsu by using the interaction that is already occurring between your brain and theirs. :)

And from there, all the other abilities of the Sharingan make sense too. You can use it to control the Tailed Beasts, you say?? What a random OP ability! But wait, if the Sharingan lets you cast illusions, and illusions can be used to impart suggestions, and those suggestions can only be dispelled by releasing the genjutsu, and if Tailed Beasts don't have that ability because they aren't ninjas... then of course the Uchiha can control the Kyubi. Any powerful genjutsu user could do the same thing! They're just passing it off as a unique ability because they don't want to share the secret to their power.

That's one thing that makes Naruto so rich in potential for rational fanfiction: A lot of mechanics just make /so much sense/ when you start thinking about them. It would have been easy for Kishi to write a system that falls apart upon further reflection, but as weird as it may seem, Naruto just gets better the more you think about it. :)
