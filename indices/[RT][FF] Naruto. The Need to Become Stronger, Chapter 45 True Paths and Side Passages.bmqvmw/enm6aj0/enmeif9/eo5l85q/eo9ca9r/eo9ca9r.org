Whoops, was busy writing the chapter and forgot to reply to this one. As it happens, reverse-genjutsu actually features in this one! Nice timing. Read it if you haven't already :)

Regarding your question, yeah, that's how it was described in canon, though the anime was kinda inconsistent with it I think. For reverse genjutsu, it was never explained, but my headcanon is that you literally take the hallucination that your enemy is crafting and show it to them by manipulating the chakra they put in your brain rather than letting it manipulate you.

As for whether you could do the same thing with a fireball technique... I mean, if you could touch it without getting burned, maybe? Actually I don't think so since elemental chakra has already had its nature changed, but you can for sure cast genjutsu on someone by targeting their shadow clone and then dispelling it so it goes back to the original. But I see your point that if chakra is your 'soul' and so if all your chakra is connected by definition, then in theory you could attack someone just by using the residual chakra from a piece of clothing they wore or something. Hm, I don't actually hate that idea - it'd be a nice reference to things like voodoo dolls and other forms of Sympathetic Magic if nothing else.
