Kakashi is speculating that somebody else might have influenced events behind the scenes. He's basically getting at the same thing Naruto originally accused Sasuke of, way back in chapter 20:

  Naruto turned to face his teammate. Perhaps it was the way he said it, or just the fact that Naruto had never seen Sasuke look uncomfortable before, but that was the moment he knew. “It was /you/.”

  “What?”

  “That night -- you left me and Sakura at the dinner table with Tsunami, while Kakashi and Tazuna were getting the beds set up. Where /were/ you? You went to Inari's room, and you convinced him to fight, didn't you? You're the one that got him killed!”

  “No! I never -- I never meant to...”

  The horrified look on Sasuke's face was all the confirmation Naruto needed, and the smouldering fury that welled up inside him brought new certainty in its wake. “What Kakashi said back at the training grounds, about how you convinced us to fight Gato just so you could get some combat experience... what did he mean by that?” Before Sasuke could give an answer, the next realization hit him. “You were complaining about the lack of combat missions even back in Konoha, and then we get a C-rank mission the next day -- but of course the /Lord Uchiha/ would be able to pull some strings to make that happen! And then it turns out we're up against one of the Seven Swordsmen, what're the odds of that? Tricking us into accepting a dangerous mission -- was that Tazuna's plan to save some money, or did you whisper that idea in his ear too?”

Of course, just because one of the main characters says something doesn't mean it's true, so the whole thing could just be a coincidence. But considering how this is the second mission in a row where a powerful ninja seems to be targeting him specifically, you can see why he might suspect foul play.

Also, Itachi totally did rescue Zabuza from Gatou in the very next chapter, and then they used him to start a revolution that ended with the death of the Mizukage. So all of this does fit with Akatsuki's methods and goals

  Also, I have to agree that Kakashi is amazing in this fic. The combat in this chapter really captured the core appeal of the battles in Naruto, probably more than any fight I can think of from the anime/manga.

Thanks! I've been really happy with how well my combat scenes have been received, and Kakashi especially really seems to take the spotlight. I may have underestimated how much people enjoy seeing genuine competence in their main characters :)

  Are you planning on releasing a chapter each week until the end of the arc?
#+end_quote

Yep! Though sometimes I find myself thinking that maybe it would be better to update every few days or so, seeing how the enthusiasm from last chapter already seems to have calmed down quite a bit. And whenever I read other popular stories, like Purple Days which was recommended here recently, I notice that they all update very rapidly and become hugely popular as a result despite having awful writing. So I'm starting to think that maybe I should just stop editing obsessively and just post more chapters even if they're less than perfect <_<
