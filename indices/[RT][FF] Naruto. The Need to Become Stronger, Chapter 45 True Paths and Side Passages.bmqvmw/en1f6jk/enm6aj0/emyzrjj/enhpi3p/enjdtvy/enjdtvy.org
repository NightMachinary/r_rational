Kakashi mentions in this that the attack on Konoha reminds him of the attack on the village in the Land of Waves, and that it carries the same signature (at least that is how I understood him), but did Akatsuki actually have anything to do with that? I had thought that was just Haku's plan.

Also, I have to agree that Kakashi is amazing in this fic. The combat in this chapter really captured the core appeal of the battles in Naruto, probably more than any fight I can think of from the anime/manga.

Are you planning on releasing a chapter each week until the end of the arc?

Oh, and I'm really excited to see you updating again!
