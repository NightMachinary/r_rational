Maybe you forgot you had a lemon.

Maybe you /just keep forgetting you have lemons/.

Maybe that time you went to the grocery store and there /was no fruit but lemons/, you just forgot about the lemons. Or maybe it was something to do with the breast cancer charity drive. That had a picture of a lemon on it.

If fact, did it even say /lemon cancer/? You check again.

You must have forgotten. It just says /LEMON/.

When you open your fridge to get a drink, it's empty.

Except for the lemon.

...

You put the gun on the table. You close your eyes, and you breathe. Possibly your last breath.

You reach forwards. You're afraid that you'll just feel a lemon. But no, it's a gun. You touch the barrel to your jaw.

You pull the trigger.

You see a lemon.
