I've tried to explain that distinction before, and I think it helps to think of it as three types of horror rather than two.

To expand on your example, you look down and see a lemon. Okay, it's strange, but it's the sort of thing that might actually happen. Maybe you just forgot you had a lemon. It's unnerving, but you can't necessarily communicate that fact to other people. You might struggle to explain to friends why a lemon is scary. You certainly wouldn't tell the police about it or try to enlist anyone to help you protect yourself from the lemons. It's just a little bit strange, a little bit worrying. (Of course, getting that feeling across in writing is the clever part, since part of the point is that it's hard to explain.)

In the second class, you have witnessed something that can only be explained by the supernatural. No prankster, no slip of memory, could justify it completely. Sticking with the theme, this is where you see a lemon floating in mid-air with a grinning face. Now the supernatural is real, and that's scary in a different way. Now it's a potential threat, even if you don't necessarily know exactly what /it/ is.

And in the third class, you have shoggoths coming out of the walls and cracks in the sky and generally things being immediately deadly and unstoppably powerful. No longer potential threats, these are definite and very real threats, and there's no plausible defence against them.
