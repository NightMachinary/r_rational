For [[/r/rational]] a more appropriate horror story would be "science is evil". The blog post [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2015/07/any-sufficiently-advanced-tech.html][Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology Is Indistinguishable From Cthulhu]] says this:

  For starters, 'Knowledge is good'. That's pretty core to most of our belief systems. And the Cthulhu Mythos present a world where that's horribly not true - where knowledge is something that you must avoid if you wish to continue to function. Where people who learn, study and seek to understand, kill themselves or kill people close to them. Where all those idiots saying 'we should limit scientific exploration' were right.

And then there is [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][Meditations on Moloch]], which explains those "alien gods" more clearly and with less fiction.

  Moloch is exactly what the history books say he is. He is the god of Carthage. He is the god of child sacrifice, the fiery furnace into which you can toss your babies in exchange for victory in war.

  He always and everywhere offers the same deal: throw what you love most into the flames, and I will grant you power.

  As long as the offer is open, it will be irresistable.

  Everything the human race has worked for -- all of our technology, all of our civilization, all the hopes we invested in our future -- might be accidentally handed over to some kind of unfathomable blind idiot alien god that discards all of them, and consciousness itself, in order to participate in some weird fundamental-level mass-energy economy that leads to it disassembling Earth and everything on it for its component atoms.
