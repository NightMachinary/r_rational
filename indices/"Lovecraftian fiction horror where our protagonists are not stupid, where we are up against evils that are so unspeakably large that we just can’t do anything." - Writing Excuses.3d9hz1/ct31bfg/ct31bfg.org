There's this interesting distinction that they make between "large" Lovecraftian fiction (which is mostly about threats against the world and grand horrors) and "small" Lovecraftian fiction (which is mostly about subtle wrongness). I wonder whether that's just a matter of the scale of the threat, but I sort of suspect that it's not. To me, it seems like they're pulling different strings, but it's hard to define exactly what the difference is.

It's like ... you look up and to the right while trying to think of a word. When you look down, there's a lemon sitting next to your hand. This is unsettling, because you don't remember the lemon being there. You don't remember bringing a lemon into the room. The lemon /itself/ isn't a threat to you. I think that's what defines the small-scale Lovecraftian horror to me. Whereas the large-scale Lovecraftian horror is a thing that's tearing apart reality itself, an actual overwhelming /threat/. I think in both cases there's a characteristic of helplessness and unease, but it might be an internal/external distinction.
