Ten minutes later and I'm home; limping tiredly through the door and into the living room to fall into my husbands arms.

"Honey, are you ok? What happened to you?"

I tell him the story for the next twenty minutes, sniffing back my tears of relief and shame and exhaustion. Halfway through, we went to the kitchen so he could make us some tea and now we were sitting at the kitchen table, warm mugs in our hands and my head rested on his shoulder.

"I've said before that you were too nice Julia; you're not obligated to talk to these people you know?"

"I know love I know, you're right. I just didn't want to be mean that's all. I'm not going to let it happen ever again" and I take another sip of tea, finally feeling better; if a little angry now at both myself for getting worked up and at that man.

"That's good to hear. You know you could have always pretended you had a text from me; you know you could have called - even if you end up leaving a long voicemail! It would have been better than listening to that man with his nonsense words, what a cruel trick".

"Oh but Josh, I don't think he was tricking me. Not on purpose. I think he thought they were all real words! Besides, they weren't all nonsense. He asked me what a paperclip was; strange huh?"

"... what was that Julia? A paperclip? What is that?"

I sit up and look at him as he sits there, confused.

"A paperclip? You know, for temporarily sticking bits of paper together. You use them for work and things. You've got some on your desk upstairs!"

He still looks confused and I'm angry now:

"David you know what I'm talking about right? You have them on your desk upstairs! You'd better not be winding me up after all I've been through today, it's not funny!"

"Do you mean a staple dear?"

I leap up out of my chair so quickly that it falls back against the fridge with a bang, shouting:

"Don't you fucking wind me up David, this isn't funny. A paperclip. Like a little curl of metal that..."

As I see his blank, confused expression my fury turns to fear I stop shouting; 'the desk, there's some on the desk'. I rush upstairs to the little office to find them; bursting into the room, I head straight to the desk tidy where we keep the... not there. They aren't there but I know they were. I start looking frantically through all the drawers and folders; sweeping everything off the desk in a panic I pull out the pay slips as we... no; no I KNOW we use them for that. I did it just last week but now they are all kept loose in a folder. Where can they be, I know we had them! I know what a paperclip is!

Ten minutes later, David comes up to find me sitting in a pool of papers and stationery; tears streaming down my face. I point to my phone, thrown off to the side:

"I can't even find them on google! But I know what a paperclip is. You know what one is I'm sure of it! I'm not mad"

David just looks at me with sad eyes, steps behind me and wraps his strong arms around my shoulders; holding me close and telling me everything was going to be ok.

"I'm sorry for shouting at you; you're so good to me" And I break out into fresh sobs, burying my head into his arm.

"It's ok baby, everything's fine. You're just tired and you've had a long day. Why don't you get some sleep and you'll feel better in the morning I promise, ok?"

I nod and, holding onto him for support, I stand up and let him lead me to the bedroom where he gets me undressed and puts me in bed.

"Julia honey, it's a little early still so I might stay up a little longer; is that ok with you?" he says as he kisses my forehead and walks to the door.

I go to answer him but fear clamps my throat shut, my hold body is paralysed beneath the sheets and I'm digging my nails into my hand.

"Good night dear, in the morning I'm sure you'll be a whole new Julia" he smiles that same smile I first fell in love with and then closes the door behind him.

Hiding under the covers, shaking like a leaf and with my fists pressed to my mouth to not scream; all I can think of is that split second where I looked at him and his eyes were black and dead.
