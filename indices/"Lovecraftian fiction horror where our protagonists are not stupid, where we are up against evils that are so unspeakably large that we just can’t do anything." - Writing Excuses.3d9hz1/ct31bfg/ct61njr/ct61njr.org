Sorry to put this here but I read your comment on small scale Lovecraftian horror and an idea for a short story appeared, fully formed, in my head and so I immediately wrote it down.

There's probably a better place for me to put it to get feedback and I'm sure my inexperience at writing will be clear to those brave enough to read it but, well, here is the short story:\\
*Paperclip*

His eyes fix upon the seat next to mine and I remember why I try not to take the bus. As he shuffles and mutters up the aisle I hesitate for a second; thinking to leave my bag there or perhaps quickly stand and let him have the seats to himself but no, that would be uncharitable. I lift my handbag up onto my lap and tuck my skirt in, twisting in to the side to give him space while making a pretense at being fascinated with the grey, empty building outside. Mentally I give myself a gold star for kindly letting him sit next to me - and then immediately tell myself off for thinking this counts as a 'good deed'; besides, he probably won't even speak to me and my stop is only ten minutes away.

"Thank you for the seat my dear, you're not a monster are you?"

Shit.

"Not a problem" I tell the window, turning and nodding briefly, sparingly, in almost his direction before returning to my desperate concrete and smeared glass London vista. I should have put my headphones in but it'd be rude to do it now. Maybe he'll stop.

Silence, for 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30; then muttering and I try to hide the sigh of relief. He didn't ask me if I was a monster did he? I smile, nervously, at my crazy imagination and I can see my movement in the reflection; no I'm sure he didn't say that, I must have misheard - I'm always doing that. He didn't sound mad anyway, quite a nice, normal voice really.\\
Then his throat clears and my heart drops as he whispers:

"The monsters in our minds are eating things you know."

My back stiffens and a shivver runs down my spine, my breath caught in my throat like a rabbit in the headlights of those words and if I could have breathed I'd have screamed except in that moment, before I could do anything further, he continued; quietly, like a lost little terrified child:

"They don't like me at all... but you're not a monster are you?"

I turned, slowly, to face him. How could I not at that deperate cry for help, my fear diminished by his own far greater terror. His pleading eyes staring straight into mine as if searching for something, hope and fear stretched across his face and I couldn't help but answer.

"No. I'm not a monster"

He sags and ducks his head, the tension falling away until he seems almost collapsed in to his seat. I suddenly realise that everyone is very aware of us; of him - trying not to look and yet somehow still judging with their hostile silence their averted gazes. I feel guilty, aware that I'm disturbing them and then the man looks up at me, smiling, and I forget the other passengers.

He's not as old as I initially thought him to be, especially now that I'm actually looking at him. Maybe in his fourties? Probably younger actually. He has friendly eyes - green like my husbands actually - and a nice smile. He's definitely been sleeping on the streets though as his hair and beard are in disarray and his clothes are odd and ill fitting; I'm not even sure how some of them are fitting together.

He sits up a little, straightening himself as if to look more respectable and then he looks deep into my eyes again; so quietly, oh so quietly, he whispers:

"Don't worry, I won't ask you for anything as I don't want them to get you!"

Ok, so he's well spoken too... and quite clearly mad. I wonder briefly if I should contact someone - the police or an ambulance or something; when he quietly continues:

"You've helped already, it's good to know I'm not the only one. But you have to hide it ok? Don't let the mind monsters know! You can see it in their eyes!"

Sighing to myself, I blink and look away. Feeling awkward now but wanting to help:

"Hey, my name is Julia; what's yours? Do you have a family?" I whisper back while trying to smile encouragingly.

"It doesn't matter, I'll be forgotten soon enough. Eaten up."

I wince, and he see's but continues on:

"Julia, I need to ask you a question. It's important ok?"

I nod, sighing to myself; well only five or so minutes to my stop now.

"Julia. What is a tolvidu?"

"... a what?"

"A toldvidu"

I sit there confused, trying to say the word back to myself but I'm not sure I even heard it properly.

"Sorry, did you say 'tolvidu'? Could you spell it? Like T-O-L...V? Or is that an F? What is it?"

He smiles broadly, seeming genuinely happy at my confusion which just makes me frustrated; I'm willing to help him but I'm not going to let him play games with me.

"Ok Julia, another: what is a clooful? This ones easier, it only disppeared a short time ago."

His question is clearly serious but he doesn't nearly as worried as he was for that first question.

"Disappeared a short time ago? Ok so are they animals that are going extinct?"

He smiles again and his eyes, that seemed so full of fear, are now twinkling with amusement.

"I'm glad Julia; so glad. Sorry, I'm using your name a lot but it's been a while since I've talked to someone and it's nice to use your name; sorry if I'm being awkward. Interesting guess though, I guess they are going extinct - that's a nice way to put it, thank you! Ok, just a couple more and you're done ok?"

As he talks I get more and more annoyed and when he mentions more questions I snap. Keeping my voice just barely at a whisper to not disturb the other passengers I tell him:

"Look, I was happy to talk to you or help in some way but I'm not answering your nonsense questions anymore; my stop is coming up so if you would please kindly move I would like to get off now"

The last part at almost my normal voice level, I stand; bag in hand like a shield in front of me; while awkwardly reaching for the button over his head to indicate my stop.

"I'm so sorry Julia" he whispers frantically, "but I've got to know! Do you know what a rundel is? Or a zberber?"

I start to shuffle forward and he quickly stands to get out of my way, the bus is starting to slow but I awkwardly fumble past him.

"What about a nool? Ever gone nooling?"

I turn angrily to face him:

"Would you stop talking? I have no idea what you're saying but I want to get off this bus and I don't want you following me ok? I'm sorry but I don't want to speak to you."

"That's fine; I understand. I won't disturb you anymore and I won't get off here. I just wanted to know you'd be safe."

He's still trying to whisper but the whole bus is obviously paying attention to him. I start walking down the aisle to the entrance and I can hear him following me slowly, hesitantly and, as I get to the entrance I hear:

"Wait! Hold on please! Julia wait!"

I step off the bus and turn to look as the man rushes to the entrance and then halts. I'm holding my bag up in defense - though I'm not sure what I would do if he stepped down.

He leans forward and whispers hoarsely:

"Angivur, Paperclip, Rendillop, Doilen"

Confused, I look up into his staring eyes and ask:

"Of course I know what a paper..." but the words dry up in my mouth at the look of sheer horror in his eyes.

"Don't. Ever. Say it Julia. Now run!"

He turns to the bus driver and screams before running down the aisle, shouting and gibbering nonsense but the bus driver just stares at me with black dead eyes. I turn and I run, heart pounding, chest heaving I spring until I can't go any further, collapsing down against a wall; arms and legs burning and a stitch stabbing at my stomach while I gasp and gulp for air.

I lay there for five or ten minutes; at first just calming down and recovering from the run and then feeling embarrassed at being so scared by the delusions of a mad man. I finally pick myself back up, aching all over and look around me; not too far from home as thankfully I at least ran in the right direction; maybe if I was fitter I'd have even made it all the way. Ok so two lessons learnt from this; start going to the gym again and don't listen to nutters.

(I ran out of space so I've continued the little bit that's left in the next comment)
