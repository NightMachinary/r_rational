I've oft thought that Lovecraft is the most native horror style to the [[/r/rational]] genre - in part because of how frequently Lovecraft-style incomprehensibility can be used to model things like [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/][human nature]] or [[http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2015/07/any-sufficiently-advanced-tech.html][big data]]. Also, I /swear/ there was an EY post (in the Quantum Physics sequence, maybe) describing the difference between how we perceive walking through a park, and what's really happening as we walk through a park (all sorts of quantum stuff bubbling under the surface, that we'll never be able to directly perceive). But I can't find it anywhere. [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]], do you recall ever writing such a thing?

In any case, I'm glad to see this here. Cheers, OP!
