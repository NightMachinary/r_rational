So, JaNoWriMo is almost over and I've written about 22,000 words, which I'm really proud of. In doing so, I managed to iron out a lot of plot things to make everything make more sense (just this weekend I worked out a way to make something that happens in Volume 3 follow logically from actions taken in Volume 1, rather than just kind of happen for /reasons/).

It's funny, when I first started the project I was scared, I hated everything I wrote, and so on. Now I'm excited, proud, and it's all coming together (but not finished - maybe another 5-10k words, hopefully). Of course, my early chapters don't seem as fluid. I'm going to have to edit them heavily, or maybe just rewrite them entirely. The other thing is that I keep on finding more stuff that's relevant to add, and so the thing gets longer - but in a good way, in a way that fleshes things out, rather than a way that makes it longer than necessary for no reason.

So, I guess the biggest thing I've learned is if you want to get good at something, force yourself to do it when you're bad at it. The other biggest thing is that it's really hard to write at my desk at home, but easy to write in empty meeting rooms after I finish work and in public libraries. There's lots of research that shows that context is very important, so it's really no surprise, but worth noting. Public libraries are great in general, incidentally: free wifi, nice places to sit, and I spent some of my time looking through recipe books and taking photos of recipes I wanted to make some time.

I'll hopefully share the full story on here in a couple of months, though if anyone wants to be a beta reader I think it's about ready for that.
