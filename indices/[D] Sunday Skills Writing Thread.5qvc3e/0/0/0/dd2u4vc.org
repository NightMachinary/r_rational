Yep, JaNoWriMo is a tiny and unofficial January edition of NaNoWriMo. November is a terrible month for me, I had exams in 2016, my wedding in 2015, and so on, so it's just... better to go for January. I think I'll "take February off" (really: ratchet Beeminder to 250 words a day), and then speed up to 750 in March again.

I also apparently signed up to design a species in your kickstarter so I should probably email you about that along with the links to my writing.
