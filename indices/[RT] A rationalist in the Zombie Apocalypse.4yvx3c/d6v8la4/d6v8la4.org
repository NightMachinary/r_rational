A great source of lead is automotive wheel weights, the kind that crimp onto the rim. Hit up one good sized parking lot and you'll have pounds of lead. Hit up a tire shop and you have more than you could use in a life time. And it's not likely to be a heavily looted resource.

The lead alloy used is also pretty good for firearms since it's harder than pure lead, meaning you can drive the bullet to reasonable muzzle velocities.
