The way it actually works is the virus is latent in everyone. It didnt really turn 99.9% of everyone at once. Rather, the virus is in you until you die. When you die it takes over your motor functions. The problem is when in major cities you have a few hundred people dying every day. They start killing and then there is exponential growth, and no localized area to contain.

In the show, corpses show signs of progressive deterioration as time passes. In a decade or so I figure the zombies will mostly be gone, and any surviving settlements will just have to take up vigils over sick and old people and practice cremation.
