[[/r/collapse]] is open for AMAs and very rationally-minded. We'd love to answer those questions!

GPS would be down within 60 days. Energy is a huge concern, but not in the way you think: electric cars, for example, seem like a great idea when the gasoline infrastructure collapses, but don't forget that cars need good and free roads too. Without the rule of law, roads would instantly turn into prime ambush material. Solar panels and inverters would be the most sought after things in a post-apocalytic world, because they make lighting, manufacturing and cooking practically free. Unfortunately they need to operate in the open (drawing attention) and they're quite fragile too. So I doubt that we'd be able to operate a solar-based society for much longer than a few decades.
