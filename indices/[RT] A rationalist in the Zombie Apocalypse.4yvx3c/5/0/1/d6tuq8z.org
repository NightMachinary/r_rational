But what do you do after fifty years for solar panels? I think current solar panels for consumer use (that attach to homes, I don't know about portable camping ones) are meant to last ~30 years. Just like lithium batteries, I don't think they'd be replaceable without a bunch of infrastructure.

I didn't know cars could run on peanut oil. That's pretty neat.
