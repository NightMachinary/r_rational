For electricity generation the best solution is hydro. It has very low maintenance (could propably run decades with just cleaning the waterway) and its renewable. They can scale from very small (enough for a small house) to really massive.I would secure a source like that. Plus you need water anyway.

Storage is trickier and baterries wont last long. One thing i can think of is using our spare hydro generator power to electrolize water into hydrogen. Now petrol internal combustion engines can run on hydrogen and air very nicely with small modification (basically bypass the fuel rails entirely and just add hydrogen in the air intake directly with a valve to regulate power). Biggest issue is how to put the hydrogen in a tank but we could salvage some equipment somewhere and have unlimited fuel.

WE can also use this with portable petrol generator for remote sites we might need electricity.
