the loud motorcycle, lack of helmets and armor, forgetting walkie talkies, not using ball gags or crybabies.. pretty much everything. there are more rational characters in the story as well, and they tend to live longer.. but one of the main characters, Daryl, a badass Georgian moonshiner who uses a crossbow and rides a very loud motorcycle /everywhere he goes/ hasn't died yet.
