Man, I'm a ham, I should know that about the radio.

As to the paintball gun, it's hard to say. A regular paintball gun fires ~4g projectiles at 300 feet per second, but can usually achieve higher muzzle velocities than the 300fps limit paintball fields impose for safety and comfort. Call it 400fps (120 m/s) at the top end. This translates to ~30 joules of energy that the projectile can deliver on impact. Normally, the high-surface area, lightweight paintball decellerates a lot in flight and a lot of the remaining energy is dissapated into bursting the paintball.

If you were to use a lead ball, the muzzle energy would theoretically be similar (~30 joules) but that would translate to a much heavier projectile moving much more slowly. It would also be less affected by air resistance due to its slower speed and greater mass. Upon impact, it would deliver much more of that energy to the target instead of bursting.

30 joules is about the same muzzle energy as a reasonably powerful air rifle, albeit one that is designed for rodents and birds. I /have/ seen video on youtube of a hunter using such a rifle to bring down wild pigs, so 30 joules to the head /can/ be lethal.

Whether the more distributed impact of the projectile due to its greater surface area would render it nonlethal, or whether the barrel length and mechanism of the marker would be able to impart the full 30 joules to a lead ball, I don't know.
