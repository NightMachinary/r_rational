  Call it 400fps (120 m/s) at the top end.

Hm. According to the Wikipedia page on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun][air guns]], there have been significantly more powerful ones:

#+begin_quote
  In the 17th century, air guns, in calibers .30--.51, were used to hunt big game deer and wild boar. These air rifles were charged using a pump to fill an air reservoir and gave velocities from 650 to 1,000 feet per second (200--300 m/s). They were also used in warfare, the most recognized example being the Girandoni air rifle.

also

  Spring-piston guns have a practical upper limit of 1250 ft/s (380 m/s) for .177 cal (4.5 mm) pellets.

There's also [[http://www.pyramydair.com/article/_50_Caliber_Dragon_Slayer_Air_Rifle_December_2007/45][the Dragon Slayer]] air rifle, which shoots at 1,000 fps. Oh, and I found a [[http://www.pyramydair.com/article/What_is_Muzzle_Energy_August_2003/5][cool calculator]] for airgun energy/speed/bullet mass. I actually found this thing a long time ago when I was writing 2YE; I used it to calculate the details of the steam cannon that the protagonist built. I'd forgotten about it and it was cool to run over it again.
