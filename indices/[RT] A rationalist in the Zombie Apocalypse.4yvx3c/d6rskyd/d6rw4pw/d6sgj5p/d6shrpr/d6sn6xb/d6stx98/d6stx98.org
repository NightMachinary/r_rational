Well...yeah, there are more powerful air rifles, and virtually all air rifles have a higher muzzle velocity. But there are two common types of air rifle you can find at virtually any sports store:

Break Barrel: very sustainable weapon, reloaded by cocking the barrel like a lever to compress a pneumatic cylinder or spring. Downsides: takes many seconds to reload between each shot.

CO2: High rate of fire but requires CO2 cylinders in addition to ammo, reducing sustainability.

Neither of these would be particularly practical, since the break-barrel (the kind I personally own) takes way too long to reload and the CO2 type requires a rare resource.

There are other options; Pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) air rifles are probably the best option for a zombie situation since they can fire multiple rounds in quick succession with high power and accuracy. However, they're pretty specialty and quite uncommon. Most people who would lay down the cash for one would just as soon get a gunpowder firearm, so most stores don't carry them.

In addition to their rarity, PCP guns only get about 30 shots per recharge--not terrible, but not great.

Meanwhile paintball markers are very common, get hundreds of shots per recharge, and have an insane rate of fire compared to any of the others.

They might not be the most effective or powerful, but I wanted this story to be tempered by what the protagonist could realistically get her hands on. Otherwise she'd be driving around in a solar-powered electric tank.
