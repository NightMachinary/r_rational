I think you're probably right about the muzzle velocity. I thought hop-up was more used on airsoft and not on paintball, though? Not sure.

I actually wrote this a while back and having just found this subreddit, thought it would be a good fit. Since then, I've done a fair bit more research on air rifles. If I were to do a rewrite, I'd probably give the protagonist a pre-charged pneumatic .25 calibre pellet gun.
