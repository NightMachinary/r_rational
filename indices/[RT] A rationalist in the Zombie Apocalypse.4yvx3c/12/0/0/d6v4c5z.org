The pellet gun might not work wither, depending on velocity. They make pellet rifles that will go supersonic but with a pellet that small and light you'll lose velocity quickly to air resistance and go transonic around 50 yards. It probably wouldn't sufficiently damage a brain to disable a zombie. Go with an air rifle built for hunting, in the .375 caliber neighborhood.\\
One more point: a rational person would probably keep rope with them in a zombie apocalypse. Herd of zombies took over the first floor? Rappel off on the clearest side of the building. You could feasibly keep a few 100 foot bundles of parachute cord in a backpack. They're stretchy under load, but two strands will support a person. The cords would be narrow and uncomfortable for a traditional rappel, but a controlled descent could be achieved with a pair of prusik knots for support. Put your weight on one, and slide the other, put your weight on that one and slide the first one down. It's time consuming but better than losing your grip, and you could rest indefinitely and go back up too.\\
Anyway. Great read. Just wanted to say she can probably still solve the situation she's in at the end. The knots she would need to know are a prusik hitch, and a figure 8 loop. Both of these are such useful knots you can find them on wikipedia.
