There aren't any explicit references except the main characters' daughter; in The Walking Dead, the protagonist's son is named Carl, but he has an accent that makes it sound like Coral.

However, this story wouldn't be out of place in virtually any episode of The Walking Dead. The overarching theme of the show seems to be that the rational self-interest of various individual factions results in a tragedy of the commons that works against the interests of humanity as a whole; it's not the zombies that are the threat, it's the other humans.

However, to maintain that narrative and its resulting tension, the show often resorts to improbable bad luck and/or inexplicable incompetence. It's also heavily rule-of-cooled, so loud motorcycles and sleeveless shirts are somehow seen as reasonable in a universe where the primary threat is drawn to loud noises and wants to nibble you to death.
