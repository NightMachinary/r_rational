This is pretty great, and now I'm curious: is there a well written and scientifically accurate article somewhere on what technologies would be usable during an apocalypse? I'm pretty sure GPS would be fine for decades, while gasoline would disappear quickly. Not sure what would happen with batteries. Obviously anything that can be charged via solar would be fine for as long as solar panels are, but I imagine lithium ion batteries would wear out pretty quickly and something like walkie talkies would be nearly useless after a decade.
