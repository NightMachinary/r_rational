It's an interesting question. Solar panels will last decades, and are probably the lowest-maintainance power source--but you're right. Batteries are inherrently quite fragile and won't last forever even if babied. The lithium battery in your phone might last a few years, the lead battery in your car about the same.

If you had a lot of solar panels and a stable base of operations, I suspect a mechanical power storage method would work--pumping water into a tower and then using a dynamo to turn that stored potential energy back into electricity on its way to water your crops.

Barring such a complex solution, you'd probably be stuck with using electricity only during the day, and then only in amounts that solar panels could provide on a continuous basis--no welding for you, unless you've got a ton.

Internal combustion engines wouldn't be entirely beyond reach; gasoline engines could run on ethanol, and deisel engines could run on peanut oil or other liquid fats.

I know primitive batteries could also be devised with commonly available metals and simple vinegar or fruit juices, but that's not particularly efficient.
