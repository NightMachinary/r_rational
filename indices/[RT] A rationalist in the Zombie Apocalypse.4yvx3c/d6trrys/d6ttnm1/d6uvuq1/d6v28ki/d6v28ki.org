Interesting. Unfortunately I have only an end-user's knowledge of battery chemistry, but if lead acids are really that simple to build and maintain then they'd be a prime candidate for power storage.

I don't know about hydro dams. Few rivers have just one dam, and if one of the dams upstream gives up, it could trigger a domino effect that could be very bad news.

Also, if you're staying in one place for any length of time, I think you could set up hydrogen electrolysis and/or methane biodigesters to fuel internal combustion engines, which would make much more portable mechanical power.
