I don't mean large-scale, settlement levels of power storage or production. Just individual power storage. I can't think of a better way to store a lot of electrical potential energy, though as I've said, I don't know a ton about battery chemistry.

I guess you could keep the reservoir mostly empty as well; it's not like you'd need to run a hydro dam at max capacity for a small corps of survivors. I wonder how many people would be required to man one...
