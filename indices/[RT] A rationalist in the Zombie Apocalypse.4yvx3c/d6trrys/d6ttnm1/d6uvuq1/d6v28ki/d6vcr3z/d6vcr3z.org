Lead acids are really simple, but they're low voltage so the energy density is low (and they are horrible environmentally, with all that lead and acid). You wouldn't want them as primary storage or we'd be using them today.

Hydro dams are designed as low maintenance for safety, so there isn't much danger they would fail as dams, but even if they did a dam further downstream wouldn't be affected much as it has a very large reservoir behind it to absorb most of the water. Really hydro electric would be the easiest way for people to get power. You want to find the cheapest and easiest way to get electricity, just look back to what they used in the beginning. Water wheels did most everything because it was cheap and most important, constant.
