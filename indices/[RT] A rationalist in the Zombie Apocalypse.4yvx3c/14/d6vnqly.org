This reminds me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_Apocalypse_(film)][Zombie Apocalypse,]] a zombie movie by "The Asylum" of all companies. It's the only zombie movie I know where people act rationally and deaths are due to unforseen situations and calculated risks rather than being a dumbass. Bite checks, getting armor, meeting other survivors and exchanging information rather than being jackasses... good movie.
