Good thought. There are few situations for which rope /isn't/ useful.

I have a belt I made using some seatbelt webbing and a V-ring quick fit bar. It's a great belt and I've used it to rappel before. Not as comfortable as a real harness, but it doesn't look out of place in most company.

I honestly think you could make a figure-8 type of thing, even if you couldn't loot one. That would make rappelling a lot easier.

I've seen a video on Youtube where a guy took out a couple of wild pigs with a .22 subsonic air rifle. Precise headshots, of course, but since that's the only thing that works on zombies anyway, I think it's plausible.
