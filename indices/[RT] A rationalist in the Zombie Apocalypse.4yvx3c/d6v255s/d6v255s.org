+A .50 caliber ball of lead would weigh more than 12 grams. A 12 gram ball of lead would be too small to work in a .50 bore, unless used with an improvised sabot, like some kind of gelatin capsule around it.+ Nevermind, the weight is right. My instincts were wrong about that point. The problem would be that the lead ball would weight about 10 times as much as the 1.25 gram .50 paintball the marker is designed to work with. The character would need to modify the valve settings significantly to get sufficient velocity to penetrate a skull, and would only get around 20 shots per tank at those settings. Unmodified, the marker would just have enough power to push the ball far enough to go about 6 feet. Firing at a 45 degree angle for maximum distance, the ball might not exit the barrel. Part of this would be because of hop up, a technique used in smooth bore air guns to increase range by giving the ball backspin through warping the barrel. Soft paintballs can deform easily to get past the bends but lead would get jammed up.\\
Protip: there are companies that make legit compressed air hunting rifles, for use in controlling large pests in environments where you might not have a good backstop. They mostly get used with night vision optics to put down foxes or coyotes prowling for livestock, poultry, and housepets, without contributing significant noise pollution. The main character could have grabbed one from a pest control business. These are designed for lethal use, some are powerful enough for deer, and they tend to get 25-35 shots per tank.
