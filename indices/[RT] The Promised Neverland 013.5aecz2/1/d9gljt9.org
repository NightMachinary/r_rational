I feel so stupid right now. I suspected Ray of being the spy, but only as a new one. Of course Mama wouldn't have accepted a new informant so easily!

As a shounen manga, I'm going to say the reason Ray is working for Mama is because Ray originally was "selfish" enough to only care about his survival.
