My guess is that Ray found out the truth independantly a long time ago. Since Ray seems to be the most pragmatic out of the group, Mama probably explained just how dire his situation is and offered him perks in exchange for loyalty.

Perhaps she even told him that he might one day be a Papa.

But Ray wouldn't take her word that he would be safe from being shipped. So he set an escape plan in motion so that he would have another option instead of just blindly trusting Mama (who had already proven herself untrustworthy). The reason he waited so long is because their projected shipping date was soon and he had less to lose by gambling closer to the date he would have been killed anyways.

I just don't think Mama is the type to cling to sentimentality and spare him because he's related. I also don't think the Demons would let someone look after their own family members.
