It's also possible that he recognised the need to improve his chances of escape by acquiring more knowledge and skills (and pushing the other main two to do the same).

Incidentally, this would explain why Ray didn't want to bring the younger kids. If all he wanted to do was inform on them, he wouldn't need to make a point of being callous; slipping under the radar would suffice. If he genuinely wanted to give himself the greatest chance of escape, he would.

However, it would also make sense if he were just playing a role as the pragmatist to avoid suspicion, so I'd say my point is only weak evidence for the "Ray is hedging his bets" proposition. The bigger evidence is that it fits his character perfectly.
