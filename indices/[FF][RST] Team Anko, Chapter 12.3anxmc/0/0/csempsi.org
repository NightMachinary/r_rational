As I understood it, Anko was putting on a show because she knew they were being watched. Shino was angry because he thought that Hinata was badly hurt, hence Anko's "she's fine!"

It's completely out of character for him to get emotional because of enemy attacking him (it's what enemies do) but it's completely in character for Hinata to assume nobody would be that upset on her account.
