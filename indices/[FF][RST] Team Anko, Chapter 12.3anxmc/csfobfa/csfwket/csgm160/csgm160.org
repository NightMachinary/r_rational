In 2YE the fight with Loki and the Hearth Goddess, the action really seemed to jump around in a way that, even with allowing for tricks and higher beings of power, did not seem to flow as well. I can't quite point to any one thing as really bad but compared to then you have improved the flow of a fight with teleportation(or the next best thing to it) existing.
