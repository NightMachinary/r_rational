The Song of Songs as Uriel's attempt to figure out human sexuality:

"YOU ARE LIKE A THING HUMANS LIKE. UM. HUMANS SEEM TO LIKE LIVESTOCK A LOT. YOU ARE LIKE A HORSE. MY BELOVED. A FEMALE HORSE THAT A RICH KING WOULD HAVE. YOUR PHYSICAL FEATURES ARE LIKE VARIOUS ANIMALS AND PLANTS. GOATS. SHEEP. BUNCHES OF GRAPES. FOR INSTANCE. UM. YOUR BREASTS ARE LIKE BABY ANTELOPES."
