Well this feels like an ethical rats' nest of issues... inadvertently creating a brand new person, who is born kinda pre-programmed to be obsessed with all the detritus of your life, and also in love with you, and also willing to have kinky sex with you.

Then, separate issue, she's sufficiently "plugged in" to turn all the ATMs and card readers and cell phones into an impromptu surveillance network? That sounds awfully like a Skynet singularity just waiting to happen.

Edit: /Still further issues/; there's no guarantee that the contents of this email are at all sincere, and oh dear it's a not-necessarily friendly AI that is entirely not in a box. "And that's how I caused the apocalypse", indeed.
