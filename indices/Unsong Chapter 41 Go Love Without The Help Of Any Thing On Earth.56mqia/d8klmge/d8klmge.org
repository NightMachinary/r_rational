Things I anticipated:

- There are not 3 more books still to go, with titles "Leviticus," "Numbers," and "Deuteronomy." We're too far into the narrative for 3 more books, plus those are terrible titles.

Things I did not anticipate:

- Sarah made Aaron forget the ensouling name. I had firmly rejected Aaron's hypothesis that the reason the name had ceased to function was because he was saying it wrong.
