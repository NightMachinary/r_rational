  There are not 3 more books still to go, with titles "Leviticus," "Numbers," and "Deuteronomy." We're too far into the narrative for 3 more books, plus those are terrible titles.

Hallelujah only has four verses, so I'm guessing there will be four books total. I had wondered how the naming was going to work.
