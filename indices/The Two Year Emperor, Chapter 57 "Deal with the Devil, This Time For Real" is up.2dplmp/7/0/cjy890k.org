Yeah, this is something I haven't really gotten into -- too focused on other parts of the plot. Suffice to say, race relations in Flobovia are complicated. There's a bunch of history behind it but it hasn't been relevant to what was happening onscreen.

Part of the problem is that Jake has interacted with very few people, honestly, and most of them high officials. Flobovia still runs on a feudal structure, meaning there's relatively little turnover among the ruling families, and it's hard for newcomers to break into the upper ranks. Flobovia was originally founded by refugees from one part of southern Ainaalacar when it splintered apart during the last Zombocalypse. The refugees were led by a human; she needed to build a government quickly, and she needed people she trusted to fill the government slots. Predictably, she mostly chose family and close friends. As in the real world, most peoples' closest friends are members of their own race, meaning that the initial government of the fledging nation was primarily human.

Over the next few decades / centuries, plenty of other refugees showed up, of all races. They slotted into the society with greater or lesser degrees of comfort and many of them became significant members of society...but the top ranks were still almost entirely human.

And it's not just the officials themselves -- even many of their servants are hereditary positions that can trace their origins back to the founding of the nation. Remember that Suze grew up in the castle; she's actually related to most of the people who live there, including many of the nobles. (Making the whole "call the servant to your room" thing even squickier.)

There is no law against other races holding high office, but it just doesn't happen that much. It's something of a glass ceiling -- no one necessarily intends to do it, it just happens as a result of nearly invisible social conditioning and expectations.

I never said that Flobovia was perfect...or even a nice place.
