I've been wondering...

In the opening chapters you described that in Flobovia (still a stupid name) there are quite a many different sentient races.

  People of what seemed like a hundred races went past, just going about their business. Many of them were races I was familiar with---elves, dwarves, halflings, some half-breeds---but many were completely unfamiliar; eight-foot bipedal scaly types with huge yellow snake eyes and four-inch talons on hands and feet, furry five-foot-high starfish creatures who were so shaggy it was hard to make out any details, two-torsoed centauroids, the torsoes facing in opposite directions but each with an excessively long, flexible neck that would allow them to turn to face each other, and dozens of other species.

But that was the first and last time, I think, you mentioned the diversity of population. Since they didn't seem to be on each other's throats all the time I assume the different kinds of people live intermingled or next door to each, with a fair bit of tolerance and respect for each other.

But your narration makes it seem as if Flobovia is a human saturated state, not a mention of other kinds of people in any position of power or public life whatsoever. That may be a case of Jake being an unreliable narrator, but, well... it seems odd. It could also be the case that positions of power /are/ only for humans and all the other people are there for flavouring the Stupidworld.
