Wow. It's really cool to see people putting this much thought in about something I wrote. Thank you..

#+begin_quote
  Given the prospect of an unbreakable telepathic bond with this creature, I'd be trying to flip his alignment with a certain cursed piece of headgear ASAP. My guess is Thomas would at least want to try this. Could win him points with Shailos if it works. Especially if the rest of the remaining Ice Assassins (whose interests Herrún would be inclined towards) could be flipped as well.
#+end_quote

Challenging, but it would certainly be nice if it could get done. Afi (and, by extension, Icefi) isn't as stupid and overconfident as Colborn, though -- trying to punch HIM out and put a helmet on him would be...unwise.

#+begin_quote
  Can Programmed Amnesia be used to alter Bone-Clone directives, as a headache cure etc? Seems a little too easy (I'd think Afi would have tried, using mindscrape to get rid of the kill-Afi bit if he could), but worth a thought.
#+end_quote

He would have, yes. Given that he's using it on himself, he would certainly have had no compunctions about using it on his minions.

#+begin_quote
  Can promises not to kill Original Afi (subject to reasonable conditions) and help free him from avatar-ism, etc. be used to manipulate the Icefi's into highly advantageous things they wouldn't otherwise go for, like volunteering for an alignment flip? (Even with Afi being Evil himself, a Neutral Herrún sounds more in his interests to serve than Neklos, and Afissassins seem like they would be willing to put up with a lot to try and achieve that.)
#+end_quote

In order for that to be a worthwhile bargaining chip, there would have to be a plausible scenario whereby Our Heroes could kill Afi. There currently isn't; the only one that might even possibly have worked (Jake's 'Take off and nuke em from orbit' plan) got sacrificed to Herrún so he can't think of it.

#+begin_quote
  I'm also curious how Jake would be affected by Helm of Opposite Alignment... Evil deontologist? :-)
#+end_quote

Heh. That would be a sight to see, wouldn't it?

No, Jake stands outside the alignment and XP system. He has no alignment, cannot earn XP, etc. This is why he can't be resurrected by normal means, and why he will never gain a character level.

#+begin_quote
  The Unreadable Library is so obviously up Herrún's alley that I could see it becoming her temple -- I figured chessmaster Loki did this on purpose, all the more to get on her good side (and serve his own amusement at the same time). The books are basically holy items for her right off the bat, being packed with secret information like that. On the other hand, the library also might be a good living space for the people, albeit a little cramped. Could work as both, especially if we decide to have millions of clerics. (There's no limit, right?) And Herrún should be able to manifest and do miracles there since it is her temple.

  The book shelves are conveniently big enough for bunk beds. There is electricity. Since it's a library, I'm thinking there is air conditioning / humidity control as well. Tricks like the commoner railgun and the shops aren't magic, so they probably work inside. Can shops work for waste disposal?
#+end_quote

Huh, interesting thought about the bunk beds. I hadn't thought of that one -- thanks for the idea.

#+begin_quote
  I'm curious as to whether Improved Shrink Item would work on the altars without disrupting the ritual. Maybe connect them with beams and shrink as one object if the proportional distance is what matters.
#+end_quote

They don't know if it's literal or proportional distance, and they don't want to take a chance.

#+begin_quote
  Do shrunk items expand the moment they enter a magic-free zone? If so, the anti-magic spell might be kind of hazardous around shrunk items. If not, I wonder if the shrink spell can be canceled inside such a zone / undoing magic still works.
#+end_quote

Hm. Well, I will point out that Jake had a Shrink Item'd cannon sewed into his trenchcoat when they were fighting their way through the sea of undead. Shortly after he threw it, the Landguard put up antimagic. If Jake had had any /other/ Shrink Item'd stuff in his coat, it didn't grow. Of course, it wasn't stated that he did have any other shrunken stuff....

#+begin_quote
  Compressed gas can certainly exist without magic, and can be created by magic easily, so if an air supply is needed in the library, it can be done. Hopefully, intelligent!Jake is up to the engineering needed for safety. Probably the hardest thing in the long run is security against accidental and deliberate bombs and other nonmagical threats that can wipe out a city. Divine protection from Herrún might help, since miracle (I guess, as long as it isn't "divine magic") isn't magical. Also, skills and stats can work without magic, so maybe we can have ultra-lucky/wise/prescient guards or something.
#+end_quote

The engineering for a self-contained airsupply for millions of people, plus the air scrubbers and recirculators that would be needed, is definitely beyond Jake's knowledgebase. That's some seriously hard-core engineering there.

#+begin_quote
  Can these books become magic items when a deity blesses them?
#+end_quote

Anything can become a magic item, or a fish or a poodle, if a god wants it to.

#+begin_quote
  Just being immune to magic doesn't mean they can't themselves be magical, right?
#+end_quote

True.

#+begin_quote
  So if Herrún wants the books to become holy armor or something (when used outside templebrarytown where magic is okay), she could change their nature to a magic one (assuming Loki isn't too insistent to the contrary -- I'm betting he won't want to let them be made stretchy/big/readable). An item that makes you insanely good at guessing knowledge or concealing information would be a good thing to try and get Herrún to create, domain-wise. (Maybe a concealment effect could get double bonus from Loki and Herrún, him being a deceiver.) Tome of Secrecy?
#+end_quote

Huh. Eeeeenteresting.

#+begin_quote
  Oh, just thought of something kind of important. Isaac the wizard knows how to make antimatter. That should be wiped for safety ASAP. Hopefully the dark gods didn't read it off him.
#+end_quote

Mwahaha. Things are SO much worse than that.... /evil grin/

#+begin_quote
  Can we use PAO to make a condensed summary or larger print copy of the Loki books? Seems like that avoids using magic on the books, without making the PAO refer to arbitrarily generated information. (I'm guessing this is still in "paper containing the phylactery location" territory -- PAO cannot generate secret information. Or maybe it's an indirect use of magic on the books?)
#+end_quote

Even if it could work (which I'm not addressing), Loki wouldn't allow it.

#+begin_quote
  Oh hey, what about using PAO to make a planet to teleport people to? For safety and Herrún favor points, put it on the opposite side of the sun so no one knows about it. Since e.g cities can't work with PAO, it could be a featureless world (big rock) at first, but magic could terraform it pretty fast.
#+end_quote

Heh, I can see it now: "Polymorph Any Object: Rotten banana to planet!"

#+begin_quote
  Maybe consecrate the whole thing as a holy site to a Good deity, say Arros, and fill the oceans with holy water and such (cover it with holy symbols maybe) to prevent the undead from ever colonizing... Then get to work on universal resurrection, with opposite alignment curses ready for any evil people...

  As always, thanks for a great story and endless munchkinly amusement :)
#+end_quote

That's hilarious. I might just do an omake about that if my Muse will get her butt in gear. I'm traveling, it's been a long week, and she's been being really frickin' lazy these last few days. I keep saying "Hey, hey, wake up! We've got a chapter to drop tomorrow!" She keeps pulling the covers over her head and mumbling "Go 'way. Sleeping."

I'm setting up the espresso drip now.
