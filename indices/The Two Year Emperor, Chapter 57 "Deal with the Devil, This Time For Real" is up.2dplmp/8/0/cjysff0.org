Albrecht made it look like he was using a Wish to transport them all home. Wish is the most powerful arcane spell there is, and it costs 5000 XP to cast. With such a high cost, using it for mere transportation is utterly wasteful -- it would be like take an Apache helicopter to travel a few blocks. The only reason you would do that would be if the cost was so small compared to your resources that you couldn't be bothered using something more efficient. In other words, it was a subtle demonstration of enormous power.

It was also a complete scam. He didn't actually use a Wish -- they had a Teleportation Circle prepared and, when he pretended to cast the Wish, everyone simply stepped backwards into the Circle, thereby being transported back to base. Teleportation Circle is a dismissible spell so, once they were at their destination, the wizard who created the Circle turned it off so that no Flobovians would accidentally wander into it and give the game away. What Jake found in the cobblestones was the powdered amber that is the material component of the spell.

Apparently that was not as clear as I had thought. Sorry about that.
