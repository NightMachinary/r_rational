Yay, I called part of it!

I was expecting them to take a bit longer to learn that Loki was working with Afi, but dramatic irony on that scale is hard to get right.

They have to apply the /permanency/ before the bond wears off, right? It lasts 10 minutes per caster level, so... yeah it's probably gonna be up for a few days or something ridiculous like that. Still, the Gods will know about the Bond if they see Jake permanencing it, won't they?

The only workaround I can see is to try and slip the trigger words naturally into conversation. "We really need un-eavesdroppable communication with our soldiers in the field. How many /Permanencio Telepathic Bond/s can we rustle up?" Or just say it really quietly; if the scrying port is far away from Jake's mouth, they won't hear him if he whispers, right?
