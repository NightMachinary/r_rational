Given the prospect of an unbreakable telepathic bond with this creature, I'd be trying to flip his alignment with a certain cursed piece of headgear ASAP. My guess is Thomas would at least want to try this. Could win him points with Shailos if it works. Especially if the rest of the remaining Ice Assassins (whose interests Herrún would be inclined towards) could be flipped as well.

I wonder how the commands to serve Original Afi's interests, etc. would interact with the alignment change? Would they be reinterpreted to be as Good as possible, or are they part of the alignment, such that they would be inverted?

Can Programmed Amnesia be used to alter Bone-Clone directives, as a headache cure etc? Seems a little too easy (I'd think Afi would have tried, using mindscrape to get rid of the kill-Afi bit if he could), but worth a thought.

Can promises not to kill Original Afi (subject to reasonable conditions) and help free him from avatar-ism, etc. be used to manipulate the Icefi's into highly advantageous things they wouldn't otherwise go for, like volunteering for an alignment flip? (Even with Afi being Evil himself, a Neutral Herrún sounds more in his interests to serve than Nekos, and Afissassins seem like they would be willing to put up with a lot to try and achieve that.)

Since opposite alignment is technically a curse, would Herrún's gratitude make her want to free the originally-Evil victims, or would she see it as good-for-them (as they see it, afterward)?

I'm also curious how Jake would be affected by Helm of Opposite Alignment... Evil deontologist? :-)

The Unreadable Library is so obviously up Herrún's alley that I could see it becoming her temple -- I figured chessmaster Loki did this on purpose, all the more to get on her good side (and serve his own amusement at the same time). The books are basically holy items for her right off the bat, being packed with secret information like that. On the other hand, the library also might be a good living space for the people, albeit a little cramped. Could work as both, especially if we decide to have millions of clerics. (There's no limit, right?) And Herrún should be able to manifest and do miracles there since it is her temple.

The book shelves are conveniently big enough for bunk beds. There is electricity. Since it's a library, I'm thinking there is air conditioning / humidity control as well. Tricks like the commoner railgun and the shops aren't magic, so they probably work inside. Can shops work for waste disposal?

I'm curious as to whether Improved Shrink Item would work on the altars without disrupting the ritual. Maybe connect them with beams and shrink as one object if the proportional distance is what matters.

Do shrunk items expand the moment they enter a magic-free zone? If so, the anti-magic spell might be kind of hazardous around shrunk items. If not, I wonder if the shrink spell can be canceled inside such a zone / undoing magic still works.

Compressed gas can certainly exist without magic, and can be created by magic easily, so if an air supply is needed in the library, it can be done. Hopefully, intelligent!Jake is up to the engineering needed for safety. Probably the hardest thing in the long run is security against accidental and deliberate bombs and other nonmagical threats that can wipe out a city. Divine protection from Herrún might help, since miracle (I guess, as long as it isn't "divine magic") isn't magical. Also, skills and stats can work without magic, so maybe we can have ultra-lucky/wise/prescient guards or something.

Can these books become magic items when a deity blesses them? Just being immune /to/ magic doesn't mean they can't themselves /be/ magical, right? So if Herrún wants the books to become holy armor or something (when used outside templebrarytown where magic is okay), she could change their nature to a magic one (assuming Loki isn't too insistent to the contrary -- I'm betting he won't want to let them be made stretchy/big/readable). An item that makes you insanely good at guessing knowledge or concealing information would be a good thing to try and get Herrún to create, domain-wise. (Maybe a concealment effect could get double bonus from Loki and Herrún, him being a deceiver.) Tome of Secrecy?

Oh, just thought of something kind of important. Isaac the wizard knows how to make antimatter. That should be wiped for safety ASAP. Hopefully the dark gods didn't read it off him.

Can we use PAO to make a condensed summary or larger print copy /of/ the Loki books? Seems like that avoids using magic /on/ the books, without making the PAO refer to arbitrarily generated information. (I'm guessing this is still in "paper containing the phylactery location" territory -- PAO cannot generate secret information. Or maybe it's an indirect use of magic on the books?)

Oh hey, what about using PAO to make a /planet/ to teleport people to? For safety and Herrún favor points, put it on the opposite side of the sun so no one knows about it. Since e.g cities can't work with PAO, it could be a featureless world (big rock) at first, but magic could terraform it pretty fast.

Maybe consecrate the whole thing as a holy site to a Good deity, say Arros, and fill the oceans with holy water and such (cover it with holy symbols maybe) to prevent the undead from ever colonizing... Then get to work on universal resurrection, with opposite alignment curses ready for any evil people...

As always, thanks for a great story and endless munchkinly amusement :)
