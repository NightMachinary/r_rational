Using mindscrape to instantly fix our protagonist's little trauma felt like a bit of a copout, but eh. Just a tiny bit. It /was/ getting annoying.

I wonder what the Ice Assafins were trying to do with the ritual, given that they're on the side of the fleshbags. Why would they need power over Herun, what would/will they do with it that fleshies wouldn't?

Anyway, neat chapter.
