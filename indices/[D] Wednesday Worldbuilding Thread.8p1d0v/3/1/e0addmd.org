There is a los of reasons it could not work though , you can't make a computer whith just wires and electricity[citation needed] , you would need some kind of chakra logic gates ,chakra clock and chakra memory .

So chakra needs to have more specific properties than just flowing trough the ink.

And having to draw circuits whith ink can limit a lot how small the circuits can be .
