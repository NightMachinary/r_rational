I have an idea with naruto fuinjutsu/sealing. The whatever special ink is essentially a conduit for chakra, so theoretically, if i perfectly copied the electrical wiring of a computer into a sealing array, there shouldnt be any reason it wouldnt work. Boolean algebra doesnt change just because im using chakra instead of electrons right?

Usually sealing arrays in canon leverage chakra's magical properties, but this one just requires the chakra to be there? I think it can work.
