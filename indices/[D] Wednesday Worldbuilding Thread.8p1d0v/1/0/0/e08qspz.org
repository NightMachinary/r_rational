  I'm under the impression that the EU is a somewhat similar story

It's not really.

We've never had a common enemy (except maybe USSR / Russia if you stretch it), and so far the EU has no power to infringe on its members' sovereignty, unlike the federal US government. Most of what the EU does is economic regulation and coordination, which is useful, but not really identity-building. So people in eg Germany are German first, and European a very distant second, even though they can travel to any EU country.

Not sure how well that helps with OP's question.
