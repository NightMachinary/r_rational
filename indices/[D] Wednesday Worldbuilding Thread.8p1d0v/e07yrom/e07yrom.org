Fifty feet above the ground is an aetheric layer, which some materials have certain interactions with. Fifty feet above that is another, and another, until you're up so high that you can't breathe the air.

One of the things that interacts with this aetheric layer is a special type of paint, which passes through the layers only reluctantly. In many ways, painting the bottom of a ship or other object allows some semblance of buoyancy, allowing the aetheric layers to be treated as water which ships and other things can travel across with only some token friction to overcome. From a Doyalist standpoint, this is all largely in service of having floating islands and skyships.

What I'd like some help with is:

1. the exact physical properties of the paint so that it's usable by humans in ways that roughly relate to real-world transport over water
2. knock-on effects of having these aetheric layers
3. neat things that flora, fauna, and people could do with them, assuming different types of interaction
4. some engineering to make use of them, given sufficiently defined properties (especially moving between layers, which I don't have good ideas for - initial thought was a painted grappling hook thrown up fifty feet to the next layer, but it would take some math to see how much the aetheric layers can "support" to see whether that would work, and you'd also have to have some way of getting down, like I guess putting it in a sack and dropping with a parachute?)

Right now I have a specific way that the world looks in my head, but I don't think that it would survive scrutiny, and there are probably some neat things that could arise from exploring the premise of having different layers that give something like buoyancy.
