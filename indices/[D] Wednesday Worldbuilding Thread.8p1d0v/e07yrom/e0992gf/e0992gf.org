Are the aetheric layers bordering each other or do we have a thin aetheric layer then a gap of normal air, then another aetheric layer?

If it's the latter your ships would function more like submarines than ships and would need a way to change their buoyancy on command.

If it's the former, you get some really interesting (and cool) physics as any parts of the painted hull that passes through the layer no longer provides buoyancy. On a ship with a roughly triangular cross section the amount of surface area that is in contact with the water surface doesn't increase when it sits deeper in the water, so such as ship would either sit with just the point of the keel in the aetheric layer (if its load is light enough) or fall right through it.

You'd want your ships to either have a flat bottom and sort of skid over the layer or have a cross section that becomes flatter near the top, such that the surface area in contact with the layer increases the more stuff you bring on board (something like this [[https://i.imgur.com/fhg7kN4.png][incredibly advanced technical drawing]])

Edit: As for changing layers: If you want to go with the grappling hook route, you would need a grappling hook that has the same amount of surface area in contact with the layer as the ship itself (which is probably not feasible) and a way for the ship to generate enough power to lift itself up fifty feet. Why not have floating islands (or even man build stations) that can lift ships up to a higher layer with ropes and pulleys?

Going down is much easier, just have a bunch of panels in your hull that can flip over or slide away so the paint on the hull is no longer in contact with the aether (and also make your ship sturdy enough to survive a fifty foot drop, which is probably not easy for heavier ships).
