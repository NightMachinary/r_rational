You could have the layers being something similar like surface tension. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRw0ttUuTX4]]

1. And the paint would be something like hydrophobe paint. Like water strider.

2. It totally depends what is affected by the layers. I would guess the weather and clima would be different. There could be small dust clouds which keeps countries in darkness (Or they need to remove it). Everyone thinks the 'surface' is just another layer, with huge landmasses and is looking/digging for a way down

3. Fauna could be walking on the air (like water striders). Flora (trees) could get huge by using the layers to distribute the weight and for stabilization. They would have many leaves and twigs at each layer. Maybe Humans steal water from the trees.

4. Well, humans don't need to fly too high. They could just use mountains and buildings (or megaflora) for ascending. Or big ballons with ropes that put some painted platforms in the next layer. Going down would be first by putting the platforms next to them and then removing the painted hull somehow (rotating them inside for example) and then lowering with ropes.

Hooks could be used to crash an enemy ship above you. Or maybe paint that overrides the effect of the ship.

Also keep in mind how your ship looks like. If you want something like a shiphull, the aetheric layers have to be deformed by the ship. If it doesn't deform you would only have flat bottoms. Maybe hydrofoils (water wings) are also a thing and use the deformation to be more stable and have more buoyancy with less surface area. And 50 feet is not high (trees can get that big), I would expect ships to have some redundancies by being in multiple layers at the same time. Maybe only with ropes. Of course, it all depends what you want your ships to look like. Most people who read about sky islands will suspend their disbelieve to have ships fly in air. And maybe, they wouldn't like to have something that doesn't look like a ship. So keep that in mind, if you are writing for an audience.
