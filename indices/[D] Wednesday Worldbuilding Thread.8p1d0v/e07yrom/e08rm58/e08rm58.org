You might want to look at some of the old Unicorn Jelly and Pastel Defender Helitrope comics. They had some similar concepts and interesting extrapolations for semi-steampunk/D&D technology level.

If you have floating islands, are some of them natural, if so then I would Guess there is some sedimentary or igneous element that when a smooth enough layer is formed, and eventually pushed up to the right layer can be sheered off a mountain to make a floating island. Does the layer have currents, or is it just wind powered? Do the layers fluctuate and make floating islands bob in the air? Is the floating element sedimentary and too much wind can erode the bottom of an island and drop it out of the sky, or is it like slate making the bottom of the islands flat?
