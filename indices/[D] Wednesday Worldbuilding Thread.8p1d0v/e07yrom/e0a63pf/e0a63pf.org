Idea: For natural floating islands, you want the floating effect to be caused by a mineral of some sort.

The most primitive way to use it would be to carve a raft/canoe directly from that mineral.

Next would be to just put chunks of that mineral in ballast tanks.

Finally(?) would be turning the mineral into sheeting/paint to cover a skyship hull.
