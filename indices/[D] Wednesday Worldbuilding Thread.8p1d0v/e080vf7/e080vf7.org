I'm working on a magic system based on stoic physics intended for a wuxia-esque setting. (TLDR the universe is made of pneuma in various configurations and states of tension, corresponding to (in increasing order of complexity) stuff, living things, sentience, and logic. Another important trait is that metaphysical concepts exist materially)

Basically, by using some philosophical insight that coincides with the discovery of bronze, people can learn to sense and sympathetically manipulate the structure of the pneuma that makes up reality with mental exercises. The exact nature of the insight isn't known in-setting, with each discoverer only managing to reduce the key to their new power down to essentially a short religious/philosophical text.

This sympathy only works on lower orders of pneuma than the manipulator. As adepts grow more skilled, they can affect lower orders of pneuma. Any manipulation is mentally draining, which can be mitigated with practice.

Psyche (nervous system): self- the most basic form of magic, completely instinctive to anyone who can manipulate pneuma, is causing the nervous system to correspond to their thoughts directly, essentially granting low-end bullet time.

sense- once they can manipulate pneuma, they can let existing pneuma affect them, which gradually develops into a pneuma sense, eventually granting instinctive spatial awareness.

other- an obscure use due to the relative rewards of focusing on manipulating the next level of pneuma, the user can affect the nervous system of others on contact. They might be able to cause spasms, light nerve damage, or with great skill, paralysis

Physis (body) self- by maintaining a strong self-image, the adept can resist and regenerate from harm or foreign magic. change- take on the physical traits of other lifeforms. largely based on trial and error to find stuff that actually works. Will very rarely be heritable. other- makes the adept's blows harder to resits or regenerate. Ubiquitous in agriculture to enhance crops, rarely used on trained animals

Hexis (matter) self- autokenisis, limited by preconceptions infuse- imbue nearby objects with the patterns of other things (ie: fire aura/sword) requires

This is set a few centuries after the initial discovery, in an otherwise bronze age world
