The logic shouldn't change but circuits are also designed off of how fast electricity travels as well as timing from quartz. I'd say if all chakra goes the same speed it /should/ be fine, but I'm not super knowledgeable on that front. You will need a way to replicate the quartz, so that the computer has a clock and cycles.
