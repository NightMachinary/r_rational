Yes an no. Crivtox is right you need a switch, so you can make something statefull instead of something analog. Though if you google universal Turing machines and the game of life, or the relevant [[https://xkcd.com/505/][XKCD comic 505 A bunch of rocks]] it's just a matter of how many switches you have and how long it takes the switches to operate.

As a thought, you have, I think five elemental chi's? Regulating pulse length intensity to make a single constaint "bit" size would probably be inhumanly hard, cue your Zener diode filter equivalents and no clue how you'd make an inverter but you might make your transistor eventually by having some form of reliable, reversible elemental interaction, though that requires multiple chakra natures. I think you'd want to make the first transistor a little complicated, and make the character work hard from there on a lot of drugery if you want EE or comp/sci types to not lose suspension of disbelief. As seals do things in the real world it can go way past S rank once you can make a seal that that both adds parallel computing power to make and design seals and remakes itself. That said, designing it or programming in it would be the work of several life- times even for experienced programmers and EE types. Look at the amount of computational theory that had to be developed, the automation and man years that goes into designing hardware for chips with 7nm logic gates, and the low level software before someone wrote the first [[https://qntm.org/ragdoll][quine (warning 6 chapter into Ra)]].

If your character isn't a hacker/hardware enthusiast/martial artist thrust back into the Naruto verse after a rigorous bachelors level of Compsci and Microprocessor design masters (they know assembly an can write more than a c-- compiler and know a lot of low level chip design) you are going to need a team, though I could see a time braid Daemon backed Akasuki machine being one of these.

Edit: Sorry for the wall of words. TL/DR Assuming no and waving:

- You need chakra switches, and they probably won't be the same as transistors, but you'd be able to use them for everything from there.

- You might need storage but storage isn't that hard and you might just keep things in memory, but that's design intensive.

- Everything from there is scale, design time, and programming (more on that below).

- It'd be several years of Godawful nigh impossible, persnickety work even if you were a top of the line grad student or professional microprocessor designer.

- It'd be several lifetimes of work from first principles.

- It'd be impossible to do by hand.
