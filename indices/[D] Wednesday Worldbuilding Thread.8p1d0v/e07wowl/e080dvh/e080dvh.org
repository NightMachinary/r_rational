I think you need some degree of sociocultural homogeneity for it to actually work, and failing that, then either enormous amounts of force projection, or enough agreement on the question of "what should the government do" that you can get unified authority.

I think America is a decent example of how it might work in the real world. /Originally/ it was thirteen states who banded together to form the United States, with a pretty weak federal government. If you look at the powers as enumerated in the Constitution, and as actually exercised by the early government, they were a shadow of what we see today. So you have people bonding together for things that it's better to do mutually, then gradual escalation of powers until the government has a finger in every pie. Add in a Civil War that prevents the breakup of the union, some bumps in the road with things like the Slaughter-House Cases, some propaganda and foreign affairs to set yourself against, and eventually you get people who consider themselves "American" first and "Ohioan" second (if at all).

I'm under the impression that the EU is a somewhat similar story, though I'm less well-read on the subject, and much less current. It's also a much sloppier mess, [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Supranational_European_Bodies-en.png][as the EU Venn diagram]] shows.
