It's fairly likely to happen in real life if we don't kill ourselves first. Just consider the historical trend from tribes to kingdoms to empires to nations to multi-national pseudo-countries like the European Union. There are currently 196 countries in the world. According to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1900][this list]], there were 234 countries in 1900. Some current countries may split, but the overall trend is likely to continue with countries being annexed by their neighbors or voluntarily incorporating into a larger and more powerful supranational union which gradually hybridizes them politically and culturally into a single state.

In real life, we've seen the European Union begin the process of transforming Europe into a united military entity without internal borders. The same process is taking place with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_American_Nations][Union of South American Nations]], though they do not yet have a shared currency. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation][Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] is the beginnings of the same process in Eurasia, with a united military, though shared borders and currency are still in development. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union#Current_issues][African Union]] is even further behind and just beginning the process of uniting Africa, with the aim of creating a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Africa][United States of Africa]]. Given 100-200 years, I expect we'll see Africa, South America, Eurasia, and Europe largely incorporated into supranational entities. When we're down to <10 countries, the role of the United Nations will likely start to transition towards the next level of supranational union.
