I'm not sure if this goes in the World-building thread, but I would like to talk about stories with a world where there is one single government that has united every nation under a single authority.

How realistic is this and will it ever happen in real life? I'm thinking that it will never happen on Earth, but if we expand to another world, then it's plausible that the planet is entirely under the domain of...let's say the American government (or at least until they rebel against America, just like how America rebelled against the British). It would make sense for a single planet to be under one government if a single nation did all of the work from terraforming the planet to sending colonists there.
