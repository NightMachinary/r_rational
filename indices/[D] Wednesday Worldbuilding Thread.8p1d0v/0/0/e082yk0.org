You could treat the aether like a layer of water in a different universe, and the paint causes materials to bridge universes. Then things float in the aether because they are literally buoyant from displacing the aether on the other plane. A sinking ship falls through a layer and lands on the next one, with all the consequences you'd expect from dropping a ship fifty feet into water. The problem with this approach is that you then have to worry about gravity on this other plane--why doesn't the aether pool into the oceans, as water does on Earth? I'd be tempted to make the layers perfectly spherical to simplify things, but gravity on Earth isn't spherical. There will be a sort of 'gravitational current'. Anything floating on aether will slowly gather where gravity is highest in our universe, assuming that gravity in the other universes is spherical. It will be dispersed by wind as well, though.

As for flora and fauna, I'd consider sky-fish at least. They swim through air and aether, and can jump from layer to layer when needed by swimming fast. I would avoid putting plants in the aether unless you want your world to be perpetually darkened by mats of greenery on high layers.

Grappling hook... how about a painted umbrella that folds out after being thrown, trapping the aether against whatever surface forms the bottom of its layer in the other universe? Although, it's essential that aether trapped at the bottom of its layer can escape somehow. Otherwise, a descending vehicle will be hindered by pockets of aether forming on its hull and stopping its descent, or damaging the paint at least.

Ships could ascend with the help of balloons inflated at higher layers. Attach an empty aether balloon to a mast (or an air balloon) and bring it above the aether layer above you. Inflate it easily. Pull on it with a rope and the aether buoyancy allows you to lift yourself. Aether rowboats with a pully system allow even large ships to move up a layer: someone goes up a layer ahead of the main ship and keeps inflating balloons until the main ship can crank itself up. Descending is trickier, but probably involves the same thing except the ship opens a hole in the bottom so it can sink through the layer.

Expect every ship to have multiple small buoys inside, so that the crew can easily read the level of aether inside the ship.

Rope towers supported by aether buoys at each layer are a possibility. My intuition is that a rigid tower with buoys on multiple layers won't shoot off into the sky when detached (since buoys entering a layer from the bottom have to lift pressurized aether out of the way) but don't quote me on that.

Travel by aether would change the face of the planet. Harbors don't occur in bays--they occur on hilltops and plateaus just below a high layer, which is more convenient for access, but not so high that other ports are many layers removed. Maybe civilizations would have conventions for layers as well: every fourth layer is for traveling north, the one above that for west, etc. Jet streams aid in shipping, assuming ships can go that high.
