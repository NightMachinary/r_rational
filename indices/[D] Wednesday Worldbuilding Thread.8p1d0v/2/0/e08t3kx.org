Given it's easier to affect higher orders of pneuma one implication of your setting ought to be that people would very quickly realize that controlling others logic would be basically the easiest possible thing if they didn't also know how to manipulate pneuma (after controlling your own logic which would probably be the easiest thing to do by far, though perhaps not if that tended to mess with your focus).\\
So that would seem to make mind control something that very quickly reshapes the world into centralized governments since mind controlling the untrained should be much quicker and easier than teaching them how to defend themselves against that.
