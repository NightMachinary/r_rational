Internal consistency is important, but don't be fooled by the post about /tg/ only caring about consistency. There is definitely a large portion of that board's users that hold realism over verisimilitude. They're more interested in historical precedent than in entertaining any kind of fantastical idea, even when the setting is fantasy.

I remember a specific thread I was linked to where someone asked what a forest kingdom's agriculture would look like, and most of the responses were that they'd just burn down the forest to make room for farms and it wouldn't stay a forest kingdom for very long.

The reality is that just as with any other form of fiction, the important thing is the suspension of disbelief of the person enjoying it and most people can believe "Dragons have wings so they can fly" without a physics explanation behind it that would likely necessitate magic. There's really nothing positive about training yourself to pedantically assume it's not realistic and ruin it for yourself.
