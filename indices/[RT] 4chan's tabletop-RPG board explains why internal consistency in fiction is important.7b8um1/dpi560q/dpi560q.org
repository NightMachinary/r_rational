I feel this has a lot to do with games in general, or at least has a direct application there.\\
There's this element of fair play, of setting down clear rules and the implicit agreement, a promise between players and the game master/producer.

If a person breaks his promises, then their words aren't worth much. If a GM breaks the game's rules, then there's not much value in beating their game, as it's pretty much arbitrary- you only beat it because the GM /allowed/ you to.

Consistency in a setting basically means it follows logic. If GM tells the truth, then things he say shouldn't clash. Let's show an example:

- Dwarfs can't use magic, at all.
- There are no known ways of replicating magic's effects.
- Author is (in this case) telling the complete truth.

So those things known to the players, they go to a dwarven stronghold, ready for a heavy conventional fight. What do they find there? /A dwarven archmage/, flinging fireballs and lightning on the completely unprepared party.\\
Let's assume this kind of scenario repeats several times- players just learned that their knowledge, logical thinking and planning is worth diddly squat.\\
How else /can/ they beat this game, assuming that you can't just beat up the GM or 'persuade' him in other ways? They have no real agency here, and their actions are meaningless.\\
That's not a game, but a nihilism manifesto.

Readers/viewers may not directly influence the narrative, but they still care about how it unfolds.\\
Take a standard slasher as a good example- realism is assumed (it's real world, not Middle Earth), stakes are high (live or die!) and the danger is clear (Big Bad Monster!): /The girl is cornered, killer is coming closer, there's no hope.../ except she's in a car. With keys in. And she can drive. She's not even that hysterical.\\
Would you feel frightened, or just jell angrily at the screen, telling her /to just drive away/?

Watching someone else 'play' means we identify with them at some level. If they behave like you never would (not even in their position), then this connection is immediately severed (or at least weakened).

My point is- stories and games are driven by /US/- players and viewers. When the author comes in and reminds us that he's calling all the shots, then he shatters that illusion.
