  So those things known to the players, they go to a dwarven stronghold, ready for a heavy conventional fight. What do they find there? A dwarven archmage, flinging fireballs and lightning on the completely unprepared party.

Obvious conclusion: the archmage is using illusions to pretend to be a dwarf, but is not /actually/ a dwarf.

I mean, that's completely contrary to your point, but it's not /quite/ impossible until "magical illusions can't represent dwarfs" or something.
