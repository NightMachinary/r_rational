Okay, fair point. This example was not good enough.

Should have replaced the dwarfs with "this mine/fortress/mountain is a no-magic zone". Would even make for a more extreme scenario, since you don't expect any /other/ race to fling spells at you.

/However/, we could still say that they killed the archmage, yet he remained a dwarf.\\
Sure, wasn't mentioned, but it /could/ have happened.\\
(And /yes/, it could be a non-dwarf that just happens to look like one, but... at this point GM could just say if it was a dwarf or not.)
