Why? I'm not interested in arguing the point, I think it's probably a good point. I'm not saying anything against the point. I'm just also incidentally saying that it makes me uncomfortable when folks say things like this. It's like they're trying to get some kind of social cred by making that sort-of-joke in the middle of their point or something.

As you reprimand me to "argue the point," one could also reprimand point-makers, "only make your point, don't also make ableist generalizations."

Edit: Ah, maybe there is some confusion that I'm trying to attack the point by attacking the method used? If so, I should say: this is not so.
