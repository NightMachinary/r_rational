But that's the thing. Appreciating something amazing doesn't preclude wanting to dissect it and figure out how it works. I marvel at skyscrapers every other time I see a building taller then the clouds. I took an architecture course as a part of materials science classes, and I have a rough understanding of how skyscrapers stay up, how they tolerate extreme winds and temperature changes, and a bunch of other cool minutia.

It doesn't at all detract from that sense of wonder at the idea of "holy shit, we built a building that literally ends above the clouds. And then we did it over, and over, and over, and over again". If anything, it increases the wonder and appreciation I feel for it.
