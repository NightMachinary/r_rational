I think this conversation is missing the "for the sheer joy of it" aspect of the realism pursuit. No, it's not /usually/ important to the story to know how a dragon actually flies, but it can be /fun/, in and of itself, to come up with a just-so story for how it works, or to peel back a layer and see that there's something underneath.

I would posit that for many of the people who engage in a deep dive on realism or consistency, it's more because they take joy from that than any other reason. It's kind of sad that "fuck you, it's fun" doesn't come up as an answer more often.
