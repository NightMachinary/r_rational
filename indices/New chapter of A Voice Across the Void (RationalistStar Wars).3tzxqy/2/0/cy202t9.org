Not sure how many people noticed -- maybe one or two others besides you (the author of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3oogyb/hsfrtstar_wars_au_timeless_warrior/][this]], which takes the beginning of the story and goes in a different direction, probably did). Not that many people played through or remember KOTOR 2, I suppose.
