Just wanted to say I like how you're fleshing out all sides, not just the protagonist (well, at least I considered Noval to be the main person but I guess it's still early). "The enemy is allowed to be smart, too" is pretty much essential imo and between the Emperor/Sith Holocron figure I think it's in a good place.
