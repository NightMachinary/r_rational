Greatest thing about her character is that all she has to do to be out of danger is fail, but by the time she has siked herself up enough to fail and thus escape danger, she is immediately promoted to a higher level of responsibility at which her failure would mean even greater consequences. She is a continuous balance between her sense of self preservation and her morals, and before the former can win the latter is just pushed harder to perform.

This wouldn't be nearly as interesting if she wasn't /competent/, she is almost always capable of the things required of her, she just isn't willing to believe in herself. She thinks she isn't humble, and she isn't, self deprecation isn't humility, that her deeds are over blown due to the involvement of others, but all of the things she is known for have had her direct influence in their success, I'm just wondering if she will be the first ever /Bumbling general/.
