Gaunt also has feats but he is nothing like Ciaphas. It is not feats that define Ciaphas' character. His career is defined by feats but his character is not. His character is defined by wanting to avoid the circumstances that lead to feats.

He thought being assigned to an anti aircraft regiment behind the frontlines was a plum assignment. He tried to stick around the sector HQ and the Lord General as much as possible. He constantly places himself with squads that he thinks will see the least fighting. His approach to discipline is focussed on not giving guardsmen a reason to shoot him in the back. When he throws himself into a dangerous situation it's because he thinks he's dead if he doesnt or it's because he doesn't want to deal with a pissed off Inquistor.
