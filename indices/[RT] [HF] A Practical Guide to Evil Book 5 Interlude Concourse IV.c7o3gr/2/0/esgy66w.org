I love that she's the kind of character that from the outside looking in without the context of her thoughts she's almost a Mary Sue, but with the context that she really doesn't want to be as successful as she is and that every success puts her further out of her comfort zone and into danger that she wants to avoid at all costs. Like her thinking of the safest racist statement to the Grand Master where something that might put her in danger would probably be the simpler way to get removed from her position.
