I agree that the questions regarding how Paris made it through training undiscovered are interesting ones. I have answers, but I'm loathe to go into them because they may come up in the story later (some aspects almost certainly will be, while others may not depending on how her arc progresses).

I presume it's not too frustrating to leave the questions open until I either cover them or get past any spot where they might be covered?
