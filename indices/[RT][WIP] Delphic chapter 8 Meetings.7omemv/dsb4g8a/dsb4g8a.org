The story itself is tantalizing, though short. One part I found unrealistic was the main character's failure to make a move on May. It would be realistic that the reason they aren't having sex is she said no, but not the way it was described.

Another problem I found difficulty suspending disbelief with was that the main character is one of the greatest computer experts who ever lived? Yet he has to waste time each day with a day job as a cable installer? He has a superpower that perhaps allows him to steal passwords, but nothing that would allow him to type faster or analyze data faster or any of the other things you'd need.

I finally will note that it's rare for the same techs to work on both electricity and internet. Also not realistic for a lone tech to be fixing things like main power lines.

I feel weird with these nitpicks. If you'd said the main character /also/ can interface with computers with his mind, that part of my disbelief would be suspended.
