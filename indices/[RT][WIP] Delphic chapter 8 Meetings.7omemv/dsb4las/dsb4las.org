Thank you, I'm enjoying this story!

A question: Police training involves quite a lot of team and partnered physical training - they practice takedowns, team catch-and-carry, firemans' lift, first aid including revival of unconscious people, they are tazed and pepper-sprayed, they practice combat with batons, etc etc. It would essentially be impossible to make it through police training without being manhandled, for want of a better term. How did Paris make it through this without someone else noticing that she feels like a "warm, cloth-covered statue"?

Couple of proofreading pickups:

Ch 6: "We came to a pretty quick decision, and I pulled a small handheld unit and *a* bit off my tool belt." (Otherwise it reads like he took a bite out of his tool belt.)

Ch 6: "â€œAnd Mrs. Anders *has* been watching Deb during the day so I can work. "
