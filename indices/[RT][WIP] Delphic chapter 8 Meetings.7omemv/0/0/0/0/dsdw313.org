It occurred to me yesterday that just as physical supers with a major power (speed, strength) get a bunch of unconscious and overlooked minor powers as well to keep their major power from destroying their bodies and the environment, to let them see while running, etc etc - supers with mental powers should get unconscious minor powers also to let them have that ability and stay more-or-less sane and functional.
