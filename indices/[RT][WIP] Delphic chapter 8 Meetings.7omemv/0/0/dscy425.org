  One part I found unrealistic was the main character's failure to make a move on May. It would be realistic that the reason they aren't having sex is she said no, but not the way it was described.

You, uh, don't know many nerds, do you? It's entirely in-character for him to confabulate a reason for her to not want sex or a relationship with him, and then believe that. If he uses his powers on her, he could even be correct - but the power imbalance of using his powers (and fighting the urge to use his powers) to pursue a sexual relationship makes the whole thing fraught.

Hector is probably sexually messed-up in all kinds of ways, just as a side effect of that superpower. Voyeurism is the obvious outlet.

  Yet he has to waste time each day with a day job as a cable installer?
#+end_quote

It's a "cover job", to stop him from being outed as Delphic. Presumably he's laundering Delphic's money somehow ([[/u/9adam4]] - the TV series Ozark is excellent for ideas on this).

I do agree with you in principle - he's wasting his time with a cover job. Even if he can't look forward in time, with his powers it would be trivial for him to day-trade the stock market based on shorting or going long on major decisions made in boardrooms far enough away that news of the decision takes a few hours, or a few days, to propogate to the rest of the market. He could make enough money as a "lucky" day trader to build up a modest stake for himself, say $2M, and then live off the interest. $2M will make $40K at 2% withdrawal more-or-less indefinitely, investing the rest to CPI increase. A person can live modestly on $40K, if they don't have to do anything at all for it.

He could even move to a low cost-of-living country, say Peru or Thailand, and probably be physically safer. His powers would let him "keep contact" with his few loved-ones, although they can't keep contact with him.

Hector's probably socially messed-up in all kinds of ways, too.

  I finally will note that it's rare for the same techs to work on both electricity and internet

I personally know several small-business electricians who do that sort of contracting, mostly for commercial and residential property managers, builders, etc. There's a lot of these type of businesses around, usually one or two guys and a van, maybe the owner's wife does the invoicing. It's a fairly standard business model for all kinds of things - plumber, refrigerator tech, aircon tech, etc etc, and it works very well with business networking groups. (Hector doesn't seem like much of a networker, not that he really needs to be.)
