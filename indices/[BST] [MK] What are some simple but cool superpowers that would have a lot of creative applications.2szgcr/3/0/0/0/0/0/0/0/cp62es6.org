So it's the above, but with the controller being an algorithm of the form

#+begin_example
  Backpack is checked -> Collapse to "All was not put in";
  X, which could have been put in, has:
    been taken out -> Collapse to "X was put in";
    its original location observed -> Collapse to Y;
#+end_example

, where Y is determined by some further algorithm or controller which was never covered that you're aware of.
