Some friends of mine played a Champions game at one point. Among the characters:

*Triangle Man*, the enormously strong telekinetic who could only control things shaped like triangles.

*White Hole Man*. He had a backpack. At any time he could pull anything out of that backpack that he might plausibly have put in it without anyone else seeing. So, he spends a few minutes wandering through a hardware store unobserved. He can now pull out an infinite amount of screws, bolts, duct tape, circular saw blades, rope, etc. He CANNOT pull out a laser cannon. If anyone looks in the backpack its contents are locked to whatever that person sees (which is generally "it's empty") until WHM has a chance to plausibly reload.
