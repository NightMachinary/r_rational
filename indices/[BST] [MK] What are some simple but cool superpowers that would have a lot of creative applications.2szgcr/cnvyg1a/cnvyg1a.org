Esprit the Hyper-Escalier. Thanks to an unfortunate encounter with alien criminals and then a followup encounter with an alien justice system in which entities with a very strong grasp of justice and an entirely absent grasp of human nature tried to compensate you for the suffering incurred in the first encounter using the only currency held to have universal value - your brain has been Moravec uploaded into an equivalently sized chunk of computronium running an emulation of said brain.

This entails the following effects: Because the simulation doesn't include obvious malfunctions, at all times your thinking is as good as it was when you were previously in peak condition. Subjectively, you are always well rested, sober and at optimal bloodsugar.\\
More importantly, the chunk of computronium can execute the emulation at very high speed. At will, your clocktime, as compared to human base can be varied from 1 to x872 (In theory, if you learn enough to make your mind more complex, the maximal speedup factor will drop. This is unlikely to matter much)

What this isn't: Super speed. Your body is flesh wired into the content's of your skull with entirely normal neurons. It can not keep up with even modest speedups. At maximal mental velocity, you might as well be a lock-in case. What it is: All the time in the world to think. About anything, limited by your ability to tolerate standing or sitting perfectly still in a world frozen in time.
