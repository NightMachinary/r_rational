Redirection would also allow for the following corollary powers:

Temperature control: Take the jiggling of temperature inside an object you touch and align all the little arrows into the same direction. Cools the object (or air!) you target to approximately 0 Kelvin and accelerates it to a velocity approximately proportional to its former temperature. Alternatively, takes an incoming sniper round and shoots back a (slightly?) slowed molten-lead sniper round.

Flight: Take the gravity acting on you and point it in another direction. The manueverability of this would be Asteroids-esque, except that there's friction. (Reducible by turning incoming resistance air away from you?) Interestingly, you can achieve space flight with this by slapping on a radiation-proof space suit and falling upwards. It might look somewhat like Hancock when you hit the ground, since the sudden stop at the end of the fall doesn't affect you and instead affects the ground doubly.

There might be a problem here with the identifiability of your global reference frame - here assumed to be Earth - which assumption, if dropped, could lead to things like instead redirecting your attraction to the sun or the center of the galaxy, or whatever other massive objects might be out there.

Fuelless spaceship propulsion can also be achieved simply by playing ping-pong against an inner wall of your choosing; each reflection against your hand increases the momentum of your ship, while all other physical processes preserve it.
