My suggestions:

- Oracle: The ability to answer correctly any well-defined question that can be answered absolutely with either "yes" or "no". The question must be asked by another person. The Oracle must actually understand the question. Does not work at all unless these conditions are met.

- Accuracy: The ability to make arbitrarily fine-grained movements, with precision to a molecular level.

- Redirection: The ability to redirect any force exerted on the user. Basically, the user can make anything coming into contact with them appear to bounce or ricochet. No damage done to the object by the redirection itself. Reactionary only.
