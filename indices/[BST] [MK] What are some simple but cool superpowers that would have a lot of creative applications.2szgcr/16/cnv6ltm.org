One element of Worm I will draw to your attention is how all the Thinker powers are unique. There isn't just one generic super-genius power and one generic pre-cog power, each Thinker has specializations. Tattletale is good at intuiting and extrapolating information from small clues, Accord has a planning ability that gets stronger as the plan is more complex, Taylor can multitask on numerous things, Dinah see the future as probability in response to single questions, Number Man can see math to go with everything.

Even though the each have one specialization, they use it in creative ways. Tattletale uses cold reading and pretends to be telepathic, Accord uses his ability to plan complicated traps just before combat starts, Number Man can both fight really well by predicting his opponent and make long term extrapolations by analyzing probability and trends.

  another will have superspeed.

Think about the exact variety of super speed you want. Velocity in worm get super speed with no friction or inertia problems, but his ability to effect the rest of the world is reduced at super speed. Battery get superspeed with the limitation of having to charge and use her power in bursts. Assault requires an initial boost of existing kinetic energy to build up speed ((he synergizes with Battery very well). Ask yourself how your superspeed deals with friction and inertia, how their reaction times scale, how long it takes to build up, ect.
