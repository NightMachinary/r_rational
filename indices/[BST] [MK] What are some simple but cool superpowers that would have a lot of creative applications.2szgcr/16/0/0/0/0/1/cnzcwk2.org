Other Thinkers have contextual limitations (Accord requires complexity for his planning ability) or have really bad thinker headaches (Tattletale, Dinah) or have very narrow applications (Dinah can only give probabilities in response to questions, even though her power can look at the futures in general). We are never given any indication that Number Man has any Thinker headaches and Number Man can apply his power both in realtime combat scenarios and in long term usages like manipulating financial transactions. It is possible there is some unexplained justification for his OPness. Number Man has been a very active cape for a while, [[#s][]] or maybe he rations his power usage very well and thus never has his headaches on screen. But given what we know, he is comparatively OP, he has several absolute advantage that regular Thinkers don't.

Contessa is a special case that we can't compare Number Man to. [[#s][]].
