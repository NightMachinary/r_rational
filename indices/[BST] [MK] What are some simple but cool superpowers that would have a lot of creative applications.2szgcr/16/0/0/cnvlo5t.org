He had a pretty BS tier power, but it made sense how it worked

  The notation billowed around it, and through it, he could see the movement of the pen, the plotted trajectory, the velocity and rotation of it. The numbers clicked into place with a speed that made the rest of him, his very perceptions, seem like slow motion.
#+end_quote

His power is actively plotting events in realtime faster than his own perceptions work.

#+begin_quote
  He chanced one glance backwards. The attack had left a hole in the wall, the shape matching the impression that one might have made with an outstretched hand, fingers grasping, except it was fifty-two point seven six times the man's handspan.

  More notation, more numbers to work with. He could extrapolate, get an estimation of his opponent's weapon. He'd need a point of reference...
#+end_quote

His power is automatically taking in sensory information and extrapolating based on it. He barely has to exert any effort to do this.

#+begin_quote
  Now the Number Man was free to evade even before the attacks occurred. As a tennis player might move to cover the open court as the opponent's racket was drawn back in anticipation of a strike, he was bolting for the safe zone, the area where incoming attacks weren't as likely to fall, where his opponent would have to take time to adjust his orientation to effectively strike.
#+end_quote

His power can also project probabilities for events.

So his power not only does all the math for him, it work nearly automatically and handles the sensory data and does this nearly instantly for both immediate events and events in the future. It is OP compared to most Thinker powers,

#+begin_quote
  Seriously, why would seeing math make you an awesome hand-to-hand fighter?
#+end_quote

Looking at his POV chapter, it is providing the appropriate information with perfect timing, faster than he can perceive the events. So his power is effectively giving him enhanced reflexes as a side effect.

#+begin_quote
  why would it also allow you to move your body appropriately to take advantage of that knowledge?
#+end_quote

He has either trained his body to move precisely in order to get more out of his power, or his power also takes care of that also.

#+begin_quote

He is BS compared to other Thinkers. We never see him indicate that he gets thinker headaches and his power has a wider range than other Thinkers).
