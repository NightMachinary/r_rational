Number Man wasn't really a Thinker though. He was just the spear expy of Contessa / a God Mode Sue justified as "oh, well, I see math everywhere." Seriously, why would seeing math make you an awesome hand-to-hand fighter? Even if it did somehow allow you to anticipate your opponent (which I find debateable), why would it also allow you to move your body appropriately to take advantage of that knowledge?
