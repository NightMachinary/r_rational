Oh, here's a character for you:

Julian Hubberman (hero name: Tiresias) was an undergraduate classics major when his powers activated. Overnight, he developed a new sense: the ability to see and fully comprehend all of the worldlines that will be spawned in the next 8.3 seconds. What did he do? He put on a costume and started fighting crime. What was the obvious name to choose? Well, if you're an undergraduate classics major, obviously it would have to be 'Tiresias'...pity no one else knows the reference, or is able to spell it. Still, too late now, he's already publicized the name.

At any given time, Julian either sees with his eyes (normal vision) or with his Sight. The Sight shows him all the new Everett branches that could be spawned in the next 8.3 seconds. He can fully comprehend all of these worlds, and they are all real to him. By taking the appropriate actions to spawn a desired branch, he can force events to occur in whatever way he desires.

There's a couple drawbacks on this power:

- All of the potential branches are completely real to him. Every time he uses his Sight to force a particular branch, he has to deal with the fact that he is closing off all of the other potential branches that could have existed at that moment, and is thereby killing uncountable numbers of sentient beings.
- Whenever he activates his Sight, he can see the outcomes of his actions. This causes a problem with agency -- he knows (e.g.) exactly what words to say to convince someone. Doesn't this mean that he is taking away that person's free will? For that matter, his Sight makes it clear to him which branch will lead to the best possible outcome in any given situation (as measured by his own values and goals at the time). If he takes that branch, is he really showing agency? And if he /doesn't/ take that branch, isn't he just being a petulant child ignoring the best choice just to show that he's in control?

NB: I got partway through this and realized that I'm riffing on [[/u/glennonymous]]'s "Erica's Adventures In The Multiverse" look and feel, but going in a different direction with it.
