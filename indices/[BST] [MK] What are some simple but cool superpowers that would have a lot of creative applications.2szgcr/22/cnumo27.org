Super Strength + Invulnerability with no flight, enhanced momentum, touch range telekinesis, or anything else. For example, if you try to stop a car by standing it front of it, you would just get hit and bounce off (or get run over). If you try to lift it by the bumper, it would rip off. If you tried punching through a brick wall, you would push yourself away from it instead.

A power like the one from SUPERHOT: you get super speed that scales inversely with how fast you are traveling. If you are standing still, you are accelerated 100x. If you are walking slowly, you are accelerated 10x. If you are running your super speed is disabled. It would scale so that an outside observer would always see you traveling at a constant 20 km/h, no matter what your actions are.

Absolute invisibility and undetectability to everything, but also creates hallucinations that perfectly matches yourself. In other words, you can't be detected by anything /except/ unaided human vision. Glasses, mirrors, binoculars (etc.) don't pick you up, so you are absent in mirrors, tiny or absent in binoculars (depending on how they're built) and out of focus to someone who needs glasses.

Alternate emergency precog. You get a clear view five minutes into a future where an emergency happened roughly an hour ago, from your own perspective (it resets to a new scenario every hour or three). Your power is disabled in emergency situations. If you train yourself to ignore emergencies (and check the stock market, for example) to feed your realworld self information, you risk /being/ the actual real world version of yourself and ignoring a disaster for no benefit (and probably significant harm).

1/5000 of a groundhog day every day: you live through each day exactly twice. On Jan 1^{st} (a), you wake up with no special knowledge, and go through the day, and then fall asleep. You then wake up on Jan 1^{st} (b) along with a full set of memories, go through the day, and then fall asleep, waking up on Jan 2^{nd} (a).

Forcefields that are actual fields that take up a large volume, as opposed to the typical wall-style effects.
