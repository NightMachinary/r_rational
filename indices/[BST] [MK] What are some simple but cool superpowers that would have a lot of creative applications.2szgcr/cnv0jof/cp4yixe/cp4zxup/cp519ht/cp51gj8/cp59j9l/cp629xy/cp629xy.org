Nothing is ever actually put in the backpack. If you actually look in it, it's empty. He loads it theoretically but being unobserved in a location that has stuff, and can pull out anything that he /could/ have put in it. So, if he is unobserved in a hardware store he can pull out anything that a typical hardware store sells as long as it would fit in a backpack. If he loads it in a forest he can pull out sticks, rocks, dirt, leaves, etc.
