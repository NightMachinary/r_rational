Is what turns out to have been put into the backpack controlled by the WHM character or player?

The controllers superpower is Coils superpower except that he can make arbitrarily many timelines, and all the timelines may only differ in whether he put things in his backpack. Since the controller has to specify what timelines to collapse away when the backpack or the things that might have been put in it are observed, the controller has as a corrolary the power of knowing whether WHM is observed, since the controller figuratively keeps getting asked to specify whether WHM is putting the dirt on the floor into his backpack in that case.
