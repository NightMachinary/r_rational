I'm a fan of overly-specific versions of stock powers. The example that's stuck in my head is a telekinetic that can only work on hammers. Run of the mill, mass-produced, normal-sized claw hammers only, no cheating - there's even a specific brand that works the best.

The thing I enjoy about this is that your overly-specific telekinetic is actually only at a small disadvantage compared to the usual general-purpose one, once you've worked out all the exploits.
