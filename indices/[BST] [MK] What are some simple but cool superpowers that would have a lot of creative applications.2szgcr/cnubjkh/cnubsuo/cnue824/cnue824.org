If you want some ideas for limits to place on a precog:

- Location limited: the power only looks at the future where the precog is currently located - put them in a cell, and they'll only be able to see the cell's future. Maybe they can only see the future of Times Square, or the future of some arbitrary spot on the planet, or something like that.
- Distance limited: the power only works up to an hour (or two hours, or three minutes, or whatever) in the future - the precog can't see beyond that.
- Access limited: the power can only be used for a limited amount of time per day, or with some amount of accumulated strain.
- Fixed point: the power looks /exactly/ one hour (one day, one year, etc.) into the future - if you want to bet on a horse race, you have to be watching that race an hour before it happens, and anything you miss stays missed.
