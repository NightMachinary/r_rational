"Better" is subjective, but "strictly better" (usually, depending on semantics) isn't. "Strictly better" is like the choice between paying $1.99 for a can of Mountain Dew and paying $1.09. It's the choice between capping out at a flat sprint of 60mph and 100mph. It's being able to call a coin flip correctly, and being able to call it correctly but then suffering debilitating headaches afterwards.

I would argue that this distinction is a really big one between superhero universes, since it offers a lot of differences in what stories present themselves.
