The range of superpowers is /really, really/ broad. My best advice would be to go pick up a copy of /Mutants & Masterminds/ and go look through their powers section (or just find a PDF online, which is less ethical but far cheaper), or the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSuperpowers]["Stock Superpowers"]] trope page. You need to answer a few questions:

- How much are the powers balanced against each other? Do some people have strictly better powers than other people, like someone who can create portals but only in doorways, and someone else who can create portals without the doorway?
- Do some people just get the shaft with their power, like the Jokers from /Wild Cards/ or the Case 34s from /Worm/?
- Do you have anything like the Manton effect preventing radical offensive maneuvers? (/ex. Creating a portal inside someone's head, using telekinesis to squeeze someone's heart, etc./)
- Are powers "unique"? Are there dozens of people with the same flight power, or are all the ways of flying different from each other?
- How many (if any) drawbacks do these powers have?

Anyway, there are a lot of questions that you need to answer /before/ you start thinking about what kinds of powers are appropriate to dish out. Here are my personal favorite powers:

- Multiplication. The ability to make independent copies of yourself that can go out and live their own lives before being reabsorbed, but with no other special powers. Like Multiple Man from Marvel or Dupli-Kate and Multi-Paul from Invincible.
- Teleportation. Usually with limits, because otherwise it's overpowered - either a refactory period, a distance limitation, or something else. Maybe you can't teleport clothing/glasses/teethfillings with you.
- Precognition. Either a static future, or a future that shifts around a lot and represents a "best guess" made by the power.
