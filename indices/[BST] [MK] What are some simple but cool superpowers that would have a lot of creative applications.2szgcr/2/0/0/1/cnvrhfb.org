Also, make the information vague, or be delivered in a different way.

With thought I can feel your physical status up to 24 hours from now (will your hand hurt? Are you tired?what will the tempeture be?) Maybe make it more or less powerful by doing diagnosises in advance or feeling emotions.)

Give them the ability to answer a single question about an object/person. (Same question each time.) where will it be? (Object only for more fun.) who will touch it next? (Not when though)

Make them project it onto an item. Tarot cards, flip a coin, have then be able to set up a chart and roll a dice maybe. (From least to most strong)

Have them pick a person as they fall asleep. That night their dreams are equal to some or all of that persons next day.

Really, you can get creative and have lots of fun.
