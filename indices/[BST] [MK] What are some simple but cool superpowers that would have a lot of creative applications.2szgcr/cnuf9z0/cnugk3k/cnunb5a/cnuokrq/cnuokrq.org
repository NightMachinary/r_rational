If you have a fairly decent understanding of science it would be possible to write tinkers like that. I mean, the real-world scientist typically /does/ specialize, and different specializations /do/ require different skill sets - it's just a matter of the author realizing how a specific skill might generalize.

(Also, I think it's worth breaking down "advanced grasp of science" into what /exactly/ the magic is doing in their brain. I think one could conceptualize it as magically having the processing power for certain things. For example, someone might have the ability to instantly search the solution space of a given problem with very specific constraints for an optimal solution, and there might be a specific set of engineering fields where that comes in handy. Although, if you use mathematicians to hack at this enough you might find that you can map one set of problems to another and end up with something OP - but i guess you'd have to be a quite math oriented to even understand that sort of story.)
