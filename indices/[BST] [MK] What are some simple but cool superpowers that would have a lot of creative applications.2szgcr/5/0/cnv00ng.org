Thoughts on this:

- Is the water created or transported?
- What temperature is it?
- What happens if you move while you're underwater? (e.g. in a swimming pool)
- What is the initial velocity of the water? In what reference frame?
- How much do you have to move to make the water appear? Take a step? Sway slightly? Blink?
- Will it appear when only a part of you moves? If you stay perfectly still and flick your finger, does it create a water whip?
