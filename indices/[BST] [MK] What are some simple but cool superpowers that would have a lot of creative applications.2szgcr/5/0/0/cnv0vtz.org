In Leviathan's case:

Presumed created. It's a superhero universe, thermodynamics be damned.

I think it's cold liquid water. I'll /guess/ it's four degrees centigrade, but not sure.

Not made clear in the story.

It's moving with the same momentum as Leviathan, ie if L stops the water splashes into it from behind, but does no damage because L is a great big monster with super durability.

Any movement at all (relative to Earth, but probably ignoring the movement of tectonic plates, etc). Blinking would set it off. Leviathan is constantly wet.

Yes.
