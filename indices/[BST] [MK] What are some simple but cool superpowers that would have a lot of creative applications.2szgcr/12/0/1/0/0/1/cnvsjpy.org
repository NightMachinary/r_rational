Of note if you put the hero in the back of the spaceship and threw a tennis ball at him, then caught it. You are getting twice the effect if throwing it in the first place, and you keep the ball. Which means if you could get half the force required in man power you could feasibly double it to get to space. Or while in space you could make slow changes to your volocity by playing catch in carefully controlled measurements.
