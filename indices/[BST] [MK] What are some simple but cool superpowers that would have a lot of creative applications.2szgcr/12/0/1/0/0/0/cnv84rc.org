Escape velocity isn't actually a velocity, it's a speed. If you're moving at 11km/s (at sea level, neglecting air resistance), then as long as you don't actually crash into the Earth, you'll be able to escape.

Even if you're travelling horizontally - the Earth is curved, after all, and you're moving in a straight line. Redirecting the velocity with your superpower won't achieve much.

The hard part is definitely getting an object accelerated to Mach 35 and letting it fly without being slowed to a halt by air resistance.
