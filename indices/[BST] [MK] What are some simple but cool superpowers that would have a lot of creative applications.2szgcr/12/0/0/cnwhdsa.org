  And actually, being invulnerable with no other powers is very interesting, particularly once you combine it with the rest of a super-team.

You might enjoy [[http://www.grrlpowercomic.com/][Grrl Power]] a superhero webcomic which features (among other members of a fairly sizable team) Achilles. Achilles is absolutely invulnerable, period. He cannot be cut, suffocated, crushed, stabbed, shot, etc etc etc. No other powers though, and he can be knocked around perfectly easily by super strength.

He knows how to use it, too -- at one point he deliberately shifts someone's swordthrust so that it hits him in the not-blinking eye...just to make her squick and drop her sword as she cringes.
