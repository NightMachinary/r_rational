Green Lantern's ability (create objects, forces, and energy by thinking about it, imitate or use technology like FTL travel, transmutation, and matter conjuration) is hideously overpowered so you'd definitely need to scale it down. The basic limiting factor for Green Lantern seems to be what the character is capable of thinking of. A sufficiently ambitious Lantern would be pretty scary.
