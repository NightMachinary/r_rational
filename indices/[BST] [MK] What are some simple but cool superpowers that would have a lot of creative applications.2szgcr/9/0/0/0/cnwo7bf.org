I like what the author does with this story. The additional limitations are excellent: [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2szgcr/bst_mk_what_are_some_simple_but_cool_superpowers/cnwo7bf][mouseover for spoiler.]] These factors prevent him from being as powerful as Green Lanterns are, which makes the story somewhat more engaging. A similarly clever Green Lantern at full power would probably effortlessly defeat all his opponents. Even as it is, the author has to do a lot of work to present real challenges.

I can't say I'm a fan of the character having out-of-universe knowledge, though. I don't mind the author making a character like himself /in terms of personality/, and I think that part is done okay-- but having the character being a dude who's read all the DC comics or whatever really takes a lot of the fun out of it. The author tries very hard to make it work, but any premise like that is pretty hard to deal with.
