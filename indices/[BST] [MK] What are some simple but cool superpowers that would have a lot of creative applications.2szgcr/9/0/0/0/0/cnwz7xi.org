Green is better IMO, but not strictly better. Orange lanterns don't have their powers disabled by being distracted (instead having them disabled by either apathy or a change in desires). Also, Orange is much better at multitasking. It is much easier to desire multiple things at once than willing several independent things.

I'm sure that there are other differences as well, but I don't know enough about the DCverse to catch them.
