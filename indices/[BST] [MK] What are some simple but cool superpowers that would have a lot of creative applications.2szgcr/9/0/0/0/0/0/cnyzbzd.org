to name a few:

Orange can use alternate power sources

Orange can convert living creatures to constructs

Orange seems more dangerous as being consumed by Avarice is a more detrimental than being consumed by Will.

Green is incredibly synergistic with the Blue Light, to the point where being in the presence of the Blue Light causes green lanterns to put out contain 400% of normal energy

All lanterns have a corps but the green and orange corps are incredibly different. This IMO is the best thing Orange has over Green, the greenies are a police force and things like developing your planet or improving life for the citizens you protect (or yourself) is a no no, with orange all you have to worry about is an insane corps leader half way across the galaxy who will take your ring if you connect to the main power battery(and maybe sorta kill you).
