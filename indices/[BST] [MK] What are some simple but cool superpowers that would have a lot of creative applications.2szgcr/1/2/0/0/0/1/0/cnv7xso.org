Are we talking "dull annoying throbbing" or "crippling migraine that prevents you from doing more than breathing and even that is unpleasant"? Because I think I'd be willing to put up with a headache if it let me stay focused and productive for 12 hours at a shot.

If you think about it, the entire /point/ of drugs is to get rid of some undesirable characteristic -- an infection, a headache, whatever. Why should "lack of focus" not be treatable as well?
