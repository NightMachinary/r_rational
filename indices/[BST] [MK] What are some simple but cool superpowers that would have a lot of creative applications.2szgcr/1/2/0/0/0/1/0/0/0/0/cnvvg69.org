Sure. In this context, it means that I think making hard-stimulant usage normal in intellectual or professional settings eventually makes it /required/ in such settings: cognitively unenhanced people simply won't be able to compete. Meanwhile, people who never particularly wanted to enhance themselves will be stuck taking amphetamines just to keep up, and /everyone/ will have to deal with the unpleasant side-effects. And then the habitual users start developing /tolerances/, so they're not even getting as much of a performance boost from the drug as they once did.

So it's better just to not normalize it in the first place: the end result is just "unpleasant side-effects and addictions for everyone".

It doesn't even really make you more productive, per se, in the long run: just better at monomaniacally focusing on tedious, menial brain-labor. In my experience and that of others, you mostly can't come up with creative or original ideas when on Adderall, and it's very easy to get distracted (there's a meme, "I sat down to write a paper and wound up color-coding my sock drawer... twice").
