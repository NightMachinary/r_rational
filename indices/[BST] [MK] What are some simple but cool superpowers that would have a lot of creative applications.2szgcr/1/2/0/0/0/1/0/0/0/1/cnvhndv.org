I don't think that's what [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is referring to. I Googled the word and Wikipedia says:

#+begin_quote
  Moloch has been used figuratively in English literature from John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) to Allen Ginsberg's "Howl" (1955), to refer to a person or thing demanding or requiring a *very costly sacrifice.*
#+end_quote

Which is more in line with his implied meaning. But why do you ([[/u/eaturbrainz]]) dislike saying the word?
