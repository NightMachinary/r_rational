I'd recommend not giving anyone super-intelligence because it's very hard to realistically write about such a character since they would take actions you would have never thought of.

Instead give people savant-like abilities such as perfect video-like recall, easily learning and doing insanely complex mathematical operations mentally, and can think far more quickly than other people. It's a lot easier to write since such a character will be a lot like a Hollywood rationalist who can recite tons of facts easily, but won't necessarily be any better at making decisions than other people.

I would love to see someone who only has the power, infinite willpower. He/She can set for him/herself a task to complete, and the task will be completed */no matter what/*.
