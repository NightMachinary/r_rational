Fun savant ability. The ability to write programs for himself. So he can't solve all math equations, until he has loaded up a "program" to do so. Then it just takes seconds to do complex Math that he has seen before. Then the guy spends time writing the codes in his head for individual martial arts, or firing a gun. It might take him 24 hours to write the code for a punch, but then he can do it on command.
