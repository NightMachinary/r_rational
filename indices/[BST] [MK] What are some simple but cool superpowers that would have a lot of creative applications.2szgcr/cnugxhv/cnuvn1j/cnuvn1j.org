I'm writing a fantasy book series. It will be a while yet, but this will eventually see play. There's a location where any oath voluntarily spoken becomes physically impossible to break voluntarily. So if you set yourself a goal and say that you will do whatever is necessary to make it true, that would do it.

It can be (ab)used for other things too, but in terms of the Infinite Willpower thing, the third to last book will see the main character breaking into the location to give himself exactly this, and then things start to escalate about as quickly as you would expect when both sides are incapable of surrendering or changing goals.
