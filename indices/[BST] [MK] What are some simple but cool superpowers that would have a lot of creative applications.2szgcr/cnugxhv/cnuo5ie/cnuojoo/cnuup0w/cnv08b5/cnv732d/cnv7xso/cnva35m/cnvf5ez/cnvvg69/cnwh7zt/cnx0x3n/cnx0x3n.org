  These drugs exist and are used, yet not everyone in academia / business is popping amphetamines / Adderal / etc. Where do you think the disconnect happens? Or do you think that all successful people are taking these pills, and that's why they are more successful than others?

All I can find is [[http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/17/health/adderall-college-students/][this bloody news article]] right now, but suffice to say, 1/4 to 1/3 of university students /are/ taking these drugs as performance enhancers, and they /do/ see, at least in the short-term before they develop a tolerance, improvements in their cognitive and academic performance. The distributions are, to my knowledge, bimodal: weak students and elite students are more likely to take the drugs. I don't have numbers of any kind on full-time white-collar employees.

But what I can say about the negative effect is: endemic drug-taking to pursue /studies/ (we can argue philosophically about real work and the job market) [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law][destroys the value]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law][of our performance measurements]] while also dumping the unpleasant side-effects of drug use and addiction (amphetamines /are/ dopamine-affecting stimulants, after all) into the population.

So effectively, amphetamines are just not the kind of /all-around, general, safe, non-side-effecting/ cognitive enhancement drug that I can support from a "transhumanist" point of view.

I think the disconnect is: most of the people taking the drugs do so for menial intellectual work, writing class papers and that sort of thing. Eventually, menial work comes to its end, and the drugs won't actually help with the cognitive heavy-lifting that comes after it. You can't attentionally and motivationally enhance your way into greater actual intelligence or creativity, in the end.

/Problem is/, much of the labor that even real cognitive workers do /is/ menial, and much of the cultural and economic emphasis is precisely on the menial labor (which is one of the great deficits of our current social system: very little ambition to produce a tomorrow substantially different from today).

So, thanks to a skewed emphasis among people, we end up with nasty incentives to take the drugs, even though they won't actually make you /overall smarter/ than someone who doesn't.

(Personally, I /was/ diagnosed with ADHD, although as a child, and over the long term, I've found that having been on the drugs when younger made me /worse/ at self-organizing and self-motivating when I got older. I've had to learn those skills late, as I generally refuse to rely on drugs because of their side-effects. However, now that I /have/ learned those skills, I am finding that I can be /very/ productive without any need for amphetamines. It may be a case of the drug being a short-cut where proper training and lifestyle would require more effort but yield better results.)

I'd dearly like to see a longitudinal study that actually collects objective performance data.
