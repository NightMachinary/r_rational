  I think making hard-stimulant usage normal in intellectual or professional settings eventually makes it required in such settings: cognitively unenhanced people simply won't be able to compete.

I've heard this meme before and, although I find it /prima facie/ plausible, it doesn't seem as though the world works like that. These drugs exist and are used, yet not everyone in academia / business is popping amphetamines / Adderal / etc. Where do you think the disconnect happens? Or do you think that all successful people /are/ taking these pills, and that's why they are more successful than others?
