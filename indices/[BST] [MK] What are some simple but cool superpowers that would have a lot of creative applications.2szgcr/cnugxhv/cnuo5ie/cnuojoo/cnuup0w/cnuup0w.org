A lot of amphetamines, such as Adderall, do more or less this. Some of the horror stories from taking too much tend to be an obsessive desire to do the one thing you want to do, and nothing else. There have been instances where people will work on something for 12 hours straight, never thinking about eating or sleeping, only to collapse in exhaustion when the effects start to wear off. Considering your description of an OCD like drawback, this sounds pretty close to a real life version of that "power".
