Possibly...but I have never heard of any such person then again it's not a very obvious thing to notice. Also I feel like such people have something to motivate themselves into completing their difficult goals. I'm interested in a power that allows you to set an arbitrarily difficult goal with none of the self-discipline one typically learns to develop such a strong willpower.

I'm kinda visualizing the hero as someone who can put themselves into the most grueling situations possible and have absolutely no ill-mental effects whatsoever. The hero would appear very odd to others and be like Batman who built himself up to be capable of matching super-heroes.

To you it's something that exists and therefore is not a super-power. To me, it's a real-life super-power I hope to actually learn.
