Your interpretation is correct.

I was mostly thinking of something like the hero can set a goal to be completed and a way to accomplish the goal. The hero will then work on reaching the goal as soon as possible. There is some leeway in that the hero can take his/her time and not destroy him/herself trying to complete something like "get strong enough to bench-press 500 pounds" in a week. But the hero will not feel as if it's a burden to get over with, but rather as something pleasant he/she would like to do (i.e. to be very motivated). However, if the hero can't accomplish the goal with an arbitrary amount of *will*, then the goal won't ever be completed.

I did think of an interesting drawback where if it turns out the goal doesn't need to be completed any more, the power will force the hero to deal with an OCD-like urge to complete the goal anyway (like doing the laundry, but if someone else did it already, then the hero will still wash the clothes). But that means if a task becomes impossible to complete, the hero can go crazy trying to do it. Also if it's something like "fast for 50 days", the hero will kill him/herself doing so. It's a double-edged power.

Hmm, using it for something other than task completion...I would say only if the hero believes it can be done at all. If the hero is cocky enough to believe he/she can resist torture indefinitely, then the power will make it happen. But if the hero thinks it is impossible, then the power won't kick in. To me, it's dependent on a good deal of introspection and knowledge about one's psych. A little Dark Arts in Rationality would be very helpful for our hero.

Anyone who wants to use this idea can do so with no complaints from me.
