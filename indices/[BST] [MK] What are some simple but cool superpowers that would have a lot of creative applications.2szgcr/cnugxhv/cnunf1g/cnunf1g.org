What do you mean by "the task will be completed */no matter what/*"? Certain interpretations of that phrase can lead to somewhat... overpowered results. (To be charitable, I'm assuming you mean something like no procrastination, no distractions, no akrasia, etc., but that line is somewhat ambiguous...)

Also, does "infinite willpower" apply to things other than task completion? Like, say, could a character with that power resist torture indefinitely, for example?
