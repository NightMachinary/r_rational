I'm starting to work on a novel, with three different cultures all based around using one of the states of water for related magical effects. I was thinking about having that as one of the things the water people can do, except that the force from it appearing affects them, pushing them forward. And since if you're going faster, you have to have more water coming out in order to occupy the space you've been, you could use it to accelerate, and basically fly.

I think I would probably also add the ability to choose where the water comes out from, though the total amount of pressure you have to work with would be based on how fast you're going, so for instance you could choose to channel the pressure out of your hands, or feet. This would also allow you to make short range laser beams, if going fast enough, by say pushing it out the very tip of your finger and making a hydraulic cutter, though the recoil might fuck you up.

The main problem with using it is that I'm not really sure what do with all the excess water that it would create. Worm got around it by having it be an infrequent thing, but if there was a whole society that could do it, you would run into meteorological problems pretty quickly. Maybe make the water disappear after a bit? Also might be a bit op, though I think that if I made it so you could only start it at a certain minimum speed would help balance it.
