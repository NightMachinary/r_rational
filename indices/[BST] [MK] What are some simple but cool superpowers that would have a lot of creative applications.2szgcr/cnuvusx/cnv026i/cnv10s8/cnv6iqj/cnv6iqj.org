Oh yes. I think I'll have two things each culture can do, with perhaps enhanced senses based on the amount of water in the air for the additional water thing. I think you would have to be going pretty fast for it to turn on, like top level human sprinting, and also have water somewhere in contact with your body. All their warriors would have to be really good sprinters, or at least have somewhere high to jump off from

For ice, the two abilities would be personal stasis and being able to turn ice chunks into memory storage and combat simulaters. The stasis would be straightforward, touch a piece of ice, and make parts or all of you utterly immovable, except by gravity. The consumed ice would turn into water vapor, with longer periods of stasis requiring bigger pieces of ice.

The iceputers would be a bit more complicated, but basically, when one them touched a piece of ice, they could load a memory into it, turning it all silvery and making it incapable of changing temperature. A bigger piece of ice would require a longer memory, and you can't pull memories back out. Once activated, the user can send their mind inside it and view any memories. Once inside, time doesn't pass outside, giving you time to think, find any relevant information, and also look outside through the block to plan what you're going to do. When you spend time inside it, the ice slowly subliminates, giving you a limit on how much time you can spend there, as well as making it so memories have to be relearned if you want to transfer them to a new piece of ice. So, in the middle of a fight, if someone was punching you, you could go into a piece of ice that's touching your skin somewhere, figure out the best way to block the punch, and then go back into real time and continue.

I wanted to try to make it a rationalesque story, so the protagonist would be ice, since the powers seem the weakest but have a lot of potential for cleverness.
