One very original power I found interesting was one of Leviathan's powers in the Worm universe. Whenever you move, the space you previously occupied fills with water. This... creates a lot of water. It would be extremely impractical much of the time, but it could have creative applications. From just flooding the battlefield as time goes on (Leviathan is pretty big) to creating a large reservoir of water at high altitudes to lots of cool stuff.
