Tinkers never made sense to me, though. Like, I know Wildbow was working backwards from the premise, "Okay, here's a typical superhero setting; now how do I justify it?", and stuff like Iron Man was probably the basis for the existence of the Tinker classification, but...

Augh, no, no, a thousand times no! /Science doesn't compartmentalize like that/; if you can build super-destructive lasers, you can use those same principles to power cities; the principles behind anti-gravity devices can be used in so many different ways I'm having trouble naming them all, and... yeah. I'm okay with the Tinkers existing, but the limitation to a single field is just completely at odds with the way technology actually works. The universe doesn't care if you use one of its laws to build time-slowing bombs or to build super-fast computers operating in a sped-up reference frame; it's the same principle either way, so if you can do one, you should be able to do the other.

This is, of course, operating on the assumption that Tinker science is "real" science as opposed to shard-based "magic", but given the Wildbow explicitly states that Tinkers have an "advanced grasp of science" to thank for their abilities, and that they can apparently distribute their technology to be used by non-Tinkers and even unpowered people, I think that's a pretty safe assumption. Pity it just also happened to nuke my suspension of disbelief.

(Worm is awesome, though; don't get me wrong.)
