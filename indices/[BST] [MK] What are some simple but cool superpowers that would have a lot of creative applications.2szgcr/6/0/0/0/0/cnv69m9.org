This is pretty much the main explanation. The power only feeds the Tinker plan and instructions to build specific devices. [[#s][]]

Another thing to consider is that the powers actively help the Tinker work through the limitations of the available materials and tools. So maybe the power tells them just how to build a tool they need just to assemble one thing right with the materials they have to work with. This also factors into the tinker tech requires active maintenance by tinkers. If the tinker isn't consciously aware of all the steps there power has made them take to get everything just right, they can't write a manual on maintenance that non-tinkers will have any hope of following.

Another common assumption is that the powers also grant low level striker abilities to help the Tinker assemble everything precisely.

But technology and the engineering and manufacturing know-how to put it together might if it is being intentionally restricted or limited.
