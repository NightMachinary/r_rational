If a quote is not the end of a sentence, then you don't normally end it with a full stop, nor do you have a capital letter next. Eg:

#+begin_quote
  you'll give them ideas," scolded his sister Piper
#+end_quote

rather than:

#+begin_quote
  you'll give them ideas." Scolded his sister Piper
#+end_quote

The exception is if the quote really is the end of the sentence, eg:

#+begin_quote
  if they'd left the liquor cabinet unlocked." He elbowed Hayden
#+end_quote

If the quote ends in a question or exclamation mark, then keep that, but still use a lowercase letter afterward, eg:

#+begin_quote
  "What if we all played hide and seek?" suggested Boden
#+end_quote

instead of:

#+begin_quote
  "What if we all played hide and seek?" Suggested Boden
#+end_quote
