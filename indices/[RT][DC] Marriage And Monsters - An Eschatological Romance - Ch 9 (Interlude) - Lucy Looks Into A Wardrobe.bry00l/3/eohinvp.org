Haley's character sheet says she has a +114 Heal modifier... I don't know much about 3.5e, but I'm pretty sure that should be either +11 or +14.

EDIT: So, this actually is the rapture, and Jesus is indeed returned--or rather something Jesus-adjacent, yet significantly more bloodthirsty and child-soldier-having than the original.

Clearly reality is busting at the seams. It looks to me like there's some combination of "actual other dimensions are blurring into ours" and "human ideas/mythologies are leaking in through our brains." It may in fact be the Rapture, or whatever real-world event the biblical Rapture was foretelling (and Norse Ragnarok, and probably a lot of other End Times Stories too).

Current hypothesis: something intentionally threw open the floodgates in an attempt to seize control or resources from the Prime Material Plane.

Also, it seems like the Swap is relatively local to Sean and Haley's area--the super-bright flash when Boden was in the chest feels like the same thing that put Sheriff in Sean's head, but none of the kids and seemingly no one in Israel got swapped out.
