  Charles is a man in a prominent position making a bad choice, but it's not /because/ he's LDS.

That's fair. The difficulty here is that /he/ attributes it to his religion, without anyone contradicting him, and the only other reference to it thus far comes from evil!Aslan. So even if individuals' actions don't prove anything about the religion, it is a rather negative portrayal.

But there's no reason you can't do that if you choose.
