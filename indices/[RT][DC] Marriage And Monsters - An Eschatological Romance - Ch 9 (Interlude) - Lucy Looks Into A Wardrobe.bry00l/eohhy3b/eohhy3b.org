We've hit over 2,000 views across RR and AO3 in the first couple weeks of release, I'm just floored by that. Thank you all so much for reading. Here we go with the beginning of Arc 2! Expect this one to draw out quite a bit longer.

First fan art! [[/u/CopperZirconium]] did this lovely portrait of a happy couple. Thank you! [[https://imgur.com/a/zYoqzn0]]

Also, Haley's next stat sheet, chapters 7 through... a chapter we haven't reached yet. These are going to stay pretty inconsistent just to dodge minor spoilers. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YizIZKFaiFo98-YAFfaOsf64BfuBIZeGC1fUCRyCH8Y/edit?usp=sharing]]
