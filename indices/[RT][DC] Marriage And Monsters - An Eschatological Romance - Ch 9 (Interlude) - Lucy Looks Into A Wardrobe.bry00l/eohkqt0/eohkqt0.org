Boden was the one who let Aslan into the world, and yet this Aslan is not what I expect Boden would have imagined. More specifically, I think Boden wouldn't expect Aslan to kill his brother. Tying into Haley's earlier speculation on story logic, it seems more like Boden allowed the broader story of Aslan into reality, The Problem Of Susan and all, and now that story's got the remaining children in its grip.
