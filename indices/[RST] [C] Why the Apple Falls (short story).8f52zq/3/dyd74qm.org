Awesome. Also guessed the explanation because physics geek.

Nitpick though: "But the reason pulling the rock inwards makes you spin faster is that the rock keeps moving at the same speed, but since it's closer to you, a full circle around you is shorter, so it can go around you in less time while moving at the same speed."

Ignoring friction/etc, pulling it in actually speeds it up because you're adding energy to the system (the work to pull it in). Alternately, in terms of angular momentum, to conserve angular momentum as radius is reduced, the velocity (not just the angular velocity, but the linear velocity) has to increase.
