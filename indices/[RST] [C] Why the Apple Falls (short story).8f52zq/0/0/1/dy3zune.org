It should have been obvious, but I didn't figure it out either until I almost reached the end. I was confused when 'halfway to the other side of the world' was equated to 'going up towards the sun', but my brain somehow jumped to the conclusion that Isaac was suddenly asking a different question. There's probably a term for your brain trying to explain inconsistencies with nonsense; for me this is one of the clearer examples. I even noticed my confusion. Dammit lesswrong, that was supposed to help me!

I did figure it out the second time the 'sun in the center' was mentioned though, near the end.
