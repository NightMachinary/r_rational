Nicely written.

In case you wanted the last line of the chapter to be a wham line, the synopsis spoils it a bit. If you wanted the last line to be more ambiguous, I would suggest removing the line "his true love and family frozen in their sleep" from the synopsis. That change would only be relevant for chapter one probably, so it's a minor thing at best.

To be fair, I personally like the synopsis as is, since the story would be much more depressive without it (it reads as if Fiona died in her sleep, rather than falling in an enchanted sleep). The synopsis tells me that things aren't quite as bad as I initially imagined.
