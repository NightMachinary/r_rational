I'm a professional technical writer of many years with close to no experience in writing, but ample experience in reading, fiction. I want to branch into it, so I decided I would write some fanfiction in order to practice. I discovered rational fiction near the start of the year and have been obsessed with it since, and I thought an attempt at writing a rational story myself would serve my needs well.

Criticism in any remotely productive form is sincerely appreciated, especially from other writers.

Story Synopsis, as seen on AO3:

Nearly fifty years have passed since Shrek first braved the Dragon's Keep. Now a grandfather of six and far into his seventh decade, he enjoys a peaceful, contemplative retirement in his swamp with Fiona, no enemies having troubled him since his defeat of Rumpelstiltskin. His tranquil existence is interrupted, his true love and family frozen in their sleep, an unnamed foe demanding retribution for Shrek's crimes. Together with Donkey and Puss, he must embark on his last quest.
