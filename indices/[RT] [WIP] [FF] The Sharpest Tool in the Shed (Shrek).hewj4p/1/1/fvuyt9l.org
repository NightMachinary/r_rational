I like your characterization of Shrek. He still feels recognizably the same character that we saw in the movies, just a little more intelligent.

My impression as a whole of this first chapter is "meandering." It takes place in four different time periods: when the mob attacks, then a flash back to when he got the sorcerer's books, forward into grandpa-Shrek period, which I assume is the "present" for this tale, then back a week, and finally back to the present. It's a little much, especially given that the mechanics of his fart attacks aren't really relevant to plot or setting or theme or character just yet; they establish a mood, but not, I think, the mood that you're going for.

In addition, the timeline is a bit confusing. You can sort it out in hindsight, but there's nothing in the mob attack scene to establish when it's taking place, so the impression from someone (e.g. me) who is coming in, just having read the synopsis, is that this is "old Shrek" being attacked by the mob. I had to read it several times in order to get the proper sequence of events (mob attack: 30 y.o. Shrek; sorcerer's books: probably teenage Shrek; last scene: grandpa-Shrek).

Finally: as this is a first chapter, I obviously don't have much information about where this is going, but I get the impression that the ending of this chapter is supposed to be a gut-punch. The problem is, we don't spend enough time with Fiona in this chapter for the punch to have any force behind it. There is the conversation with Fergus, that Shrek doesn't even react to, much less take part in, a single paragraph about how Fiona is important to him, and then the wham line at the end. I get that fanfiction necessarily is going to rely somewhat on assumed empathy, based on the reader's pre-existing connection to the characters that was established in the original work, but you would need to spend some more time re-establishing the connection between these characters, if you want the act of tearing it away to have any particular weight to it. That goes double when so much time has passed since the original work, and the relationship will necessarily have changed in the decades since we last saw them.

I'm definitely interested to see where this goes, but I really think that you missed a chance to have me /emotionally invested/ in where this goes, instead using that chance to explore the disgusting biology of ogre farts.

Edit to add: That said, I /love/ the world building of the disgusting biology of ogre farts; I just don't think it's well-suited to a chapter building up to the conclusion that this chapter has.
