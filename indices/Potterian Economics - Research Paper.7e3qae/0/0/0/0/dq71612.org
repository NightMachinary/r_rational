It is indeed awesome.

There is a much more legible version of the paper [[http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/interstellar.pdf][here]], typeset into LaTeX and crisply rendered, rather than a scan of a typewritten paper.

And I don't want to turn this thread into a list of all the best quotes (you might as well post the whole paper), but this is one of my favorites:

#+begin_quote
  This is an inertial problem---which becomes a weighty problem in a gravitational field---requiring an economic analysis, provided in the next section.
#+end_quote

It's thoroughly infused with excellent wordplay.
