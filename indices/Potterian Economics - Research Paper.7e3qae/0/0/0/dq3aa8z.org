... but... but... you don't need general relativity to deal with planets with large relative motion. Special relativity covers that. Now, if you had planets with different masses, then suddenly general relativity becomes important because time will pass differently due to different gravity.

Slight nitpicking aside, this paper is absolutely awesome.
