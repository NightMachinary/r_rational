Here are my first, somewhat unstructured thoughts (I would assume that most of these are things that you've already thought of):

You never cast "naked" unless you're really desperate. Because magic depletes and never recovers, you always cast "clothed", i.e. with an heirloom.

Heirlooms are always made from as durable an object as feasible, even if this takes it outside the bounds of what's normal for its type.

Heirlooms are one of the primary spoils of war. They can also be taken for ransom in certain cases, as part of negotiation between countries or when stolen by a thief. Heirlooms represent a lot of power, which means that security needs to be really, really good around them so that a large, irreplaceable chunk of material wealth doesn't go missing.

Some heirlooms will wear down faster than others, just by their nature. A sword needs to be sharpened often, and there's wear and tear associated with fighting with it. That's less true of (say) a war hammer, which can be as simple as a glorified chunk of metal on the end of a stick. Heirlooms that don't actually have wear and tear are the best.

Heirlooms come with a future-oriented mentality. You don't plan on making the best heirloom for yourself; you plan on making the best heirloom for your grandchildren, who are going to be the ones to get the most use out of it due to the ramp up in power.
