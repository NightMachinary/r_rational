Contrasting to your idea of not casting naked spells, and possibly adding to the idea of dynasties, maybe there could be a tradition of some sort of "death spell". If you could cast 1000 low level spells in a lifetime, could it be advantageous to save up all your magic for the moments before you die, in order to do some sort of really awesome spell to benefit the family? Or infuse your magic into an heirloom? It could be a tradition to come up with a really neat spell that essentially marks your death in the eyes of the family, like a "life's work" kind of thing, something that people would be able to remember you by. In lieu of a tombstone you remember Uncle Jerry's spell that makes it so everyone in your family never has trouble opening a pickle jar, or something.

Poor families could sell their final spells to high paying dynasties, serfs could owe their final spells to their dynastic lords. Tossing some stuff out. It's a neat idea.
