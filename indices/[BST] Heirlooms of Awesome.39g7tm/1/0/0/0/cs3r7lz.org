Ah if that's the case then it'd be more interesting with the serfdom magic tribute thing. A way to keep the lower class low and the higher class high maybe? Then maybe the serfs could rebel, each fit person making their "final act of magic" or whatever something to power them all up and take control? Could be used to interesting effect.

So like if the serfs had to give a fealty in the form of magic the knights and nobles would get to keep theirs in order to fight wars and make conquests and tools and such, while simultaneously keeping the rabble in check, with limited magic they have limited ability to harm them. Same with POWs, you make them do a final blast of magic and then kill them. Or, rather, make them do a final blast of magic and then keep around doing menial tasks, I think there was an example someone talked about having prisoners using objects in order to instill them with magic properties.
