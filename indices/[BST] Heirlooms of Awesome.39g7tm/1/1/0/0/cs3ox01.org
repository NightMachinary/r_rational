  The *Code of Hammurabi* is a well-preserved [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia][Babylonian]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_code][law code]] of ancient [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia][Mesopotamia]], dating back to about 1754 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi][Hammurabi]], enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stele][stele]]/ and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_talionis][lex talionis]]/) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man. Nearly one-half of the Code deals with matters of contract, establishing, for example, the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, establishing the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, for example, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_behavior][sexual behavior]]. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A handful of provisions address issues related to military service.
