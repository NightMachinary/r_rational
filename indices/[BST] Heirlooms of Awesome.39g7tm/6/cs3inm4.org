There would probably be certain cantrips you'd be expected to use at certain points in your life and career, just to cement their importance by a permanent sacrifice of power: a rite of passage to adulthood, marriage, birth of a child, joining various religious or secular societies, joining the military.

Perhaps there's a cantrip that unforgeably signs a document, so sufficiently important documents would be signed with a permanent sacrifice. Makes signing with your blood seem positively wimpy.
