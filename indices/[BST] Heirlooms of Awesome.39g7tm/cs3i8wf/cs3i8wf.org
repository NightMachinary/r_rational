Wouldn't the magic in such a world be negligible for most purposes compared to normal technology?

I mean it really depends on the rate by which items gather magic but from your description it sounds like the rate is really slow. And when you combine this with the inevitable wars for any item which becomes close to a gamechanger which might very well cause them to be destroyed over time would cause a situation where most items will just not be worth it.

I mean sure you might have an ancient cannon that can hit a target 50 km away with pinpoint accuracy but you do not win wars that way. you may have the best hammer in the seven seas but it won't help you produce a microchip. In the end items get deprecated, and mass production wins. That is unless magic gathers pretty quickly, in which case it would really depend on the speed of the field.
