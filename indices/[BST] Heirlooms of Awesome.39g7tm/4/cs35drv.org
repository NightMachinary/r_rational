One consequence is gratuitous tool use (AKA "grinding")

Example: A young man may start using walking sticks to aid in walking despite not really needing it so that when they are old they have super-powerful walking staffs which enable them to walk at superspeeds.

This can very quickly get ridiculous, as gratuitous tools seeps into every possible aspect of life.

(Oh, better train my cup instead of scooping water with my hands. Never carry /anything/ in your hands, you could be increasing the size of your bag of holding. I'm gonna crack peanuts with my mighty and ancient Peanut Cracker, not with my fingernails.)

You can fix this kind of by making body-part use count as tool use, with people's bodies getting some intrinsic power as they get older. That does have a cool side effect that bones and corpses might be magically interesting. But people might still do gratuitous tool use if they want something a little more long lasting than bones to pass on.
