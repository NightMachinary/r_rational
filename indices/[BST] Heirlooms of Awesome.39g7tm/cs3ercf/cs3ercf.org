If I was administrating a country in this world, I would make sure to have some very powerful industrial utility heirlooms - tools that can summon harvests from fallow fields in a moment, a pick axe that can summon a mines worth of ore from the earth with a tap, a weathervane that can predict daily weather years into the future - and make operating the heirlooms a civic duty, one that's fun. Citizens would get to enter lotteries to wield the most powerful artifacts, there would be leaderboards of who managed to use the artifacts most effectively, you would be compensated for your time using the artifacts, etc. They would be closely guarded, of course, but not threateningly. Convicted criminals would be prohibited from using the highest-profile national artifacts, but criminal labour would be used to tune new or experimental artifacts up to an efficient level.

Entertainment heirlooms would be held by the state and leased to companies that supported the state's message. Symbolic heirlooms that could achieve effects without accruing wear and tear - a ceremonial sword that literally empowers people by knighting them, for example - would be highly prized. Where possible, sheaths or treatments that protect the artifact from damage without removing material would be added.

Imagine a stamp that could mark a thousand bills at once with a mark conceptually impossible to fake. It would be a lot easier to move away from the gold standard.

And, of course, medical tools would be /weird/.
