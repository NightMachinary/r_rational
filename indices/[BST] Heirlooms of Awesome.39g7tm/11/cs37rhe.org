What about modular machines, like a farm, a violin, or a car? Things where the wear-and-tear is concentrated on one section, so you have a violin that goes through dozen strings a year and needs it's bow rehaired every performance, but the wood, varnish, everything else is ancient and seeped in power? Does it lose some of that each time it's rehaired, or does the spell count the ephemeral parts as ephemeral and unimportant? You mentioned the metaphor of Theseus's Ship, but what if it's only the sails that change - do they take a bit of power with the each time? Do separate components have to be engraved separately? Can I bury a marked waystone to represent a street, or does every individual cobble need to be marked?

What would be really awe-inspiring, though, would be the churches and cathedrals. Ancient structures /designed/ to inspire awe, and /constantly used/ in rituals of /awe/. Imagine a church bell in a little countryside village that's stood for the greater part of a millenia - what spells could it cast? An effect that can push a message to the minds of every man in the country? A call that summons hordes of wild animals to a town's defence?

More on repair: If an object needs periodic but infrequent repair to stay in perfect working order, is it possible to fill it with magic faster than it loses magic without going to extremes?

If symbolic objects can cast spells as well as actual tools, then they would become much more valuable much more quickly - a judge's scepter doesn't get a lot of wear-and-tear, and neither does a well-made, well-cared for ruler or compass. An ancient glass lens might work better in a telescope than a modern one, for example, even if that violates physics.
