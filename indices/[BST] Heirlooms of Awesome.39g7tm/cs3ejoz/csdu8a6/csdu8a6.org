Per OP, each person has a limited supply of magic over their lifespan; if I understand correctly that would mean that an immortal would run out of magic of their own in no more than a mortal's lifetime, which limits the advantages for personally creating items. Not to say that immortals wouldn't be vastly powerful; just less directly so.
