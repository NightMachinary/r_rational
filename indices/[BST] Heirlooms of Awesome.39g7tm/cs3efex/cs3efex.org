What happens if you keep using a computer programmed to do X? Does the computer's program get more efficient? Can you find an algorithm to sort things fast by writing a program that sorts things slowly and practicing it, then reading the program? Or does the computer just sort fast magically even though the program on it should not be able to do so?

Are you just incapable of practicing things that work in reductionist ways, such as computer programs? If that's so, can't anything be described in a reductionist way?

What exactly does it mean to use something? If you keep throwing a spear at a target and you miss 60% of the time, how does the magic know that you're practicing the hitting and not the missing, so that the hit rate of the spear increases with XP and not its miss rate? And if your answer is "it depends on what the person using the item thinks", do they then have to understand how an item works? If someone falsely thinks that the spear keeps missing the target because the target is magnetic, does the XP then just make the spear more capable of hitting magnetic targets? If someone doesn't know that cars have engines, and they practice the car, does the engine gain any efficiency?
