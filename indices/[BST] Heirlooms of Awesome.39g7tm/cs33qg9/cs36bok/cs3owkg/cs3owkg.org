i was thinking about how this could make dynasties separate from family connections. maybe the blacksmith doesn't leave his hammer to his son, but to his best apprentice? there could also be heirlooms attached to an office or a title rather than a person.

for that matter, would, say, a constitution become an heirloom? it isn't used in the traditional sense, physically, but every time its laws come into effect, it is in a sense used.
