This world is probably ruled by the first person to inherit an artifact designed to provide immortality - or even longevity, since it would grow in strength over their lifespan. They'd be vastly more powerful, since they'd have the ability to actually create items instead of just cooperating acausally with past generations.

Admittedly, coming up with such an item is tricky; but if this setting is thousands of years old, someone should have done it by now. And they should be the most powerful.

The explanation for how this works seems to suggest that multiple people "using" the same object would increase it's power much more rapidly; and the explanation for why buildings and locations aren't vastly powerful seems to suggest that smaller objects should be correspondingly /more/ powerful (jewlery, for example, or small tools.) This seems broken; I'm not really sure how to fix it consistently, but I'd say there's a way.

You mention in the comments that reusing components from Heirlooms allows you to reuse some of the XP they had soaked up; as long as you don't alter it too badly (a handle should probably still be a handle, for instance.) Could you use this to give, say, a fairly new knife the handle of an epic-level Heirloom screwdriver to create a powerful weapon? That sounds useful.
