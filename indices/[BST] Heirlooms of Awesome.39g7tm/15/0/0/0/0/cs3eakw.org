  Good luck inscribing the entire ocean
#+end_quote

Depends how it works right? If I inscribe on a canteen or cup or something and drink from it, does the water I fill it with become more clean or more potent, or is it just the canteen that gains powers.

Is a depression not the container of lakes and water? If I inscribe with food colouring onto a still water then I could form a rune like that. Does that work? If yes, why, if not, why?

The soil is a tool that trees use to grow, can I inscribe that? Can I take advantage of other beings magical energy production or is it only humans?

What if inscribe myself, obviously I can do every piece of clothing, shoes, etc? Can I inscribe my children, they are the tools of my DNA, etc. My teeth?

So many questions!
