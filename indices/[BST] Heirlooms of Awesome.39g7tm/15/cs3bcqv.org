If it at all possible you would see people trying to associate things with large objects that are unlikely to fall apart or break up. You would also see a far more organized work structure as instead of having ten people working away using their own tools it is far more worthwhile to have one person only working and to share the same tool.

Obviously going on to that you're seriously changing the cost-benefit analysis of things so that making cheap objects that don't last so long isn't worth much any more.

Things like does tilling and other farming techniques magically imbue the entire earth? Does swimming in the water imbue the ocean, does breathing imbue the air?
