Heh. I was just reading through the thread to see if anyone else had mentioned [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_Effect][The Practice Effect]] before linking it myself. You beat me to it.

Explanation for those not familiar: David Brin novel, the more an object is used the better it gets at what it does. Look at a mannequin, it gets more lifelike. Use a handkerchief, it gets softer and more absorbent, etc.

Note that in TPE it's the objects themselves that are gaining new qualities. OP seems to be saying that the objects become better at reducing the cost of casting cantrips but do not themselves do magic.
