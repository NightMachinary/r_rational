Sure, since I already looked, why not.

Twilight gives potion to Maud, with instructions to apply it to a rock. Maud applies it to Boulder (that's the name of her pet rock, which is decidedly not a boulder, if you're not aware). Boulder turns into a sort of well endowed squishy grey android (pondroid?) with creepy blank eyes. Maud proceeds to appropriately utilize said endowment, while monologuing to Boulder-pondroid in a sort of understated but overall porny way. Consent, as well as sapience or even sentience, of Boulder-pondroid is rather ambiguous. Ultimately, Boulder turns back into a pebble and inconveniently digs into Maud's back.

It's more silly than anything, really. Although probably less silly than [[https://e621.net/post/show/457774][this]], which is literal, non-anthropomorphized rocks having sex.. somehow.

YMMV though because I think a lot of things that seem to squick other people are just silly. If it's not physically possible, it's pure fantasy and pretty hard for it to get worse than 'silly', IME.
