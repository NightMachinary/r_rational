  And indeed, considering the *frightfully pornographic* nature of fimfiction.net
#+end_quote

Eh? I just turned off NoScript in case this 'pornographic' stuff is in the ads, but I don't notice any.. and there is the occasional vaguely-suggestive text or image, but I'm not sure how you'd run into actual explicit content without specifically seeking it out -- fimfiction's rules* are designed to prevent it, and do a decent job at that.

So I guess I have to take back my 'erraticly pornographic' comment, which is considerably milder than your 'frightfully pornographic' comment.

* No NSFW content in story thumbnail; No NSFW content in story descriptions.
