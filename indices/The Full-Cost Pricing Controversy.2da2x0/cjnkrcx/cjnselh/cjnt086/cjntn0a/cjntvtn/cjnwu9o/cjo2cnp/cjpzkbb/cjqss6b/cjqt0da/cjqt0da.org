You're a horrible person.

I mean, look, they're of humanoid mind-design, except with extra emphasis placed on positive social relationships. Of course they're going to /have/ sex lives. You're just not supposed to actually portray them, because butting into someone else's bedroom is /rude/. How much more so for what is technically another species with very different primary and secondary sexual characteristics?
