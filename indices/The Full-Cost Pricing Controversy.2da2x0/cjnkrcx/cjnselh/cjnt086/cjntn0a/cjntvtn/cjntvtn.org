There is an optimal level of warnings and information provision in general which will usually never be at a total provision or total absence of information because producing and distributing information is costly. Thus there will inevitably be some false positives and false negatives. When people get hit by some such error, they will inevitably complain about the level of information provided, and they are right to do so /even if the level of information provision is optimal./ And indeed, considering the frightfully pornographic nature of fimfiction.net, it is unlikely the level of information I provided in the title is optimal.

This is all simply my mistake, and I thank [[/u/literal-hitler]] for bringing it to my attention. Now if we are going to argue about something, let us argue about how widely spread marginal cost pricing is in practice and how useful it is in theory, and how economists performed in the full-cost pricing controversy.
