  Also, am I supposed to memorize sites I don't want to go to just in case someone links them? Should we all go memorize the addresses to furry porn sites just so we don't accidentally go there?

In your case, bothering with such a policy seems entirely consistent with the level of significance you are assigning to this whole issue.

When the item is a) posted by '*mylittle*economy' and b) its domain is *fim*fiction.net, I do not have much sympathy for your argument. Either one of those factors alone is enough to infer 'It's MLP'.

EDIT: However, searching domain:fimfiction.net in [[/r/rational]] suggests that this particular post is atypical and 95% of other posts aren't very clear on this issue. So I suppose I've ended up supporting your proposal.

Note however that if it's the erratic pornographicness of fimfiction.net that is the real problem, an MLP tag may not help you all that much (it's not as if fimfiction is the only website with MLP fiction or with NSFW content). A 'NSFW site' tag may be more relevant.

Also note that AFAIK story thumbnails are not permitted to contain explicit content, so it's appropriate to report them if they are.
