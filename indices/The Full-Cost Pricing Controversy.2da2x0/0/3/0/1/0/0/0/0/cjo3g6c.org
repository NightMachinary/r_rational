Well, there is toaster porn, so I don't see why there wouldn't be rock porn. Actually, on the topic of MLP, There is Tom the rock (who is definitely /just a particularly large rock/, not anthropomorphized), and there's definitely Tom/Rarity shipping. There's probably also Tom/Rarity porn. I mean, there is [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/6608/1/airshipping-is-magic/chapter-1]['Twilight and Trixie as airships' shipping]]!* -- surely Tom/Rarity porn is positively mundane next to that. Tom/Maud porn should be practically guaranteed, given Maud's field of interest.

* story is SFW, just rather bizarre. Airship romance and betrayal!! (yes, really)

Somewhat more seriously, I'm pretty sure that anything that has an appealing face qualifies, and anything that looks interesting may also spontaneously acquire a face (Google Image Search 'anthro fighter jet' sometime, for example)

I guess my overall conclusion is that well.. people are obsessed with relationships and sex, and that's really all that there is to this whole matter: putting any given X in the same sentence as 'sex' or 'relationship' seems to be just a matter of time, hence rule 34.
