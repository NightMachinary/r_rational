That understatement. Hehe.

As I was writing my previous comment, I looked up "tom_(mlp)" on e621. One of the images shown depicted [[https://e621.net/post/show/457774]["Tom and Boulder 'copulating'"]]*, with 'bodily' fluids oozing out where they are touching. I believe that broadly fulfills MLE's 'rock x rock' idea; it certainly fulfills my 'wat' quotient.

Also, [[https://e621.net/post/show/290275][aforementioned toaster porn]]* -- not the only instance, but the funniest one. It's even *furry* toaster porn, however the hell that is supposed to work.

* both links are NSFW.
