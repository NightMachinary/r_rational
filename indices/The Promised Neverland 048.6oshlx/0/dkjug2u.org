More character building! A little hammy, and I didn't care for the way the little ones jumped on Ray, but that's more my perception of kids.

These kids are much smarter than your standard fair.

I have couple options:

Ray's the 'bad' one, Minerva's the 'bad' one, or someone else? A new character, perhaps?

Also a theory on the demons vs humans:

Demons become more humanoid the less human they eat.
