This would be more interesting if the same offer is presented to Clippy!me. In that scenario I'd bide my time, outsourcing personal assistants to spend all their time working for me searching the internet for word on increased paperclip production. If I can find him, and have 90% confidence it's him, I'd make my move.

My winning condition would be his permanent paralysis, so I can take the boost while he still lives, as per whisper's suggestion. If the boost only lasts so long as Clippy!me lives, then we should stop talking about it in a public forum.
