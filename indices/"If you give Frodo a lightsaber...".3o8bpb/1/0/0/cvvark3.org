Yeah, but it won't have the money just yet, and even if it does, it'll need a lot more skill to plan the world's destruction. at the most, it'll be a successful CEO with more... eccentric spending habits. I mean, it might get further, but I doubt it. The demand for paperclips or the supply, depending on how it operates, might skyrocket, but it won't be world-ending or even harmful enough that I would feel morally obligated to turn-down this offer. Now, exponentially boosting it would be foolish, but doubling, trippling, or even quadrupling should be safe.
