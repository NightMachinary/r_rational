I convert it into longform personally: for the purposes of my cognition a bad person is a person who if given more power would do things I (and hopefully humanity in general) consider bad, based on past experience and so forth. Same for a good person doing good things. Basically, my heuristic is to ask can they be trusted with power and what would they do with that power.
