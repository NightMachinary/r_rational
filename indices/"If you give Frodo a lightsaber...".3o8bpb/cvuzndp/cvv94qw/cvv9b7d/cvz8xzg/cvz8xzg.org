Pro gaming seems like a decent start. A three or four times boost would let you play games dependent on reaction speed or strategy with a nearly insurmountable advantage.

There's a reasonably large amount of money tied up in Counter-Strike tournaments for example, and given a sniper rifle and a x4 speed boost you'd probably seem like some kind of aimbot from the outside.

That's enough to get you some seed money, and I'm sure there are other ways to leverage 'increased clock speed' or whatever you call it into financial success.
