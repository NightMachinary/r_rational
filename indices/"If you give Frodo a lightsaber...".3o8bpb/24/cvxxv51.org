You have control over both your and his CPU speed - this is a huge advantage.

Sit safely in home watched by someone, and turn the time speed to 100000x for one hour. Wait 1+k4 hours - repeat. Wait another 1+k4 hours - repeat.And so on. When you are reasonably sure you caught your enemy when driving or in other dangerous situation he couldn't possibly survive thinking at 0.000001 the usual speed - stop doing this.

Now you are free to use any time speed you want.

Alternatively - persuade someone to put you into 3 months long pharmatological coma, and connect you to the required medical devices to survive. Swith time to 10000000x just before, switch time to usual after. (S)he most probably died of dehydration or starvation.
