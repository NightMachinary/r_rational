If I have the ability to increase and then decrease back to normal the speed of my thoughts, then I would go through life using it only in emergencies. For example, giving myself a slight 10% boost when I need to finish thinking about a question on a test or when thinking of a comeback in conversation, and cancel it afterwards. The times I use the speed boost will be variable and while the paperclipper probably could predict a few, like me using it only when I'm awake or at the same time in class, it's still a significant problem to need the speed boost at the same time as I do and only for a minor percentage.

But if I can only chose my speed in the beginning and there's no changing it, then I'd go for a 3% boost. Minor enough to not make me super-smart, but significant enough that for an improvement.

I doubt the paper clipper will be able to damages things significantly, but I'd keep my ears out for someone starting up companies to make paper clips.
