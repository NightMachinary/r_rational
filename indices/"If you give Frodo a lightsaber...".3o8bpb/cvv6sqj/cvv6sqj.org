I attempt to strike an alliance with the paperclipper. I'll use my powers to help produce paperclips, as long as he uses his to help save lives and improve the lot of humanity. We both benefit from cooperation; two heads are better than one.

Then I'll go for a 100x speedup. Enough to give us a powerful edge over normal humans and do things that nobody else could do, but not enough that we're unstoppable if the rest of the world decides we're too dangerous to keep alive and unrestrained.
