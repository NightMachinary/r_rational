Depending how similar Clippy's psychology is to my own, and to what extent we're both buffered against the obvious possible ill effects of a speedup, I think we both boost a lot and split the universe between our utility functions. But only if Clippy is similar enough to me that we have common knowledge that it's a /symmetrical/ Prisoner's Dilemma.
