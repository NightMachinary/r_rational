Without self-replication technology (doesn't need to be nanotech) or a self-improving AI ala Celestia from Friendship is Optimal, the paperclipper is at most an annoyance. At most it could make enough money to build a bunch of paperclip factories, but it would be competing with the rest of humanity for resources, and its product (paperclips) doesn't bring in income to keep the process going -- it has to earn money elsewhere to keep the paperclip factories running.

Self-powered self-replicators or self-improving AI with the ability to take actions in the real world are a win scenario for the paperclipper. Both can be researched (or research can be funded) by the papercliiper without it revealing its aims.
