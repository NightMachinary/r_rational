We trade: Clippy can have its section of the universe for paperclips (which shall naturally be far away from earth) and I will have mine.

If we ever get to that point. In the mean time there's plenty of room for both humans and lots of paperclips - in fact I think the two rather need each other. We're both better off with respect to maximizing our preferences. Just because we have orthogonal preferences doesn't mean we can't cooperate.

At first, we can just increase it by a small amount - humans are the ones who make paperclips after all, so Clippy will be a temporary ally so long as I don't let him get /too/ powerful. It's in Clippy's best interest to help with ensuring my survival, humanity's survival, and help with ensuring we find a reliable way to enforce our agreement. Plus this way there are two minds working on the problem.

Meaner strategies include: using my greater knowledge of the situation to kill it, using the fact that I control the situation to play the unfair ultimatum game ("I promise to make you a gazillion paperclips if you cooperate, but I get the rest of the universe") and so on.
