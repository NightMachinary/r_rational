My ideal path would be to cooperate with the paperclipper to fight against the empty blackness of space. There's far more to lose through than to gain through competition with an equal with superpowers.

We're not actually equals, however, if its value system is sufficiently inhuman. There are a lot of important unknowns in this scenario. What's the paperclipper's risk aversion? Do paperclips scale linearly in value? Do future paperclips matter more or less than current ones, and by how much?

Quite possibly, the paperclipper would be able to take advantages of relative weaknesses in my motivational system. I get bored easily, but the paperclipper presumably wouldn't. I would give in to torture, while the paperclipper might not. My chief advantage is that I'm a satisficer, and I don't particularly care whether there are ten quadrillion or twenty quadrillion happy humans. Additionally, because I care about other human beings, it's probably easier for me to cooperate with other humans than for the paperclipper to do so.

This suggests that I should set my internal clock at a point where my influence is important but not so strong that I could take over the world without significant help from friends. My goal would not be to carry humanity to a new plateau of technology all by myself, but to speed up our current rate of advancement.

I'd choose to speed up my brain by 5x or so. Interacting with other people would still be bearable at that speed, and I would have a lot of influence but not so much that the paperclipper could destroy the world.
