You both have practicaly infinite subjective thinking time (as close to immortality as we are going to get IMHO). After subjective tousands of years of preparation you can do a lot of damage with "just" human-level intelligence. Or go mad. Probably both.

If you think that existence of humanity means you can't maximize paperclips - humanity has to go.

How much preparation time do you think you need to start WW3?
