Honestly, slowing down your subjective time isn't really the best way to 'be smarter' in my opinion. There are problems I couldn't necessarily solve even with all the time in the world. There are only so many ideas I can hold in my mind at any one time. There's a limit to what I can hold in my memory.

I'd make it so I think slightly faster, between 1.5 and 3x and not really worry at all about contending with my paperclipping double. I mean, he's just one person, and he's still only as smart as a human.
