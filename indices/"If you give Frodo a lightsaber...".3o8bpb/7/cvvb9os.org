I'd go with the maximum mental speed-up that doesn't result in total boredom. Let's say a couple dozen times acceleration, or so.

Many people seem to be worried about the paperclipper, but it's important to remember that what makes a superintelligent paperclip-maximizing entity dangerous is the */superintelligence/* part. Given effectively infinite power, an entity with a paperclip-maximizing utility function will convert all available matter in the universe into paperclips. But a human-level intelligence, even a fast thinking one? It'll probably just open a factory or something. (Keep it away from nanotechnology and powerful AI, though.)

Anyway, I'd use my newfound time to study math and eventually enter a lucrative career in finance. I'd probably donate most the money earned towards high-impact research or effective charity, but a portion would go towards hiring private investigators to look into any AI or nanotechnology researchers that seem to be unusually interested in paperclips. (Eliezer Yudkowsky, I'm looking at you.)
