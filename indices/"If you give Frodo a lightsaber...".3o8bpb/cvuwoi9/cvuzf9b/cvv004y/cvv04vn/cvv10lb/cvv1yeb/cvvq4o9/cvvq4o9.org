Good computer screens update at 144Hz. You're experiencing the equivalent of trillions (understatement) of years every second. (I'm assuming you also picked Graham's number). Even if a computer screen was pre-setup for you to use it for this, you would have to go for trillions of subjective years between each page flip.
