I feel like this is the correct answer. If I know Clippy exists, then its Prime Directive will make it very predictable and fairly easy to identify and neutralize. As long as I don't make myself smart enough to design an Artificial Intelligence (which doesn't seem like a possibility with this power), Clippy won't be able to either, which means the damage he can do is minimal and not necessarily even dangerous.
