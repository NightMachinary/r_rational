I'm not entirely convinced that just having more time to think is going to make me very much smarter - suspect I'd still find myself constrained by limits on the complexity and depth of my thoughts even with more time to consider.

Might take a small boost just for those times when being a bit more quickwitted /would/ help, but not so much that I start to find conversation annoyingly lag-prone. I doubt Clippy will get very far with that against the combined self-interest of the rest of the human race.
