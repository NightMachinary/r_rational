Eh, maybe a couple percent, enough to give me an edge but not enough to be a major problem. Also I phone the relevant police on the other side of the world and tell them that I think my estranged twin brother might be a danger to himself and others - he called me and started to rant about turning everything into paper clips. Yes, officer, I know it sounds crazy. That's why I'm worried. I'm not in the country, but I'd appreciate it if you kept him on file. You mean you don't have a record of him? Oh, my. I thought he was joking when he talked about illegally immigrating. Well, I don't know his address, but I can give a physical description."
