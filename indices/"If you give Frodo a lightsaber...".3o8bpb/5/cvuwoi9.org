Iff I know the rules of this scenario and the paperclipper doesn't, I would choose Graham's Number%. I would then use my first-mover advantage to locate and obliterate the paperclipper before a serious amount of damage was done by it. Presumably, it would be unprepared for an attack by an entity whose utility function was, at that point, only concerned with obliterating it.
