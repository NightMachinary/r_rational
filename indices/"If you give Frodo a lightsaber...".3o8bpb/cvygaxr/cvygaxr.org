Anything more than perhaps double or triple speed would make interacting with other humans to be an unbelievable chore. Waiting so long for them to respond, becoming frustrated and such. I don't think I could deal with it without becoming a hermit. Imagine the slowest person you know. Now imagine that everyone you talk to begins to seem slower than them because you're so much swifter. Not fun. Increasing clock speed is only nice if everyone else does it as well.
