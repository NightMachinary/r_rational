This seems pretty easy: don't increase the thought speed of either you or the paperclipper. Think of it this way: we've got a scale, and on one side of the scale sit you and human civilization, and on the other side of the scale sits the paperclipper. Percentagewise the paperclipper is hopelessly outgunned, with 7 billion humans plus you on one side and it on the other. Now let's say you increase the thought speed of yourself and the paperclipper by 1000x. At that point the 7 billion humans start to fade in the background and it becomes more of a fair fight between you and the paperclipper.

My answer might change if I'm allowed to use my superfast thought on other problems too though.
