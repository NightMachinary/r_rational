One of my favourite parts of reddit is discussion threads around a piece of media that I enjoy, like TV shows/movies/webserial/webcomic. I recommend you look for something you enjoy, and see if there's a community built around it.

Some that I like are [[/r/brakebills][r/brakebills]], [[/r/gunnerkrigg]], [[/r/blackmirror][r/blackmirror]], [[/r/TrueFilm][r/TrueFilm]], and the odd thread on [[/r/anime][r/anime]] or [[/r/movies][r/movies]].
