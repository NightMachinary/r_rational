I'm following a most excellent quest, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After The End]], and was hoping to pick [[/r/rational]]'s brains for some ideas on the latest challenge (with the author's permission!)

Avoiding spoilers, the players have finally gotten started on a long-planned research project to recreate the lost art of the Perfect Multiform - a technique which splits the user into multiple identical bodies as strong as the original, far superior to the currently-known Multiform which splits the user's strength as well. The challenge is in deciding how to achieve this.

#+begin_quote
  Premise 1: Multiform, as a technique, functions by using one's energy to split into multiple physical forms, all of which draw from the same energy pool when determining their own. Naturally, this splits one's energy pool into equal parts (historically, two to four).

  Premise 2: It is a matter of historical record that achieving a four-way ["perfect"] multiform with each clone being at the full power of the original is possible. Furthermore, this historical instance appeared to be without serious intrinsic drawbacks, although it was certainly far less decisive than one might expect.

  Premise 3: It is not theoretically impossible to outright demand that one's energy duplicate itself, although practically speaking it has never been done, and it would likely involve a significant up-front expenditure of energy.

  Premise 4: Similarly, there exist plentiful techniques to boost one's energy level beyond its default maximum, and thus the clones resulting from a multiform could artificially boost their energy levels to, "base," at the cost of significant ongoing strain.

The default options are:

- To simply split the user's Ki reserves and avoid losing potency, which would leave each body with 1/4 of the stamina.

- To investigate stretching out the clones' ki with techniques that boost the user's strength for brief periods, which would leave them at "full" strength - but such techniques invariably cause great strain on the body, drastically reducing the time the clone survives for.

There was some discussion around making use of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox][Banach-Tarski Paradox]], but after investigation the author ruled that this was not compatible with their model of ki. The author has outright invited the players to try and game this system if we can, but we're stumped. Admittedly it might just be that no better solution exists, but does anyone here have any ideas? To again quote the author:

#+begin_quote
  The moving part in question [given the above premises, which are assumed to be true given the information available to the thread] is that multiform intrinsically involves splitting off new physical forms from an existing ki source. Is there some other way you can think of to game that system?

EDIT: I reposted this in the [[https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ba5797/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ek9hvj2/][Saturday Thread]], because on reflection it fits better there.
