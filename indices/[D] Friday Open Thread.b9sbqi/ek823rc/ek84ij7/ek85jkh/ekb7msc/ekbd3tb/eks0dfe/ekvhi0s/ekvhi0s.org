This is definitely a setting where souls are a thing and that has an effect - you can't go Astral Projecting while in Multiform, sadly.

The clones work on the principle that they're all "real", and whichever body doesn't go away at the end just gets all the memories. We do indeed use Multiform as a way to get more done, but the limit on the amount it can be used each day makes the time gains useful but not huge.
