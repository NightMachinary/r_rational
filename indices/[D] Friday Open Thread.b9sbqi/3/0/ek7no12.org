  friend from uni who lives in Paris

Any reason why you can't stay with that friend or ask the friend if s/he knows anyone trustworthy looking for a roommate?

  inspect it on my behalf to make sure it's not full of cockroaches: do you recommend that?
#+end_quote

Absolutely, if you can get someone to manually inspect the place, that's very good.

  Especially because I'm probably going to have to commit to something without seeing it (I've got 2.5 weeks of airbnb booked)

I'm confused. If you have a place to live in Paris for 2.5 weeks, why do you need to commit to a houseshare without looking at the place? Plenty of places allow you to move in very shortly after inspection. When I was looking for an apartment in Baltimore, I could have moved in within a few days after an inspection. Just pick a bunch of houses you are interested in moving into, book appointments, and go all over Paris while you are staying at your AirBnb.

  tips

Ask about your housemate's schedule. If you are a morning person, then you might be most comfortable with a night owl so that there's minimal interaction when you need to use a bathroom or eating. Then again, you might want someone with a similar schedule so that the two of you are sleeping at roughly the same times for minimal noise/interruptions at night. It varies, but ask about their daily schedule.
