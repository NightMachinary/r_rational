  The first farmers paid a heavy price for their way of life. Though they still hunted and gathered wild foods, their crops and livestock had circumscribed their movements and they were eating an increasingly narrow spectrum of foods and suffering a range of previously uncommon afflictions.

I'm curious whether we have a good scientific consensus on what a pre-agricultural human diet would look like.

Does anyone here know: is there any scientific study of what exactly the human diet of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness consisted of? Presumably this would be “the set of foods that humans could manage to forage from the plains and/or treetops of Africa without yet having reliable access to cooking fire, but probably having constant access to grinding things between rocks”, and probably had a lot in common with the diet of chimpanzees, with the key difference that there are things chimps can chew open with their powerful jaws that we can't (but a lot of that is balanced by grinding things between rocks.)

It'd be interesting to try it as a fad diet, to say the least. (Though it probably contains a good number of plant+animal species that only exist in sub-Saharan Africa, so maybe this research would be best conducted at the University of Cape Town.)

I also imagine a good deal of the diet's effect would come down to the sheer variety of things eaten; the fact that many of the foods are eaten only periodically due to second-order population boom/bust effects as many other animals compete to eat those same things; and the fact that many of the foods are eaten only within tight seasonal bounds (e.g. flowers in bloom; birds from elsewhere caught mid-migration.)
