  There's a high likelihood of getting sick, no matter how hygenic you are. Long distance air travel really screws with your immune system. You'll still be able to enjoy your vacation, but be prepared to need cough syrup.

You're also likely to be exposed to strains of cold viruses etc. that you've not come across before due to geographical distance so aren't immune to, which adds to the likelihood of getting sick.
