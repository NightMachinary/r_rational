  Any reason why you can't stay with that friend or ask the friend if s/he knows anyone trustworthy looking for a roommate?

That's the first thing I did, he doesn't know anyone, alas!

  why do you need to commit to a houseshare without looking at the place
#+end_quote

... because I've never been in a houseshare before, and I'm also a real Type A obsessive planner, and the thought of going to Paris for 6 months with "only" 2.5 weeks of accommodation booked gives me major anxiety, even though I know worst case scenario I can afford a last minute hotel / hostel / airbnb fee. But I think you are probably right, especially since the vast majority of "house share" ads I'm seeing are available either immediately or within a week or two.

  Just pick a bunch of houses you are interested in moving into, book appointments, and go all over Paris while you are staying at your AirBnb.
#+end_quote

I appreciate that, I will only commit to something in advance if it's "perfect" (and be ready to forfeit any deposit if it turns out to be full of cockroaches).

  Then again, you might want someone with a similar schedule so that the two of you are sleeping at roughly the same times for minimal noise/interruptions at night.
#+end_quote

Yeah I have real trouble sleeping if there's noise so I think I'd want to find another morning person, which is why I was thinking that maybe a single woman in her 50s or 60s might be a really good option for me.
