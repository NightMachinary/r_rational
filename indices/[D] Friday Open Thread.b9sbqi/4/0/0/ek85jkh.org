So, I can recall 4 boosting techniques that we know of:

- The Kaio-Ken, which boosts the user's strength (or "Power Level") by using your life force - this passively damages the user as time goes on, and is more and more self-destructive the stronger a user gets.
- A technique which burns through a user's reserves to "use up" the ki faster, which in practice means a few minutes of a 10x increase or so, from memory, before the user is exhausted.
- Willpower Pushes - this is the nod to Dragon Ball's "yelling to get stronger", where through sheer force of will the user temporarily raises their Power Level (mechanically in the quest, a Willpower check that recurs at a higher difficulty as time passes.
- A passive % boost to Power Level maintained indefinitely by "refining" the user's ki - this is of course something already in use.

You are correct that multiple weak combatants are generally inferior to a single stronger combatant - hence why Multiform is considered relatively useless in real combat. Perfect Multiform would not be so, as the user would not get weaker. The goal here is to create a technique that clones the user without losing strength, and then have every clone use any energy boosters.

Storing energy for later use is a hypothesised workaround the thread hopes to eventually get around to, and is probably going to be the default solution - we're just trying to figure out whether or not there's a better way to approach this, by tweaking the technique.
