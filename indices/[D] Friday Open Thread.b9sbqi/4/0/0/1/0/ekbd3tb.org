I don't think a DNA clone would be a combat technique - if we just wanted another person at our level, we'd go get another Super Saiyan. Or are you suggesting a technique that literally grows a clone on the spot? That would be interesting, but I have no idea how you'd pull that off.

Unfortunately, using regular Multiform whilst using a boost technique leaves you with clones who are also using that boost technique, who will get weaker once they stop - and so are stuck with the drawbacks of the technique.

Your third idea is actually pretty interesting! For regular Multiform any damage taken by the bodies is "averaged out", so a serious injury on one becomes a minor injury once the technique ends. I think I'll float that as an idea to pursue once we actually have Perfect Multiform, if it leads to some method with a shared pool, or a way to transfer the ki.
