What's the strain that are being put on you when combining an energy boosting technique and using a regular multiform to make full powered copies? Mental strain? If so does there exist mental boosting techniques?

From what I remember from DB then one powerful attack is more impactful than multiple weak attacks so it seems suboptimal to split into multiple forms and use the energy booster rather than just using the energy booster.

An important detail I find is whether any laws on conservation of energy is in play or whether that isn't the case. If internal energy is regenerating I wonder what's stopping you from storing energy either in internal or external storage parts. If you could absorb energy to quadruple your current mojo and then split immediately there should only be a short moment of intense strain rather than the strain of multiple copies.

I personally find the idea of boosting techniques interesting. Are they summoning energy from somewhere or how does that work?
