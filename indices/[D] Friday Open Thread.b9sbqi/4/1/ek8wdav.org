So far, I only have one idea that seem like it could work for recreating Perfect Multiform.

Make it so that all four clones are somehow still connected to each other metaphysically where everyone draws on the same ki pool instead of splitting the pool. This means that every clone has access to the full reservoir and therefore remain at full-power. The obvious drawback is that the user's ki will be expended four times faster than normal if all four clones are attacking at once. It's just having the user be in four places at once instead of being four people.
