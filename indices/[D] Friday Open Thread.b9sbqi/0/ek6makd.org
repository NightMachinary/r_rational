I have a pinched nerve in my C6/7 area of my spine and light tears in both of my rotator cuffs from falling while rock climbing in January. I haven't been able to climb since and have been restricted in working out. I'm finally getting an appointment with a physical therapist because my new jobs insurance is finally kicking in but I'm just really frustrated.

I miss my climbing friends and haven't seen them in several months. I miss making progress in something I enjoyed and I feel way less healthy than I was a few months ago, despite the fact that I have been doing cardio 6 days a week and lower body workouts 3 days a week.

Anyone else just need to vent about terrible shit in their lives? I'll commiserate with you.
