I'm handing my masters' dissertation in soon, and I'll have to wait over two months to get my results (don't ask). I'm going to be massively stressing the whole time because if I get a bad grade on this I might not be able to get the job I want when I graduate this summer (I have an offer conditional on getting a certain grade). There's still a load of exams until then as well, so I'll need to be revising a lot and generally get very involved with course material, some of which overlaps with my dissertation. I don't think I'll be able to fully relax until mid-June.
