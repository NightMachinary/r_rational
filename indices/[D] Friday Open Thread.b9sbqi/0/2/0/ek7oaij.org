  I'll have to wait over two months to get my results (don't ask).

I have no idea if this applies to dissertations, but when I handed in a final paper for one of my classes, I asked my professor if he could grade it first out of everyone in the class so I could get my grade back sooner. I don't remember why I needed to know right away if I passed this one class, but he was willing to let me know sooner than usual. Maybe if you explained to your professor how much anxiety waiting for your results will be, they might be willing to let you know sooner.
