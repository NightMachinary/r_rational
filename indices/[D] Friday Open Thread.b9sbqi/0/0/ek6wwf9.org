I've been in a job for more than a year now where I'm well underpaid - and by that I don't mean I'm underappreciated, I mean that average salaries for equivalent graduates are more than double my own. The only reason I've stuck around is because of promises of a forthcoming takeover which would result in big pay bumps and equity payments.

It's now looking increasingly likely that that takeover is not going to happen, at least anytime soon, meaning I've basically wasted the last 6 months. Plus, I do actually like the job and don't look forward to moving on, but there's no way I can carry on with this kind of pay. Just a bit shit all round
