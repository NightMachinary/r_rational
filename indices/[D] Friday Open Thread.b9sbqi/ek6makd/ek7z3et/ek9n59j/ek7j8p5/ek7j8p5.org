My French visa arrived on Monday!!! I've booked my flights! I'll be in Paris from the 25th of May till the 25th of November! THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now I need to find a houseshare. I've never done houseshare before: only with partners. So... does anyone have tips? Especially because I'm probably going to have to commit to something without seeing it (I've got 2.5 weeks of airbnb booked). I'm a 31 year old woman and I'll be studying while I'm there, but I go to bed early and wake up early (it's 6am right now and I woke up 20 minutes ago).

I signed up for a French houseshare ads website and I noticed a lot of women in their 50s/60s are renting out rooms: is this the sort of thing that'd be a good fit for me, or do the sorts of women who rent out rooms tend to have personalities that make living with them suboptimal?

I do have a friend from uni who lives in Paris, and a penpal from a language learning app who lives there too, so if I'm serious about a place I might be able to convince one of them to inspect it on my behalf to make sure it's not full of cockroaches: do you recommend that?

Any and all tips would be greatly appreciated.
