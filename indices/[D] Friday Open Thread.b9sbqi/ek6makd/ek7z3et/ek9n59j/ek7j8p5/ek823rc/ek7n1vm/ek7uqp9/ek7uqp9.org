  Tips for traveling abroad would be helpful too.

So assuming you're american, rather than European:

1. Do your level best to minimize your luggage. If you've traveled by air before you likely already know how to do this, but if you haven't, you typically find yourself using only a fraction of the stuff that you bring.\\
2. If you miss a plane that would force you to stay in an airport overnight because of something that's the airline's fault, you can (usually) get something out of the airline representative, like a free or heavily subsidized night at a hotel, or in-airport food credits, or whatever.\\
3. There's a high likelihood of getting sick, no matter how hygenic you are. Long distance air travel really screws with your immune system. You'll still be able to enjoy your vacation, but be prepared to need cough syrup.\\
4. Remember to get a plug adapter! The brits have their own special kind of outlet. You can buy one at an airport, but it will be crappy and overpriced.
