Advice for London: the tube is amazing for getting around. Make sure to go to the Natural History Museum, it's really cool (and free!) and so is the Science Museum. Probably goes without saying but don't mess with the Queen's guards; they look odd to tourists but they're on-duty military with real weapons.

If you travel anywhere else in the UK, get the train - but make sure you plan in advance. A London-Birmingham return can be as cheap as £8 or as much as £50 depending on what ticket you buy and when. Also, London is very expensive compared to the rest of the country.
