Looking in my list:

I have my home city sub, sometimes people make nice connections there. Some hobby related stuff: [[/r/printsf]], [[/r/boardgames]], [[/r/magictcg]], [[/r/space]].

The expert discussion ones: [[/r/askahistorian]], [[/r/askscience]]. The feedstyle ones: [[/r/goodlongposts]] [[/r/threadkillers]], [[/r/bestof]] and since that one is pretty overrun with bad stuff nowadays. For the people who crave reddit experience with deep discussions and articles [[/r/truereddit]] and for those who find that too mainstream [[/r/truetruereddit]].

Now we have circled all the way back to [[/r/rational]], slatestarcodex gets linked often in those last ones.
