Well I am strudleing to think of anything that wouldn't also allow to produse unimited ki.

What produces ki in the quest? Is it the physical strength of a fighter or their soul. Maybe to solution is proform the technique with your soul body + normal body.

  splitting off new physical forms from an existing ki source

That seams to hint that you don't have to use your own. Maybe it is like the spirit bomb where you gather power from the world and use that to fuel the technique.

Prehaps the trick is to get really good at moveing the ki the the multiform body that needs it most. So most of the ki goes to a body right when it attacks or blocks and then is divded back out. That way you could block and fire attacks at fullpower while also haveing the benifit of being in multipule places at once. The main problem with this is you have to time your attacks so the don't happen at exatly the same time.
