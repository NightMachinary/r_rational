Creating a clone on the spot seems possible in universe but I'm assuming is stopped by the soul. Cell should've been making tons of clones whenever he's damaged for example, and learning to use ki to speed up the growth of a clone of yourself seems reasonable. If you can regen from half your body you should be able to exploit this if souls aren't an issue.

That's good consistent logic, 1 person boosting = 2 half power clones boosting.

How does the averaging out effect work mentally? I think in universe clone memories aren't shared? If that's true in quest clones can do willpower pushes and refinement to literal insanity before cancelling themselves without hurting the real mind.

I just realized any kind of clone that retains your brain can be exploited for learning and training plans. Since they are perfect mental copies you can have them cover huge amounts of ground then condense and evaluate if it's worth the real one actually doing. Just perfectly A B testing study plans on yourself before choosing to do one would be huge!
