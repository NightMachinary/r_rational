It seems like the real goal of Perfect Multiform is to give each clone a copy of your power level cap instead of splitting or sharing it among them. I guess you could flat out DNA clone yourself since DNA(or something) holds power, as we saw from Cell, then pass it off as a multiform clone?

I don't know where that cap comes from, maybe you need to attach a separate copy of your soul to each clone? You could also pull this off if you could temporarily increase your cap 2x then split the cap with a clone if that makes the temporary boost permanent.

Improving the plain multiform: Destructive power boosting; do a shared power split then have clones use boosting techniques if they don't hurt the whole to boost the shared power pool. Having clones entirely devoted to willpower pushes and ki refinement should work, kaio-ken probably hurts the shared soul? You can put clones into time dilation to magnify this if it works, they meditate/burn themselves out faster relative to the other clones.
