I damaged my right shoulder such that I cannot lift my arm, lie on it, or carry anything heavy in my right hand. My main activity's are fencing and coaching fencing... I've switched to leftie to stay involved but I'm shockingly bad and my cap leftie is probably quite low. The potential healing time ranges from a few weeks to half a year. That's the worst thing in my life right now which is actually pretty good, everything else is chugging along nicely.
