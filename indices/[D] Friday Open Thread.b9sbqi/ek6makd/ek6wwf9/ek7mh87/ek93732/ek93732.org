I understand. I really enjoyed my last work environment before my current job. But the hours were variable and the pay was very mediocre. As much as I enjoyed the job my current one pays ~5k more a year and has me paying less for better healthcare. It still isn't all that much money but I have to move up whenever I can. Plus I get to enjoy my free time more often now.

I'd just keep on looking for better positions while I'm still there. I hope things work out the best for you. Keep me updated on your job hunt.
