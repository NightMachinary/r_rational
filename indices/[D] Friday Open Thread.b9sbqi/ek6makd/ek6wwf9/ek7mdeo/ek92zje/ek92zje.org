I actually have yet to climb outdoors. I mostly do sport climbing at a gym and don't think it's a good idea to spend ~$80/month just to hang out while people climb. Maybe once the weather warms up and people go outdoors to climb I'll join them if I'm not healed, but until then I don't see a point in wasting my time and money like that. No matter how much it makes me depressed.
