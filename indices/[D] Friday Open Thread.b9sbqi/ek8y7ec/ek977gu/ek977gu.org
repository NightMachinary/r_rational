Your question could have been phrased better. Homo Sapiens probably always had fire, the consensus is that it was habitually used 300 000 years ago, ergo around 100 thousand years before homo sapiens 'existed'.

​

Agriculture started around 12 thousand years ago. So are you asking about the diets of homo sapiens earlier than this specifically ?

  The *Paleolithic diet*, *Paleo diet*, *caveman diet*, or *stone-age diet*[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#cite_note-bda-1][[1]]] is a modern [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad_diet][fad diet]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#cite_note-nhs08-2][[2]]] requiring the sole or predominant eating of foods presumed to have been available to humans during the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic][Paleolithic]] era.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#cite_note-Tarantino2015-3][[3]]]

  *The digestive abilities of* [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomically_modern_human][*anatomically modern humans*]]*, however, are different from those of Paleolithic humans, which undermines the diet's core premise.*[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#cite_note-fantasy-4][*[4]*]] During the 2.6 million year-long Paleolithic era, the highly variable climate and worldwide spread of human populations meant that humans were, by necessity, nutritionally adaptable. Supporters of the diet mistakenly presuppose that human digestion has remained essentially unchanged over time.[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#cite_note-fantasy-4][[4]]][[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet#cite_note-5][[5]]]

Fish, seafood, roots, meats, nuts, fruits and vegetables. Basically, they ate things that people can eat and aren't man made / selectively bred like most animals, plants, and fruits we eat today..

Fish is often overlooked, they probably ate more fish than other meats, because fishing is easier than hunting.

  Does anyone here know: is there any scientific study of what exactly the human diet of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness consisted of?

This is a common misconception, areas like archaeology, anthropology, history, geography don't generally have "studies". They publish things, hypothesis and theories based on findings, but they can't do control tests or run experiments, most of their best evidence would be considered 'anecdotal' by statisticians.

​

What they do is come up with a most likely range of possible values, based on findings and the evidence they have available. Then experts come to a consensus on what ranges are most likely to be true, and that becomes the accepted data until more evidence surfaces and they can refine it even more.

​

It is particularly annoying because some people can just deny their evidence, say it's all circumstantial and anecdotal, to pass on their own agendas, and refuse to believe things that we are basically sure are true because the evidence is 'anecdotal'.
