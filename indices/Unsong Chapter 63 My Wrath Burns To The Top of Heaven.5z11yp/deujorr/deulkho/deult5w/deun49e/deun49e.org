Is TOK's plan to get Uriel out of the way so Sohu can sub in for him? If so, who do we know who would want that? Possibly Acher, possibly TCK or Robin, and the /sorry/ makes the latter two more likely.

And if they do sub Sohu in, what would that accomplish? It'd get a Cometspawn out of the way when they're trying to take Colorado, but that's too simple. It'd get her in charge of Uriel's machine, at which point maybe they can convince her to follow along with their plans?
