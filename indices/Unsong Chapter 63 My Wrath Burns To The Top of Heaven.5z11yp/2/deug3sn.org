Well then. This more or less confirms that Robin is the Other King. She's the only person we know of who might be kind enough to apologize for decoalescing Uriel and has the capacity and motive to do horrible things for possibly good reasons.

She probably corrupted Vihaan years ago, maybe implanting a trigger in his mind to act on her command at a designated moment. She had the opportunity to do so, after all.

The real question here is /why/ she's taking out Uriel. The Wrathful Name won't permanently destroy him, only Thamiel's Bident does that. So she needed him and his constant monitoring of reality out of the way. Perhaps she predicts that, with the machinery of the world grinding to a halt, the doors to Hell will cease to function properly and a missile bearing a scroll of the HaShem Mephorash will be able to get through?
