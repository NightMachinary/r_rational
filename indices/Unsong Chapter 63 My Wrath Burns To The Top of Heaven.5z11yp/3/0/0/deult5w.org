That does suck, but that's why Sohu was training with him, right? She'll just have to sub for him. Assuming she's capable of putting together some kind of slapdash replacement machinery, and wasn't totally depending on just taking the controls Uriel built.

The world can't be destroyed in the very near future or there wouldn't be a story, so on a narrative level I'm more worried about Uriel than I am about the world.
