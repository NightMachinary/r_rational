In this chapter, we were given a glimpse into the daily life of Uriel for only a few minutes and he was actively monitoring three imminent apocalyptic threats that might require his intervention at any moment. I think every time we've seen him he's been putting out one fire or another.

I'm not sanguine about the chances of the world's survival for however long it takes him to pull himself back together.
