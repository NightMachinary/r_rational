What happenes with ball after you die?

What happenes with ball during your sleep? Can you accidentally use it during sleep?

If ball is non material, can I materialize it inside my enemy body, maybe even inside his heart, instantly killing him?

What happens if I materialize ball, put it somewhere, and start running far away from it? Will it diseappear, or follow me just by flying (in material or non material form)?

If I travel to mars, but leave my ball on Earth, and then I will 'call back' it to me on Mars, will it travel to Mars faster than light?
