Hmm, how fast does the ball return to you? And how fast can you resolidify it?

Can you solidify the ball while it's speeding towards you, thus creating a solid with a high velocity? (Dodge out of the way if you want to live though.)

Can you repeatedly solidify the ball, drop it from a great height, unsolidify it, let the ball travel back up, then drop it again, for lots of free energy?

Can you solidify your ball into a shape that disguises it as a construction material, then a long time later unsolidify it and send the building crashing down?

On a smaller scale, could this also work for pitfall traps? Your targets think they are standing on solid ground, but instead they stand on your disguised solid ball, shaped into a pancake over the hole.
