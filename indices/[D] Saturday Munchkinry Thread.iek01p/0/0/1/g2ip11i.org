  What is the precision of shaping? Can you shape keys? No more need to worry about losing your house keys?
#+end_quote

I think that's a good application, yeah, and would be even with relatively low levels of precision (since you could make keys and locks bigger to compensate). I'm not sure what I want to set as the upper levels of precision, but my feeling is "visible to the naked eye" would probably be the smallest effective change you could make.

  Can the ball be separated from you by any means?
#+end_quote

No. The ball will just slip through invisible cracks to get to you if you there's a solid barrier in its way. I'm less certain about shapes: I think the most interesting rule, to me, is that your shape can stay how it is no matter how far away you are, but that you can change it back to ball form (and thus recall it) no matter how far away you are. (The ball/shape also disappears on death.)

These are the kinds of rules you end up just tacking on though, and don't necessarily feel "clean".
