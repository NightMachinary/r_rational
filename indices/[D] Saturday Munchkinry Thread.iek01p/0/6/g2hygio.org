  Could you make a bow, if you had a string for it? ... probably?

How much can you transfigure against tension? Could you e.g. make a crossbow, attach the string and pass it through a hook, and then reshape it to move the hook back so that it's drawn? If that's too hard you might be able to break it down in multiple easier steps, with pulley, *ratchet and whatnot.

Leaving aside this combat application, that would also make it a possible source of energy, depending on where the reshaping energy comes from. [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13][New job: just levitate and drop your ball over and over again.]]
