  Keeping people in prison or as slaves would become exceedingly difficult.

Don't underestimate government's readiness to perform violence. Considering OP's rule that shape stays how it is no matter the distance, wardens can force prisoners to make the ball into a certain shape and store it in a 24/7-monitored room. If someone's shape disappears, they get a small army entering their confinement cell.

Goverments and/or slavers /will/ get creative to keep their power over people.
