A clipboard. Can the orb/object keep floating once formed into a shape?

A basket for carrying things, or a cart. How much fine control does the average person have over material properties? A low friction base would be useful for the nonfloaty version.

A mold for making other parts in a manufacturing environment, especially for small quantity runs. Material properties come into play again... does the shape change or become harder to control due to heat? Will the orb/object catch fire?

Walls and stairs, scaffolding, ladders; short people no longer need to suffer the tyranny of ceiling mounted cabinets.

A sphere which carries your valuables inside, which only opens when you reshape it into a fishbowl to take your stuff out. Actually this brings up another question. Can the orb be stolen if it'ssolid and floating behind you?

Can I make it soft? My pillows are never the right height.

Shoes. Especially if you're poor.

A chair wherever you happen to want to sit.

An outfit. Can the color of the orb-object be controlled? What about the texture?

A spoon or fork or knife, or a plate that's perpetually clean. Can the object be a plate and utensils all connected by strings?

Think of modern conveniences. That's the main thing anybody would use it for.
