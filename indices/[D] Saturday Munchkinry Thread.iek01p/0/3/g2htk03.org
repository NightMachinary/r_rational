If it's "like Wood" that actually allows a huge range of variation. Consider the range from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignum_vitae][densest wood]] to balsa wood. Or the range from cured/treated hardwoods vs. freshly cut wood.

If it isn't normally possible to rapidly dismiss the shaped object back into a ball (I don't think you mentioned if it is) then for a handy trick, leave a vulnerable point on the finished object that can be reinforced with a secondary piece. Then when you want a different object, remove the secondary piece and break that vulnerable point. For hunter-gatherers and especially [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting][endurance hunters]] this would be a good way to minimize carrying weight. You can use the object for all of your tools by having practiced all the needed shapes in advance and then rapidly breaking and reshaping to switch between tools.

For a primitive tool, the atlatl would be good one. It is simpler than a bow and provides a good boost to spear throwing.

For making a bow, you want a nonuniform tension/flexibility... [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_bow][composite bows]] typically use a lamination of wood, sinew, and horn. If you can control the properties across the bow to within the range of wood without having any weak-points at the interface where properties change (or better yet smoothly change the properties), you could probably manage a bow better than the best composite bows. Imagine archers with bows at the overall force of an English longbow but the size/compactness and nice recurve of a composite bow. A culture that can teach its citizen to shape their ball into a bow with these specs and train them to develop a good draw strength will have a huge military advantage.

For other tools... I am not sure how much better an obsidian knife or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl][Macuahuitl]] is for having the handle perfectly fit around the obsidian and just leave the very edge exposed, by I suspect it would be a decent improvement on it, but not enough to replace bronze or iron.
