Good points. You could also use this as a pump to gradually compress air by initially making a huge ball and then reshaping the ball to make it smaller and smaller. You could then use the compressed air source as a scuba tank, a power source for an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun][air gun]] or cannon, as an explosive device, or as a heat exchanger since the gas will heat up when being compressed and cool down again when it's allowed to depressurize.
