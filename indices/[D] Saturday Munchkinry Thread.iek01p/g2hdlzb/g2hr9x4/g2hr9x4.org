How should societies of fey who are ageless and able to make unbreakable vows leverage this to the greatest extent?

The fey can't lie, and are incapable of not putting forth their greatest possible effort into upholding any promises they make. Fey contracts can't force non-fey to keep their end of any deal, and for that reason are always drafted with escape clauses. Fey have at least as much control over their body/mind as the best human meditators, but there are still some parts of their subconscious/nervous system they can't consciously control and contracts don't change this.

To prevent the obvious slavery related exploits here, all fey when young bind themselves into promises limiting what they are capable of agreeing to/doing under duress. Certain kinds of promises are also obviously best made publicly, for instance: "I will never to give in to blackmail or ransoms and do everything in my power to kill anyone who tries such tactics against me". Not lying absolutely applies to "white lies", despite fey language being almost intrinsically impossible for humans to understand given its absurd amount of innuendo and multiple layers of meaning.

*It strikes me that a species able to make perfect precommitment like these fey should have massive advantages in a staggering variety of areas compared to humans, but I've never seen this explored to its full potential.*
