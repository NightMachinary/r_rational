New Age Munchkinry! Munchkin various miscellaneous magic powers based on rationalizations of New Age practices. Munchkin one of them or mix and match. Treat as a single unique power you possess, or consider the societal implications if anyone can learn them.

*Homeopathy*

- By performing a few various ritual actions (mixing/shaking it a particular way, saying prayer to various neopagan deities, meditating on water memory, etc.) as you dilute a substance with water, you can allow the water to retain the full potency of the original substance, so long as you or another Homeopath are the one to administer it.
- With moderate practice, the potency of the water will automatically adjust such that it gives the optimal dosage of the substance.
- With a lot of practice, you can allow the water to have only the beneficial properties of the original substance and none of the side-effects, up to the maximum non-lethal dosage.
- For all other purposes save ingesting, the water is just water.

*Crystal Healing/Energy Worker*

- By moving crystal and magnets over a persons body, you can heal some aliments.
- Practice will improve ability, but some things are easily healed and others are relatively unaffected.
- Careful study will show that the crystals/magnets are actually only affecting bio-electricity, albeit in a precisely optimal way (in proportion to the Healer's skill) towards maximizing the subject's health.

*Aura Vision*

- By concentrating on a person, you can visualize their Aura, seeing a mix of various translucent color and shades around them.
- The colors are meaningful, but unfortunately, they have too much information: the color coding mixes colors for emotions, colors for thoughts, and colors for physical condition/health. Furthermore, every person has slight variations on the standard color scheme.
- For example one persons dark red might mean anger and another persons dark red might mean irritation. And red might also indicate good blood flow and/or aggressive thoughts.
- Lots of practice might mean some limited discernment between similar looking colors that correspond to different things.

*Astrology/Palm Reading/Tarot/Other Divination*

- By working a divination ritual (i.e. Tarot, Astrology, etc.) on a person with their consent, you can generate a reading that the person will feel is very detailed, accurate, and personal at the time it is read to them.
- In actuality, the reading will only have actual accurate information as is absolutely necessary to induce that feeling in the person being read. For the most part and/or to a objective outside observer, the reading will be vague guesswork with a few bits of accurate information.
