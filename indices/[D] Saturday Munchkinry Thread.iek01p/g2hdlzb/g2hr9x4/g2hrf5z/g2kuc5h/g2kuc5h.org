Through a reality-bending rift in spacetime that will /never/ repeat again, you get to talk with an AGI from another version of Earth. You do not know if the agent is well-aligned, but you know that humanity still exists on that Earth and is not enslaved/made into paperclips/etc.

What questions would you ask this AGI?
