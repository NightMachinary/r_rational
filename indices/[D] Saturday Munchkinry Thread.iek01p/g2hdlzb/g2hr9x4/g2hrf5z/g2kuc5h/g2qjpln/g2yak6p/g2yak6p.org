Forking Sextet

- You wake up with the ability to "fork" into 6 separate bodies, each with a copy of your mind.

- Every time you go to sleep, your mind is copied 5 times and into 5 bodies (plus your old original one remains).

- you can "absorb" copies and merge them with the original mind. You can do that consciously, or wait until both the original body and the copies fall asleep, then it happens automatically. Same happens if the copy dies.

- if you consciously absorb a copy, its body disappears.

- your mind merges seamlessly, with forks' memories queueing in order of falling asleep.

- for the sake of the argument, the copies appear naked, and are: You (original), Older You, Cute You, Ugly You, Cute Sex-reversed You, Ugly Sex-Reversed You.

How would you munchkin that?
