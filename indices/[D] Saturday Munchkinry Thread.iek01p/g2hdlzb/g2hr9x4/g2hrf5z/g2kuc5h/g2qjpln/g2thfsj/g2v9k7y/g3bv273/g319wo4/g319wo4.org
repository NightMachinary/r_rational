Depends on the resolution of this "ability." If smoking the hive to harvest honey means you can sell the honey to keep paying rent on your bee farm, then /not/ smoking the hive would be more harmful since you'd lose the farm and they'd all die. My comment assumed that "harm" was defined on the macro scale and in the long term.
