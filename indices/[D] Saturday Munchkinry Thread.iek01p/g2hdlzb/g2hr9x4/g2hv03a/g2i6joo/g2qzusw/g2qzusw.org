  Fey also have vulnerability to cold iron (metal not significantly heated within the earth/feywilds magnetic/magical field) which is the only way to disable their powers. ... These empires produce essentially all cold iron (which requires magical space stations) and forbid giving it to non-fey upon pain of death.

Wait, so the only way they could think of to make iron that never wound up both hot and in a planet's magnetic field was to build blast furnaces in space? Bruh.

*A vengeful human's procedure for making cold iron-plated weapons:*

1. Take some normal iron, some lump of metal that is not necessarily iron but can be, some sort of very acidic solution (concentrated vinegar and lemon juice are both excellent choices, but oleum might be a bit excessive and need substantial dilution), two corrosion-resistant wires with alligator clips or something, and the (metallic) weapon to be coated.
2. Attach one end of wire one to the unspecified metal lump and one end to the weapon
3. Attach one end of wire two to the iron and leave the other one hanging.
4. Prepare two acid baths: one with the iron and the weapon submerged, the other with the metal and the exposed wire submerged.
5. Wait. Iron should build up on the weapon's surface.

This is basically just an electroplating rig set up to a crude battery. As electrons are pulled from the iron, it enters the solution as iron ions. In this phase, it is chemically distinct from actual iron; if you boiled the solution, you'd get an iron salt, not iron itself. As electrons are pushed into the weapon, some combine with iron ions, forming new iron atoms. These iron atoms have never been exposed to high temperatures at all and thus count as cold iron. The cold iron plating only increases in thickness with more time in the electroplater.

Though electroplating was invented in the early 19^{th} century on Earth, the principle [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery][was likely understood]] as early as classical times, and of course the inhabitants of your setting have a strong incentive to develop and weaponize it...
