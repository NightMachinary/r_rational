  The Fey don't need a lot of the cultural/societal technology that humans do to do stuff like go to war or organize on large scales, this might actually be a disadvantage in the long run, because they wouldn't develop institutions and conventions that are useful beyond the immediate needs they fulfill.

Yeah fey society has some fundamental differences due to immortality and the fact fey can live comfortably in the wilderness just fine. That being said nearly all fey are fairly clever, with the most powerful ones being peak-human intelligence (which at least for qualitative intelligence is the max within my setting).\\
I should also note that massive numbers of hunter gatherers from surprisingly large geographic areas were banding together to build large (presumably) religious structures well before agriculture, so agriculture isn't the be all and end all of mass scale cooperation.

Many paths to civilization are likely possible without people relying on state for their survival, though they may not resemble our civilizations much. The existence of a minuscule fraction of fey who are individually equal in power to an entire army of average fey is also going to be a major factor here, though to what end I can't be confident.
