  Would this not fall under "Fey have at least as much control over their body/mind as the best human meditators"

Being able to make yourself feel bad about something you /know/ you shouldn't (in every sense of the word) feel bad about isn't something it seems like any humans are capable of regardless of meditation. For similar reasons to why people can't make themselves believe something they consider absurd.

  Sounds like you're adding new rules after the fact.
#+end_quote

I haven't introduced any new rules, or even changed my interpretation of any previously established rules in response to your comment. I wasn't clear about exactly how specific oaths need to be, but that was clarified both by the example I gave and by multiple comments I made before yours.

The idea that fey would necessarily make many slightly ambiguous oaths that take advantage of fey's lack of ability for self deception (as a consequence of their inability to lie) to function was always part of the scenario I was imagining here. When you can literally include clauses about acting in accordance with what one believes to have been the intended interpretation of an oath, that unavoidably places limits on certain types of exploits against any well thought through oath.
