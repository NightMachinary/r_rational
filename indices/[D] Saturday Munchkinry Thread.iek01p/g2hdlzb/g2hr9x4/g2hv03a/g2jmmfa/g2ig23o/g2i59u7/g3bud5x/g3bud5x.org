Seems like oath hackers would be a thing. People who can figure out the exact limitations of a captive's birth-oath, then find loopholes to force them to swear slave-oaths anyway, then make them forget the captivity and save-oaths ever happened, and eventually take over the world.

The whole list of "swear to always feel intense discomfort and self-loathing when working against my wishes" type oaths can't be counter-oathed against, especially by a child who barely understands what is happening.
