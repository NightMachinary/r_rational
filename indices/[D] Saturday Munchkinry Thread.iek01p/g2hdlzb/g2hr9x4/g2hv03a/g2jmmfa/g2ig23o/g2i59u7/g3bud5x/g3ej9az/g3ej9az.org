  Seems like oath hackers would be a thing. People who can figure out the exact limitations of a captive's birth-oath, then find loopholes to force them to swear slave-oaths anyway, then make them forget the captivity and save-oaths ever happened, and eventually take over the world.

I don't think this is terribly feasible with well crafted oaths. Since you can have oaths rely on the interpretation of the the bound individual, so you can literally just exclude the possibility of accepting any clearly exploitative oaths (and fey are superhumanly good at foreseeing the consequences of their oaths), as well as oaths that would never be accepted except under coercion.

This kind of oath wouldn't be possible, because people can't force themselves to feel negative emotions in this way. Especially when doing so is so obviously against one's own interests (also see my comment about why extreme operant conditioning based brainwashing doesn't work).
