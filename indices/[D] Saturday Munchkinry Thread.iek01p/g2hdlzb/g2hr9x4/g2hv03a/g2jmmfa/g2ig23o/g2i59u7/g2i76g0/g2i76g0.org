Fey aren't capable of making oaths they don't intend to keep, which rules out contradictory oaths. The oaths don't exist outside the Fey's mind either (thus they often have clauses preventing deliberate mind control) so it just relies on how they understand the contract (and they can't agree to contracts they don't understand fully).
