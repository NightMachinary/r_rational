I wasn't proposing any utopian oaths by any stretch of the imagination.

The oaths described serve two purposes: Making it irrational to try to blackmail, torture for information, ransom your loved one's, etc to you. The second purpose is that anti-slavery oaths act as a form of mutual defense to ensure no faction of fey can gain an overwhelming advantage by enslaving fey, which would rapidly snowball.

  On the other hand, upon discovery of a loophole in a dystopian oath, society instantly dissolves into bloody revolt, while in an utopian one people just voluntarily fix it.

I should note that dystopian oaths needn't by at all vulnerable to loopholes since oaths rely on the judgement of those bound. So you can include "acting loyally" in a contract, thus disallowing any actions the slave knows would probably be considered disloyal.
