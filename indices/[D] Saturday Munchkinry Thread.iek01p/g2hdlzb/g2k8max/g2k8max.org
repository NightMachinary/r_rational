Having a material that can fill a space, and then become immaterial and disappear from that space, has huge implications on materials manufacturing and many other industries. You can create perfect vacuums without a significant power source. You can make molds that disappear after the hardening process. You can make load-bearing objects that disappear on a mental trigger.

Can you make fibrous, flexible shapes like rope?
