Everyone in the world has a "ball", a little orb of matter approximately 30 centimeters across (volume of 14 liters) that floats around within maybe a foot of you. In its natural state, it's somewhat insubstantial, but with a little bit of focus and time, you can shape it. Once the ball has been shaped, it's roughly as dense and heavy as wood, though less easy to damage: damage can be repaired with a reshaping. Once a person has created a shape, becomes easier for them to recreate that shape. Shapes must be contiguous objects. Matter that's not used in the shape will quietly disappear until the shape has been unmade and/or changed.

Thinking through the implications of this:

- Everyone has a tool at hand for whatever they need, without having to carry anything. This means that whole swaths of economies cannot form because they are obsoleted by the ball. It also lowers the capital costs for a wide variety of things where shapes can replace tools.
- Everyone is always armed, or could be armed with only a few seconds notice. (The exact limits on shapes are something that I'm still working out: I would rather not have guns, but would be fine with something more clever than guns that fills the same role. For a projectile-based weapon, you would have to carry the projectile(s) with you.)
- Clothes can, in some circumstances, be partially obsoleted by the ball. Particularly, an umbrella to keep off the sun or rain is always handy, and in a pinch, depending on some specifics of the power (how easy it is to make bendy things, for a start) maybe actual protective clothes of some kind. Cruder armor would definitely be possible, with the easiest being a cuirass that you bind to yourself with a length of string/fabric/rope.
- The shapes can replace a lot of tools and other things that you would take with you as you go, but the options get a lot bigger if you have the ability to augment your shapes, with (for example) a stick, a piece of leather, a wrap, or something like that. If projectile weapons, then this includes projectiles. This allows you to have more complicated tools than you otherwise could, and allows tools to be better (by for example protecting your hand with a grip).
- In addition to common shape augments, you could carry around secondary pieces that slot into a shape, in order to make tools with moving parts, or to otherwise get around problems with the "one contiguous part" rule. Beyond that, two people working together can make two shapes that go together. I think this is all good and interesting, and needs a bit more thought to figure out what daily life looks like for people in this world, what norms and mores would develop around the balls and their shapes, etc.

Some open questions I still have:

- Saying that it's like wood when in shape form is ... fine, but there are questions about tension, deformation, etc. that probably need to be hammered out. Could you make a bow, if you had a string for it? ... probably?
- What are the most useful shapes that a person could/would make? A knife, hammer, crowbar, staff, bowl, basket, and spear are all at the top of my list at the moment, but those are the primordials, the ones that you start out with as hunter-gatherers, rather than the stuff you would have in an advanced society.
