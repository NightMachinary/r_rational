Keeping people in prison or as slaves would become exceedingly difficult. So difficult that aside from a few political prisoners both institutions would never really exist.

Another thing I noticed is that you could make attachments out of other materials to make the shapes you make be more effective. For instance you could buy a couple real dense balls of metal, that you then form your hammer around to make it much more dense.

Or a thin sharp blade of metal that you attach to your knife/sword shape to make it sharper and tougher for a fraction of the cost of making a full metal knife or sword.
