I'm mainly curious about the applications of reshaping. If you practice two different shapes, could you reshape from one to the other a lot faster or more forcefully? If that's the case, you could have all sorts of tools developed on the principle of rapid reshaping to cycle between shapes rather than having moving parts, with the additional benefit that any wear to the objects would be immediately fixed with the next cycle. For example, memorising the shape of a jackhammer at minimum and full extension, then moving between them quickly to produce the same effect
