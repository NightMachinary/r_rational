  I'm not sure what I want to set as the upper levels of precision, but my feeling is "visible to the naked eye" would probably be the smallest effective change you could make.

This would probably be in the range of 3-8 micrometers with good lighting, like a strand of spider silk. That would make it relatively easy to construct a bow with an included string composed of twisted wood-like fibers which emerge from the ends of the bow staff, assuming you can form an object under tension so the bow is strung from the start.
