Wait a second. The ball floats? And stays around you somehow?

How does that work? Is it telekinetic? Can you just move the ball around psychically?

Can you stand on top of the ball after shaping it into a platform, and then fly?

Can the ball be separated from you by any means? What happens if you float the ball such that it is on the opposite side of a wall, solidify it, and then start running away from it? Will the ball break through the wall to get to you? Will it apply more force if you run faster?

What is the precision of shaping? Can you shape keys? No more need to worry about losing your house keys?

Can you make a (very thin) bed with it? Really just a flat surface to place on the ground so you don't have to worry about lying on top of pebbles and stuff.
