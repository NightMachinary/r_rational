Homeopathy can be exploited for an infinite supply of any substance that can be formed by a reaction with the body. For an example, say you want infinite silver chloride (presumably to refine into the pure metal). Homeopathically transfer the properties of silver nitrate to some water (with the intended effect of "make the drinker poop out AgCl"---it should form the insoluble salt when reacting with stomach acid) and have your subject drink up, then collect their feces and get the show on the road. As a bonus, "acute nitrate poisoning" and "loss of chloride ions in stomach fluid" are definitely negative side effects, so you can have them drink as much of this water as you want without exhausting their stomach acid or killing them.

Other ideas: Hydrogen: infuse with the essence of a colloidal magnesium suspension Sugar: infuse with the essence of starch. (Similar methods should exist for all nutrients) Oxygen: infuse with the essence of hydrogen peroxide NaOH (useful not just for its alkalinity but also as a carbon sink): infuse with the essence of sodium ...and so on and so forth

Divination should get interesting if you invent AGI (or have some highly skeptical people).
