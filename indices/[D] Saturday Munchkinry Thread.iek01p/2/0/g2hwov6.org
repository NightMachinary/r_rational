Homeopathy + Telemedicine = Win. Have multiple uber-skilled homeopaths infusing water with all the beneficial effects of all drugs in existence (no reason not to do it if there are no side effects), deliver the infused water via water supply. If anyone needs any healing, it can be done at home at any moment, you just need to play a video of the most uber homeopath providing instructions on how to drink the water. There actually were attempts to "charge" water over television IRL, so these beliefs don't necessarily involve personal presence.
