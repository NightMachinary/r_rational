Food is a substance (under the homeopathic definition at least, which counts stuff like goose liver as a substance), while calories, taste, vitamins and their texture are all properties of said food. Hungry? Go down and get a homeopathic cup of burger.

Aura readers would become security guards, bouncers and cops. To get into a place you would have to pass an aura test, and if your Aura is naturally the wrong shade of red or blue or black? Cops are going to be stopping you every time they see you, leading to aura discrimination for people that just have bad auras.

If it was around long enough I could also see it being used as probable cause or evidence "Your honor, the suspect had a burgundy charcoal aura, so I knew he had just murdered someone."
