In [[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18][Silmarillion-based glowfics]], this is how Melkor retains control over his orc armies. Get the first-generation orcs to swear obedience to you (in this fanon orcs retain the canon elves' ability to swear seemingly unbreakable oaths), then order them to make all their future children swear the same as soon as they're old enough to speak, and bam, self-sustaining slave population.

The Silmarillion itself, of course, is a bit of a cautionary tale about careless oaths. To a first approximation, basically every evil act ever committed by an elf in all of history is a consequence of the [[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Oath_of_F%C3%ABanor][Oath of FÃ«anor]]

There is also a fairyland glowfic setting (can't find an archetypical thread, [[https://www.glowfic.com/characters/3?view=posts][it's a bit of a mess in there]]) where anyone who knows your true name or feeds you food can give you orders. Not being overseen by an evil micromanaging deity like Melkor, it instead breaks down into smaller hierarchies that work pretty much exactly like [[/u/scruiser]] described.
