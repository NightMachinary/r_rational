This form of unbreakable vow is very conducive to creating dystopian hells, which is why I tried to specify the initial conditions as egalitarian (since I wanted to explore scenarios where this ability makes most fey better off). Since it's essentially impossible to break out of such a dystopian hell once it forms. Though the inverse is also true, since if things start as egalitarian everyone can agree to vows that bind them against anyone who tries to create such a dystopia.
