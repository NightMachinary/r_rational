  Your anti-slavery method is insufficient.
#+end_quote

The fey have other protections from slavery by virtue of having more magical talent than nearly all humans and having children very rarely which they are more invested in. Fey societies are decently egalitarian for a few reasons: Fey society emerged in the Feywild isolated from non-fey and fey magical talent is such that they can live comfortably in the wilderness completely isolated from civilization. So fey societies had to start out as egalitarian because of the voluntary nature of citizenship. Fey birth rates are so low that food and other basic resources have also never been scarce for them. Having great foresight by virtue of their psychology/lifespan most fey have long since been binding themselves into an ancient compact to do everything in their power to destroy anyone attempting to enslave fey. So trying to kidnap fey kids means assassination attempts from the majority of powerful spellcasters in existence (who would never otherwise cooperate).

  The control over their own body/mind can be used to enslave them even further by forcing them to use Pavlovian conditioning on themselves until they are willingly obedient and loyal.

This probably wouldn't work for the same reasons brainwashing people who know what you're doing doesn't work in real life. Conditioning doesn't seem likely to have a dramatic effect if being self-applied by someone who actively wants it to fail.

  Also can Fey hybridize with humans? It seem like their may be room for exploits if part Fey can do stuff like pass for fey but not be bound by oaths, or pretend to be human and make secret Oaths to themselves.
#+end_quote

They can hybridize with humans but essentially never do for cultural reasons. Fey intrinsically despise those who break contracts and lie (though they don't care as much about "white lies", though they consider them the mark of an inferior culture). Fey social etiquette is also so weird that non-fey will always be uncouth outsiders and this sort of incomprehensible etiquette always arises as a consequence of fey's alien psychology.\\
Anyway fey can't blend in well in human society without illusions (which human mages can detect) because they are all extremely attractive (or blatantly inhuman) and possessing of an otherworldly grace almost no human could hope to match through training. Fey also have vulnerability to cold iron (metal not significantly heated within the earth/feywilds magnetic/magical field) which is the only way to disable their powers. This is important because otherwise fey empires would have no reliable way of imprisoning criminals. These empires produce essentially all cold iron (which requires magical space stations) and forbid giving it to non-fey upon pain of death.
