Your anti-slavery method is insufficient. Capture enemy fey babies, bind them with carefully worded oaths when they are old enough to speak, repeat with their babies and so on until you have an apartheid society with top level fey that take all the standard anti-slavery oaths as children, mid-tier fey that are mostly enslaved as a child with a few escape clauses to stop them from being carelessly destroyed by the top tier and to give them incentive to cooperate, and bottom caste fey that get brutally used freely with ridiculously horrific oaths forced on them as children.

The control over their own body/mind can be used to enslave them even further by forcing them to use Pavlovian conditioning on themselves until they are willingly obedient and loyal.

The Fey don't need a lot of the cultural/societal technology that humans do to do stuff like go to war or organize on large scales, this might actually be a disadvantage in the long run, because they wouldn't develop institutions and conventions that are useful beyond the immediate needs they fulfill.

Also can Fey hybridize with humans? It seem like their may be room for exploits if part Fey can do stuff like pass for fey but not be bound by oaths, or pretend to be human and make secret Oaths to themselves.
