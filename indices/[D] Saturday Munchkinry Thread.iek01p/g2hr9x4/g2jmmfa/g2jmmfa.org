One of the most interesting consequences that might arise from this is an extremely important social role that is basically a genuine "benevolent dictator", that swear an extremely complex and restrictive system of oaths that bind them to extreme epistemic standards, and requiring any order they give to be /proven/ beneficial to all of fey-kind to some very high standard, and also swearing genuine 100% benevolence and selflessness etc. and before they can be given this status they must swear a bunch of oaths proving that the initial state is not pathological. In return, /every/ fey would swear to follow /any/ order from this role.

Since the fey is given up their free will, and has to act /maximally selflessly/, and spend centuries or millennia with maximally efficient scholarship and calculations, effectively being a slave, this might be a temporary state with a term length of say 1000 years. Only the most altruistic that felt the calling, or who needed to atone for something horrific, would do it. Still, at any given time there'd be a fair amount of them, and no concept of jurisdiction, since the oaths are designed to work with Aumann's agreement theorem. The aesthetic styling would be more shoolars, wisemen, and shamans than leaders of any kind.

Probably the most important things they' do is study the subtleties of how oaths work, and writing lawbook-length oath systems that all fey can swear safely. But they'd also make most of the stuff here redundant; you don't need a /specific/ oath against slavery if this social role exists to give an order to do the mass attacking, and it'd unlike lots of individual contingency oaths work for arbitrary unforeseen threats or when multiple threats have to be prioritized.

After a few thousand years of this, I'd expect the end result to look a lot like a single hivemind piloting multiple bodies, or at least a completely eusocial species. At the limit, exactly EVERY positive-sum interaction would happen, and no zero sum or negative-sum ones. Basically, all fey would have an exactly identical oath of maximizing utility according to something akin to the species coherent extrapolated volition, although probably implemented in a roundabout way rather than an actual number or any of those terms it would be mathematically isomorphic. As it is a highest-priority oath, and no two actions ever have the exact same expected utility, it effectively screens of all possibility of making further oaths and any other influence on their decisions of every kind.
