  What if they swore oath #2 while very drunk and not remembering (or misremembering) oath #1? Or what if the memory of oath #1 is surgically removed from their brain, and reattached after #2?

You can absolutely circumvent many oaths through mind control/memory manipulation, but fey intrinsically despise such behavior (both the prospect of doing it themselves, as well as anyone who actually does it) and all serious contracts are drafted to make this as difficult as possible (since you'd need to wipe your memory before taking the oath and then have somebody prepared to surprise and mind control you afterwards despite you after taking the oath making great efforts to avoid this).

Fey have eidetic memory for their oaths and a superhuman innate ability to foresee oath conflicts, because this trait is so central to their psychology. They are also incapable of making oaths they aren't confident they understand, which by instinct they never are if seriously impaired. They consequently can't make /logically/ incompatible oaths, because oaths only exist within one's mind so erasing it from memory /is/ erasing the oath, they aren't magic just a consequence of fey psychology.

When it comes to oaths which compete with each other for time/resources one usually prioritizes oaths through their design. For instance the oaths used to prevent one from being enslaved/coerced are made before all other oaths and disallow the creation of any future oaths which take priority over them. Thus there is generally a hierarchy of types of contract people will be bound under. I should note the example used in my question was overly simplified because all the contracts tend to be extremely lengthy having undergone intense scrutiny, with fey preferring to stick to preexisting well studied contracts whenever possible. Similarly nearly all contracts except the highest priority ones have escape clauses to limit their cost in the event of unforeseen consequences.\\
On occasions when one contract doesn't take clear priority over another however one is compelled to act in the way that balances them "equally" (which is a subjective judgement), but fey hate that sort of ambiguous room for interpretation and try to avoid such scenarios.
