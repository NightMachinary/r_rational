  Fey aren't capable of making oaths they don't intend to keep, which rules out contradictory oaths.
#+end_quote

What if they swore oath #2 while very drunk and not remembering (or misremembering) oath #1? Or what if the memory of oath #1 is surgically removed from their brain, and reattached after #2?

What if oaths #1 and #2 appeared compatible at the time, but later prove themselves incompatible?

What if #1 and #2 are not /absolutely logically incompatible/ but just both draw on your personal resources such that you sometimes have to (consciously or not) choose one to prioritise? As an extreme example, taking your "do everything in my power to kill anyone who tries such tactics against me" in its strictest sense would prevent you from swearing any other oath related to your future actions, because possibly someday you'll have to drop */everything/* to go on a murder quest.
