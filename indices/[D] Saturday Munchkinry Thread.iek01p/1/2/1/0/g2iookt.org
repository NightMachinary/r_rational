  Even with the additional constraints and initial condition vasudrake describes in response, it still seems like it is one clever and cruel leader from sliding into dystopian horror.

It's essentially a matter of which oaths spread first, because there are multiple stable equilibria.\\
I don't think the dystopian hell scenario is very likely to emerge for fey from an egalitarian hunter gatherer starting point though (which is the default if this trait is genetic).\\
If the nearby hunter gatherer fey see an early city state growing rapidly in power through slavery they have the foresight to know that kind of power will snowball. So any empire trying to utilize this kind of slavery is likely to be rapidly crushed by overwhelming numbers of other fey, who are after all clever and forward thinking.

Once most everyone is bound to destroy would-be fey enslavers then that equilibrium should be stable indefinitely unless there's some outside party which can afford to go to war with nearly all fey.
