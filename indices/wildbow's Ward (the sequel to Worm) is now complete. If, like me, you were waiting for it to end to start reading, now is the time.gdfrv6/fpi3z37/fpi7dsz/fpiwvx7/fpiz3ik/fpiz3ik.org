It's really not the same at all. The only serious power boosting that takes place in Worm is right near the end, with an interlude to set it up and for a power that we've never seen the base power level of, allowing the description within the story itself to be simple and easy to follow. Taylor's power changes so slightly and so simply that there's no seams to it. She gains the extra sense so gradually and her range expands so subtly, there's no comparison to the bullshit Ward pulls.

In Ward, powers will change multiple times, sometimes radically, never in an easy to follow sense. If it wasn't past midnight I'd list all the examples I can think of. Lord of Loss? His power is ridiculous and even boosts itself in a way that's orthogonal to Lung's. It's impossible to follow what he's doing half the time. The second time he fights Victoria he's kaiju-sized, something the narration has trouble getting across. At the end of that fight we learn it's thanks to teacher giving him a secondary thinker power, which just complicates the power further because a reader would've only then managed to accept his power can be that strong and still be within Victoria's weight class , only to have that contradicted immediately after.

I don't even want to get into the mess that are clusters in this story.
