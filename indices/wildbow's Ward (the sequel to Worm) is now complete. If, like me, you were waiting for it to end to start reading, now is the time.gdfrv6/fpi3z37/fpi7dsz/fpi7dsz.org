I'm actually going to contest this. I think one of Ward's biggest missteps is the scope creep when it comes to power boosting and power modification in general. Powers in ward do *NOT* behave consistently *AT ALL*. You can in fact expect that any power you see will work differently at some other point in the story, if not because of a Trump's involvement then because of shard mechanics.
