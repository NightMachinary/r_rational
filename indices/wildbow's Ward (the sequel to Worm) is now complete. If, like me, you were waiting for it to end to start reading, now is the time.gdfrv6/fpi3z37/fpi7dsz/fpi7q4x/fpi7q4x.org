I was thinking of putting some sort of asterisk in for that, but that sentence was already getting pretty gnarly.

As far as I can remember, every power behaves consistently except when acted on by a force. There's quite a lot more weird stuff going on with powers, as you point out, but it's not like classic superheroes where the amount of weight Superman can lift is several trains one day and the planet another.
