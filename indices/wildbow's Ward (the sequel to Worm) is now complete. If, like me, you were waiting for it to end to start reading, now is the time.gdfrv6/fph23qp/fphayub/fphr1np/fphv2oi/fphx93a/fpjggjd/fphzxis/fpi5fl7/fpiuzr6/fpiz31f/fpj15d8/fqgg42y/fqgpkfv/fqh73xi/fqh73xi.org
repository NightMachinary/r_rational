  Why would you do this when I already said I didn't care anymore and moved on?

I completely support not reading works you don't enjoy. If the story no longer gives you want you want out of it, it is definitely preferable to stop. If your comment was just about not wanting to read about rape or not liking the direction of the story I would not mind at all. I was responding because people take comments on the internet as fact, so pointing out when information is wrong is generally a good thing (obviously it's not really important what people think about webfiction, but we're here anyway).

  you can't just nitpick one detail and make an entire assumption out of it.

I'm glad that it was a miscommunication, but I still can't really think of any way to interpret "equivalent of a false rape accusation" and "not taking consent as seriously as he should have, regretting the act, and then victimizing himself" as anything other than "he wasn't really raped".

  The rape was the point where I stopped at because I didn't want to read about that in the first place, I didn't enjoy such a serious topic being carelessly toyed with like that, and I simply couldn't stomach the story anymore.

I can completely sympathize with not wanting to read a story with an arc like that, but I don't think it was handled carelessly by the author. I don't know exactly what you're referring to about "the way [Juniper] handled it wasn't as serious as it should have been, that he was a jackass about it, and that everything he did afterwards was terrible", but I can tell you that his reaction felt very similar to a friend's. People don't always act logically to trauma.
