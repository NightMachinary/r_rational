*SPOILERS FOR WTC BELOW*

Don't be sorry at all, I understand the feeling of a loved fic going bad. You bring up a lot of interesting points that quite frankly, I would need to do a lot of rereading to be able to fully engaged you on, so maybe I will do that. I do agree that fenns development and abrupt conclusion were surprising in an off putting way, but I went back for a quick re read and there were subtle (admittedly, maybe TOO subtle) references showing how Fenn was really tried of being treated as comic relief and not being taken seriously.

I agree with you on bethel, I don't think she is a redeemable character (despite the fact that I am horrified at what happened to her) and I'm glad she doesn't really seem to be in the story anymore. As for Joon, the more I read about him the more I see him as not a hero or MC, but just a dude, one I might not necessarily like if I met but not necessarily one I would hate either. Just a flawed human being, who's trying and sometimes failing to be morally and logistically consistent. I think empathize with that, because i don't often like myself either.

Last, it's kinda funny you say the world is a cardboard cutout, because I thought that was the whole point, explicitly confirmed by the One True God. That miiight just be deliberate and not a failing on the authors part.

I'm sorry to hear that WtC disappointed you though. I hope you've found other isekai fics that you enjoy. I would recommend Patchwork Realms by eaglejarl if you want a really quirky isekai litrpg. The main character is a dog(yup, really) that lucks into an epic tier skill, and that's all I'm going to say, in case you want to read it. Good luck!
