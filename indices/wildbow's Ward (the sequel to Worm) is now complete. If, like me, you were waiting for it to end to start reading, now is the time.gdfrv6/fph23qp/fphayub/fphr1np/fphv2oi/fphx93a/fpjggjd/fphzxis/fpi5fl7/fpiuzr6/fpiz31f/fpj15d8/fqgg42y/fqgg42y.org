I had a whole thing typed up correcting a couple factual misconceptions like how Joon unlocked the ability to use unicorn bones for the revision power after Fenn died, but then I reread your comment. Are you really saying it's a false rape accusation?

Joon literally says no 3 times before Beth rapes him. The third time:

  <Bethel, no,> I tried again. It felt good to kiss her, and I was fully erect, there was no doubt of that, but I hadn't actually decided that this was something that I wanted to do, and I felt a knot of fear forming, because she was more powerful than me, and if I said no, well, that was what I had been in the middle of thinking about when she'd interrupted me.

Just because something is physically pleasurable doesn't make it not rape. I don't know exactly where you're coming from with the statement, and maybe you've misremembered the chapter, but it really feels like someone saying "It couldn't be rape because she was wet".
