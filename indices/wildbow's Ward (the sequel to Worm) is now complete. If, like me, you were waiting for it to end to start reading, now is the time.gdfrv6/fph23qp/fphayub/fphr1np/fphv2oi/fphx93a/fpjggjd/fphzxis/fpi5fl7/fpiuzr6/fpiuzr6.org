Spoilers for WtC: It's been a few months now, so I might be a bit hazy on the details but I hated how Fenn's death was handled. I'll start with that because looking back it was sort of the turning point for me, I didn't have any complaints and I really enjoyed it up to that moment (even berated myself a bit mentally for not reading WtC sooner), but there was something about that whole event that felt so jarring and wrong. Like there was a lot of build up and a lot of time that went into setting up their relationship, and then they have a little fight and literally two chapters later she dies? And it's not just that, but her death barely seems to phase the MC at all, like there is a little arc of 'getting over it' and then they move on with their quest? The same quest that started with his friend's death? The one that influenced the whole fantasy world he is living in right now? The one he keeps having constant flashbacks to because of his regret and inability to move on? I wasn't a big fan of Fenn, and I didn't care THAT much for her, but it bothered me that her death didn't seem to matter as much as it should, like the author just disregarded one of the main themes he had been pushing for most of the fic and one of the biggest flaws of his own protagonist.

I sort of gave it a pass for that because I know WtC likes to get all meta and play around with tropes, so I stuck around to see if that would lead to some sort of subversion or anything interesting. I'm not sure when it happened, but I think it was a bit after the library arc (which imo was amazing) that I started to feel like the story wasn't hitting the same right spots that it had been hitting up to that point, it really felt like I was reading a fanfic of WtC rather than WtC itself. The pacing took a nosedive, unfunny references and memes started to crop up, the whole harem thing Fenn had pretty much undermined appeared again (which I somehow didn't enjoy in this story despite the fact harem, polyamory, and other unconventional forms of pairings are some of my biggest guilty pleasures), it also felt like a lot of characters lost depth and nuance and became cartoons of themselves. It was bizarre how the story as a whole seemed to tell you things, and then do others or have the complete opposite happen. I remember that scene where everyone gathers together and they resolve to not let themselves be manipulated by the narrative, taking the fight to the threats instead of letting them come to them, only for the MC to do anything but that so he could go to school, wtf? Then there was the cringy cannibal Shia Lebouf thing, Reimer appearing to deliver some exposition and then being written out, and then still magic.

One thing I enjoyed a lot about early WtC is that you could see, almost feel, the MC's progression, seeing him use what he learned or just anything he could to get by was cool and interesting. I think it's before the whole still magic incident happens that all of that is thrown away. There is this weird and unexplained power gap and suddenly he can do stuff he couldn't do before for no reason, and nothing bad he does seems to have any consequence. The narration keeps telling you that sacrificing a skill for a boost means MC will have a harder time training it back later, but that never seems to be the case and it never seems to matter. Still magic being introduced and then exploited means he doesn't even have to bother with that anymore, suddenly MC is OP and any semblance of 'midgame' or coherent power progression is entirely skipped. Oh, and don't forget about the unicorn bones he kept on using to save his life which he never used to save Fenn because...?

That was annoying, and many things I didn't mind before started to become increasingly annoying as well. I think at that point I sort of realized that there wasn't much of a 'world' planned out like I was led to believe and that every set piece and location existed as it was and there was little to no depth to it. The story tells you about a world that despite all of the chaos it has going on, it has a semblance of order that most of its inhabitants are used to by now. That's what you're told, but the truth is that things simply don't seem to exist until they're relevant, and once they're not relevant anymore they might as well stop existing. The dwarf city was a big example of that, it seemed to be such a big and important deal in earlier chapters, and then when they finally explore that part of the world it's just a cardboard cutout, and the same thing seemed to apply to everything else.

Things happen, scenes happen, and it really does feel like there is little thought and planning to them. Which this whole thing being based around a tabletop is to be expected to a point, but even then it's jarring, and everything feels fake.

I was bitter by the point the MC fights the infohazardous kaiju, none of the rules that had been established early seemed to matter anymore, there were no stakes because he had infinite revives thanks to the unicorn bones, and a lot of it felt like padding so we could get to the 'cool' scenes.

I stopped reading on the chapter when Bethel and Val leave. I can handle flawed protagonists, I prefer them way more than bland or self-insert ones, but the MC's morality and the inconsistency of it started to get on my nerves early on. Him turning on his friend over what he did to the sentient house, condemning him despite the fact that Arthur pretty much stopped the world from being a giant shithole several times, was disgusting, specially after how he pretty much forced Fenn to kill a lot of people so they could get to said house in the first place. And that's without mentioning all of the other people he turned his back on and died because of him.

I'm not one to get squeamish over violence, sex, or sexual violence, so I'm not one to get triggered over those topics (stuff like the fridge scene in Worm don't get much of a reaction out of me). But the whole rape thing in WtC and how it was handled sickened me, and to this day it's probably one of the most deplorable things I have read. Rape is a very serious thing for a lot of people, and whole it never affected me or anyone I know, to me it's still not something that should be treated lightly. The protagonist not taking consent as seriously as he should have, regretting the act, and then victimizing himself while taking a stance of moral superiority after the fact disgusted me and opened my eyes to what I was reading.

I was sold this story as an isekai with an interesting world and magic system that was also an exploration and subversion of common narrative tropes. I went into this expecting Mother of Learning but with some strange tabletop RPG spin on it. So why am I reading about the fantasy equivalent of a false rape allegation?

It wasn't what I wanted and what I enjoyed anymore, I wasn't getting 'anything' from it either, and I... I honestly didn't care about the characters anymore or what happened to them. So yeah, there is that, a very bitter feeling left. It's a real shame too because I was genuinely enjoying it, and then Fenn started acting OOC, died, and the fun survival adventure stopped being fun and reading became a chore that only kept making me even more annoyed and angry. I'm ashamed that it took me up to chapter 160 or so to realize that and finally drop it, maybe it got better, maybe it's even good and interesting now. But I don't care anymore, I moved on, I'm done with WtC.

Sorry for the rant.
