  tl;dr This review has some good points, but the general outlook is a seriously unhealthy way to consume media.

Dunno, seems about what I'd expect if someone went through three and a half million words and the last two million or so turned out to be a big disappointment. Doesn't seem very reasonable to expect someone to invest so much time into something and then not get /invested/ in it.

Getting some big GoT S8 vibes from all this.
