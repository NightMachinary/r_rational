Same here -- struggled my way through the prologue PHO (?) chapters as they were being released, but continued to be super bored as the main story continued. Was waiting until completion to see if anything improved, but the Weekly Rec Thread's review has dissuaded me.

Are there any good fanfics of Ward out yet? I found myself liking lots of Worm fanfics more than I did the actual Worm, so maybe I can glean the canon resolution to older plot threads and character arcs through derivative works.

Alternatively, were there any must-read standalone Ward interludes?
