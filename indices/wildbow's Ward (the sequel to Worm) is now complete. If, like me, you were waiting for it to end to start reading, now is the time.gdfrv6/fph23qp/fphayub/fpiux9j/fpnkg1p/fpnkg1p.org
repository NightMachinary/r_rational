I don't agree with the second spoiler - determinism doesn't mean your choices don't matter, and you can apply a similar reasoning here. Her being capable and doing the correct things are why she is integrated into the winning plan.

If you are the kind of person who thinks it doesnt matter what you do since it's predetermined you'll end up doing nothing and be useless. If you are the kind of person who still does their best and achieves things, things will be achieved.
