The Capricorn interludes ([[https://www.parahumans.net/2018/09/13/gleaming-interlude-9-x/][9.x]], [[https://www.parahumans.net/2018/09/13/gleaming-interlude-9-y/][9.y]], [[https://www.parahumans.net/2018/10/16/gleaming-interlude-9-z/][9.z]]) are some of the strongest chapters Wildbow has ever written.

I got bored of Ward partway through, but the extremely cinematic set pieces are still just as good as ever, and a few of the best scenes almost make the whole thing retroactively worth reading.
