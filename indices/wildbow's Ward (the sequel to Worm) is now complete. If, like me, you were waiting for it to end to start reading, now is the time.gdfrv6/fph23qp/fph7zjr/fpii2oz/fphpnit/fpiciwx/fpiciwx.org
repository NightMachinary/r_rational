I started reading it more than a year ago. Skipped past glow-worm after reading several pages of cryptic chatlogs. Started the first arc, was somewhat nonplussed by civilization looking pretty hunky-dory after the massive apocalypse at the end of Worm. Kept going to the end, learned Victoria was the hero, felt mild dismay since she struck me as a character whose dramatic potential had already been spent. Also, fairly boring powerset. Kept reading a couple more arcs, feeling increasing unease at the uneven narration and unclear story. Got to the part where she's having a dissociative flashback in the middle of a fight scene and thereby making both stories extremely difficult to follow, and decided I was done. It just wasn't fun. YMMV.
