I've seen some complaints is this thread that seem relevant:

- "if you like ward it won't be for the same reasons as worm" so maybe not? I started reading it, got caught up, and stopped, and there was some dark stuff, but not that much blood, but I didn't get very far in, and decided to start reading when it was over.
- Another complain I saw was that the fights were too bloodless (unlss

So, I'm not positive, but maybe it's not as "dark" if by dark you mean rivers of blood and such? Though I could see some potential for that, from where I got to. Remember the cults that worshipped the Endbringers? I think they show up in the story, and I don't know how that compares to s9 because I didn't get that far.
