It's highbrow in the sense that it doesn't try to capture you with the exciting "what if's" of power interactions, super hero fight scenes, one-dimensional injustice smiting, etc. that the setting lends itself to; even when these are present, they take a back seat to /internal/ struggle. WB seems to have wanted to take the fanbase that engaged with We've Got Worm and build this giant complex themepark for them.

It's higherbrow in the sense that while being in Taylor's head and centered within her powerset was compelling, Ward tried to create a compellingness from the characters themselves that didn't rely on the superpowers. And I think he succeeded, with several very memorable interludes.

But there's something to be said, that the Worm experience of interludes was "Oh no an interlude drawing me away from Taylor and the story, I'll post asking whether I can safely skip it" while the one here was "This Interlude was amazing and recontextualized so much!" There's more required of the reader, and the chapter to chapter payoff is a little bit less. He tried to build the story out of finer stuff, and a lot of people found it to be less filling.
