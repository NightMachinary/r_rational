Twig has a heavy focus on relationships between characters. It has a clear protagonist, but more than in WB's other works, you get invested in other characters than the one, and in the relationship between that protagonist and the other characters. It covers the largest time period of any of his works, and (arguably, given Ward) has its characters grow and change the most. It has the biggest mindfucks, unreliable narrator, of anything. It's setting is unique and I love its worldbuilding. The crimson blood-covered biopunk Victorian-esque/industrial revolution era Crown States. It is my favorite of his works.

Pact follows a protagonist who keeps fighting, and fighting, and fighting, despite accumulating personal costs (something common perhaps to all of his works) but in which those injuries are sustained and change the character and how the character has to deal with things. Its sort of an urban fantasy, with a bit in common with Mage: The Ascension, but very rooted in the protagonist's ignorance of all things arcane as they struggle to adapt and survive. I think that while Twig's big thing was the ensemble cast, relationships, and humor, Pact was more "rather than OP Taylor, we'll take a broken half-a-person with barely any power, give everything costs, and see what happens." There are elements of that that were kept for Twig, ones which weren't really present in Ward (where the main character, despite their various injuries, wasn't moved all that far by them). A lot of people didn't stick with Pact when Worm ended (it was an entirely different story), and WB had personal stuff going on that kept it from being what he wanted, and the community at the time was afflicted by a meme that pervades to this day that Pact is hard to get through due to never-ending escalation and tension which I really don't see; Pact has long been "known" to be WB's "weakest" work, and I disagree with that, and it's my understanding that WB has come around to like it more as time has gone on, despite being fairly down about it at Pact's conclusion.
