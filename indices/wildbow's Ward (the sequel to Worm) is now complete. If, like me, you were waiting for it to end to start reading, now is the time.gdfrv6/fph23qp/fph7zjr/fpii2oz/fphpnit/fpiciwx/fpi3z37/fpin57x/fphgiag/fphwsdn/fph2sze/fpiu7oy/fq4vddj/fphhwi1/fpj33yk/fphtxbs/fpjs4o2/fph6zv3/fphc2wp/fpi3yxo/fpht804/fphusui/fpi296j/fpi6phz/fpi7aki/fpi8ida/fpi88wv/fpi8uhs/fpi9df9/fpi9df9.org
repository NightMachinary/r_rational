I mean yes, but New Wave is outside the PRT system and probably wouldn't have dedicated M/S testing protocols, so I'm wondering again how she'd tell. All the people who live with Vicky already did before Amy triggered, so she wouldn't have a before/after.

Wonder if Amy ever really looked at Dean...

Edit: I mean, "my sister is a Master who makes people love her, and I'm exposed to her unreliable power every day, but it's okay, I'm immune."

"So you don't want to bang her?"

"Oh of course I do, I'm in massive unrequited lesbians with her. But it's not her fault, because it can't be, because she's so beautiful and good, and is also literally the only source of positivity in my life. Not mastered!"
