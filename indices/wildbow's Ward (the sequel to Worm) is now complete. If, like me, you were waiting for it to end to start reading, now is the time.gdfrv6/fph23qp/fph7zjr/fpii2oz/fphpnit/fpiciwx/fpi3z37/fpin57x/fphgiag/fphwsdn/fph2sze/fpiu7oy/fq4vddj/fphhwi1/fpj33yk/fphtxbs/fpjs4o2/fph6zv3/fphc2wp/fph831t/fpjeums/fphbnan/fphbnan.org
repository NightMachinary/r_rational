Amy was done dirty in Ward. Any moral ambiguity regarding her circumstances was thrown out the window and the worst takes you could possibly have about her personality and the things she did is what her entire character becomes. It's like the author was personally offended that people felt sorry for her and set out to make her as unlikable as possible in the sequel.
