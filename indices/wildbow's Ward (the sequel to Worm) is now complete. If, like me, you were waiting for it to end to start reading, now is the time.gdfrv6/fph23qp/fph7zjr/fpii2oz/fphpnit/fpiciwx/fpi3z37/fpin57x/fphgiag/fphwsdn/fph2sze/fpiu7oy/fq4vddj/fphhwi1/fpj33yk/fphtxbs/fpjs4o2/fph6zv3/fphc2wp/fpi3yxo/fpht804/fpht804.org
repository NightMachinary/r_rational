Worm never directly explains this, instead you have to read between the lines through Carol's interlude with Amy's explanation. And even then you have to assume the worst possibility through the ambiguity. Considering that just getting through Taylor's rationalization was too hard for a major portion of the original fandom, expecting them to understand Amy without having it spelled out is an unreasonable expectation on the part of the author. And given that softer interpretations had years to develop and spread, spelling it out in the sequel was bound to get some backlash.
