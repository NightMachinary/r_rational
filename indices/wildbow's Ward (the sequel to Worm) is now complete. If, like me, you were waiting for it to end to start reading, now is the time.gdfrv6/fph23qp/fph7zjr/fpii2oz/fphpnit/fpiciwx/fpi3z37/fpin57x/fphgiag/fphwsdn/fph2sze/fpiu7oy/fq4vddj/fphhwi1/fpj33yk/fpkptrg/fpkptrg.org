It's more focused on inflicting emotional pain on the characters than Worm is. I don't think there's anything as physically nightmarish as Worm's fridge scene in the S9 arc, but there's still a lot of pain, injury, body horror, and violations of autonomy. Then on the emotional side, first person perspective PTSD flashbacks are just par for the course.

Definitely not the most comfortable thing to read, and worth avoiding if the state of the world is getting to you.

If you're looking for something lighter and haven't read Mother Of Learning yet, I'd give that a shot. It's very low-stakes yet still quite compelling.
