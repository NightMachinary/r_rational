I dropped Ward after I reread parts of Worm and remembered how much I hate Victoria Dallon. I'm not sure there's really anything he could do to get me past that. She's not a bad character, but she is a terrible person and I don't really want to read a book about her.

Then again I also love Amy; she is a precious bean who deserved better than she got.

Also Kenzie needs absolutely all of the hugs. I mean so do most of her team but wow is almost everyone around her awful.
