There is a very big and real complaint in that Ward undoes a lot of the seeming successes of the epilogue of Worm off screen prior to its start... like if you were expecting Yamada to continue being a super effective therapist and Dragon to rebuild everything with Tinker tech goodness and Tattletale to have a significant and important role in the alternate world city she had a major role in founding prepare to be disappointed. This might be okay yet somehow the city has been built to sprawling proportions with very little power usage (we are explicitly told most powers are bad at constructive usages) in a way that maybe works as thematic commentary about societies' goals but doesn't work from a logistical standpoint.
