The worldbuilding in Ward was insane in my opinion. The bizarre giant city setting wasn't even slightly believable as post golden morning. The weird amnesty everyone but there are still criminals but they don't seem to commit crimes? Amnesty even clones of slaughterhouse 9 members created to end the world, and the fucking endbringer cultists. Weirdly retcon the Fallen so they are slightly disreputable rather than endbringer cultists. Vicky tries to argue someone out of joining the Fallen but doesn't think to mention they are endbringer cultists who burn down malls for jollies.

Then there is Vicky's character(In the first few arcs). She refuses to join some hero team because they hire racists, so she joins a team with a racist only there to use the nutters as human shields and a slaughterhouse 9 member only there to convert the autistic girl to villainy.

Also I'm half convinced Glowworm was a producers-esque scheme to murder Ward's hype. Reading it felt like debugging code, I've never had to read something so closely to follow it. Then there was no point because all the characters it introduced were introduced normally in the actual story.
