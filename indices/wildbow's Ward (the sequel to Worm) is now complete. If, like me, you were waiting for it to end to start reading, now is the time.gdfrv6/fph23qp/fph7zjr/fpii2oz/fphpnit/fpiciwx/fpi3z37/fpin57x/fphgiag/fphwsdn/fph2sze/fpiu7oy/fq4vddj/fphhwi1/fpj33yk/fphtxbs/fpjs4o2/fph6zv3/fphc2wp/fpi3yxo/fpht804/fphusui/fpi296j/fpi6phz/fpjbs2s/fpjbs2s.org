  edit: Hang on is GG's aura leakage canon or fanon?
#+end_quote

Depends. The part where it has some small effect may be canon. But the part where it makes people GG-sexual through exposure is a mix of fanon an just another one of Amy's endless bullshit excuses. Or to put it differently, not a single other member of Victoria's family is attracted to her.

Also, the involuntary sexuality change at that first pivotal touch is not what people mean by rape.
