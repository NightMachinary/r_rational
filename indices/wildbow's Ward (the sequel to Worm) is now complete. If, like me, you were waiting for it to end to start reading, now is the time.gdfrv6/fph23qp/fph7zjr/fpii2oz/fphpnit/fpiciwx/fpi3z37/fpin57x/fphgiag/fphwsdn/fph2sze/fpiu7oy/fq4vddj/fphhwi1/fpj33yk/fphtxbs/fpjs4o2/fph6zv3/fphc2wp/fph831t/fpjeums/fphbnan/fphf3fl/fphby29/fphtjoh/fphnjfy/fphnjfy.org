No, Amy's core problem was just that she couldn't bring herself to actually accept responsibility for her actions. I've had the misfortune of dealing with people who were the same way. It's like that Friends meme irl, they'll agree with each individual line of reasoning inexorably proving that they acted wrongly, and then conclude "and it wasn't my fault!" And it can lie dormant for /years/, never realizing they were that sort of person until they've done something atrocious and you get to have that baffling, incomprehensible conversation. For the sort of person who posts here, if you ever have to have that discussion, it will make you doubt the other person qualifies as /people/. My best guess for what's going on under the hood is something like "Ego Protection beats the piss out of Internal Consistency Checker".

Shit, the one I knew irl even ran off and got the stupid tattoos. If anything, Amy hit too close to home.
