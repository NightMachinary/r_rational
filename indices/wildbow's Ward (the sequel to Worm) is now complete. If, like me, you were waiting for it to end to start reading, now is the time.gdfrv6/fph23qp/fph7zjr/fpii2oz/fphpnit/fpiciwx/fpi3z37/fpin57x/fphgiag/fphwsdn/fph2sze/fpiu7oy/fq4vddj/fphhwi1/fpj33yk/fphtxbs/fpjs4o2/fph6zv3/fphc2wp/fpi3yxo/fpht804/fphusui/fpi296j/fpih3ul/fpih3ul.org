I mean Carol never seems to fully make the connection in her interlude. It's up to the reader to infer what Amy meant, and as bad as messing with her biology is, rape (and not just rape but flesh blob rape) is another step further that the reader might not want to consider. As crappy a person as Amy had been earlier in Worm, rape seems like a step further.
