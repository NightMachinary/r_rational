I quit because the world wasn't believable anymore.

The whole "How do superheroes make money?" question was glossed over in Worm but at least somewhat explained by Crime and the quasi public nature of the protectorate.

In Ward, a post apocalyptic society apparently still pays money for spandex clad heroes and it makes no sense.

Additionally, the fights with powers were way too bloodless. At the end of Worm, Manton limits are generally eliminated. Reading the fights in Ward was like reading about two people getting into a chainsaw fight and having no blood.

Also, no one is willing to kill. Nursery's power is literally filling the room with Cronenberg babies and having them rape your face. She does this to Victoria and Victoria is super blase about it. Such a person would have a kill order on them after doing this dozens of times.
