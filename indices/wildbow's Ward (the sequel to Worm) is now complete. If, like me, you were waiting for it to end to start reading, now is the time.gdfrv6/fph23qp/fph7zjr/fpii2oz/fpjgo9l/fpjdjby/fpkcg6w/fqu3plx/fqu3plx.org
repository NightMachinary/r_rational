+1, the biggest reason by far for me to drop a story is that if there is a character I am supposed to like from the way that the author is handling them, and I would immediately kill that character for the good of the fictional world they inhabit given the chance, then I can't enjoy the story. I despise The Godfather and movies like it for the same reason.
