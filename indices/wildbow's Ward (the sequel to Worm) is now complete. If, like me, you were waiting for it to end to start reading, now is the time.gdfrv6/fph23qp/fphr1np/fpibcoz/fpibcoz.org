  Just try to read Ward and give up if you don't like it. It's just a fucking book.

It's a book that's /two million words long/. That's a lot of time investment for something that ends up being disappointing. If, for example, you bail 25% of the way through you could have instead read /all of War and Peace/. It is not unreasonable to exercise a higher level of discretion about that kind of time investment, or to feel upset if you make it and it seems wasted.
