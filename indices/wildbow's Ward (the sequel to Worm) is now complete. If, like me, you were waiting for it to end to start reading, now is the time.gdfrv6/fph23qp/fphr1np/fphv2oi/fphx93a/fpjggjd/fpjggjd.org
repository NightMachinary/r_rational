There's something you probably don't take into account here: huge reserves of faith in the author after reading Worm. This was the sole reason why I didn't abandon Ward. And I think the linked review is pretty accurate, probably it wouldn't be as negative if the reviewer abandoned the story earlier, but it was also my impression that it was getting progressively worse towards the end.
