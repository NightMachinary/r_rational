Ah yeah, I did this with WtC when I realized I wasn't enjoying it anymore, and even then I was left feeling so bitter it took a lot of willpower to not start ranting online about it.

It's hard to walk away from something that you had a lot of hopes for, specially if it's something that kind of proved itself to you or you thought had a good track record. I guess what I mean to say is that regardless of the sub we are in, we're still people, with all our flaws, and there is no button to instantly purge all biases and negative feelings and thoughts that might remain.

That guy's disrecommendation doesn't exist in some sort of fully rational and unbiased void, and neither do all of the echo-chambery praises that started being sung in the Parahumans sub after Wildbow made his self-deprecating comment last week. Both are equally valid, and I don't think being dismissive of the points being presented because either side has strong feelings about it serves the actual discussion.

Let's stay on topic and talk about Ward itself, and not about what an internet stranger's feelings are towards Ward's author.
