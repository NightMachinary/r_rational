Holy crap, that's... a really strong take.

I mean, this:

#+begin_quote
  People have various complaints about Worm [...]. But these problems are all small, petty, easy to work past to appreciate a well-told epic. They're nothing in comparison to the problems that define and pervade Ward. Ward's problems aren't subjective quibbles with how clearly some scene was written. They're basic errors in the writing process, [...] problems that have metastasized to the story's outline and style. The story is fundamentally and fractally half-baked.

seems to me like the reviewer got way too attached to the original and saw something that wasn't really there?

I'm not going to do a point-by-point counter-review, because I think these get tedious and petty fast. But I really want to comment on the general approach. Parts like these:

#+begin_quote
  We hear it said explicitly that the apocalypse killed something like 90% of humans and something like 99% of parahumans. But the actual story certainly doesn't act like it; /the fucking apocalypse/ never stands in the way of bringing a character back from Worm.

  But somewhere early on, Ward got into its head that worldbuilding is masturbatory nonsense for rationalist nerds (which is a shame, because Wildbow excels at it when he's trying, which he usually is), so it dropped all of these threads; nothing was honestly examined or went anywhere. Instead, Ward concerns itself first and foremost with characterization. That's the defense that Ward's proponents generally give,

  An addict's house may be full of syringes, but that doesn't mean she's better at using them than a nurse. Ward spends much of its nearly two-million word (!) duration on highly introspective internal monologues and inane navel-contemplating small-talk between characters; after a point, it's just polishing something it's already completely worn away.

  and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect"

  because whiny fans treated tension and stakes as writing flaws and the writer was desperate to win their approval back just for a moment

are ridiculously angry and abrasive and uncharitable.

*tl;dr This review has some good points, but the general outlook is a seriously unhealthy way to consume media.*

Just try to read Ward and give up if you don't like it. It's just a fucking book.
