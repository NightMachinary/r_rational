That puts you at the end of arc 14 out of 20, or 75% of the way through. If you got to the confrontation with Amy there, I think that might be the high point of the book.

If you enjoyed it up to there I think it's worth finishing. It introduces some interesting new elements, though I think it gets bogged down in too much giant monster fighting.

The ending is a bit weak though, if that's what you're holding out for.
