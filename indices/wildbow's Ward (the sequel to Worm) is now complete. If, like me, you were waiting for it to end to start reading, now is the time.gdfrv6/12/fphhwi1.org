Does it get any better? I've started it 3 times, reading 20-30 chapters on the longest read. Every choice in that story from the protagonist, behaviour, tone, style, plot etc. run so counter to Worm (which is my favorite work) that it almost feels like it comes from the same sequel school as Aladin 2, Jason X, Jaws: The Revenge, Son of the Mask, Mulan 2 etc.

Edit: From reading comments - it doesn't. :/
