  Ward is great, but it is also higher brow

Strong disagree. Ward is "higher-brow" than Worm only in the senses in which being "higher-brow" is a bad thing. Ward isn't a smarter story than Worm; it's a much dumber story that sees Worm's strengths as beneath it. See my review in the week's recommendation thread.
