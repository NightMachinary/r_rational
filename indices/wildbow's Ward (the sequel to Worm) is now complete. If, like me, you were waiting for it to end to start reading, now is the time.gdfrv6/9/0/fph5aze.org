It has really powerful moments, particularly in the Interludes. But it is not something you would read for the same reasons one read Worm. Worm was a lot easier to Consume, and it had a significantly simpler structure which could pull you along throughout. Ward is great, but it is also higher brow and a lot of the Worm fans who disappeared for Pact and Twig and came back for Worm2 were disappointed throughout when Worm2 never materialized.
