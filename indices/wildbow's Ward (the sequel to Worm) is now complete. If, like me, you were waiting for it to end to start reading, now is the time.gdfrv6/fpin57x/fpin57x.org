I finished it, more as a factor of taking my mind of panic attacks than enjoyment, mostly without reading the comments. I really see it as a continuation of the progressing problems in Worm. As Worm went on, it seemed to get more and more bloated, particularly the fight scenes. This was partially ameliorated by several factors: I wasn't reading it while it was coming out; Taylor's powerset is really, really interesting; and secrets about the setting were being revealed. The normal fightscenes were broken up by Endbringer attacks, which were unique, hugely dangerous, a change of pace, and used relatively sparingly. The setting in general was fresh enough, dystopian superhero.

​

Ward really took away a lot of those supports. Victoria's powers aren't that interesting. The most important secrets had been revealed. And the setting is wildly inconsistent. It starts with an interesting rebuilding society kind of setting, but it feels like Wildbow got bored/ didnt't like it, so it all went to shit again. As this was going on, the fight scenes got more and more bloated. Some of the sections, like March, the Family, and the Assault on Teacher's Compound just got boring. There was also an expectation that you would care about all these minor characters, some of whom changed their name since the Worm days. I also don't think most of the characters showed development. To me, the characters feel mostly static.

​

This all adds up to incredibly inconsistent themes. Worm has an internal and external descent into darkness driven by the main character's need for control. Ward is clearly supposed to be about characters getting better, becoming more whole, and breaking cycles. You don't see this in the plot, setting, or characters until there's a rush at the very end.

​

So you're left with a book where a lot of stuff happens, there are fights against people that don't matter, and the fights that do are too long. I had little emotional connection to any of it. Don't read it. It's not terrible, but it's not worth it.
