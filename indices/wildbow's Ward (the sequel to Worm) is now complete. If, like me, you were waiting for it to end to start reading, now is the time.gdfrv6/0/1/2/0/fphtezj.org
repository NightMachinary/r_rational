There is this

  This is an aside, but I blame a large part of Ward's disdain for worldbuilding (also known as "being set in a world that attempts to make sense") on Doof! Media. In the months running up to the start of Ward, a popular liveblog-type podcast called "We've Got Worm" sprung up and became extremely influential in the parts of the fandom closest to Wildbow; he even became a frequent listener and participant in the post-podcast discussions. It was well-produced and well-done all around, and in a very difficult-to-replicate way, it brought a fresh perspective and fascinating analysis to Worm. But the host responsible for much of this, Scott Daly, was very much of the mindset "well, I don't care about worldbuilding, because I'm not some fucking nerd, I'm here for all that other good stuff in writing, like character arcs". That's a valid lens for an individual reader to take in a project like that, but Wildbow wound up hearing a lot of Scott. I mean, the guys make a long professional podcast devoted entirely to relentlessly praising a particular artist; it's not a surprise that the artist would wind up hearing a lot of it. And then, when Ward started, the We've Got Worm guys moved onto Ward, and the podcast became something very different - much less meritorious, but still very popular, effectively a glorified recap podcast endlessly pumping out content each week just describing what happened last week. And it became a literal feedback loop - Wildbow hearing a constant drone of "you're great, you're perfect, I love this unconditionally, you're so good at characters, your shit is golden, but we don't care about worldbuilding, Wildbow, I love this, we don't care about worldbuilding at all, we're not fucking nerds, Wildbow, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter at all..."

A whole thing dedicated to one of the members of a podcast that does a recap of the series... liking something different than he does about it?
