  Ward is the kind of story that gives a secondary character a dramatic, wonderfully-executed death at the hands of a fresh, fascinating, brilliant antagonist, but then the fans throw a collective bitchfit that pierces the heavens, because the character who died was a fan-favorite from Worm, so he brings the character back a few chapters later, literally doing what a facetious meme had suggested, reasoning that we hadn't seen the body, even though her death was from the perspective of an alien with local omniscience in charge of blowing her up. The bullshit-soap-opera-retcon-resurrected fan favorite then proceeds to kill the interesting new antagonist who had originally killed her, in order to secure cheap cathartic revenge on the fandom's behalf.

  a protagonist whose character revolves around the time she was raped

  "whelp, what I'm doing is like a cross between the way Hitler committed genocide and the way Hitler killed himself, hmm, oh well, still gotta do it"

  having other people say things like "aw, geez, Victoria, I don't want to die, also, I'm a big mean uglyface" and "okay, I guess I'm really depressed lately, so it's probably okay if you throw me on the suicide pile" and "I'm trans and really dissatisfied with my body so totally, go for it, it is okay for me to die"
