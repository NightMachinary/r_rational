>(admittedly, maybe TOO subtle)

This sounds super subjective I thought the signposting with things like repeated mentions of washathar and Joon aggressively shutting down uncomfortable conversations with her was a bit obnoxious in how obvious it was being and nothing that happened was the least bit shocking as a consequence. Similarly the idea that the story quickly moved past this when the consequences still loom large and she's getting explicitly bought up every other chapter alongside speculation on how to get her back is pretty crazy to me.
