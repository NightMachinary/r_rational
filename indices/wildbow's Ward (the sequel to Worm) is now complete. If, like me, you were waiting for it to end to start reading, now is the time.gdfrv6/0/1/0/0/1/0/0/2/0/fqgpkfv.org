  I had a whole thing typed up correcting a couple factual misconceptions like how Joon unlocked the ability to use unicorn bones for the revision power after Fenn died

Why would you do this when I already said I didn't care anymore and moved on? They asked for my reasons and I gave them, whether they're accurate or not doesn't matter, they were the reasons I had at the time I stopped reading and the knowing facts won't reverse time and undo my decision or change my opinion.

  Are you really saying it's a false rape accusation?
#+end_quote

No, I'm not, even in the text you quoted it's pretty much explicitly stated that the MC was raped. I'm not stupid, and you shouldn't assume I'm some sort of rape apologist just because I don't enjoy the story anymore or am not as invested as you are.

To quote what I said before:

#+begin_quote
  I was sold this story as an isekai with an interesting world and magic system that was also an exploration and subversion of common narrative tropes. I went into this expecting Mother of Learning but with some strange tabletop RPG spin on it. So why am I reading about the fantasy equivalent of a false rape allegation?
#+end_quote

Context matters, you can't just nitpick one detail and make an entire assumption out of it. The point was that I didn't want to read about rape at all, that I had different expectations and reading about rape wasn't one of them.

Also, as far as I remember this isn't wrong either

#+begin_quote
  The protagonist not taking consent as seriously as he should have, regretting the act, and then victimizing himself while taking a stance of moral superiority after the fact disgusted me and opened my eyes to what I was reading.
#+end_quote

The protagonist was raped, yes, but that doesn't take away that the way he handled it wasn't as serious as it should have been, that he was a jackass about it, and that everything he did afterwards was terrible. But that's his character, this is how Fenn's death was handled, or his murder in the library, or him causing a whole exclusion zone.

The rape was the point where I stopped at because I didn't want to read about that in the first place, I didn't enjoy such a serious topic being carelessly toyed with like that, and I simply couldn't stomach the story anymore.
