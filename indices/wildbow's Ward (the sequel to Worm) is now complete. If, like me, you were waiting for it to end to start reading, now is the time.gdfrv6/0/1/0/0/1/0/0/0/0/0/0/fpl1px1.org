Yeah that's what I remember happening. Sound and silence felt a lot like a crime thriller followed by one drawn out action scene with little introspection in general (except Joon zoning out twice in class I think). Still she's effectively replaced Arthur as the crux of the plot if my reading is right. Joon is rushing the end boss because his hung up on that dream he had as much as anything. She's kinda on par with ending the hells in importance so I really don't see her as a dropped plot thread.
