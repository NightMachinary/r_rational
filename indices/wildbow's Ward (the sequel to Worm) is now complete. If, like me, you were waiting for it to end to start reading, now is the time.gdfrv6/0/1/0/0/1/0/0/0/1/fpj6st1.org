  I see him as not a hero or MC, but just a dude, one I might not necessarily like if I met but not necessarily one I would hate either. Just a flawed human being, who's trying and sometimes failing to be morally and logistically consistent.

I see a lot of things like these in WtC, and I get it and appreciate it for what it is. But there is a mark that is missed, or some balance that is not quite met. But that could be on me, perhaps I can't stomach characters that are too flawed and don't show as much progress as I believe they should. Either that or something being unique and interesting isn't enough 'payoff' by itself and I need it to reach a certain level of narrative satisfaction. Something to introspect about I guess.

  Last, it's kinda funny you say the world is a cardboard cutout, because I thought that was the whole point, explicitly confirmed by the One True God. That miiight just be deliberate and not a failing on the authors part.

Yes, I contemplated this briefly during the part where the MC wondered what would have happened if he never met Amaryllis and instead saved that other girl at the beginning, if she would have turned into Amaryllis instead. The world being tailored to him and to his present is a neat idea, one that probably went against the expectations I had at the beginning, those probably being a fairly more traditional storytelling and worldbuilding.

  I hope you've found other isekai fics that you enjoy

I started Lord of the Mysteries last week and I love it! The first eleven or so chapters can drag a bit, but once it gets going it's great. Isekai to a fantasy world full of SCP objects and other 'mysterious' beings. It's an engaging read if you can get past the rough translation.

I'll definitely check it out. I'm still fairly new to the Isekai and litrpg genres, so I'm not that big on it, but I'll read anything so long as it is interesting or amusing :P Thanks for the recommendation!
