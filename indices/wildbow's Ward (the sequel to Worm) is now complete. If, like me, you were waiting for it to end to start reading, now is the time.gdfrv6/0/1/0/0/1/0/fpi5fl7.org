Oh I should've mentioned: I agree with the review where they said that Ward heavily prioritizes character development over plot and worldbuilding, and suffers for it as a result- that was essentially the reason I stopped reading Ward in the first place, because it just wasn't compelling enough as a story to keep me hooked.

I just wanted to point out that everything else, especially the post's analysis of Wildbow's intentions and his last post should be taken with a significant grain of salt.

On an unrelated note, I'm sorry to hear you don't like WtC, I still enjoy reading it (though not quite as much as in the beginning). What were your reasons for stopping?
