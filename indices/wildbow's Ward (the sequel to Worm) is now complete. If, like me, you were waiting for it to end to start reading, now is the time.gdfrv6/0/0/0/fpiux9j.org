Try starting at arc 19 or 20. Victoria gets her shit together and being inside her head is not as dreadful after her time in shardspace.

That review is not a fair review. It spends half its time on tangents, and half the remaining time on extraneous bs, such as worm having focused on a group of characters who survived scion and how the fact that the ward mc sometimes chooses to stick with familiar faces is somehow illogical or inherently makes the story bad.

90% of the "review" isn't even a review so much as filler but that's beside the point. Ward's problem is the same as Worm's problem: the fact that the MC has no way to affect the outcome of the ending except by being the puppet enacting Contessa's will. Or in other words the existence of a character whose superpower is "always win at everything as long as you're somewhat careful." The rest of both stories was just an in-depth case study of the internal monologues of trauma survivors and Taylor happens to have her shit together to a greater extent theoughout Worm than Victoria does in most of Ward. Where ward and worm differ is that Taylor loses her shit at the climax while Victoria collects her shit at the climax.
