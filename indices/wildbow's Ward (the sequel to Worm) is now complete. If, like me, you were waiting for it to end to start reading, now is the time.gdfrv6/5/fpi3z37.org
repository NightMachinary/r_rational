(crossposting my review from the rec thread, since the other one is pretty over the top)

Ward is very good in a lot of ways, but still flawed. The characterization in Worm was great, yet Ward's is still much better. Ward's pacing problems are even worse than in Worm, but in new, more nuanced ways that make them even more aggravating. And the focus has changed significantly, which will leave a lot of fans behind.

If you enjoyed Worm for the clever interactions between simply drawn powers, you won't find any of that here; powers still behave in a consistent manner and interact properly, but none of them have simple explanations like "Controls bugs" or "Sensory deprivation smoke," and the details of power interactions matter a lot less when your main character has to solve most things by punching them. If you enjoyed it for epic monster fights and play by plays of combats, I can't tell you whether it's gotten any better, because I found it dull both times around (but I can at least tell you that the biggest monster to punch is smaller in Ward).

If you enjoyed Worm for parsing Taylor's self-oblivious and extremely biased point of view, you'll probably enjoy Victoria's shaky self-awareness and half-constructed attempts to be impartial even more, but if you didn't notice that part of Worm then you're going to be missing a huge chunk of this story. And as I mentioned before, the characterization really has grown, so if that's what you're here for, you'll have a good time - Breakthrough are much more believably real, traumatized people, especially compared to the Undersiders who mostly exist as one or two character traits drawn to a maximum. I was impressed the first time around when Wildbow would spend an interlude writing a convincing POV of a dog, but now his writing has the nuance to characterize as just much difference in thought process just by using people that lie within human norms.

The biggest problem with Ward though is the pacing. After spending several arcs slowly working through characterization and inter-character conflicts, Wildbow folded to fan pressure and started smashing people into combat trial after combat trial. After the first one, they rarely have the buildup time they need before the punching starts. And many of the combats go on until the fans get bored of the excessive slog of combat, then rather abruptly stop, only for the slow inter-character part of the work to return until some segment of the fanbase gets bored of it, and then suddenly lurching into more superpowered fistfights. I'm obviously on the side that it'd be better if it stuck to being mostly character-based, but the sudden lurching back and forth between the two modes didn't do a service to anyone.
