Worm powers vary in some small degree based on emotional state and repeated exposure to trigger-like conditions, but nowhere near to the extent that they vary in Ward due to external factors that never feel solid or predictable. There's even an entire fight resolved by the fine control a power-boosting Trump has over her power and how it allows her to render her opponent's power unpredictable and dangerous to themselves repeatedly and in novel ways.

What you're trying to argue is that just because it's a fact of the setting that small variance like Taylor's range fluctuating can be expected, that we should've expected something like cluster-draining and Teacher all along, when the entire point of their inclusion is that small variance is not enough and external factors are involved.
