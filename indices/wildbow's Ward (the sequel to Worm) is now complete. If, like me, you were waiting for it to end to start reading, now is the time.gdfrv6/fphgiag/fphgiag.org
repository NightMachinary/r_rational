Are there payoffs to characters being successful in Ward? This was my main complaint in Worm/Pact, where the outcomes of each plot arc didn't really matter.

In some stories, there just isn't any tension because the authors are afraid to have the characters lose anything that is at stake. You know going in that nothing bad will happen, and so the tension is lost. Reading through Worm and Pact, it felt like the exact opposite was happening, but with the same effect. The results of each conflict didn't matter, because something would happen to make everything worse. Just as if everything gets fixed every time, the tension is entirely lost.
