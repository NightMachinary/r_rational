You didn't happen to read a lot of fanfiction, did you? Because it seems a lot of it made Amy a lot more sympathetic than the canon version.

Many people miss the part where Amy /didn't/ transform Victoria into an abomination while trying to heal her. According to her dialogue in Carol's interlude, Amy pretty much fully healed her but hadn't woken her up yet. Then she got /lonely/ and 'made some tweaks', resolving to fix her after. Then, while fixing /that/ she decided to take a break, and finish fixing her later. And only after /days/ with tweaks that caused Victoria to love her did Amy decide to finish the fix only to find she couldn't.

So it wasn't exactly one small mistake brought on by stress. It was extended mental and physical molestation after an inciting incident brought on by stress.
