It's at best possibly canon. As far as I know, pre-Ward it's not mentioned in the text and the only WOG is Wildbow responding "I wondered if people noticed that" to a theory positing aura leakage.

So maybe it's an intended subtext or maybe it's just a neat idea that Wildbow thought about but never considered canon.
