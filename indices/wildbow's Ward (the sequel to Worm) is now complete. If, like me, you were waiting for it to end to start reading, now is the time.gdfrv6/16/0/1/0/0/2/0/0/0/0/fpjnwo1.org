Shaper definitely had something to do with it. And Amy isn't perfectly stupid and evil. Amy is a girl with a dangerous power that massively suffers under her own narcissism.

Yes, you can blame how she was raised, how she involuntarily felt for her sister, what kinds of pressure her ability to heal anyone put on her, what kinds of opposite pressure her shard not wanting to just heal people and who knows what else for various aspects of her personality and downfall, but the end result is someone sick and dangerous that doesn't see how she is sick and dangerous and has a crippling obsession for her victim. And that end result would not have been true for just anyone in her situation.

Blaming her as a stupid evil villain abusing her own perfect agency is nonsensical, just like it always is even in real life, let aline for a story character whose life is literally being written. So yes, Amy deserves pity. But she doesn't deserve to have Victoria, in any capacity.
