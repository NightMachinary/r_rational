The aura comment that Wildbow vaguely canonized is specifically about Amy going through puberty while under the effects of the aura 24/7, so no, because that's not part of the premise.

What's ambiguous is whether Carol abandoned Victoria or not, in Worm. That's something that's made explicit in Ward, not before. What's also ambiguous is whether Amy's Victoria-centric sexuality was intended to be a result of aura exposure, or maybe "breadth and depth". Guts and Glory was going to be centered around this family in a world where capes are routinely shaped by powers, especially when exposed at a young age. This has always been a setting conceit of Worm's.

I find it pretty funny that, somehow, when it's time to assign responsibility and mitigating factors, the characters who never did anything /too/ offensive or horrible get full marks, while any who did mental illness /'wrong'/ gets the "you had perfect agency! Why did you think this was a good idea!??" treatment.

When you set out to make a sequel built around themes of second chances, healing, therapy and redemption, having your protagonist be a pure victim that BTFOs her perfectly agentic rapist is hypocritical at best. Especially when there's a bunch of WoGs centered around implying there was power intervention in Amy's breakdown and subsequent actions. Fragile One and Shaper can't have anything to do with what happened because then Fragile One couldn't be worthy of development and Amy couldn't be perfectly stupid and evil.
