The other hypothesis would be that it was just natural change, I guess? It's clear in I11h that it's something she's actively resisting, and after the trauma of what happened and her experience afterwards, maybe she just broke down, sad and fucked up as that is

Also I edited my comment just after writing it, in case you missed the edits. I added:

  The "break" parts still don't really make sense to me. I think part of it is maybe that this is supposed to be her making excuses for herself, and she wouldn't just casually say she took an unneeded extended break while doing so, and that disonnance makes me confused. And I'm still not convinced that the text as-is in Worm is sufficient to support the reading that Amy sexually assaulted her, I just don't see it in the text or subtext. The bit you highlighted with Carol's reaction does lean that way, but not enough for it to be definitive for me
