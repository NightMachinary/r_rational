Yeah, I always thought that a good chunk of the horror regarding what Amy did is that it was so plausible and believable and still terrible, I stopped reading Ward around the time she was getting heavily flanderised.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I mean that Amy was a horrifying villain because what she did was so close to something real, and was a few degrees of fantasy/sci-fi away from being just a realistic rape story. She was an Umbridge, so to speak. I disliked it when she started pivoting to mwahaha-ing megavillain.
