Currently towards the end of arc 7. It does look to be getting better though I will agree with the general idea of it not feeling as good of a work as Worm. My two cents is that I feel like it is already too large in scope. Worm started out very locally with street gangs and expands slowly till the ending with the death of a space alien and it's done so well that it doesn't feel forced. Ward starts out focusing on too much and adding a new character every chapter, this makes it a chore to read trying to constantly remember different characters and what they can do.
