Just reread the interlude. When I read it, my understanding of what happened is that in order to keep her alive, Amy had to like fuse her into the coccoon as life support, which was what all the work was ostensibly supposed to be: unfucking the body horror that was required to keep her alive. And then along the way, she's exhausted and she starts making mistakes. She's indestribably exhausted and she stops being able to see Victoria as Victoria, like semantic satiation, and her caricaturistic on-a-pedestal perception of her bleeds into it too. And that's what resulted in the abomination-ing.

I don't really know what implication is supposed to be there when she mentions taking a break. I can't draw a line from it alone to sexual assault, but I can't draw a line from it to /anything/, it just leaves me confused.

When she talks about being lonely, I gather that she's trying to excuse how her personal desire bled into the process and resulted in Victoria becoming a caricature of how Amy sees her.

And I'm pretty sure you're wrong when you say "tweaks which caused Victoria to love her"; that didn't happen during this event, but earlier on as a seperate thing.

But that's just a reading from the interlude alone, and I'm not sure about subtext to that that I missed or what was explained or retconned in Ward. And regardless, I'm more interested in just looking at Worm, not considering what Ward may have added or changed.
