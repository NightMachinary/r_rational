Thanks for sharing your thoughts. The "break" parts still don't really make sense to me. I think part of it is maybe that this is supposed to be her making excuses for herself, and she wouldn't just casually say she took an unneeded extended break while doing so, and that disonnance makes me confused. And I'm still not convinced that the text as-is in Worm is sufficient to support the reading that Amy sexually assaulted her, I just don't see it in the text or subtext. The bit you highlighted with Carol's reaction does lean that way, but not enough for it to be definitive for me

  Edit: also, Amy changed Victoria's sexuality earlier on, which caused her to become enraged. When we see her in the asylum, though, she is uncontrollably infatuated with Amy. That happened during the Ensquidening.

I don't think this is true. In Interlude 11h (Amy) it's pretty explicit that Amy didn't just change Victoria's sexuality, but made her specifically in love with Amy:

  Amy's voice was a croak as she replied, “...make it so you would reciprocate my feelings.”

  “I can find someone else to fix it. Or maybe, at the very least, I can show some fucking self-control and realize it's my sister I'm having those feelings about.”

In Interlude 18 (Yamada), I don't think there is enough there to conclude that Amy must have made Victoria more infatuated with her during the Cronenberging
