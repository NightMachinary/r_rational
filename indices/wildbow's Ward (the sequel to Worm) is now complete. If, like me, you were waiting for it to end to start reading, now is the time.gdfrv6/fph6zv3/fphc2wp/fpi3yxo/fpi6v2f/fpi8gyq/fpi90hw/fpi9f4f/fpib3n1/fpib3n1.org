I suppose it is possible that her begging in the asylum was the result of a mundane mental breakdown, but does that really fit the evidence better? Looking over her comments about how she 'wanted to see her smile again. To have someone hug me before I left forever.'

Technically possible, but improbable, that there wasn't any further mental manipulation. At least, as far as I see it.

And as for the edit. You are confused because Amy is saying something bad about herself in a situation where you would expect her to be trying to sugar-coat everything, right? Wouldn't that imply, then, that she really /is/ downplaying how bad things were? If excuse-making self-justifying Amy is admitting to something as awful as an extended unnecessary break, then what she actually did must be much worse. Or at least, that is the conclusion that makes most sense to me.

And I was trying to make the point earlier that even ignoring any possibility of outright sexual assault, the fandom tends to skip over or excuse Amy's actions far more than I think is reasonable.
