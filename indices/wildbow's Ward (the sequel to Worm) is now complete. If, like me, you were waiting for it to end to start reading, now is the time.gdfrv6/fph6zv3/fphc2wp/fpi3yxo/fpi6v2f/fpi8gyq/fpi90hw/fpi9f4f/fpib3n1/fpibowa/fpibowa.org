  Looking over her comments about how she 'wanted to see her smile again. To have someone hug me before I left forever.'

Oh, that's true. Her comment here does actual suggest Amy did further mental tampering. Potentially to remove Victoria's animosity to her rather than further infatuation, though.

#+begin_quote
  Wouldn't that imply, then, that she really is downplaying how bad things were? If excuse-making self-justifying Amy is admitting to something as awful as an extended unnecessary break, then what she actually did must be much worse.
#+end_quote

Hm, perhaps you're right. My confusion may also be on a meta-level, though, that there's some dissonance with it being there as something Wildbow would write into the text without anything else to accompany it and make it feel more natural, sensical. I don't know, it's hard to put a finger on what exactly causes my confusion with it, that it sticks out like a sore thumb.

  And I was trying to make the point earlier that even ignoring any possibility of outright sexual assault, the fandom tends to skip over or excuse Amy's actions far more than I think is reasonable.
#+end_quote

That's fair; what Amy did was fucked up even without the potential sexual assault. But I think it would still be another significant leap into inexcusability, so it's not irrelevant
