“I... she wouldn't let me help her, she was so angry, so I calmed her down with my power. She'd been hurt badly, so I wrapped her up. A cocoon, so she could heal.”

“I... I had to wait a while before I could let her out, so I could be sure she had healed completely. I-“

  It looks to me like, at this point, Victoria was already set to be healed, and it was only a matter of waiting and then letting her out before she would be ok.

“I didn't want her to fight. And I didn't want her to follow, or to hate me because I used my power on her again.”

“So I thought I'd put her in a trance, and make it so she'd forget everything that happened. Everything that I did, and the things that the Slaughterhouse Nine said, and everything that I said to try to make them go away. Empty promises and-“

  This is questionable, but probably could have gone without too much comment. Considering how badly an angry Victoria could have hurt Amy, this could even be pre-emptive self defence. If you really squint.

“What happened?” Brandish asked, for the Nth time.

“She was lying there, and I wanted to say goodbye. I- I-“

Something in Amy's voice, her tone, her posture, it provided the final piece, clicking into place, making so many things suddenly come together."

#+begin_quote
  This is where the subtext is that some kind of sexual assault took place, but even glossing over that the stuff that comes next is much worse than any mundane rape.

“I wanted to see her smile again. To have someone hug me before I left forever. So you wouldn't have to worry about me anymore. I- I told myself I'd leave after. Victoria wouldn't remember. It would be a way for me to get closure. Then I'd go and spend the rest of my life healing people. Sacrifice my life. I don't know. As payment.”

#+begin_quote
  Considering how Jessica's interlude went, we know that this whole thing involved controlling Victoria into an uncontrollable infatuation for Amy. Keep in mind, all she had to do was wait and let her out.

“I wanted her to be happy. I could adjust. Tweak, expand, change things to serve more than one purpose. I had the extra material from the cocoon. When I was done, I started undoing everything, all the mental and physical changes. I got so tired, and so scared, so lonely, so I thought we'd take another break, before I was completely finished. I changed more things. More stuff I had to fix. And days passed. I-“

#+begin_quote
  She got so tired and scared and /lonely/ that she took another break. Possibly justifiable if she was really tired, but by this point her other actions were truely heinous. It wasn't just another break, though, because she 'Changed more things. More stuff I had to fix' during that break. And apparently, this period where she took a break and 'changed things' lasted days. That is tremendously fucked up.
#+end_quote

Brandish clenched her fists.

“I lost track. I forgot how to change her back.”

#+begin_quote
  Even if she had changed her back, there is really no way to justify what came before.
#+end_quote

Edit: also, Amy changed Victoria's sexuality earlier on, which caused her to become enraged. When we see her in the asylum, though, she is uncontrollably infatuated with Amy. That happened during the Ensquidening.
