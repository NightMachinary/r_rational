Is it really reading between the lines? Even ignoring anything ambiguous, in Amy's own words she pretty much completely healed Victoria and then 'tweaked' her and modified her mind because she was 'lonely'. Then, she kept her that way for /days/, putting off fixing her. Even if there wasn't any kind of mundane molestation going on, that's still heinous.

Sure, a lot of people missed subtext, but treating Amy like she was just some poor misunderstood victim that Victoria is being unfair towards is a step beyond. At that point, you're ignoring the /text/, not the subtext.
