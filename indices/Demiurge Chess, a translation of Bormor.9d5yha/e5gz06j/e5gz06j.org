I took the liberty of editing it a bit, as a native English speaker. I hope you don't mind.

+There's a bit of dialogue missing because I didn't understand its purpose. It's marked in [*bold and brackets*].+ Thanks [[/u/sl236]] for the explanation.

  Demiurge Mazukta set the board, placed the pieces, and picked up the die. "So, let's begin?"

  "Let's begin," Demiurge Shambambukli eagerly agreed. "Throw the die!"

  Mazukta looked at his roll and let out a self-satisfied chuckle. "Yes! I play white, and you play black."

  "Damn," complained Shambambukli, "I wanted to play white."

  "Oh?" Mazukta laughed. "Good needs to be aggressive." He held out a fist. "Can you even throw a punch? Anyway, the die decided, so you're evil."

  "Ah well", Shambambukli caved. "So, these pieces are mine? The thieves, murderers, rapists, etc?"

  "Yes, and mine are priests, judges, teachers, doctors, and politicians. Let's play!"

  In unison, the demiurges leaned over the table and began thoughtfully moving their pieces.

  After some time, Mazuka interrupted Shambambukli. "Stop! What are you doing?"

  "What's wrong?" Shambambukli replied.

  "The bastard you just moved - what is he doing with that grandmother?"

  "Helping her cross the road."

  "Are you insane? He's a rapist! An awful person."

  "And awful people can't help others cross the road?"

  "Absolutely not!"

  "Why not?"

  Mazukta paused to think. "They just can't. It's a good deed and you're playing as evil."

  "Wait a minute," Shambambukli said as he raised his hand. "If my pieces only commit evil deeds, no one will like them."

  "Of course! People are supposed to fear them, not like them!"

  Shambambukli shook his head. "I disagree. If no one can tolerate my pieces, the whole board will switch to white, and I'll lose."

  "Then why don't I lose when I play as evil?" Mazukta countered.

  "I don't know, what should I be doing?"

  "Certainly not what you're doing now! Your spies prevent wars, your bandits steal from the rich and give to the poor, your rapists only act with love and consent! I understand, of course, that the ends justify the means, but not like this!"

  "Let's change places then", offered Shambambukli. "If you know how to play black so well, be my guest. I will play white."

  Mazukta considered the switch. "Fine, let's change places. Just let me explain what I've done so far."

  He pointed at a group of pieces. "Here's the Inquisition - it prevents pieces from defecting. Over here is the Holy Order, which is tasked with converting black pieces to the white faith. This is my education system, designed to rip out dissent at the root, so that people won't even consider changing sides. Finally, here's where I put my prison camps, to contain irreparable elements. After all, white can't just murder them, right?

  "Anyway, pick up where I left off, and I will fix the mistakes you made."

  "Yeah," Shambambukli swallowed, "there's certainly a lot of fixing to do."
