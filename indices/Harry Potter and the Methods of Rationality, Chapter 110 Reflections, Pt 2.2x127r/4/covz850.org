I don't really like this chapter. The confrontation between Dumbledore and Voldemort felt rushed. Also the Dumbledore characterization was bad. It felt more like a silly caricature, something Voldemort would have imagined Dumbledore acted like rather then the real thing. I guess it's possible that the mirror is still reflecting Voldemort's fantasy of how he wants the confrontation to go.\\
I can;t wait for the next chapter.
