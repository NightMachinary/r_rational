If these events really are just Riddle's CEV (Skeptical, why on earth would he want that), there might be a lesson here: If illusions from within the mirror can successfully perform the /Process of the Timeless/, that means the mirror is dangerous after all.

Riddle said that the Atlantis believed the mirror to be harmless. It's quite clearly not /that/ harmless. Atlantis tried to build something really powerful. They tried to put that powerful object in a /box/ and used the /mirror/ to determine its volition /before letting it out of the box/. Then, they got removed from time. Also, this is written by the guy who came up with the AI box experiment. Coincidence?

(Which doesn't mean they are dead. There's clearly already versions of every time-turning character outside of time, thinking up all the self consistent time turner plots. Atlantis might still be pulling strings.)
