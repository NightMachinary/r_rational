It definitely did. The mirror could have conceivably gotten such arguments from Voldemort's mind, though, so such resemblance is not strong evidence either way. (Damn telepathic oracles!)

EDIT: Mirror Dumbledore referencing his earlier conversation with Harry specifically - "how I laughed when I realised it! When I saw you had made a Good Voldemort to oppose the evil one - ah, how I laughed!", /is/ fairly strong evidence that was the real Dumbledore. Could have gotten it from Harry's mind, I guess - either via shared soul shenanigans or Voldemort using undetectable Legilimency on Harry - but complexity penalty.
