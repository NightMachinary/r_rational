Huh, well. I thought the mirror might be showing a Competent Dumbledore/Worthy Opponent (V's repeatedly stated desire), who would convince him back down/change his ways/self destruct.

It looks like either a Worthy Opponent wasn't really V's extrapolated volition, or that the mirror was instead a pre-arranged trap. Except.. the /Process of the Timeless/ must have been pulled from V's memories, rather than actually being built into it by D (at this point, all unforeshadowed major plot elements are being pulled from /somewhere/ at least). Anyone got any ideas of any CEVs of V that would generate Mirror Dumbledore?

BTW V didn't explicitly dismiss the Greater Circle of Concealment, or the Greater Circle of Exploding before dragging the cloak off Harry. I'm sure he did, otherwise it would have exploded, but I'm having to infer it.
