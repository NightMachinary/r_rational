This might be confirmation bias - since I originally thought the mirror was showing CEV Dumbledore as well - but Dumbledore's argument sounded a bit like a /caricature/ - what Voldemort believes Dumbledore believes. The argument was won too easily. The time-lock trap too poetically out-maneuvered.

(Granted, life isn't a story, so we shouldn't expect a rational villain to win in dramatically appropriate ways. It is still unusual.)

Hypothesis: Voldemort's CEV was to *win* against Dumbledore and all his future opponents, completely and utterly. With all the Deathly Hallows, the Philosopher's Stone, /and/ Harry naked at invisible gunpoint, this is practically assured.

Now we get to see what Harry's CEV is.
