Both Cat and Black want to create institutions that can continue to function after they're gone, making Praes and Callow less reliant on and less susceptible to the influence and whimsy of Named. The fact that the Dread Empress/Emperor of Praes is a Name is a problem for Praes, not a good thing.

Cat talks on many occasions about abdicating as soon as there's a stable government in Callow that can survive without her. If she gets a Name that makes her the savior of Callow and the guarantor of its peace, then she's basically ensuring that this will never happen. Callow will be reliant on the Black Queen (or whatever her Name is) forever, whether that's Cat herself or claimants on the Name down the line.

I dunno. I don't really think it's impossible that Cat gets a Name, but I think that's the least interesting way to go.
