First Sword and Board was instantly resurrected and then barefoot staff woman and Hammer Wielder were killed and greatsword wielder was disarmed.

  With the coming of dawn, Tariq had been able to Forgive the death of Mansurin. The young man, displaying the famous fortitude of the Champion lines, had only been spurred to greater zeal by his stay Above. Little Sidonia, with her laughing eyes and quick wit, would have to remain under shroud of preservation until tomorrow.

Since we have Forgive only useable once per day, used on sword and board on the day Cat fought, this means Mansurin must be Hammer Wielder. Also Champion lines seem to prefer blunt weapons, which makes sense. Furthermore, all the resurrected heroes were mentioned, but not the sword and board.

I'm assuming that Myrmidion and Silent Guardian were used to protect Forsworn in the previous battle since they were on protection duty again here. There is some implication of heavy armour here. However, Cat did fight two different swords and boards and if Francois is one I'm not sure who the other would be.
