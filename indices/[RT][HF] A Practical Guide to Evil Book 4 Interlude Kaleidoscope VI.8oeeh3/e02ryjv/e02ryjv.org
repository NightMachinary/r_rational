Ha, nice Absence demon reference.

edit: Gods, Akua, that's fucking amazing:

"Still, a responding battle cry was in order. It was the heroic thing to do. Something about Callow? Akua pondered her understanding of Catherine's temper. I am angry, the sorceress decided, because I am disappointed as I have mystifyingly failed to grasp that the Heavens prefer their pawns powerful yet rather dim. I must now protect the venerable sanctity of farms and countless peasants everywhere, as I am very concerned with their fate even though they are ignorant and full of lice.

“Fuck off and die,” Akua called back, tinting her voice with wroth."

edit 2: With that ending I'm beginning to actually like Akua now. *That cloak must be burned before further damage is done*
