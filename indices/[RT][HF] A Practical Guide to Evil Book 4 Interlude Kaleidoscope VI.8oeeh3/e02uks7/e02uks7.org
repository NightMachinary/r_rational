  Starlight stolen
#+end_quote

I always got the feeling that Pilgrim was not using the Summer Sun with his weapon - to call it starlight instead of Summer's sun doesn't seem to match thematically, since thematically stars are associated with night and suns with day, and this world if nothing else, follows theme more than logic. It was something else entirely, as the staff he has has made appearances beforehand. I feel like the Summer Sun was more him breaking the control and reshaping the leftover magic rather than usurping Hierophant's miracle. Like in the way he breaks Hierophant's 'light has no effect' circle, or Cat's portals.

It seems to me that the Pilgrim's staff is a completely different power source that is tied to the breaking of power. Like the power of a fallen star or something - thematically fits with the idea of breaking power and it's lack of effect of Pilgrim who doesn't wield personal power to break.

  Such a thing could be interrupted by workings, but it would take nothing less than a miracle to usurp or reshape it.

This sounds like Hierophant is going usurp the starlight as a new weapon in his arsenal
