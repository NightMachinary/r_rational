  While Cat coming back is awesome and welcome, I'm wondering what her coming back while going full-blown Winter is going to do to her. I'd really hate for Winter-Cat to be the version we get back, because she's basically a rabid demi-god.

That could be bad, yeah. At least we know Archer's nearby. Hopefully Cat gave her the same oath keywords she gave Thief.

Edit: On further consideration, just because Archer got a shot in doesn't necessarily mean she isn't a full mile away.
