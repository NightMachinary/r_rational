It's a joke :-)

In Chapter 4, Thief and Cat discuss the invading host's heroic makeup:

#+begin_quote
  “We'll untangle that particular mess in full at the briefing,” I sighed. “What've you got on the heroes? None of this matters if they just splatter us across the countryside at the first scrap.”

  “Wasn't able to get all the Names,” Thief said. “But I do have a number for you: there's *fourteen* of them.”

When GP and Cat meet up and talk in chapter 8, she promises not to use demons and warns GP that they believe one may be somewhere in Callow, possibly trapped in a legion standard:

#+begin_quote
  “Done,” I grunted. “As a gesture of goodwill, I'll add a warning. There's a demon from Dread Empress Triumphant's day bound somewhere in the vicinity of Harrow. My people believe it might be one of *Absence*.”

  “A Hell Egg, after all these years?” he said, brow rising. “I thought none remained within Callow.”

  “Would that this were true,” I ruefully said. “I don't know exactly where it is, or what keeps it bound. Odds are it's an old Legion standard but I can't guarantee it.”

  He inclined his head in thanks.

  *“I will discuss this with the others,” the Pilgrim said. “If we can slay it, we will.”*

Absence is a particularly nasty demon, because its corrupting effect is to basically erase things around it from existence - even from memories. When previously released, Absence apparently wiped an entire country from existence, with no one even remembering it. From book 2, chapter 22:

#+begin_quote
  A shiver went up my spine at that, I was unashamed to admit. Every Callowan was raised on stories about what demons could do when let loose, and both of those kinds had famous legends to their names. An absence demon was widely believed to be the reason the entire Yan Tei Empire had no mention of it anywhere during two centuries and then had suddenly reappeared in the histories. People hadn't even noticed it was gone, or even that anything had been missing at all.

In chapter 10, Archer and Cat discuss the heroes again:

#+begin_quote
  “It's *just twelve* heroes,” Archer shrugged. “Nothing to worry about. Worse comes to worse, I shoot a few in the eye and run away.”

  *Strange, it hadn't occurred to me before now that the muster of heroes on the other side was essentially a tenth and two officers.* I /had/ been tired, and there'd been a few days a while back where I'd had vicious headaches. Must have been the lack of sleep having unforeseen consequences. We were all feeling the pressure: even Vivienne and Masego had been out of sorts.

The implication here (and referenced again in this chapter when GP tells the heroes to remember they were twelve once and to never "forget") is that the demon was found and fought. Two heroes were erased from existence, as was any memory of the battle. Hence the headaches suffered by characters, and the subtle references to a smaller number of heroes than originally discussed.

It was probably quite the battle, but no one remembers it.
