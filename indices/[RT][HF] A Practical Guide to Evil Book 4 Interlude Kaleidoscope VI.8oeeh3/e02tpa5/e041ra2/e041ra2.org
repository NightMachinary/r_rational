That caught my eye as well. There are a lot of signs that Cat is "fated" to become the Empress. The song of course. Presumably Alaya heard it before and that's how Black knows even thought it "wasn't for him". I wonder if the crusade would consider that a win? Praes reformed under Cat and Callow as a tributary state to Praes, but not headed by a Named.

There was a few more lines in this one that I was thinking on:

The line about resurrections. I wonder if the side of good using such a potent ability will empower the side of evil to maintain the balance?

I wonder who else would call what Cat is doing heroism? It's clear that compared to Akua she could be considered heroic, but Cat reminds me too much of Doctor Doom or Magneto. Still considered Evil.

What does it mean that Cat's soul is completely fused with Winter? Did that just happen from the magical backfire or has it been like that since she became the last titled entity of winter?
