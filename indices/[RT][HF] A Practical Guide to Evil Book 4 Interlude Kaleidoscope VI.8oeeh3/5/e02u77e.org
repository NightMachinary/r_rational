The exposition on Winter zombies reminded me of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjtkWZ1uCXo][Spongebob (replace "Darkness" with "Zombie").]]

Really liked the creative use of Winter's powers by Akua. Reminded me of Ice-Man from the X-Men comics in their overwhelming, indiscriminate control of water/ice, which is terrifying.

The action was anime af, which is great. I liked Akua's arrogance and internal monologue in the midst of battle. It's a shame we only got to see her as a Classic Villain, because she really is a fun character (assuming she's not on the other side). She felt like a mini-Triumphant here (may she never return): quick, witty, and hopelessly arrogant.
