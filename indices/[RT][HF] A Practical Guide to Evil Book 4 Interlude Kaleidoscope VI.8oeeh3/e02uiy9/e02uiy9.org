>If Akua had always known heroism was this entertaining, she would have begun dabbling /years/ ago.

I feel like this line holds some significance. Akua, villain of the old breed, has come from viewing Cat as a disgraceful upstart of a Villain to viewing her as a (lower case h) hero. I'm fairly certain Cat is gonna get a new name with the next chapter "the Queen returning from slumber in the hour of her kingdom's most dire need" is such a powerful trope.

There's no way Cat's gonna be a Hero, but maybe her new name will be neutral? In terms of alignment it's worth noting that the Heavens don't view Winter as something that must be destroyed (as seen when blessing the water failed to fuck up the Winter!Zombies).

EDIT: Fuck, maybe Cat has inadvertently offered Akua a shot at a redemption arc? I'm not sure if I like the idea, Akua deserves to suffer, but that would be quite a heroic or at least unvillanish thing to do.
