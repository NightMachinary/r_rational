I feel like I've posted something to this effect in every update, but I really don't think Cat will be getting a Name anytime soon. A Name is a consequence of acting the part of a Role, and I don't think Cat wants anything to do with getting locked into playing the Gods' narrative games anymore. She wants to break the story of Callow being the beleaguered battleground for the fight between Good and Evil. A Role is a groove worn into Fate, a path tread by countless individuals in the past. She wants to forge a new path for Callow, and so there's no Role (and thus no Name) fitting for what she wants to do.

Besides, she's plenty powerful already as the Queen of Winter. As Akua just showed, she can stand on her own against two of the most mighty Heroes we've seen to date and eight fodder Heroes. She doesn't need a Name.
