We've seen new names before though, or at least names that haven't existed in living memory (see Hierophant). If not for that I'd think you're completely right. With the fact of new Names being a thing, I'm not so sure. Cat is carving a gauge in creation rather than following a grove, and that fits a new Role and Name better than no Name at all.

I guess the real question here is whether Cat wants to /break/ the story, or if she wants to create a better story. I'm honestly not sure, I'd say the chances are even or close to it. Watch me get proved wrong next chapter though.
