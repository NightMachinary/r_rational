I'm not sure I agree with that. Encounters that Cat has spent a lot of time planning in the first 3 books:

- The final school battle.

- The defense of Marchford.

- Her resurrection scheme.

- The duel with the Duke of Violent Squalls, arguably (the one where she gets her first Winter title).

- The Battle of Four Armies and One.

- The whole attack on Diabolist.

I think the major difference would be, in this book she's starting to do more long-term planning.

On the other hand, I'm with you on the hypocrite part.
