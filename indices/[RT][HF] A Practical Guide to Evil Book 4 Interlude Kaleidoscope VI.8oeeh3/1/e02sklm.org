I know that Ubua's reappearance has been a little controversial, but I hope that after this chapter more people are on board with her sticking around. I found her perspective on the fight to be delightful to read. Really, I think that turning Cat's foil into her personal genie in a bottle/shoulder devil was a great move by EE.

Also, how horrifying is it that this has turned into an "all according to plan" moment? It's gone from a funny injoke in Book 1 to Cat doing it on purpose
