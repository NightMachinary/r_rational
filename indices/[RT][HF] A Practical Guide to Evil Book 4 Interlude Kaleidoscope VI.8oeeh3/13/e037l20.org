Devil's in the details! Some stuff that stuck out:

  He drew strength from it, from the *Dawn* that was one of his aspects.

Missed a good pun chance here; should have been *Drawn*, as he *draws* power from the *dawn*. That's Good for you - no sense of humor.

  Only the greater lines won more than empty titles and emptier privileges from being recognized, as was only fitting for the descendants -- in Blood or Bestowal -- of the five heroes that had founded the Dominion.
#+end_quote

Neat world-building about the Dominion of Levant. Looks like their heroes have two ways to become Named (or as they call them, Bestowed) - either through Blood ties to a former Named, or through being Bestowed by the Heavens. If the Named has a family, their descendants form a new Line; a lesser line if not one of the Names shared by the founders, or a greater line if it is (I think?). Valiant Champion, slayer of Captain, wasn't born into a greater line but inherited the Name of one of the founding heroes - so her kids will be, effectively, royalty. Speaking of royalty, Grey Pilgrim is apparently both from a greater line AND inherited one of the founders' Names. I find that interesting, especially since he's so close with Saint of Swords, who is known as the Regicide for her history of murdering royalty. I wonder if there's potential conflict brewing there.

Oooooo... wondering what this could foreshadow?

#+begin_quote
  The heroine flickered with Light and it pulsed in a perfect ring around her. Aspect, the sorceress decided. Weak enough it could likely be used more than once, which would be difficult to deal with.
#+end_quote

I'm wondering if Saint's Aspect is weak by nature, kept weak by Saint to not overexert herself, or is weakened because of Saint's advanced age. It was mentioned in the previous chapter that she hasn't used Aspects before, and theorized it's because she can't without repercussions. Now she's started to use them... death-flag is being hoisted?

  She called on Winter again, the fullness of the mantle, and kept digging deeper until her vision blurred. Her reward did not take long to be delivered.

  *Back into the box, Diabolist.*
#+end_quote

While Cat coming back is awesome and welcome, I'm wondering what her coming back while going full-blown Winter is going to do to her. I'd really hate for Winter-Cat to be the version we get back, because she's basically a rabid demi-god. Demi-dog? Hoping that's not the case, but it seems too lucky and easy to have her just pop back and be "normal" Cat.

This also doesn't solve the issue of Masego. Unlike Cat he doesn't have an Arcadian hardcopy to tether himself to and reassemble. I wonder if a potential solution would be for Cat to deputize him with a Winter title, and then use her power to yank him back. Although I worry what that'll do to a guy who's already pretty amoral... mix in Winter and he stands to get his personality turned cold. Suddenly rather than just an academic interest in everything, he may find his passion in hunting prey or figuring out how to freeze all of Creation or something...
