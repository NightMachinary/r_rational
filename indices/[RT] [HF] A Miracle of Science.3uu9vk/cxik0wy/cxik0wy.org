An excellent work, in my opinion. Though I may be biased. "A Miracle of Science" was one of the first webcomics I ever read. I think the only thing I read before that was Andy Weir's "Casey and Andy" strip. Sadly, after ending that, Mr. Weir had to make do with writing a best-selling novel that was made into a very popular movie. And hey, the novel and movie heavily feature Mars, as does "A Miracle of Science." You see how I came full circle?
