Not really. There are a lot of instances in the story where I found myself thinking "Okay, that was a really cool scene, but no. Taylor would absolutely, absolutely be dead (or in police custody) in this situation."

It's a kind of suspension of disbelief that you have to apply when reading Wildbow stories.

(eg, in Twig, every single fight against nobles (after the Duke's introduction) has them being severely handicapped to let the protagonists win)
