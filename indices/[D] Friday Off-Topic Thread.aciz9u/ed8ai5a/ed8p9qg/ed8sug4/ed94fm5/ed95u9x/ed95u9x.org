Hm, that's annoying. Mostly because I could see her powers allowing a lot of cool applications that are reasonably believable, but they just aren't fit for the situations she gets thrown in (especially considering also her companions; if she could team up with someone with the power to engorge things, resulting in swarms of 1m long spiders at her beck and call, /that/ would make her a far more dangerous threat).
