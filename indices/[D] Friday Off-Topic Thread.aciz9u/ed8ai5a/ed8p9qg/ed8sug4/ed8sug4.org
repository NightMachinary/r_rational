Minor spoilers (you already have enough information to deduce this):

Yes, Coil is using his power to help them. He gives them different directions, or doesn't have one instance do anything, etc. His power is actually ridiculously versatile and OP (a lot of worm powers are). But with that said:

​

No, it's a recurring pattern that only gets worse the further the story goes. Worm fell square into the trap of endless escalation. Taylor faces off against increasingly strong enemies and while victory is always hard-won and always exacts a price, she doesn't really get seriously hurt. For example, she gets shot a few times, stabbed, etc, but she's always able to either get it healed by other capes or have a surgeon take care of it. There are some reasons for this, but they're pretty thin.

Major spoilers that you haven't read yet and can't possibly know:

Superpowers come from parasitic alien "worms". The worms don't physically attach to a host, they link to it through some sort of dimensional thing. They're the ones handling the grunt work of actually controlling the bugs, but there's a degree of cooperation between worm/host that gives the host access to additional minor powers that would definitely make it easier to survive. This is explicitly mentioned later on, though it's never clear whether Taylor is truly aligned with her worm or not because she doesn't think about it. The worms want conflict and Taylor doesn't really see herself that way -- but whatever she *wants*, she's definitely in the thick of a lot of conflict. There's also other chessmaster capes moving Taylor around (she ends up being important due to how unique powers are). So there is *some* justification for her surviving, but not that much.
