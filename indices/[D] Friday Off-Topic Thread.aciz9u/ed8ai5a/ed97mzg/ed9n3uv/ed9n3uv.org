  I'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution

What could possibly be more elegant than playing a podcast on /exactly the subject you wish to learn about/ at /exactly the speed at which you just barely are able to understand it/? Beyondpod lets you increment the speed in 0.05x blocks, if your current app doesn't have that fine-grained control.
