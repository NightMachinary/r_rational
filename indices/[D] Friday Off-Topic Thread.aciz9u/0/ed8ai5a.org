I've found that doing exercises while listening to something boosts my productivity, but that the boost is proportional to how much of my attention is focused on what I'm listening to. If the content is conveyed slowly enough that by the time I digest a statement the next one still didn't arrive, the productivity is lower than it would otherwise be.

So, recommendation request:

Any fast-paced podcasts or audiobooks? Or podcasts in which complex material is conveyed in a very information dense manner, so you need your full focus in order to follow it? The topic doesn't matter. Much.

For reference: I'd prefer something 1.5 times faster than Rationally Writing.

(I know I can take any podcast and play it at 1.5x speed, but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution.)
