Ouch, that doesn't bode well. Especially considering that her first sortie against Lung was /already/ way in over her head. I expected the story to use that as a way to set a power ceiling for parahumans in this world, then scale back down and have her engage in smaller incidents. Instead every fight was even bigger and more dangerous.

There's also the fact that the Undersiders just don't seem to have a set of power suited for all-out fighting. Grue + Skitter with Tattletale's intel would be excellent assassins, but they're terrible for close quarter combat. Heck, Taylor is basically just a normal 16 year old girl. Brandishing a baton or a knife will hardly make her supervillain material when it comes to mel√©e combat.
