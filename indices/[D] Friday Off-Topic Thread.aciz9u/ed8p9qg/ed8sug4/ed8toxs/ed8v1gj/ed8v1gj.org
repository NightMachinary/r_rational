Early on it's like that. Lung's power counters Taylor's really really well. But later... let's just say the villain lineup includes gansters, giant monsters, terrorists, giant robots, artificial intelligence, and finally gods. And that's just what I remember off the top of my head.

Most of the fights are like Lung -- she hangs back while someone else plays tanks, gets hurt when the enemy closes in, but ultimately wins by figuring out how to exploit a weakness.
