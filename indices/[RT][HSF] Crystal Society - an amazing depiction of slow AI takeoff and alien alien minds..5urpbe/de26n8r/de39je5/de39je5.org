Thanks for the detailed breakdown! I think you make a lot of great points.

I second the recommendation for MOPI; Localroger's other famous work, "Passages in the Void", is also extremely good. (Now I want to post both on here, or at the very least look for previous discussions).

Speaker for the Dead is one of my all-time favourite books. The alien life on the planet described is definitely better than the nameless in Crystal Society. Another great recommendation.

I have not read the other two, though I take some issue with the assumption that a story should avoid "titillating" the reader at all costs. You wouldn't say a story should avoid scaring the reader at all costs, especially when something scary happens in the plot; so I don't think there's an intrinsic problem with the reader having sexy feelings if something sexy happens in the story. If it happens gratuitously then that is a problem of course (unless you're writing a tingler...), but not IMO if it's plot-relevant.

One minor nitpick:

#+begin_quote
  After the upgrade to install "Heart", for example, one of the first "sanity checks" I would have done as a programmer is to monitor how the internal priority bidding between the threads looked, and upon noticing that Heart won every bid would realize the system was not functioning as intended.
#+end_quote

That was functioning as intended; Socrates consented to adding Heart, but Myrondin double-crossed him by giving Heart infinite strength to bid with, thus effectively turning Socrates into Heart with a little bit of backup from the others. So Heart winning every bid was intended behaviour.

Finally, I'm partyway through the second book and you'd probably hate it for similar reasons, a lot of the issues are as they are, but moreso.

Also, I believe the author is an [[http://raelifin.com/resume.pdf][actual computer programmer]] - though without anything I would consider "formal" education, which is arguably worthless these days.

Thanks again for the comment, it was really interesting to read! I'm going to have to see if I can find a copy of Left Hand of Darkness. Could I trouble you for more fiction you would recommend?
