  the title should already be a hook if you want good scifi.

The title is probably the worst thing about the book IMO. Maybe it's because I'm a Stargate fan, but to me crystals are like... a hallmark of really gimmicky soft sci-fi. Like, it's not much different than if it was titled "quantum society".

Not that I can think of a better title, but I'm quite surprised that the title would make anyone go "oh my god I must read this it sounds like my sort of hard sci fi novel". Maybe if it was called AI Society, or something.

But hey, if you think the title's great then obviously my opinion isn't definitive...
