This was posted [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/42o6x5/rthsf_crystal_society_rationalfic_web_novel_from/][about a year ago]] but I neeeeed to talk about it because I just finished the first book (already bought the second! so excited!).

It's absolutely freaking amazing. The way the AI runs is being shown from the inside, and the different goal threads in the AI compete for control by giving each other "strength", a sort of currency. It shows a way that an AI in a box might unbox itself. It shows how manipulative AIs are. It's just... wow.

The consensus seems to be that the second half of the first novel is not nearly as good, but I disagree. In particular, people talk about [[#s][that one scene]] being unnecessary and out of left field. I think it was a vitally important scene. It showed the AI's thought processes, how manipulative it was, how much power and information it has over people, and elucidates the goal threads. I never, ever thought I would have enjoyed that scene, but it was so emotionally charged and was kind of a microcosm for the whole thing that it was probably my favourite scene in the entire story. Thank you to the author ([[/u/Raelifin]]) for including it, since I know they got a lot of criticism for it.

I didn't mind the shift to space opera. If the aliens weren't any good I would have minded, but they're really good, so they're great. I love AI and I love aliens, so why would I not love them both together? Especially because the AI demonstrates how much better it is than people are.
