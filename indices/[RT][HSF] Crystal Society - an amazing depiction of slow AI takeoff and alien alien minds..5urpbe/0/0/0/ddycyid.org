Nah, I like the characters, I like the worldbuilding, I like all of that. I agree that the premise of the second half is not as interesting as the first half, but that's mostly because AI box problem is such an underexplored gold mine in fiction so of /course/ it's going to be super awesome whereas terrorists/aliens/etc is more standard sci-fi fare. I think if AI Box was an explored premise, this story might get more respect as a coherent unit, since it would be considered "really good AI box stuff" followed by "really good space opera".

I'm about 20% through the second book and it's a bit less gripping in the first parts, but I am full of anticipation. The reviews on amazon make me excited for the denouement...
