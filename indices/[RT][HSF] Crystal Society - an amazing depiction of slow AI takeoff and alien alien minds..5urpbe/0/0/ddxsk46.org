Even setting aside the sex scene (which was, in my opinion, needlessly gratuitous), I think the second half of the story is noticeably worse than the first.

The story shines when it's about an AI getting out of a box. Everything else -the character writing especially - is pretty mediocre, and the loss of focus on said box-escaping means that the less-good parts of the novel are brought to the fore.
