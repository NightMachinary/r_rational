  As for the rest of the chapter. Is RWBY trying to hack into the surveillance system just to get a look at her sister, or is she trying to use it to communicate to Yang's pad? I found that confusing.

Thanks for letting me know; I'll clarify that part. (She's trying to triangulate the positions of the surveillance drones by measuring how strong the signal they're transmitting is at different points, not hack into the network. Her assumption is that one of the drones is probably roughly over her sister's head.)
