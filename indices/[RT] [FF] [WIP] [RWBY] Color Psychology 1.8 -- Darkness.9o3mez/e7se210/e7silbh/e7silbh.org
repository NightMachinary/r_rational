I dunno, I'm personally enjoying the author's portrayal of Ruby's social issues precisely because it's looking to be a huge chunk of the 'actual plot'.

When your society's existence relies on a literally institutionalized process of creating child soldiers, how those children function mentally and socially is going to be a big deal. Training people to slice up bogeymen is relatively easy; training them to think clearly and cooperate despite being flawed human beings is really, really not.
