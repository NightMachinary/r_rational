Your portrayal of communication learning disability is spot-on. Ruby's characterization makes her very realistic and relatable. The others' reactions to her are also very realistic and relatable. I say this from experience as someone who has a communication learning disability myself. Bravo! Can't wait for the next chapter. :)
