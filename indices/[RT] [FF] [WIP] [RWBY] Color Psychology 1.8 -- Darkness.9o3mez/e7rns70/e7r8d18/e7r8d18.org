I wanted to be (appropriately) sad for Ruby this whole chapter, but I couldn't stop laughing at the fact that you were doing the /thing/. The character-listens-in-on-the-exact-conversation-that-happens-to-be-dramatically-relevant-at-that-given-moment thing.

I don't really blame Weiss here, because I know /exactly/ what kind of mindset can lead to this kind of thing. One of the worst moments in my life was when I did this exact thing to one of my friends. It's easy to vent about just about anything when you think you're alone. I can't say I blame Ruby either. /But,/ I think if I were her, I would walk away and wait to see if Weiss says anything about it in person - obviously, you can't just unhear it, but a valid test for whether or not someone really believes what they say is to see if they say it again in a different context. That way, you avoid the responsibility of having to figure out whether they meant it yourself. I don't know if Ruby can do this, or if it would feel more like running away from a problem for her.

As for the rest of the chapter. Is RWBY trying to hack into the surveillance system just to get a look at her sister, or is she trying to use it to communicate to Yang's pad? I found that confusing. I liked the conversation by the river, specifically, the line where Weiss reveals that they're being watched, because it injects a new dynamic into how Ruby strategizes about things. On the other hand, I think her getting distracted by it and nobody really /trying/ to stop her other than Jaune - just because "Ruby is weird" or whatever - seems to me like a weird mix up of priorities. They've only known Ruby for maybe eight hours and haven't seen her on her pad once, other than navigating with the map, so they don't think it's a little strange that she's spending so much time with it now? It just feels like they had a lot of time to make the communication mishap, but it only seems to happen after Ruby's done doing her little project.

If Ruby didn't catch fish, what did they eat?

That's basically it. Despite that I basically poked a bunch of holes in the chapter, I did really enjoy this one, maybe a little more than the last.
