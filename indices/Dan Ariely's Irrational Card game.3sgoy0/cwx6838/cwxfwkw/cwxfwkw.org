Exactly. The gameplay mechanics seem really bare-bones (and probably not very well thought-out - at least that's my prior for tacked-on amateur game design, having seen a lot of it). So what you're left with is lots of experimental psychology trivia. And while I really like experimental psychology trivia, there are better mediums for sharing it than a card game.
