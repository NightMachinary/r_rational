When I look at the trivia games that I play, most of them have somewhere in the hundreds of questions. Trivial Pursuit has something like 6,000, Wits & Wager has 900 ... this game has 75. The game is won when you have an answer card from all 5 categories or when you have 10 in total. So assuming that on your first playthrough you have 4 players, perfect play means that you could still go through half the deck (40 cards) and imperfect play means you'll go through more.

So yeah. Definitely an interesting idea, but there's not enough trivia to sustain it because you'll very quickly know all the answers.
