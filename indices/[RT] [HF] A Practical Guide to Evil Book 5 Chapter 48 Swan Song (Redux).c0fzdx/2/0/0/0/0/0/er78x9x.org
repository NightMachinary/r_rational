It might be something more complex in practice, while a sword cuts without morality, she herself has much more of a stated position that she holds to. As in she might well be unable to make the transition as she is, but a mantle seems to have some amount of effect on mental state. She might start out as a sword(that cuts) and end up more idunno The Sword(that cuts out corruption) or something.

Like she's clearly not just the sword to the point that she's simply a sword, a sword has no morality, a sword doesn't choose what it cuts it merely cuts things, where she's firmly on side of Good to the point that she's willing to burn out a Good country as a way of getting one over the Dead King.
