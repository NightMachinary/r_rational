It certainly makes sense, but i'm not sure if we have enough evidence to suggest that a truly heroic death, or sacrifice if you will, is enough to prevent him from forgiving the death, hell he seemed uncertain about Archer after her revive, not necessarily uncertain that he could revive her and man would that have made a different story if the Dead King overestimated the Pilgrim's ability in the first place. But uh that in his interlude he said that those he brought back " Resurrection left a scar on the soul, always. No one could be ripped from the embrace of the Gods without finding Creation and faded and brutish place for the rest of their days, even if the memory of the Heavens was withheld." this was in interlude kaleidoscope II. Which i guess also brings up the question of where Archer ended up considering she came back with knowledge of the Pilgrim's past as a priest.

Man how meta would it be if all she saw the chapters that we see on the website?
