My bet is that it's not the heroism of a death that prevents resurrection, but the /weight/. Significant choices grind a groove in the fabric of reality in this setting. Bringing someone likr that back isn't just repairing physical damage, it isn't even just wrestling a soul from the Gods - it's a Sysiphean effort to push a boulder that has /ontological/ weight.
