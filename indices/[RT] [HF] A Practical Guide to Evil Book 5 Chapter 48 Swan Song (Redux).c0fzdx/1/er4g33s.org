I mean i can't say that i like the Saint anymore after this chapter but it and the previous few does kinda give her a lot of implicit rationale. I mean she's not super wrong and i think it says something that she's even willing to admit that Cat might not be as treacherous as she could be, i'm not sure if she means that much more than that but, well it is a concession. It's really interesting to see it in comparison to Cat's speech to the Drow previously to be better, to not be dragged down by the 'pettiness' that is can so easily become an existential threat. That to compromise with evil gives them the kind of legitimacy that well let's the fox into the hen house writ large.

​

It also kind of is diminished, because of her own lack of action oh say the invasion of Callow? Or the years of occupation in which their previous Good aligned culture was overwritten. If anything if she really believed what she was saying then she would definitely be trying to destroy Callow outright not Procer... wait.

​

Also can you imagine how Masego is going to feel after Cat and party bring a God (or is it god?) into existence, without him there to watch and be a part of? And for the G/god to potentially be Archer? Also it was interesting to see that there were some kind of limitations to the Pilgrim's ability to Forgive deaths I wonder if that's like a bug or a feature.
