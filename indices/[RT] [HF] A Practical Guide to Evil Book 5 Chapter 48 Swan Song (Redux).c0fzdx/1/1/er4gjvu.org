From what we've learned of saint before, I feel like it is.... her. If that makes any sense. While I didnt see the crown being given to Indrani, that the Saint would not accept it was certain, and the rest of the chapter kinda felt like a car crash - watching things happen that have been set in motion, but it being too late for them to change.

Personally, I think she goes for Indrani or the crown, and I dont know if she survives the next few chapters or not.
