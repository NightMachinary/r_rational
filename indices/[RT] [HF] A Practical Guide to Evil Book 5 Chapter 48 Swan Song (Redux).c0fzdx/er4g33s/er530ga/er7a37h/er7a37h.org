She certainly has the feel of a Puritan Inquisitor of Warhammer 40k to me, as in one that shuns the other, kind of rightfully so given the hostile nature of most if not all of the others in both situations.

The other thing that i think is pretty telling is about the consistent emphasis on the trying to be better by both White Knight and Pilgrim. That to fail is almost expected if not outright so.

It is really kind of unusual given our view of the more "enlightened" evil i guess, the more institutional rather than personal power, that for the majority of the time evil meant the kind over the top evil that might have made individual improvements but for the most part would fall into the doomsday weapons that arguably Cat, with her portals previously, and Ubua and Malicia with the Hellgate, all fell into the trap of. I think that for the most part Saint's mistake is thinking of Cat being oldschool evil like most if not all the villains she's encountered but Cat is something new or at least new-ish in being concerned with the governing more than the conquering for instance. At the same time the institutions that she's working toward kind of have the implication of potentially being the death knell for Good societies as whole so Saint's certainly not wrong that Cat is potentially as threatening to Good as the Dead King.
