Is that an outcome that they would want? Like Saint was kicking a Winter powered Cat's butt by herself not so long ago and shoving an entire Fae court's worth of power into her seems less than optimal to be honest. At least if the crown is destroyed there's a chance they still get the portals working, but beating Saint plus more power seems like a lot for our spent party.
