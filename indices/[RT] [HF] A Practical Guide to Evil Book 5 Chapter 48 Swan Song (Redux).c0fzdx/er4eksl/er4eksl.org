So she's destroying the crown, the same way Black destroyed the doomsday weapon. That sucks.

It didn't actually give the immediate outcome though, or say what Cat was doing, like it had at the end of the previous Swan Song. It isn't impossible that Cat uses her contingency for the Saint before she gets to the crown. I wouldn't count on it though. They're in Arcadia, where the story matters more than anything else.

Edit: Is this why the Bard wanted Kairos to live? So it would lead to this outcome?
