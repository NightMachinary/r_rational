I think a large part of why she seems extreme is that she treats good an evil like abstract metaphysical entities not aspects of human minds, which to us seems insane. But in the guide verse it is genuinely the case that there is an insidious metaphysical force that will exploit any weak point to manipulate the world. So a zero tolerance attitude makes a lot more sense. Particularly since with the way stories work a "precedent" has metaphysical power of its own.

(I'd say the meta level mistake she makes is equating Good (the metaphysical force) with what is morally good, and vice versa. As arguably the heavens are just as bad for humanity as the hells. But if 90%vof the time Good is pushing people towards niceness, community and hugs, and Evil is pushing them to burn things down, mass murder and death then its an understandable position to take.)
