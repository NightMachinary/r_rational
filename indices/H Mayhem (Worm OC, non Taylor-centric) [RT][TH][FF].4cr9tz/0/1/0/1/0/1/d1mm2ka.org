Well, he sacrificed his arm to take down Hookwolf. He sacrificed his financial backing, support structure, his only remaining probable allies and his backup against enemies when he took down the empire. Though he 'beat' Armsmaster in the strictest sense of the word, I hardly think he got the best out of that encounter when he could have easily become at least neutral to the protectorate. Had he been in his right mind it would have been entirely doable to become recognised as an independent hero/neutral/at least not a villain.

To my mind just because he's got less of an emotional reaction to his changing circumstances, it doesn't mean those circumstances are much less crappy.
