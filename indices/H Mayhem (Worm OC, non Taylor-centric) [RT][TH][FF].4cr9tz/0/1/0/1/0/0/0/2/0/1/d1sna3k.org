There has been foreshadowing that this is going to lead to a bad time.

Mayhem is incredibly manipulative. I'm getting echoes of Kurama from Team Anko. Note in one of the latest chapters he tells Adam to always include 'survive' in his commands - I suspect this is because that command is what enables Mayhem as a personality. Note when he doesn't use it he simply gets an emotionless robot.
