I've really enjoyed this. It feels like his abilities could become over powered very easily but right now he has certainly suffered enough setbacks to keep things interesting.\\
This feels very original flavour, for the most part it's a grim world full of hard choices and consequence but there's definitely enough notes of humour to keep things from straying into the depressing.
