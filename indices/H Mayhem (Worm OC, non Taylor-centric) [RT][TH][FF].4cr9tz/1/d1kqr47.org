H+ Mayhem focuses on a transhumanist tinker whose ultimate goal is to kill Jack Slash. His speciality is human augmentation with a side of mental alteration. The fight scenes are good, the world makes sense, and he doesn't waste time angsting, but that is not why I am linking it here. I am linking it here because it has some of the finest characterisation I've seen in a worm fic in a long, long time. It is subtle, it is understated, and it blows me away.

It takes a few updates to get into the swing of things, so don't stop after reading just the first one.
