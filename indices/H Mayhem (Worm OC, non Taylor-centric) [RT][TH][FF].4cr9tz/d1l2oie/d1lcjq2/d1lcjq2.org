For what it's worth, the author does a good job of interrupting the progress that he makes by keeping him out of the lab for most of the narrative. This keeps him much more balanced. Also shard fuckery is part of the setting so I'd bet that the drive to conflict is calibrated even more closely with him (not spoiling past the 3rd threadmark, just speculating)
