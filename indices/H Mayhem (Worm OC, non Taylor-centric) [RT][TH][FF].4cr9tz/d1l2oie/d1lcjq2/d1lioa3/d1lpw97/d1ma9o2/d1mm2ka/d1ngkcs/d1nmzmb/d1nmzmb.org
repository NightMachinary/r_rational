I really don't see what else he could possibly have lost at the point that we started this discussion that would make you think he'd sacrificed something. Literally all he had left was a semi-functional body, his implants, and his skills. What more could he realistically lose? He had no house, no real friends, no left hand, no allies and no lab. He was maybe a couple weeks away from achieving some very important goals of his, and now he is not.

What would count as sacrifice to you?
