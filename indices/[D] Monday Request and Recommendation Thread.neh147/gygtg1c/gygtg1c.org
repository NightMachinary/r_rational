I am looking for funny fantasy stories, particularly things like online fiction/fanfiction, but any suggestions are welcome.

Some examples I enjoyed are the Discworld novels, Good Omens, Dealing With Dragons, John Dies at the End, fanfiction like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/3/Just-a-Random-Tuesday][Just a Random Tuesday]], or particularly bizarre crack fics with a plot. Really anything fantasy related and funny is good.
