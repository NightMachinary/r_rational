Any fantasy stories with rule-based systems that /aren't/ gamer fanfic? For a more inductive sense of what I'm looking for, finished Mother of Learning, which was /amazing/, and I've been reading Only Villains Do That, but Worth the Candle was just awful for me. Bailed the second I saw the skill point system.
