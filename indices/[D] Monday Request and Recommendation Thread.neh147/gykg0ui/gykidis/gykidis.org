If you know the author isn't sexist it wouldn't matter even if the work was sexist. I don't think it is though. If it was and you know the author isn't sexist you should just assume he has a point to make, or a particular theme he wants to portray..

I also don't get the people that complain about this kind of thing, most literature made before 1980s was sexist, with sexist authors, people still enjoy them and call some classics..
