i agree with you. but i haven't read either of the author's works, just heard about them, so i can't speak for his character. and i actually have trouble reading some older fiction because of the sexism/racism/religious-prejudice thing, i have no problem when they don't focus too much on it and generally will ignore it and read them anyway if they do, but it does negatively impact my enjoyment enough that i prefer newer fiction.

Edit: to clarify, i tried reading The Gods are Bastards some years back, but couldn't get into it because while i like the "Loads and Loads of Characters" trope i dislike stories with too many MCs/POVs.
