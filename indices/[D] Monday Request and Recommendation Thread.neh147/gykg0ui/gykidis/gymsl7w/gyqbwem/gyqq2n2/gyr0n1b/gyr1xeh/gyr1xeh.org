Societal roles aren't arbitrary at all in that sense; they're a reflection of the power dynamics of society. And in every society, there are plenty of people pointing out the nonsense of them, and at every timeframe of humanity there are less-fucked societies you can point to and say "Hey, this society is less fucked, why weren't you like that".

And you get silence, because they are all dead, of course.
