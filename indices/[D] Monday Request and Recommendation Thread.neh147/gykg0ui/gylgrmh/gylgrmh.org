I read most of what's published. The setting is an isekai world with quasi-medieval tech and social arrangements. As a result, many tropes from isekai (e.g. the hero having a harem) and ways in which historical society sucked for women (power imbalances, limited professional opportunities aside from adventuring, access to resources mediated by men in their life) come up a lot.

The author (to my read) goes to pains to try and present these things as bad, both narratively and from the MC's modern point view. He also tries to present the women in the universe as people with agency who've been dealt a shitty hand rather than oppressed props to be saved.

I didn't read the discussion you're talking about last week, but if you're asking because mid-1900s-style sexism in SF/F bothers you, there's nothing like that in the story that will prevent you from enjoying it. If you're asking because you explicitly liked the way The Gods Are Bastards built a fantasy world that included a lot of modern/progressive/feminist social norms baked into the worldbuilding, this new story probably won't give you that. (Although we'll have to see what happens, it seems like the MC is planning to build a more modern/progressive/feminist social order, so maybe in a few months the plot will be more of that.)
