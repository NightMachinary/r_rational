If you enjoy historical nonfiction like /The Devil in the White City/, then I highly recommend /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78508.The_River_of_Doubt][The River of Doubt]]/. It's the true story of Theodore Roosevelt's disastrous expedition to map an uncharted river in the Amazon.

Like /The Devil in the White City/, all of the dialogue and events in the novel are taken completely unaltered from historical documents such as diaries and letters. All in all, it's a very inspiring, but also cautionary tale about the furthest limits of human ambition.

From the blurb:

  After his humiliating election defeat in 1912, Roosevelt set his sights on the most punishing physical challenge he could find, the first descent of an unmapped, rapids-choked tributary of the Amazon. Together with his son Kermit and Brazil's most famous explorer, CÃ¢ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a feat so great that many at the time refused to believe it. In the process, he changed the map of the western hemisphere forever.

  Along the way, Roosevelt and his men faced an unbelievable series of hardships, losing their canoes and supplies to punishing whitewater rapids, and enduring starvation, Indian attack, disease, drowning, and a murder within their own ranks. Three men died, and Roosevelt was brought to the brink of suicide. /The River of Doubt/ brings alive these extraordinary events in a powerful nonfiction narrative thriller that happens to feature one of the most famous Americans who ever lived.
