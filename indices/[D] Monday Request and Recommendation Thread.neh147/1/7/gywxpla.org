First non-fiction book I'd reccommend to anyone, which I read at the end of high school, and stayed with me for a while, is *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom* (found [[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/131825/autumn-in-the-heavenly-kingdom-by-stephen-r-platt/][here]]). It's a history of the Taiping Rebellion, the biggest war in the 19th century that you've probably never heard of.

Fanstastically gripping and readable, expertly weaves the social and economic background in with the more biographical story of the christian-prophet-modernizer-king who rose out of nothing to the head of one of the bloodiest revolts in human history, and transitions seamlessly to incorporating grand overviews of the military campaigns and international politics without losing sight of the individuals - generals, ambassadors, mercenaries, priests - involved.
