Your criticisms are fair. I was really just impressed they did an empirical test of their solution to the time-loop instead if just deciding “hey, what if we need to do X” & having that work, so I say it was rationalist on the basis that the meta-strategy they use to get out would work in an actual time-loop situation, even if the specifics of the situation, mechanics, and solution don't really make sense.
