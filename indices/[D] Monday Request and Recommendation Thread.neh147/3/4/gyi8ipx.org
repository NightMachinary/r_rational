[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon]] is a pretty good original fantasy comedy.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14770070/chapters/34158194]] is a crack HPMOR/Rick and Morty crossover.

The Legend of Boatmurdered is a very cracky narrativization of a shared game of Dwarf Fortress. It's probably funnier if you've played the game. [[https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/]]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4]] is a funny riff on Wuxia/Xanxia tropes. [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken]] plays with similar tropes, but is less comedic and better written.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests]] is funny but kind of hit or miss.
