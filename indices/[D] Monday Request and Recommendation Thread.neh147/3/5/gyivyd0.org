Since you enjoy the /Discword/ novels and /Good Omens/, you might like /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152328.One_for_the_Morning_Glory][One for the Morning Glory]]./ It's a whimsical fantasy novel that good-naturedly pokes fun at common tropes such as renaming items to sound fantastical, ancient tomes with knowledge better left hidden, unclear prophecies, etc.

In regards to Harry Potter fanfiction, you might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love]["A Mother In Law's Love"]]. It's a satire of soulbond fics with a bawdy style of humor similar to "A Black Comedy". [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9268425/1/Honey]["Honey"]] is also a great HP fic which had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions (it's an excellent satire of manipulative-Dumbledore fics.)
