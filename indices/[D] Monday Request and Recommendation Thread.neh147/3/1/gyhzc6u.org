One of my absolute favorites is the RoyalRoad novel Dungeon Crawler Carl. The chapters up to the latest floor have been removed and published on Amazon, so you'll have to buy the first 3 volumes and then read the current chapters on RoyalRoad.

I really love the comedy, competence, and dark and tragic story, and how the novel perfectly blends it all together. That's an issue I typically find with more comedic novels, the comedy never blends well with the more serious story, and there's a lot of competence issues. Carl and his group is clever and makes the most out of the mechanics and abilities given within the System, and sometimes the comedy is even worked into major story moments brilliantly. A fantastic novel that I honestly consider to be unlike any other, with how unique and flavorful it is, but there's too much stuff to put into words and summarize here.

The only possible negative I'd attribute to Dungeon Crawler Carl is a slight lack of character writing, interaction, and building, but I think that's fine, given other characters don't matter too much and the concept of the story, and that enough is given about the main characters. Highly recommend this one.
