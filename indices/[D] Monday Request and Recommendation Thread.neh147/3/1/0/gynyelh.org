I'll second the Dungeon Crawler Carl rec. Everything said above is a good summary, but I'll add that the galactic culture that the story is set in is wonderfully, abysmally dystopic in a very believable way. It's simultaneously darkly humorous, and gritty and depressing in a way that isn't often pulled off well. I like it.
