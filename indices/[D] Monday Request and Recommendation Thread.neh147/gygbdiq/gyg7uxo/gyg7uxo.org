Once more requesting nonfiction "old man yells at cloud" books. I want angry or passionate books written about ultraspecific niche subjects: microhistories, biographies about people who you wouldn't expect biographies to be written of, polemics about tiny meaningless problems, etc. Books about or written by people who really care about Thing That Nobody Cares About.

Also looking for good nonfiction books in general. What nonfiction books do you feel have had a deep impact on you or your life? Do you know any people who have solid lists of recommended nonfiction? (Gwern, Yudowsky, authors/bloggers/anybody else with good nonfiction shill lists, stuff like that).
