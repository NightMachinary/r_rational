I'm having a lot of fun with [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns][There is no Epic Loot here, Only Puns]].

The story is dungeon core / litRPG fiction. It has occasional spelling and grammar issues, and is written at about Young Adult audience level. The author seems to have some fuzziness on their world's mechanics. A frequent theme is the experience of adventure as something cool vs min/maxing. The author appears to be pretty solidly on the side of play experience.
