I recently watched the movie Palm Springs. It was very good, and somewhat rationalist! Spoilers for why, reveals a plot-point involved in resolution: They use the scientific method to escape the time-loop. Not just random mumbo-jumbo. They take a goat & test their theory for how to escape empirically.
