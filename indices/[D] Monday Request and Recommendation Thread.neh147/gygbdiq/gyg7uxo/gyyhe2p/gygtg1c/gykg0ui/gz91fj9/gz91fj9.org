Schild's Ladder. Really good, really out there ideas. Based on hard sci-fi yet ends up with things far more novel than any soft sci fi. Perhaps the most alien xenobiology that someone's actually tried to describe. Nice ideas about the far future. I liked the description of The Silencer physics laboratory. Lots of navalgazing about the nature of identity, not that that's a bad thing, the philosophy was often interesting. The conflict felt forced to keep the readers attention, it did work though, it's almost 4am here. I think it was a bit strange that there was only one laboratory described flying next to the horizon, lightspeed would have meant others wouldn't have played much of a role but I think they should have been talked about. There were some other inconsistencies and oddities but I guess every story has those.
