Ehhh. I loved it as a comedy and I'd second the rec on that basis, but I don't know if I'd call it rational, let alone rationalist. Setting up that kind of expectation might lead to disappointment.

The rules for time travel seemed to be inconsistent, for starters. IIRC they blow up the goat and the goat disappeared from the next time loop. They took that as proof that it worked and blow themselves up. But in the next loop, JK Simmons meets a version of the non-timelooped version of Nyles. Shouldn't he disappear from the loop like the goat did?(I might be misremembering this one, it's been a while)

Also the characters themselves. They left behind JK Simmons with just a voicemail to explain how to leave? What if he never got the voicemail for whatever reason? Why not just do it in the next loop after talking to him since there was absolutely no hurry to leave in that specific loop? Did they leave it to chance that they might consign this guy to an eternity in the loop just so they could leave as soon as possible?

Finally, the solution to the loop. The idea that one could make progress in a highly complex field of physics(starting as a complete beginner!) with zero ability to keep your notes and equations from one day to the next is kinda far fetched. But that's a minor quibble, tbf.

That reminds me, if you want a great, rational time travel movie, check out Predestination. It's on netflix in my country(canada).
