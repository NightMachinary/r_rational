Generally I'd say that it's possible to criticize a literary work for its sexism while also enjoying it and/or calling it a classic. (Though most of the classics suck. Bite me, Wuthering Heights, you were shit when you were written and you've always been shit!) I can acknowledge the seminal place of Asimov in SF literature while also complaining that his writing is sexist as all fuck, and don't even get me started on Heinlein.
