I've been following this story since then and I love it. I think its sexism status has not changed, but it wasn't really as bad as you seem to remember.

As far as I understood from the thread at the time, the sexist thing that it does is to portray violence from men towards women as uniquely bad, and appeal to royalroad "white knight" sensitivities a lot. I agree that is sexist, but is not the usual kind of sexist.

Other than that, it depicts an incredibly sexist (and racist, and speciesist; and overall miserable) society. The protagonist is a modern-day Japanese protagonist that is kind of an asshole but not a terrible guy overall, so he is much less sexist than the setting (if at all).

The hero (not the protagonist) has a harem, which is sexist, but is there to follow Isekai tropes humorously.
