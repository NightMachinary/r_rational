Kinoko Nasu has some of the best rules based fantasy around, but he delights in non-omniscient veiwpoint characters, which means you have to peice things together yourself (or find someone who has already done so, I suppose). It's legitimately one of the best examples of this imo, but it's not delivered in the most reader friendly way so unless you also enjoy his works on their other merits (and the Fate works are good) then it might not be wort the investment.

You've had mistborn recced to you; that one is great. Stormlight Archives by the same author has a similarly great rules system but it's less well known in universe and thus less spelled out in text early on, also good fiction though.

Order of the Stick is a great webcomic example of this.
