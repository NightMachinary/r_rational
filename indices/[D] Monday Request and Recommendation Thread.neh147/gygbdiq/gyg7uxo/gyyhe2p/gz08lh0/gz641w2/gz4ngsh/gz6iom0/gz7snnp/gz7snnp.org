I feel obligated to point out that the skill point system only plays a tiny, tiny part of worth the candle. Like I honestly can't remember the last time that gaining points in a skill was remotely part of the plot. Juniper maxes everything he can fairly quickly and then the only relevant part is unlocking new skills/magics.

His skills are important, but it's only in abstract, there's no number games. If that's the only reason you didn't read it then you're missing out on a really great story.
