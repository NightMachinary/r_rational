You could take a look at [[https://mostrecommendedbooks.com/alan-kay-books][these recommended books by Alan Kay]]. If you haven't read it already, I recommend [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker][The Power Broker]] by Robert Caro, and if you have read it, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Years_of_Lyndon_Johnson][his series on LBJ]]. Haven't heard of anyone who didn't get into those who is even slightly interested in nonfiction and got started with them.

I'd also recommend [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0041OT8O0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][The Devil in the White City]], which is a true achievement. It weaves together the story of the people who put together the Chicago World's Fair with the true story of a prolific serial killer who preyed on young women at the fair.

Edit: missed your yells at clouds angle, though honestly the above will be more useful to more people. But you could try [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ULOPUY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony]], definitely a yells at clouds book but also pretty good. I'm very anti-monopoly and enjoyed [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HRLQSLG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][The Curse of Bigness]] on the modern tech trusts.
