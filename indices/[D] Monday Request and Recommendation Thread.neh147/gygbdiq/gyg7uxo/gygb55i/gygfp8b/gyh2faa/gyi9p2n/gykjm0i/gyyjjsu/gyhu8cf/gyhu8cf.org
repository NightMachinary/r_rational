Many capable influential people have book lists, pick one you like and look it up. Here's Bill Gates': [[https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books]]

I read a lot of non fiction, but I do it with a purpose, to gather / learn specific information / skills. I build my TBR list from various sources across many of my interests (no I'm not comfortable sharing it). When somebody you like recs or mentions a book google it and add the amazon / goodreads page to a favorites folder. At least that's how I started.
