[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarettes_are_Sublime][Cigarettes are Sublime]] is perhaps up your alley in terms of being a weird, esoteric undertaking that Nobody Really Cares About. Basically a defense of the cultural value of cigarettes, their literary value, iconicity and symbolic virtues, written by a French professor trying to quite his own smoking habit. The whole thing kind of feels like an ironic joke, carried out in a very serious and thorough manner.
