not exactly what you mean, but Discworld series by Terry Pratchett features a character, The Patritian, who is a hyper-rationalist/utilitarian autocrat, and rules a city state with an +iron fist+ exactly measured and impassionately pragmatic fist.

He is rationalist and utilitarian almost to the point of parody. He has exactly 2 traits that are not optimised for rational practicality: his love for crossword puzzles, and his hate of mimes.
