It's not a book, but some of Ada Palmer's blog posts might scratch that itch. [[https://www.exurbe.com/black-death-covid-and-why-we-keep-telling-the-myth-of-a-renaissance-golden-age-and-bad-middle-ages/]] in particular comes to mind.

ACOUP might also be what you're looking for. One of the things he does is big (as in 7 or 8 long blog posts) writeups on the historical accuracy of fictional battles. [[https://acoup.blog/2020/05/01/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-i-bargaining-for-goods-at-helms-gate/]] is good, for example. He also has some nonfiction recommendations in his area of expertise.
