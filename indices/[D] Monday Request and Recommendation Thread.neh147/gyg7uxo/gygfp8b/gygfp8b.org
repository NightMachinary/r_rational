Oh man, it's not surprising these books were never translated, but there's a woman named Maria Romanushko who wrote four (!) books about a (relatively obscure even on the post-USSR territory) Soviet mime [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Yengibarov][Leonid Yengibarov]]. I can try to find an EPUB or something so you can check it out via DeepL (it handles Russian rather well) if you want to. It absolutely blew my mind several years ago that someone was obsessed enough to produce four published books.
