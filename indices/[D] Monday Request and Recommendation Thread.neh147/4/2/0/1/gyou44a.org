Yes definitely criticizing something and enjoying it aren't mutually exclusive. But what I was referring here was more in a sense of 'not reading it because of the criticism', imho that's not optimal for many reasons.

In my view a work being 'insert criticism here' should not dissuade people from reading. Sure keep the criticism in mind let it alter your interpretation, avoid supporting the author if you feel the need to, but do not let it keep you from experiencing different types of fiction that could inspire you to create something new and fresh.
