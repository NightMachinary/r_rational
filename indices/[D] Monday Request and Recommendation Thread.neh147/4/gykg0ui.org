a couple of threads back someone discussed how D. D. Webb's new fiction, Only Villains Do That, was kind of sexist and how that was weird because his previous work The Gods are Bastards was pretty progressive and even had an mc who was a paladin from the goddess of war and feminism. so, has that changed since? because the tvtropes says: "Equal-Opportunity Evil: Seiji has shown disgust at the sexism and racism present in Ephemera, and judging by the reactions of the other bandits he treated the goblins considerably better than most do."
