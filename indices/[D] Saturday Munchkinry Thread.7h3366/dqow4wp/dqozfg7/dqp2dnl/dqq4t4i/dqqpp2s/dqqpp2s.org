At the same time there will be finger pointing towards the whole russia thing(s), emails, et cetera. I expect politics will become a clusterfuck in degrading proportions from top to bottom, simply because of the investment of people in it.

[[/u/ShiranaiWakaranai]], would in your scenario basically the old brain fully rewritten, including chemical imbalances and acquired neural structural changes (minus the age deficit?), or would it simply be a magical memory download? I'm wondering, since just having new information won't necessarily be enough for people to change their worldview (latter case), but if the person with the changed worldview is suddenly in its former body... well, that's a slightly different scenario.

The imperfect transplication, the pure memory dump that is, without the changes in worldview and experience and personal growth, would harbour more potential for conflict I'd think.
