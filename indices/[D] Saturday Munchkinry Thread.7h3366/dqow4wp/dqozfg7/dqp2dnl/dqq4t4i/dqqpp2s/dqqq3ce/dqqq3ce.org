I didn't really consider the scenario to that level of detail. In my head, people simply blinked and found themselves in their bodies 10 years ago. They would feel like they time traveled back 10 years, rather than feeling like they gained memories from some future version of themselves. So if they have new worldviews, they keep those new worldviews. If they have learned new things, like how to ride a bicycle, they still remember those new things.

But I have no idea how to justify the various chemical differences needed for the physical manifestation of those memories in their brains, other than handwaving it off as "time magic".
