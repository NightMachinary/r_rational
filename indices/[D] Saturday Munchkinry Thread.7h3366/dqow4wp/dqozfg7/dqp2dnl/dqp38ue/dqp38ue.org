...there are going to be some /extremely/ embarrassing situations in those first ten minutes after the reset. Some guy who had a very acrimonious divorce in 2012 suddenly eating supper at the same table as his wife, for example, is going to need to be /very/ diplomatic /very/ quickly (as will the wife) or they're going to end up with broken crockery.

People who suddenly 'wake up' driving are going to be in serious trouble for about ten to fifteen minutes, though they'll likely be fine if they have quick reactions.

There will probably be a spate of sudden arrests, and the legal question of 'can you put someone in jail for something they haven't done yet?' will actually need to be seriously considered in court.
