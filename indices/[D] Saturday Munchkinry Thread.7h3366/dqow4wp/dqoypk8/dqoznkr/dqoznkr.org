  Well, I would have (most of) a college education and no debt, so I got that going for me, which is nice. Shame about the credentials though.

Well, since most people would keep their memories, couldn't your college give credentials to the people that they remember graduating? Hope someone remembers you did!

  Other than that, I think that some of the other millions of people would suck up the easy opportunities.

Well, what are the easy opportunities here anyway? If you tried making a book/movie that you didn't originally make, the original makers and the people who remember could still try to sue you.
