Well, I would have (most of) a college education and no debt, so I got that going for me, which is nice. Shame about the credentials though.

Other than that, I think that some of the other millions of people would suck up the easy opportunities. Popular media could be rebuilt fairly easily (TV shows, books, etc.), and prospecting could as well. Science and technology would be harder (and I don't have any particular specialties there), but very highly prioritized for obvious reasons.
