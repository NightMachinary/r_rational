Well, the one-off exams that the universities allow will of course not be /free/ exams, so the university will get a certain amount of money right upfront. And they will be strictly marked, with the red pen on standby (because, as you point out, the university /does/ want students).

And there will be some people who will reclaim their degrees - and immediately get started on a second degree, because they can afford it and/or they really loved the campus life.

And then there's the ones who died in the interval in the original timeline...

So, yeah. Universities will get a chunk of money up front from the re-sat exams, but then have a bunch of very lean years. I expect they'll be doing a lot of encouraging people to go for second degrees (and pointing out that the job market just gained a massive amount of competition - the guy who you would have replaced in five years from now hasn't retired yet...)
