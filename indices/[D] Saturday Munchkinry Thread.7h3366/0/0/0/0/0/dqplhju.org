The college would want to get paid. In a utopia where we're trying to maximize public value it would be best for society to just give back all of the degrees that can be verified, but as individuals the college wants your money. And arguably has a right to it. They spent years teaching you stuff in exchange for your tuition money. When time gets rewound all of the money you gave them is magically transported back into your bank account, but all of the teaching they gave you is still in your brain.

This actually brings up an interesting moral conundrum. Should you have to give them the money again? For most careers that produce physical goods or services, the things they accomplished during those years have vanished, so whoever purchased it no longer has it, they certainly shouldn't have to pay for a good that they no longer have. However the workers have regained the time they spent, so if they want to get paid again they need to do the work again.

However in intellectual work such as teaching, the product has not been lost. The teacher or professor spent ten years teaching people, or doing research, and even though the fruits of their labor still exist, the money they were paid for that labor is now magically back in the bank accounts of the people who learned from them. Or actually, the money doesn't exist because the people, or their parents, likely earned the tuition money during that time and will have to re-earn the money by doing jobs. However, the teachers can't "redo" the work in the same way other people could, because there is no a shortage of knowledgeable students. Suddenly, people aged 8-18 don't need to be taught in public schools, people aged 12-24 have likely already graduated college and will no longer need to attend. For the next ten years, the vast majority of people who would be attending college already have. So if they don't have to repay their tuition, or really even if they do, a lot of teachers and professors will have to be laid off because they already did their jobs in the alternate timeline.

Your solution is great for students, not so great for the teachers (and I'm not sure what is, they're kind of screwed no matter what we do)
