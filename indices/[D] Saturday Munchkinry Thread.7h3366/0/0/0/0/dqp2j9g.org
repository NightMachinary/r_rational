  Well, since most people would keep their memories, couldn't your college give credentials to the people that they remember graduating? Hope someone remembers you did!

The college would want to show fairness and a lack of favouritism in a way that leaves a paper trail.

Most likely, they'll (once-off) allow a set of exams for just about every degree that just about anyone can take with some fairly minimal cost, so if you can show in the exam that you still know your stuff, you can re-obtain your degree in double-quick time.
