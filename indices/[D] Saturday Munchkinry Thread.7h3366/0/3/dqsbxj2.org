Honestly, I think this would, by and large, be a huge gift. It'll be (a bit less than) ten extra years of life for everyone affected. Excepting the people who died in the interim (who will be extraordinarily confused) to everyone else it's still basically 2017. Our technology's taken a bit of a hit, and records from the intervening time will obviously have disappeared, but across scientists and academics, we'll retain much of the information we've learnt in the interim, as well as much of our worldview. There would be significant upheaval with our legal system, but such change would be temporary. Meanwhile, by the time we got around to 2017 again, the world's technology base would look more like 2023/2024 or so.

From a more personal perspective, it would suck incredibly hard for all the young adults now in child or teenager bodies, and especially for those who have since broken ties with their families for one reason or another. It would be quite the tragedy for all the children younger than ten to be effectively "killed". I predict a rash of suicides and sexual abuse cases in the immediate aftermath. That being said, the issues caused by legislation (not being considered a legal adult) can be solved with legislation, and while certainly a lot of people will be in a lot of pain, I'm perhaps naive in thinking that for most people, there would only be a few years of true suck, and after that they'd regain most of their autonomy.

In terms of exploiting the situation, outside of edge cases involving taking advantage of the relative chaos in the early months, I think it's largely dependent on your own initial conditions. I think most people would basically end up just making a few better health decisions.

Oh, and also climate change would be delayed by 10 years, and with the massive boost to solar panel/wind turbine technology, even without the documentation, the time skip would end up being pretty great for the environment.

edit: now that I think about this, it would make a fantastic writing prompt. Post it there and see how it works out! Send me a link and I'll try and write something.
