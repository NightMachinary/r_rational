  And you have to wonder what about the people who died in-between? Are they reset as well, with the knowledge up till their time of death? Or will they not be affected at all and feel shifted by fate, doubly so for being dead in ten years and for not having a leg up in knowledge and experience like all the others got?

From the OP, you have to be alive at both points to keep your memory. So basically, everyone currently living that's above the age of then retains their memories.
