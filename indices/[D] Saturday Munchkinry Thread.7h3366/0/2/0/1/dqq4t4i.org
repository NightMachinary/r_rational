  Politics world wide will be in some upheaval or another, since all the scandals making certain politicians ineligible in hindsight will now have become unvotable in â€˜presight'. International sanctions will be made harsher if they weren't effective.

There's going to be an immediate conflict between the world leaders who were in power 10 years ago and the ones that are in power now.

E.g. Donald Trump and his supporters will argue that magical forces re-winding time don't change the fact that Trump was elected President and everyone in the country knows it. Meanwhile his opponents (likely bolstered by those who think this is a sign from God or whatever) will argue that it's /verifiably/ 2007, and every record on Earth shows George Bush is the POTUS with almost a year still to go in his presidency.

There will be a lot of arguing over the legal definition of "year".
