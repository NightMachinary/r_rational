  Politics world wide will be in some upheaval or another, since all the scandals making certain politicians ineligible in hindsight will now have become unvotable in ‘presight'.

Suddenly this time reset feels very tantalizing. XD

  The 2008 sub-prime crisis that lead to the recession that followed will start a year early, to name just one thing.

And now it's not :(. Damn economics.

  On a more granular level of society, there will be a sudden surge of ‘genius' kids, again because of the education injection. The affected kids will learn the repeat material easier (since it's repeated), but at the same time will likely be less motivated (because they already did this).

Couldn't students just skip 10 grades ahead? I mean, it would probably be pretty tedious sorting out who gets to advance how many grades, since some people may have been held back or dropped out or died and so shouldn't be advanced 10 grades, but overall it should be doable...

  And you have to wonder what about the people who died in-between? Are they reset as well, with the knowledge up till their time of death? Or will they not be affected at all and feel shifted by fate, doubly so for being dead in ten years and for not having a leg up in knowledge and experience like all the others got?

In this scenario no. Anyone who isn't alive now doesn't get a memory transfer. Same for anyone who was conceived within the last 10 years. You have to be alive both now and 10 years ago.

Though on the plus side, if you died within the last 10 years, and time reset back to the point when you're alive, isn't that incredibly lucky for you? Most people just got some extra knowledge, you get to literally cheat death. Ask people what killed you and avoid it this time.

Unless it's unavoidable, like a terminal illness you already have, in which case RIP. :(

Oh yeah someone recommended this to me a while back, I kinda forgot about it until now. It seems fairly interesting.

  Overall a very interesting and intriguing idea for a novel, actually, with potential for heaps of drama on all kinds of levels, be they character or societal.

I so wish I had the writing ability to do this. Like [[/u/CCC_037]] suggested, just the divorces alone would be dramatic chaos. Especially if the divorce was because of something like a child dying/miscarriage, yet the child is alive and healthy now...
