  Anyone who isn't alive now doesn't get a memory transfer. Same for anyone who was conceived within the last 10 years.

What about someone conceived but not yet born? There's a nine-month gap in there, no doubt /someone/ will be exactly the right age...

And what about children who were nine years old pre-reset? Can they even be born again, or would one merely get a sibling for them?

  Though on the plus side, if you died within the last 10 years, and time reset back to the point when you're alive, isn't that incredibly lucky for you? Most people just got some extra knowledge, you get to literally cheat death. Ask people what killed you and avoid it this time.

If it's more than six months away, it almost certainly won't happen the same way again - too much will change.

  Like [[/u/CCC_037]] suggested, just the divorces alone would be dramatic chaos. Especially if the divorce was because of something like a child dying/miscarriage, yet the child is alive and healthy now...

"You cheated on me with that hussy!"

"No I didn't! Yet! I mean, you can't divorce me based on something I haven't done!"

"Is THAT your excuse?"

"Well - no, wait, wait, dear, put down the vase, dear, we can discuss this like rational adults -"
