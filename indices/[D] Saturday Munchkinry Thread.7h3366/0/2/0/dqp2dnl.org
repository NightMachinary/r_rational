That is a good point. Politics world wide will be in some upheaval or another, since all the scandals making certain politicians ineligible in hindsight will now have become unvotable in ‘presight'. International sanctions will be made harsher if they weren't effective.

The same goes for a lot of economics. The 2008 sub-prime crisis that lead to the recession that followed will start a year early, to name just one thing.

In academia and universities you might see an uptick in demands of merit-testing for all those who want to get their degrees reinstated, despite not having yet gone through the courses this time around.

Furthermore, you will have a sudden influx of more competent, or at least more well-educated people insofar as people will have crammed the last 10 years of education crammed into their heads. This will wreak havoc with schools, to name just one thing.

On a more granular level of society, there will be a sudden surge of ‘genius' kids, again because of the education injection. The affected kids will learn the repeat material easier (since it's repeated), but at the same time will likely be less motivated (because they already did this). This will affect testing parameters something fierce, I think, with more the bell curve flattening in that regard.

On a more personal level, people will be going to take measure to deflect whatever tragedies befell them in the last 10 years. This may be in preventative measures, but also in shortcuts. If you know you'll be in dire straits for the next ten years, a mentally unbalanced person may decide to take the permanent way out to relieve their suffering, which is why I expect there to be a lot of suicides.

And you have to wonder what about the people who died in-between? Are they reset as well, with the knowledge up till their time of death? Or will they not be affected at all and feel shifted by fate, doubly so for being dead in ten years and for not having a leg up in knowledge and experience like all the others got?

Personally, I have little ambition to go for world domination and such. I would simply avoid a lot of shit and stupid procrastination best I can and call it a win. And I'd try to keep a couple friends from stupid life choices, I suppose.

If you want to read one exploration of an adjacent idea, you may want to read “Fast Forward” by ...Wilson, I think. Somewhat similar premise, with all of humanity being in the respective heads of their X years in the future versions for a couple minutes. The early part of the novel deals more with the immediate chaos that ensued when all of humanity suddenly fell unconscious for the time they went to the future.

Overall a very interesting and intriguing idea for a novel, actually, with potential for heaps of drama on all kinds of levels, be they character or societal.
