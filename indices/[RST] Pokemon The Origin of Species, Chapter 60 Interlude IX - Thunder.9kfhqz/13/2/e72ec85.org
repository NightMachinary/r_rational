Yeah I wondered about that. I think it is the author's perogative to do some world building while we wait for GameFreak to catch up, but I think it's a little muddy here. The Inuit and Sioux are not exactly New York adjacent. I wonder if a play on the Iroquois confederation might feel more appropriate geographically.
