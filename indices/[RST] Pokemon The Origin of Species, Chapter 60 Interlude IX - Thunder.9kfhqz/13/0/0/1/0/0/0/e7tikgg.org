Okay so you're argument is basically that humans would be too focused on surviving to actually fight each other? That sounds valid on paper, but it never works in real life. When resources become more valuable, conflict increases, not decreases. Perhaps a more related comparison would be the zombie apocalypse. Quite a bit of literature has been written on varying types of zombie apocalypses, and no matter how bad the zombies are, it's unanimously agreed that other humans are more of a threat than the zombies. It doesn't matter if they're slow Walking Dead zombies or ridiculous World War Z zombies or the unkilable Train To Busan zombies, the humans kill more than the zombies do. And humans aren't exactly great at resource management, just because a resource is valuable doesn't mean they won't throw it away for some bullshit. And as I said somewhere else, in a world where a strong team of pokemon is rare, literally one guy with a Charizard could take over a country on his own. The kids in this story right now would straight up be able to solo a decently sized village if not a city. Brock could do so with just one pokemon.

Side note, Im starting to realize the woman who wrote World War Z (and the Zombie Survival Guide) kinda predated this whole rational thing.
