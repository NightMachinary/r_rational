Is it implied that pokemon can only be domesticated through pokeballs? I was under the impression that many, if not all, were tamable and that pokeballs only magnified the process. In that case, war wouldn't be on the scale we see here but a guy who makes friends with a charmander when he was a kid is going to be able to take over a couple of villages at least later on.

It does seem like suuuper large scale societies aren't really a thing. Unova, Kanto, Johto etc don't really seem very big. Unova's map might just be based off of New York, maybe it's actually a bigger region, but even then I doubt it's bigger than New York State.
