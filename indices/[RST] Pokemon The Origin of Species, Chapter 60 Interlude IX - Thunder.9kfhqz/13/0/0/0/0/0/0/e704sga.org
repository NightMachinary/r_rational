Holy shit that's even more insane to think that Pokemon might only be a middle class+ thing. Can you imagine how much worse class divisions would be if the wealthy legit had fire breathing dragons ready to ride around? Most fully evolved Pokemon are stronger than most Marvel superheros/villains. Thank god they have this renegade shit going on because class warfare would be insane in this universe. But then again maybe it's just some horse-riding kind of thing, the Renegade laws make it hard to use it for legit oppression but indirectly its probably a lot harder to survive in that world without pokemon of your own considering how much of a threat wild pokemon are. I mean I think we've had quite a few tier 3 events in this story already and I don't think it's been a full year yet.

But I am still curious about how the smaller city states are explained. I think it'd take a bit more convincing to say that the presence of Pokemon is enough of a reason for humans to have only gotten so far with their expanding their regions. It seems like it took them around 3 days for the two journeys between Cerulean and Brock's city and Pallet Town. That puts the region maybe at the size of Ireland? And it's not implied that the other regions are that much bigger, otherwise that would be mentioned more. We know they've at least tried to take shit over in the past, so it's not like they're peaceful than normal human.
