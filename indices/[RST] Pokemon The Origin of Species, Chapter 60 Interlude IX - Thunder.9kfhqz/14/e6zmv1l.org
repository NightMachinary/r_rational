Fantastic chapter, had a lot of great world building to it. The part about Blue and Surge and the Zapdos was really well done, I wanna see more about how Surge prepared for war and whether he can do anything about Blue, but by far the best part was the beginning with the war. Seeing how war is in this 'verse is really interesting. Its also interesting to see you make up a new region. So this chapter gave a lot more insight (and a lot more questions!) about the larger scale geopolitics of this world. You've gone beyond explaining pokemon genetically and gotten to how military tactics would evolve around pokemon. At the very least, talking about whether these people are expansionist might hint towards whether humans are naturally that way or if we are that way culturally or if they simply wouldn't be naturally that way in a world with pokemon. This also kinda plays into the whole vegan thing because we probably wouldn't have evolved to eat as much meat if we weren't the Apex predator in every continent. Are all the regions in this universe small? I can't see Unova as being bigger than New York State. Do they all have a pokemon league? Is this world mostly wilderness with small pockets of strong human civilizations? Or is the entire world populated (like ours) but everything is small nation states, comparable to Europe or how the US would look if every state was it's own country. Its presumed that the power of pokemon would make large countries difficult to maintain, especially before pokeballs, but it's also implied that pokemon were still tamable before pokeballs, so war would and territorial expansion would still have existed. And Surge mentioned how entire regions used to get wiped out, so its not like regions are a new thing. But in the real world the expansion of a nation is limited by transportation, which these guys have in spades. So are wild pokemon really more of a boon to expansionist states than a lack of transportation? Again, it is possible that culturally they wouldn't be more peaceful because they wouldn't have been predators like humans in our universe were, but it probably is worth exploring.

And then how does war interact with pokemon? Being able to teleport away is huge, it makes kamikazes super viable, especially when kamikaze planes can have voltorbs in them. The fact that a hyper beam can probably bust through anything makes big tanks and big aircraft carriers not very strong. Or if those things are able to withstand anything BUT a hyper beam then hyper beam will become very important. And pokemon who can defend against those high power attacks would be super strong, being able to put a protective bubble around one of those helicopters would have been a W. And what about bullets? I presume a machine gun would rip through any of the bird pokemon, and we have confirmation that guns are a thing in the show (episode where Ash mistook a camera for a gun). Are pokemon that are resistant to metal type attacks also resistant to bullets? If so, by how much? Do bullets just bounce of Charizard or is it more like his skin is a bullet proof vest? The way that bullets, missiles, and explosions interact with the typing stuff could have huge implications on what's strong in battle.

Also I totally see you setting up for Blue to start to side with Giovanni. Giving Blue a way to kill the birds might be too big for him to pass up, and he already kinda idolizes the dude anyway. Maybe he won't go complete turn coat but I can see you're gonna do some interesting things with that.
