Eelectross brought a smile to my face, it's definitely one of my favourite electric types, alongside Jolteon. I've used Giga Drain Eelectross on Smogon to great effect. It feels great when an unsuspecting opponent counters with a ground type only to find their attacks completely ineffective and being beaten about the head with life steal.

I would have countered Surge by having Rhyhorn lead with Smack Down and quickly followed up with an Earthquake.
