Has it been explained yet why the storm birds attack cities, when other legendaries don't? Is Arceus or Lugia mad at humanity or something? If not, I can't wait for that reveal!

Do humans in this world even know that the other legendaries exist? They reference Arceus, but as a religious figure. Has anybody ever seen Kyogre or Groundon?

Also, what are humans in this world? There doesn't seem to be any other normal animals in this world, just pokemon. Are these humans just a really weak normal type, that traded almost all of their ability to use moves for increased intelligence, or is humanity a whole separate branch on the tree of life? Some humans are psychic, and some are dark, so they don't seem entirely unrelated to pokemon.
