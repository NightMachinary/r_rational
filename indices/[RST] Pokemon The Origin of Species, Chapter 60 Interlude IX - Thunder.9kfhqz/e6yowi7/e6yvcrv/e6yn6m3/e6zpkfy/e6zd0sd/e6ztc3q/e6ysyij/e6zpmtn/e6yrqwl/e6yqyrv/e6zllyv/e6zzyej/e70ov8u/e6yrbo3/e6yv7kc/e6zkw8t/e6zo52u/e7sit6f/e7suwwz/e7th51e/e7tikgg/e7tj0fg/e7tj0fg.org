Not to not fight, but dangerous enough not to risk their trainers and their trained Pokemon in a war. Each Pokemon lost is years of training gone.

You are right about the charizard stuff. And Surge mentions warlords taking over regions. That would happen. But I expect they wouldn't fight large scale battles like this. A charizard would take a lot of training to control, And you aren't going to risk it fighting in open war. You just subjugate those weaker than you. Fear of losing is a powerful motivator. I expect before the pokeballs and the League, cities were ruled by the equivalent of gym leaders. Who held political power in addition to pokemon.
