A sword isn't on the same level as a gun, but people still did a loooot of damage before guns were around. It isn't entirely about the power of your own weapon, it's about the power of your weapon relative to the power of their weapons. Riding a dragon into battle is insane in a world without pokeballs, especially since it's probably a pretty rare thing to have that strong of a pokemon before pokeballs. Having an army of monsters makes you an average citizen in this story, having a charizard in a world where people are still in the feudal age makes you strong enough to almost start an empire on your own.
