Well cities have to have defensible positions to avoid being destroyed by Pokemon incidents. I imagine plenty show up and fall over time.

Being nearby to each other probably gives the region's connectivity. Which is only increased with the modern technology and safety from Pokeballs.

And when you have a safe region, why would you go to the wilderness inbetween them? The areas outside would probably be colonies of nearby regions, which is the seeming cause of the war in Unova.
