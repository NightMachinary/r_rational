They are on opposite ends of the continent, and if that holds true for the Pokemon world we are potentially looking at a continent's worth of wilds being upset. It may be that Inuvik is losing a way of life in those wilds, but it's more likely that Unovan development is displacing the wildlife and increasing the threat to Inuvika cities from the likes of Volcarona, Haxorus, and Darmanitan.

If activities in Hoenn resulted in an increased threat to Kanto from Dragonite and Gyarados, you can bet that Kanto would take action.
