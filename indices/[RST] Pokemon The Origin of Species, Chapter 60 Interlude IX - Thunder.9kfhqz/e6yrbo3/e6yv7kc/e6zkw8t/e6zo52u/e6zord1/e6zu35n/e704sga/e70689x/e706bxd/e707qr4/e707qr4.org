We will have to ask [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] so that he makes the schoolboy error of publicly committing to a specific size regardless of story needs so that we can pick over travel times for every inconsistency.

That way it can be a huge scandal when Red and Leaf are cornered by Shadow Pokemon while abroad and send an emergency message from Shiver Camp to Victory Road via Murkrow, resulting Lance successfully flying his Dragonites to the rescue by the following morning.

And tragically loses his fan-favourite Aerodactyl to a well-aimed /Icicle Spear/ attack, but that reaction will be lost to the supersonic Murkrow controversy.
