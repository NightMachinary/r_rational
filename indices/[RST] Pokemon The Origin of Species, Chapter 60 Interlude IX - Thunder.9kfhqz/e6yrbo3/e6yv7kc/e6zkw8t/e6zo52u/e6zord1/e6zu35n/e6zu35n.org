That's the impression I get from the story, that warlords ravaged the world, or protected a small piece of it.

Though I get the distinct impression that the average citizen is not a trainer armed with six+ pseudo-legendaries. Trainers clearly receive a lot of state support to do what they do (for starters, the manufacture of Pokeballs must surely be subsidised to keep them affordable), and I doubt that would work if everyone was in on it. Laura seems more like an average citizen, who had no Pokemon in adulthood at all until she purchased a Tangela that had already received basic training.
