That seems fair.

I guess the next bigger thing is the distance between regions. The war was instigated because of expansion into the wilderness near the other region. Something that wouldn't be possible without stable regions. They don't have time to expand when they need to rebuild cities every century or so. Besides there are nearby cities to fight before inter-regional warfare.

I would say the lack of ability to build such infrastructure would prevent wars like this. At least for the most part. You have to worry about a forest fire spiraling out of control or a rampaging Onyx.
