  Not to not fight, but dangerous enough not to risk their trainers and their trained Pokemon in a war. Each Pokemon lost is years of training gone.

You're right, logically that would be how it works. But humans aren't logical, and humans are even less logical when they're constantly under threat. Rationally, they'd be reckless with their pokemon and some would even benefit massively from being reckless.

  And you aren't going to risk it fighting in open war.

Depends on what the war wins you. And these "open wars" don't have to be that large scale. Maybe these warlords get an army population in the thousands. So that's a 5K humans on each side along with maybe 40 big pokemon and 200 lesser pokemon. I suppose the humans involved would have spears and arrows. Now unless your the South humans don't usually start a war unless they think they can win. So you wouldn't usually see even battles like that, but lets say you do.

Although now you got me thinking of how humans would even far in a pokemon world without pokeballs. In the real world, humans "counter" large animals (we evolved to hunt water buffalo in Africa) and are countered by insects (no fur). In the pokemon world, our ability to chase prey down probably would not be nearly as effective, but our pack hunting and our weapon usage would still at least challenge a Tauros. Also our main counter in nature, insects, are now giant sized. Believe it or not, this actually helps us. In fact, we would probably hunt Beedrill. Any physical based attacker that is fairly large and doesn't have armor that would resist spears would be pretty good for us. Just skimming through the first gen, most bug types, Venasaur, Raticate, Wigglituff, Poliwrath, Dugong, Lickitung, Seaking, Kangaskhan, Seadra, Chansey, the eeveelutions, and they MIGHT be able to hunt flying types and fighting types. Of course with the stuff there's always the important question of how much food you get out the hunt, but considering killing two beedrill is probably more valuable now than a single buffalo was, so while many of these mons might have high risk, they also have much higher reward than our traditional prey.
