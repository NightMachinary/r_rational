I don't think they would ever be as effective. Maybe with a single Pokemon. But pokeballs give you numbers and versatility. You can habe an arsenal of Pokemon for each trainer.

Not to mention that taking decades to fully train means that they are valuable resources. And they need to defend against the much more imminent Pokemon rampages, They don't have much oppurtunity for war, let alone war that risks their trainers and trained pokemon.
