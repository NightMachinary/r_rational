For about a paragraph after Surge declined the gym challenge, I thought Blue would eventually end up getting a PITY BADGE from his city defense.

I'm surprised Membership is an easier challenge than Mastery. I guess I headcanon'd that formal Membership was reserved for higher up positions who might need to challenge/teach veteran trainers, lest the gym leader spend all their time in Membership battles against whatever random Lass wants to hang around.
