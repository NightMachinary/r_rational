I think the sooner this problem gets addressed the better, because the current version will only be keeping gaining momentum if it's left untouched. It's much easier to change something now when there's only yet ~7,000 readers here than further down the line when the number of active participants will increase.

I can also see fans or authors trying to label a story as a rational one even if it's full of your regular bad writing tropes just for the additional bragging rights and\or marketing opportunities (e.g. advertising through [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic][TVTropes.org/RationalFic,]] through relevant goodreads bookshelves, etc).

One problem I can see is that different people will have different definitions of what they consider a rational story. One thing that can help with this is trying to collect a bunch of different definitions and see which ones become “adopted” the most.

Another thing would be formulating the definitions in such a way that they will allow for a “sliding scale” of rationalism on multiple axes. If we try to break down the “rational” genre into smaller “sub-tropes”, then here are some of the themes (regardless of how “justified” they are) that are usually prevalent in the stories that people often associate with this emerging genre:

1.  rational protagonists

    - rational inhabitants --- an expectation that /all/ characters in the story will be acting in a rational manner
    - straw Vulcan pseudo-rational characters
    - or, in contrast, perfectly rational characters --- an example of a story suffering from this was HP:MoR, in which the protagonist had, for instance, near-perfect emotional intelligence and control.

2.  intelligent protagonists

    - intelligent inhabitants
    - [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVGenius][straw intelligent]] characters

3.  lack of plot railroading
4.  lack of out-of-character reactions

    - lack of [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][zombie characters]] --- characters that at best don't act like humans. Or ones that act like videogame NPCs (no real intelligence, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision][no peripheral vision,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens][no attention to their surroundings,]] [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor][or to the weird things happening around them,]] etc)\\

5.  lack of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadWritingIndex][bad writing tropes]]; lack of simplistic plot design, character designs, worldbuilding, etc; high-quality writing; etc
6.  character actions (and discussions) relevant to morality, ethics, pragmatism, and ruthlessness
7.  deconstruction of the genre, the worldbuilding, the canon-material, etc
8.  highly ambitious protagonists, gradually improving protagonists
9.  munchkining,
10. high-conflict environment
11. technological uplift
12. emancipation of the masses, fighting for equal rights, etc
13. ersatz mimicry of rationality sub-tropes, which can be confused for an actually rational story and generate something like a cargo-cult reaction (see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/][EroGamer]] for a recent example)
14. and so on.

So just giving the genre a one-sentence (or even a several sentence-long) definition and then interpreting that definition by the letter of the law would not solve the underlying problem. Instead, these “sub-tropes” should be collected and then combined into different flavours of a rational story, with the faulty ones being discussed and eventually pruned out of the “meta-definition”.

--------------

Another problem is that it can be unclear sometimes whether or not the story's trying to abuse plot devices (e.g. deus ex machina) or characters' decisions (e.g. “was that character's behaviour an OoC moment for railroading the plot or would such a reaction from him be a reasonable one in the given circumstances even if it seems to be in-congruent with his past actions?”) or if the author sees those developments as the natural, unforced outcome for whatever reasons. But maybe that's something that should be addressed as a separate discussion of its own.
