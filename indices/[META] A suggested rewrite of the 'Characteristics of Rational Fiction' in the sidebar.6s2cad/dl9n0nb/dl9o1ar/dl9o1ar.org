  But if an individual sees those RF characteristics as requirements for "good fiction," it's likely they're just personally drawn to stories with those traits.

No, these people weren't really fans of rational fiction, it's just that the rules as currently written don't really communicate the distinctions of the genre. For example 'The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.' Does that mean no stupid people are allowed in these stories? Does it mean that the character are not allowed to fail? Does it mean that they're never allowed to have luck contribute?

I think my bullet point that the story displays a respect towards the use of intelligence actually captures the point we want to make better than the one we currently have.

And the other 3 rules seem to mostly sneer at non-rational stories. Things that happen must have a reason, is that really the best way we have to express what we want to say? Gandalf coming back from the dead did have a reason, God made it happen. But that reason doesn't actually suffice for rational fiction...

  Basically, I don't think that reaction to the rules really speaks to any issues with the rules themselves.

If the rules don't communicate well enough the category of stories we are talking about that's an issue.
