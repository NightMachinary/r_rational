I can appreciate the sentiment but I'm not a fan of your definitions as laid out. One of the primary benefits of the current sidebar list is that it's straightforward to identify: Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil". The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources. The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.

These are concise and contain zero jargon. I can take any work and see if they do or don't do these things. By contrast, comparing a work to three bullet points that go "the author displays respect for X", "the author attempts to explore X", and "the author doesn't use narrativium" might be helpful when explaining the concept to someone but does not feel conducive to actually judging a work. Does an author who has a low view of intelligence while yet having characters who are /actually/ intelligent mean the work is not ratfic? Should we care so much about the author and their intent or focus when identifying works that would be enjoyed by those who also enjoyed HPMOR or Luminosity or Metropolitan Man?

If I was to take your proposal and attempt to rework it into a set of guidelines that are easier to use for evaluating fiction, I think they would look more like this:

- Characters utilize intelligence and reason while applying their resources to overcoming their obstacles, and incorporate a reasonable amount of preparation and forethought into their plans.

- The premise of the setting is respected and sufficiently followed through: rules breed limitations, actions lead to consequences, and events propagate and echo through the world proportional to their actual impact.

- Characters react to the world with something resembling realism: they explore and experiment with the rules of the world, challenge unfounded restrictions, and investigate and react to alternate solutions to their problems.

- The plot flows around the events of the world and not the other way around: plot is the effect, and not a cause.

Personally I am also against listing specific examples in or associated with the definition. Doing so is a form of anchoring and doesn't actually let us know if our definition is any good; I'm sure eventually we would like to have moved away from any definition that has "something like HPMOR" as fundamental, and unnecessarily restricting ourselves (and newcomers) does not move in that direction.
