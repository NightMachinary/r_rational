  . One of the primary benefits of the current sidebar list is that it's straightforward to identify: Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'

Do you really think this is straightforward to identify?

  The characters solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources.

Any Batman story would qualify as ratfic then, since the character is considered to be intelligent.

But Batman is not ratfic because it doesn't bother exploring whether this is really the effective usage of Batman's resources. Batman is intelligent within-the-story, but the authors don't truly want to explore how an intelligent Bruce Wayne would really utilize his resources.

  Does an author who has a low view of intelligence while yet having characters who are actually intelligent mean the work is not ratfic
#+end_quote

Yes, IMO. Consider a story where the intelligent characters are there effectively to be mocked as cowards who use their calculations to be defeatists or whatever, while the story instead admires only the people who stay the course via faith and perseverance alone instead. That's not what ratfic is about.
