I don't think your controversial examples are reasonable (except that they are controversial).

I would say instead that there's a difference between stories /about/ intelligent actions of characters, and stories /with/ intelligently acting characters.

Worth The Candle, HPMOR, Drop of Poison, etc - these are all in the first category.

Worm, Unsong, etc - these are all in the second category.

I don't think I know a single piece of mass-appeal fiction - or fiction that wasn't explicitly written to be "rationalist" - that fits the first category.

I'd call the first category "rationalist" - as that's a thing it's attempting to be - and the second "rational", as it accurately describes the fiction.
