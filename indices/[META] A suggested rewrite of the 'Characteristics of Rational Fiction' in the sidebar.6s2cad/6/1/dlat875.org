Worm and Unsong are definitely part of the genre; you may be being tripped up because neither of the main characters are defined by their intelligence.

But, in both stories, most characters (and, importantly, the "winning" characters) are actively thoughtful and creative about their world and capabilities. Similarly, there are large organizations designed around features of the world, run by characters thinking about existential threats.

There are also ranges of idiots in both stories; but the idiots are still "intelligent" within their world-views, even if their world-views are... wacked.

Examples: 1) Tailor's first and second actions as a super are: a) Cardio b) Armor. Her third action is to go straight for the vitals of the biggest threat /from around the corner/. 2) The main placebomancer acts strategically to make a better story because that is literally the source of his power.

The universes have influential rules that we do not have that makes many weird or dumb things smart for the characters to do. But, a universe can only be irrational if it's rules are inconsistent; this is not the case in either work.
