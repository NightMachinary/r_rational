I agree that this means we shouldn't use these stories as primary examples of rational fiction. It could be harmful to both the [[/r/rational]] community and the author to classify their story as such against their wishes.

I also agree that these stories don't entirely fit. They're best described as rational-adjacent as they do fit some of the descriptions of rational fiction and a significant portion of the community finds value in them for those reasons.

However, an Author's opinion doesn't actually change whether their story fits a given description. As a counter-example, if I were to write a story that does not fit any of the given descriptions of rational fiction in this thread, then it would not be rational simply because I call it such.

This is part of why I find the points in your original post do not fit well as a description of rational fiction. Once the story is written, the author's intent while writing has little to no weight on what the story actually contains.
