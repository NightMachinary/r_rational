  I realize this is tangential, but wherefrom comes this infernal idea that Worm is lesser for "merely" building a classical-looking universe instead of "truly" exploring the idea?

I never use the word 'lesser'. Neither Worm, nor Unsong, nor Lord of the Rings are 'lesser' for not being in the category of stories we are talking about.

Perhaps you should ask yourself why both the Worm author and the Unsong author have said these stories indeed do not belong in the genre.
