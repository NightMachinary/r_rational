  Should I? Authorial intent does not seem like it would affect the genre of a finished work.
#+end_quote

A story doesn't belong in a comedy genre just because it made you laugh, it belongs in the comedy genre because the author's primary intent was to make you laugh. A comedy that /failed/ to make you laugh would still be in the comedy genre, if the author had intended it to be so.

Every time I hear a person saying that authorial intent doesn't matter, I want to scream at them that it does. Authorial intent affects everything in a story, and I'd much rather discuss authorial intent to figure out a story's placement in a genre than anything else whatsoever.

EDIT:

  Then, substitute "lesser" for "less rational".

Better yet, "less clear membership in the 'rational' genre".

"less rational' implies we're criticizing them. If we're defining a genre (which means we're trying to pinpoint what it is we're talking about), we should define it with as little hint of condemnation towards stories that are doing something different as possible. Else we're leading back to "That's just what every good story should be doing."

I consider "Lord of the Rings" a much superior piece of fiction than "The Misenchanted Sword", but I'd place the latter in the rational genre, and the former clearly /not/ in it.
