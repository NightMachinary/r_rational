Why, thank you - while I don't /need/ a vote for BDFL, it's appreciated :)

Personally and as a mod though, I like having occasional meta threads. If there's a proposal that seems well-argued and supported by consensus, I'll even adopt it!

(adopting other people's good ideas is a key trick to /remaining/ BDFL)
