(Benevolent Dictator For Life, for anyone else wondering)

By all means, if the collective comments in this thread leave you and the other mods convinced that a change is better than maintaining the status quo, I say go for it. I'm just advocating that you make the changes that sound best to you rather than making any attempt to determine a consensus or majority opinion.

We're not, so far as I can tell, debating what /is/ rational fiction---I'd want to see as much community involvement as possible in a conversation like that. But I think we all kinda [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobellis_v._Ohio][know it when we see it]], and we're just deciding how to vaguely gesture at it in a couple of sentences in the sidebar here.
