Your description of rational fiction seems fine to me other than that I don't think the edge-cases category is particularly useful to list explicitly. And I have also witnessed the phenomenon you describe where people claim that the current description just describes well-written fiction rather than carving out a unique genre.

But I also don't think that the contents of the sidebar really need to be up for democratic debate. I am in favor of the mod team having unilateral power over what the sidebar says and not spending a long time trying to reach a consensus among the entire community. One of the purposes of having leaders is to avoid the problem of 7000 people having to come to agreement on every small issue.
