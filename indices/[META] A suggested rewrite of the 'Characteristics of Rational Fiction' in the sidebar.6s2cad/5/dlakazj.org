I've only read a handful of what this community generally calls rational fiction, but a LOT of it seems to sync up with [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction][Deconstruction,]].

(Deconstruction: breaking down a a story (or aspect of one), seeing how it works, thinking about how it would work in the real world, etc).

Rational fics seem to often incorporate [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction][Reconstruction,]] as well.

Worm, for instance- deconstructs TONS of superhero tropes. It takes elements that are common in a superhero story, and goes, "What if this was true in the real world? How it work? How would people react to it? Would it be justified, or would people never do that in real life?"

Worm also reconstructs a ton, providing good, in-universe reasons as to why people do these superhero tropes.

Rational fanfic, especially, shows this off- the writer wants to pick apart and deconstruct the original canon, but if you make it too different you often lose the feel of the original. The trick seems to be, examine, explain, justify. Put it back together better than it used to be, without losing the original spark. (Good example of this would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species][Pokemon: The Origin of the Species]] IMO.

So, after all that said... I guess I'm just agreeing that this is a tough genre to define?

Or, how about this: If we just called all "rational" stories, "Deconstruction" stories, what would we be missing?
