"in case you re laptop is stressed"

nah bruh, vodka got my brain so stressed i can't even read correctly, i'mma have to make up for tonight by sacrificing several weeks of youtubbe on the alter of nonfiction

edit; you either edited that real quick or my brain is more befuddled than i though it was

edit nope you didn't edit it, it was just two comments back and two comments back is too complicated right now (shit, i did two and too just fine with m y brain altered this much, seriously is proper grammar too much to ask from fic writers?)_
