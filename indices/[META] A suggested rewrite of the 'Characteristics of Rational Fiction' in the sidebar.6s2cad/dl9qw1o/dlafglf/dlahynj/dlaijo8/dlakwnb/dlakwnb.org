I'm pretty sure we could do a thing with CSS to make [[/r/rational]] automatically redirect to another subreddit. That would be the smoothest way to get the community from point A to point B, but if you automatically redirect I think that would prevent access to all the previous threads here.

It should also be possible to have CSS put something in front of the subreddit proper with a link to the new home while we lock the original. We could also do the minimal-damage version of staying on this subreddit but changing what we call it. It'd still be [[/r/rational]] but we wouldn't say 'rational fiction', we'd exclusively say the new term. In any case, even if it isn't trivial to organize a smooth transition it's well within our abilities, and if doing so increases approachability for the genre then it's probably the smart move to do so.

The bigger problem, really, is finding a better name. Too many potential names have the exact same pitfalls as rational, so we need to be very careful that the name actually describes the genre but doesn't sound elitist.
