There is a common failure mode which goes like this: I like X. X should be more popular. The name of X must be turning people off.

Usually the answer is something else, however. Yes, people think that "rational fiction" is arrogant and snooty. Also: Atheists. The solution of Richard Dawkins? Refer to ourselves as "brights".

People don't think "Rational fiction" is pretentious because of the name, they think it's pretentious because we /genuinely do/ think rational fiction is better, just as atheists /genuinely do/ think they're smarter and more correct. If we come to websites and advertise ourselves as more rational, we'd better be able to back it up. And the fact is that many of the rationalist stories spread around are simply not very well-written as stories, and rely mainly on geek-appeal to be successful. Take those two factors together, and that's when you turn people off.

I think we'd be better off fixing the fundamental flaws of rational fiction, not worry so much about the branding.
