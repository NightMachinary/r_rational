  As far as I can tell, the only hard requirement for something to be considered "rational fiction" is for the characters' patterns of reaction be consistent and realistic.

That would be a bad definition, because it'd just mean we want good characterization.

I believe the quotes by EY you bring up refer to the writing of intelligent characters, not rational fiction per se.
