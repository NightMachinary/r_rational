  because it'd just mean we want good characterization

One of the things that really ticked me off at school was when the teacher would wax rhapsodic about the characterization of the most bizarre and strange people.

For example, near as I can tell none of the male characters in Jane Austen's works consistently behave like a human male would ever behave, no matter when the story was written or set. They are clearly created to fill a slot in the story for Emma or whoever to react to. But Austen's books are "great works", so Austen's characterization is automatically "good".

So when you say "we want good characterization" you need to qualify that to mean "for the characters' patterns of reaction be consistent and realistic", rather than the artistic meaning of "good characterization" that basically everyone in the literary fold cleaves to that has nothing to do with writing realistic or rational (or even credibly flawed) characters.
