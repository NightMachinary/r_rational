Well, Yudkowsky [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier][codified the genre]], so let's look for some relevant Yudkowsky quotes:

#+begin_quote
  If the character gets catapulted into a fantasy world, they actually notice the resemblance to their fantasy books, wonder about it, and think to themselves, "If this were a fantasy book, the next thing that would happen is X..." (which may or may not happen, because Watt-Evans doesn't write typical fantasy books). It's not done as a postmodern self-referential schtick, but as a faithfulness-to-reality; they think what a real rational person would think, in their shoes.

  If the character finds out that it is their destiny to destroy the world, they don't waste time on immense dramatic displays - after they get over the shock, they land on their feet and start thinking about it in more or less the fashion that you or I would in their shoes. Not just, "How do I avoid this? Are there any possibilities I've overlooked?" but also "Am I sure this is really what's going on? How reliable is this information?"

As far as I can tell, the only hard requirement for something to be considered "rational fiction" is for the characters' patterns of reaction be consistent and realistic. There's also this:

  There's a scene in the movie The Hobbit II: The Desolation of Smaug which Tolkien did not put into the original book.

  The movie version goes like this: The thirteen dwarves and Bilbo Baggins have just spent one and a half movies fighting their way to the place where Thorin, leader of the dwarves, expects to find a secret entrance into the lost dwarven kingdom of Erebor. This entrance can only be opened on a particular day of the year (Durin's Day), and they have a decoded map saying, /Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the last light of Durin's day will shine upon the keyhole./

  And then the sun sets behind a mountain, and they still haven't found the keyhole. So Thorin... I find this painful to write... Thorin /throws down the key in disgust/ and all the dwarves start to head back down the mountain, leaving only Bilbo behind to stare at the stone wall. And so Bilbo is the only one who sees when the light of the setting moon suddenly reveals the keyhole.

  That thing where movie!Thorin /throws down the key/ in disgust and /walks away/?

  I wouldn't have done that.

  You wouldn't have done that.

  We'd wait at least an hour in case there was some beam of sunlight about to shoot through the side of the mountain, and then we'd come back tomorrow, just in case. And if that still failed we'd try again a year later. We wouldn't /drop the key/. We wouldn't wander off the instant something went wrong.

  The scriptwriter thought it would make a Dramatic Moment to leave Bilbo watching the side of the mountain alone. But the price of that Dramatic Moment was to populate the movie with strange, bizarre creatures who do not think like you or I; and so the Dramatic Moment fell flat, at least for me.

I think that's all it comes down to. Rationality isn't a /thing/, you can't hand me a "rationality" on a plate, it's a concept which refers to a certain pattern of reaction.

/Friends/ is unrealistic. The behavioral patterns of, for example, Joey and Chandler during social interaction don't correspond to the behavioral patterns of real humans. Typically, Joey will say something, Chandler will insult him, the audience laughs, and the plot keeps rolling forward. In real life, Joey would say something like "I was trying to help you, but eff you too."

Yes, dialogue /must/ be unrela- uh, unrealistic cause, y'know, we all, uh, pause, and... we all pause and repeat ourselves and do these weird things with our mouth holes because we're making up the words as they're coming out of our mouth holes and not edited or planned so it's imperfect...

That was probably painful to read, and it still doesn't exactly capture it, but when humans have conversations with each other, we respond immediately, we don't plan and edit our responses. There's a difference between /that/ type of unrealistic dialogue, like a speech equivalent to that Snapchat filter that makes your face a more beautiful version of yourself, and the type of unrealistic dialogue that just doesn't naturally follow from the conversation.

I'm not sure if that devolved into a tangent there at the end or not, but TL;DR: *It seems to me that the defining trait of "rational fiction" is characters who react rationally.*
