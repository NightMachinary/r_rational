  I've several times seen people in other forums whose first reaction to the current list of characteristics in the sidebar is to claim that these are the characteristics of any good fiction.

I think many people conflate the term "good fiction" with the concept of "fiction I personally enjoy."

There's plenty of fiction that's widely regarded as good (by critics, fellow authors, and/or readers in general), but clearly does /not/ fit the characteristics of RF. But if an individual sees those RF characteristics as requirements for "good fiction," it's likely they're just personally drawn to stories with those traits.

Basically, I don't think this reaction to the characteristics really speaks to any issues with the characteristics themselves.
