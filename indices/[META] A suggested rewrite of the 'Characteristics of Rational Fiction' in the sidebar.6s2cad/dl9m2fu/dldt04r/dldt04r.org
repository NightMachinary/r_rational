Hmm. I think this is a very accurate definition, in the sense that it allows us to easily point and say "Yep, that's rational" or "Nope, not rational".

I am not sure, however, that it is a good introductory explanation. I think there is still value in elaborating around it, what we use these L1 characters to accomplish and why. Sensible world building, rewarding the reader's thinking, solvable problems, all that. Ideally, all of these things follow from hang L1 characters, but I think it deserves explicit expanding upon.
