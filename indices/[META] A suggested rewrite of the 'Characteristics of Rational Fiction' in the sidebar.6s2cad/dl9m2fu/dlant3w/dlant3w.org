I agree; I talked about this definition [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6gd97l/meta_the_definition_of_rt/dippn6n/][before]]. Rational fiction is defined by being populated by Level One+ Intelligent characters. It's not about sending a message, or exploring a theme, or being set in such-and-such setting, or having plot with a particular direction; it's about goal-driven characters interacting with each other or environment. In a way, it's akin to a role-playing campaign, except the author is both the DM and the players.

It's not /just/ good characterization. An author could define a good character, give them good development, then sneakily put an Idiot Ball in their hands, or have them not think about something, or make something happen to them to force them to conform to the plot. Rational fiction is fiction where characters with good characterization remain true to this characterization in spite of plot convenience.

Or, looking at it from another perspective... Yes, I suppose it would be true for any all-around good fiction. Rational fiction, then, is merely fiction that is /good in certain ways/; to be precise, in ways related to characters and characterization.
