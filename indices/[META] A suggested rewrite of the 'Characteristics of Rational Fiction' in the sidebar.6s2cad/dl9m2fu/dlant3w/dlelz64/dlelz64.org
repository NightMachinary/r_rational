  t's not just good characterization. An author could define a good character, give them good development, then sneakily put an Idiot Ball in their hands, or have them not think about something, or make something happen to them to force them to conform to the plot. Rational fiction is fiction where characters with good characterization remain true to this characterization in spite of plot convenience.

I agree with this, and think Diskworld might be a useful example.

I like Diskworld. The characters are fun. They totally make sense within the context of their stories. It's good fiction.

But the setting requires a fair amount of suspension of disbelief. It's stylized, rather than realistic.
