  Do you really think this is straightforward to identify?
#+end_quote

In the moment almost never conclusively; could be enemy action, could be the workings of an evil god, could be an unknown wrinkle in the world's rules. But when all is said and done, it's usually easy enough to take the work as a whole and identify if it contained magic plotsauce or not. And even if some of those holes are only obvious in retrospect, a work can still potentially make it obvious one way or the other.

  Any Batman story would qualify as ratfic then, since the character is considered to be intelligent.

I didn't say "everyone in universe says the characters are considered intelligent" or even "the characters are intelligent" but "knowledge and resources are applied intelligently". That /is/ something that we can evaluate on the outside free of the whims of how the author says things are, and matches with your next Batman paragraph neatly, so I'm not sure why that was brought up as a counter-example.

  Yes, IMO. Consider a story where the intelligent characters are there effectively to be mocked as cowards who use their calculations to be defeatists or whatever, while the story instead admires only the people who stay the course via faith and perseverance alone instead. That's not what ratfic is about.

I think there is a miscommunication here: an author saying someone is intelligent followed by the character doing something unintelligent without a good reason means the author /lied/. I do not care what the author says something is about if the work itself clearly states differently, and I also don't care if the author calls something stupid something smart. Mere labels are insufficient; if the characters /truly act intelligently/, and react in such a way that /we ourselves would call intelligent/, do we care if the author tries to play them off as idiots? Likewise, if the author has someone dumb and tries to act like they're intelligent and then mocks the poorly done caricature, are we fooled? If Spock claims that there's a 1% chance of success every single mission and is wrong every time then /Spock is an idiot/.

To badly paraphrase the sequences, intelligent characters should be rational, and rational actors /win/.
