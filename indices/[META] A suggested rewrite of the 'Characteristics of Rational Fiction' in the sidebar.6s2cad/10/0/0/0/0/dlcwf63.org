  A story doesn't belong in a comedy genre just because it made you laugh, it belongs in the comedy genre because the author's primary intent was to make you laugh. A comedy that /failed/ to make you laugh would still be in the comedy genre, if the author had intended it to be so.

Naturally, bad comedy is still comedy. But not for those reasons, I think.

Compare to fantasy. Good or bad, we can easily point and say "Yep, that's definitely a wizard, this is fantasy". That is, the defining pattern (wizards) is clearly a separate thing from the sliding scale of quality (which is just quality in general). Comedy isn't so lucky, the defining pattern (telling jokes, one way or another) is directly intertwined with the sliding scale of quality (causing laughs).

Still, I think the same logic applies. Comedy that doesn't make one laugh (bad comedy) still carries the defining pattern of /trying/ to make you laugh. Not as a ghost in the Author's brain, but in how the text is set up and structured. Generally, it's easy to tell a boring joke from a non-joke. Furthermore, I would argue, an attempted comedy book where you can't even /tell/ it's trying to joke, has simply failed and is not a comedy at all, however much the author wants it to be.

If we're being personal, then I too would like to label myself as generally pro-intent. My general stance is that the author is the only thing that separates fiction from reality, and in removing them, asking "For what is Mody Dick a metphor?" becomes on par with "For what was WW2 a metaphor?" Genre classification, however, is an area where I think it makes sense to not count it. Genres are a system from classifying what works are, not what they were intended to be.

  Better yet, "less clear membership in the 'rational' genre".

  "less rational' implies we're criticizing them. If we're defining a genre (which means we're trying to pinpoint what it is we're talking about), we should define it with as little hint of condemnation towards stories that are doing something different as possible. Else we're leading back to "That's just what every good story should be doing."

  I consider "Lord of the Rings" a much superior piece of fiction than "The Misenchanted Sword", but I'd place the latter in the rational genre, and the former clearly /not/ in it.

Right.

By both 'lesser' and 'less rational' I meant, roughly, "less clear membership in the 'rational' genre". Challenging, or implying you challenged, the quality of these works as a whole was never my intention, I apologize if my wording implied otherwise.

That said, /no/. Working to construct a (superficially) functioning superhero universe, as opposed to taking a wholly conventional one and watching it break down, does not constitute less clear membership of the rational genre. Writing about a universe where nothing is ever a coincidence, and having characters correctly conclude that nothing is ever a coincidence, is also a perfectly rational-y thing to do.

If I may, I will accuse you of looking at the conclusions of these stories in a vacuum. Yes, rational thinking usually allows us to conclude that "superheroes don't work" and "narrative logic doesn't work". But it seems like, since Worm and UNSONG both ask "But that if they/it did?", we're labeling them as 'edge cases' because they rationally explore absurd situations we're not used to.
