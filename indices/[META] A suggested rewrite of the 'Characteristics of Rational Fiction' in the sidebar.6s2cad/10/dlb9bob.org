I realize this is tangential, but /wherefrom comes this infernal idea/ that Worm is lesser for "merely" building a classical-looking universe instead of "truly" exploring the idea?

Deconstruction and reconstruction are different things. Normally, I'd try to elaborate on each and try to demonstrate why they are different things or equal value, but it's almost 04 in the morning. I'll have to settle for something more aggressive to convey the same emotion.

/Deconstruction has been done/. Yes, supervillains should just sell their inventions on the market. Yes, Superman should fly grain to Africa. Yes, armies of vigilante enforcers is trouble, and yes, between injuries, expenses, and government crackdown it's all unsustainable. /We know/.

Looking at this situation, where a thousand people have let the cart loose and seen it go into the ditch, /of course/ you should add steering wheels to it. You shouldn't "truly" explore its path by sending it into the ditch /again/, as opposed to "merely" keeping it on the damn road. Anyone can nail together a house per blueprint band watch it collapse. Changing the blueprint so you still have a house, but it doesn't collapse, is hard. Worm is not lesser for setting out to solve the problems of classical heroes instead of watching them play out for the umpteenth time. Problem solving is the next, more advanced step to problem observing, not a lesser copy.

Again, objection. Rationality can only amount to describing reality. If you live in a reality where NIEAC, then NIEAC is a real thing that you can and should work with. It does not detract from its rationality.

Finally, as for the definitions you propose... Nah. Like the sidebar, it hits on some points and completely misses others. It's just a question of what is which. Too much emphasis on world exploration, too little focus lvl-1 intelligence. To enthusiastic on some points, and a tad exclusive.
