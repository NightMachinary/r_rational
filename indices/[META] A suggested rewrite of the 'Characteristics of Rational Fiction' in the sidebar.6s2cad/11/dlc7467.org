Like everyone else's attempts this will be imperfect, but:

One possible definition for RatFics is that the majority of the characters are intelligent (TRUE intelligence, not Cartoon Intelligence), and that the thought processes that come from that intelligence are a *major focus of the story*. In other words, a "rational story" is a story in which people's (REALISTIC!) /thoughts/ are the main thing the reader is interested in and the author focuses on, with actions /resulting/ from those thoughts being a mere follow up.

To contrast with Lord Of The Rings (the standard "not-rational" comparison): LOTR is a story where the thoughts beyond why the characters decide to do the actions they do are not in focus. The focus, the "big deal" of the story is the actions themselves. The trials and tribulations of the quest to get the Ring to Mt. Doom, not the particularities of why that course of action was chosen. The viewers are there for the fighting and struggle, not for the thinking. (This is /NOT/ to say that a non-rational story cannot provoke the viewer into deep thought, just that the /character's/ thought processes are not significantly focused on.)
