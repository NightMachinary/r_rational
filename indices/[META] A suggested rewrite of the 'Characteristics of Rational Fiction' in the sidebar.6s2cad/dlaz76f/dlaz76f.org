Perhaps it would be useful to provide a list of counterexamples? Not on the sideboard, but perhaps in the wiki, we could expound upon each bullet, what makes it rational, what well-known works have the trait, and in particular, what well-known and respected works do not have the quality. This would make it plain that these qualities are distinct from "good" fiction. If there are no counter-examples, then perhaps we don't need the bullet.

Also, I'd like to see something about how rational character often reveal their knowledge and plans to the audience, showing their reasoning in the process.
