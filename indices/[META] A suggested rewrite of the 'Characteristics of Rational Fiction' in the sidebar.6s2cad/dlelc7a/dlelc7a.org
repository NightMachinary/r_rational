  The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.

I'm unsure about this one. Are we talking about [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3]] characters?

There's a cluster of stories where the story's payoff is the hearing a character explain their especially-clever reasoning. Take '[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4yvx3c/rt_a_rationalist_in_the_zombie_apocalypse/][A Rationalist in the Zombie Apocalypse]]'. The story's major mystery was, "why is this person carrying /that/?"

Some of the defining works go even further and have message-fiction scenes to impart some tools of rationality to the reader:

  "Great Scott!" said Harry. (This was an expression he'd learned from the mad scientist Doc Brown in Back to the Future.) "Were you also thinking that when I bought the Feather-Falling Potion, the Gillyweed, and the bottle of Food and Water Pills?"

  "Yes."

  Harry shook his head in amazement. "Just what sort of plan do you think I have going, here?"

'Displaying respect for the value of preparation' seems like a good way to describe both of these works. And there's definite value in having a phrase that means, "Fair play mystery with some competence porn." That's a genre unto itself.

Based on the defining works, I can see how that (somewhat specific) genre might claim the label 'rational.'

On the other hand, there's a sense in which Unsong or Worm respect intelligence. The characters aren't meant to be Level 2+ geniuses of planning. But they're Level 1 intelligent.

And there's a sense in which the settings themselves respect intelligence. In Worm, I'm allowed to notice stuff like, "The Powerful people sure do spend a lot of time punching. That's weird." And in Unsong, I'm allowed to notice stuff like, "Theodicity is legitimately hard."

This sets these works apart from lots of popular fiction. Harry Potter, for instance, was a great book. But the answer to, "Wait. This school has like 80 students. How big could this society be?" is that JK Rowling isn't great at math and you shouldn't think too hard about it.

This is a kind of respect-for-intelligence, but I'm not sure it's what's meant by the bullet point.
