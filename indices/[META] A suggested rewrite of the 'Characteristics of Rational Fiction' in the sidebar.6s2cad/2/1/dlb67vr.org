While I agree that unilateral mod authority over the sidebar is reasonable, I find "no need for democratic debate" is misrepresenting the issue.

A genre is, ultimately, defined by its audience. That is not to say it's a democratic process, but that's because there is no system of rule, not because people aren't involved. It's not democratic, it's just demonic.

The sidebar should be accurate to the reality of what the genre is, which it can influence, but not decide. This can be accomplished via democratic means, but we can also do like all of the rest of literature, and put a couple of academics (mods) to the task of writing lots of papers on how they think it is.

Either way, while we don't need a democratic debate, the question is fundamentally demonic, and we do need /a/ debate, even if just a demonic one.
