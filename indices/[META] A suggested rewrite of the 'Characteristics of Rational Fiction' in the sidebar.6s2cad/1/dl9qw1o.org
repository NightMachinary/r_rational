It's certainly far better than the current list.

I'll remark that the whole phrase "rational fiction" is not something I invented or would have invented. "Rational/ist/ fiction" makes sense. And there's another genre to point to that isn't rationalist fiction, but grew up around it, and the stories in that genre do have something in common. But I wish this genre had been called something other than rationalfic. "Rational" is a dangerous word and should only be used judiciously and probably in front of well-selected audiences who understand it as a reference to [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/eta/rationality_appreciating_cognitive_algorithms/][a quality of cognitive algorithms]]; for most people "rational fic" is just going to sound like "fic the author thinks is somehow better or correct". It's not smart to ever describe a character as "rational" because, again if somebody hasn't been introduced to the cognitive-algorithms viewpoint, the word "rational" often doesn't mean anything to them other than "correct", and whenever they see the character do something they think is incorrect, they'll go "Lol that character isn't rational!"

Empirically, if I were to try to describe what Luminosity and The Last Christmas actually do have in common, I would say the most standout literary characteristic is a hard-to-define open-world quality of thinking, like Skyrim vs. Half-Life. The character's thoughts don't /appear/ to stay on a plot-determined railroad, they seem to think all over the place and look all over the place because that's part of what it means to be sane. Now, the masterful author will have it add up to the plot anyway, but you should still get the impression that the "rational" character lives in cognitive Skyrim. Rational!Isabella Swan sees a vampire and thinks about the global implications of immortality, not just a hot guy in love with her--although she thinks about that too and at great length!--because her thoughts aren't following what another author would have taken as the railroad. She thinks what /you/ would think and that's a key appeal that good rationalfic tries to capture.
