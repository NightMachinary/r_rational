Nothing, it was a dead sub. You can [[https://web.archive.org/web/20111206160150/reddit.com/r/rational][see a capture of it from the Wayback Machine here]], roughly two years after it was created and two years before we (not actually me, I wasn't involved) took it over. So far as I know, those two posts are all that ever got posted to the sub in its entire history prior to December of 2013.
