Not from before the HPMOR community came in. That would have been at least over 2 years ago. Probably more than 3 years. I wasn't here then myself.

I'm not sure if one of the mods here already had it or if they went through [[/r/redditrequest]] to get it. I'm pretty sure whatever existed on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] beforehand didn't have much going on. It would have been abandoned, not been popular, had no content, the mod was missing or had lots of spam.

I remember trawling back to page 1 of this sub a couple years ago and I /think/ I found that anything from before HPMOR community arrived had been cleared out. To be sure, you'd have to ask a mod or user who was there at the time.

If you just want an example from when the current community had more discussion outside fiction, check through the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=Friday+Off-Topic+Thread&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][Friday]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=title%3AFriday+Off-Topic&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all][Monday]] threads. Otherwise you'd have to go back a lot of pages to see if you can spot such a change. It would be a change of tone or changes to the type of topics. You could use the [[https://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]] to make this easier by enabling never-ending scroll and holding the "End" key for a while.
