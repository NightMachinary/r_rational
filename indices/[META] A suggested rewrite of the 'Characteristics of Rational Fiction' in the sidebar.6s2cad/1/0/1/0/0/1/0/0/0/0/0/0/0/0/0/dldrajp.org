  This SubReddit is primarily for rational discussion, on ANY topic at all. It exists so that people can discuss whatever they want without having to worry about people who won't be reasonable.

That's /exactly/ what I thought this sub was about back when I wasn't looking at it closely enough to recognize that almost every post was a fic recommendation.

Also, it appears as though there may have been something wrong with my computer the other night; if I had to hazard a guess, I'd say the problem was probably somewhere between the chair and the keyboard.
