Not exactly.

Some time ago the rules were altered to focus more on posting fiction rather than discussion / ideas threads, which had become spammy. This is probably the change you're thinking about.

The people posting relevant content (fiction) were given an allowance to post discussion threads here and there while non-contributors were discouraged from doing so.

Such discussions are otherwise relegated to the weekly and monthly threads including Monday General Rationality, Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread, Off-Topic Friday, Thread, Saturday Munchkinry Thread, Monthly Recommendation Thread, etc.

To go back further, the sub was at some point a different community entirely, though dead and abandoned. The HPMOR community took over moderation of the subreddit and repurposed it for rational fiction. Older posts would have been removed.

Alternatively; perhaps the turning point was when the sub contributors had already discussed a lot of the things they wanted to discuss with their 'shiny new community' so there was less interest in general.
