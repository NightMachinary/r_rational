Was there ever a time when [[/r/rational][r/rational]] wasn't a sub where people recommended / talked about fanfics? There was a period of somewhere between 6 months and a year where this sub was one of the ones I cycled through looking for interesting posts where I (embarrassingly enough) failed to realize that almost every post was a fic recommendation, where I thought the sub was about "rationality" as opposed to "rational!fics" because I wasn't really paying attention.
