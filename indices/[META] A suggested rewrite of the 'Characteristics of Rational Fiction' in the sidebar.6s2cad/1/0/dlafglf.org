Part of the problem with the branding is that there was no conscious effort involved in branding. It was literally just ... some people decided that HPMOR was in a dry spell and wanted a place to collect fiction like it, so they took over [[/r/rational]]. There wasn't really any debate on terminology in regards to public perception, attracting an audience, etc.

Similarly, the sidebar as it exists now is only slightly modified from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/][this post in HPMOR]] from four years ago which dates from prior to the creation of this subreddit and any sort of community here, let alone community consensus.
