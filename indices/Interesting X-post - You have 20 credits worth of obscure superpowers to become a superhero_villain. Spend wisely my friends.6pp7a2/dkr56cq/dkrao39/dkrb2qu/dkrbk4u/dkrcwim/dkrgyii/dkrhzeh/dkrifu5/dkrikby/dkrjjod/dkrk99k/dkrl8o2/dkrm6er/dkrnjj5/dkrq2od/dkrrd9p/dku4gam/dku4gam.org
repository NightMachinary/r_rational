Asking for the sake of understanding - how do you experience asexuality or aromanticism?

Sexual and romantic attraction can be remarkably specific; there are some, for instance, that never find romance until very late into their lives. And in a similar vein, I'm... not really attracted to most people, though not so much that I would consider myself asexual. The individual that actually does spark an interest is few and far between; if not for the existence of the internet, I would likely have gone through my life without ever encountering anyone I found attractive.

I'm not saying you're the same way or attempting to invalidate your identity; it's more just intellectual curiosity - what is the driving point that makes you certain you will never experience romantic or sexual attraction?
