For reference, I was actually curious after reading this exchange so I did look up statistics. the only actual study I could find was from England in 2004, but found a rate of approximately [[http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/10/14/asexual.study/][1% asexuality among adults.]]

Numerous obvious caveats abound, including lack of replication as well as it being old and potentially having lower reported rates. However, by comparison, only about [[http://www.gallup.com/poll/183383/americans-greatly-overestimate-percent-gay-lesbian.aspx][3.5 to 4% of the adult population currently self identified as homosexual]], which puts asexuality as less common, but definitely not an order of magnitude less common.

So, if you think the response you received would have been unmerited had it been instead a gay person responding to someone claiming that everyone grows out of being attracted to someone of the same sex, then that's one thing. But the statistics don't really seem quite as strong as you're implying, and might be worth updating your beliefs.
