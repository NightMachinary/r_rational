The chances are actually 100% that I'm an adult, because I'm sitting here, being an adult.

Seeing as we're in [[/r/rational]], I'm surprised that you're this cool with making unfounded assumptions about people you've never met. And that you think yelling "Statistics!" makes for a good argument.

Seriously--if you're going to make an argument like "you must be a child if you think you can have a happy life without a romantic partnership," you're going to have to do better than vaguely alluding to the concept of statistics. How about you try to actually back up your claim that "99.9% of people outgrow" the idea that a romantic partnership is absolutely necessary for happiness? Cause I was going to let that slide as hyperbole, but apparently now it's /statistics,/ so--you got a source for that? And do you actually think that aromantic asexuals are the only people in all the world who can be happily single?

And as for the "age gap" thing, I'm really not sure why you think situations like "a 50-year-old marries a 20-year-old" extrapolate to situations like "two 20-year-olds get married, but only one of them /looks/ 80 when they're both 80." You want to argue that a 500-year-old immortal will have trouble successfully dating the mortals, you might have a leg to stand on, but the argument you actually made was about a partnership where one partner undergoes senescence and the other does not--something that, again, has never happened in human history.
