  I think the immortal angst thing comes from this cultural ideal we have of the One True Monogamous Romantic Partnership that is supposed to be the pinnacle of your existence, and once you lose that you may as well be dead.

It's easy to argue that death gives life meaning or eternal life sucks when you don't have a chance to reup your lifespan every fifty or so years.
