If you want to commit suicide, there's nothing stopping you from doing that. I've always dislike the whole concept of immortal angst - just make new friends, most people don't just kill themselves when loved ones die - but this isn't even total immortality.

Unless you literally mean you want to undergo the aches and pains of ageing, which is one of those things which sounds super romantic until you think about it for more than 10 seconds, and then you realise it's /really/ dumb. What kind of a monster would you be marrying that would want to see you suffer when you don't have to?

EDIT: A word.
