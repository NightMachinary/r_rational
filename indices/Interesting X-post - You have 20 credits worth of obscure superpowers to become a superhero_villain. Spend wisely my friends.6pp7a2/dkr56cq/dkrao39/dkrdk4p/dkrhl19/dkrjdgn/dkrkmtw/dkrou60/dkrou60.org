  I think we can agree that old people tend to be less active than young people, maybe even more content with "doing nothing".

I think this is a core point of contention with your scenario to me, and possibly with others as well. I don't have statistics to back this up, but this description doesn't mesh with my experiences. It might help to elaborate what ages and experience levels we're actually discussing.

One comparison I keep seeing is "80 year old in a 20 year old's body". However, that seems to ignore the potentially inconvenient ages between the two. For example, I think it would be somewhat difficult to say that, for example, a 30 year old first time parent is "obviously" or "clearly" less active than that same person was at 20. Is the activity the same? Probably not, they're not going out drinking and clubbing (or whatever "activity" we're positing that 20 year olds do currently; when I was 20, I sat around and watched TV a lot, so I suspect that I'm not a member of the reference group), but chasing a 2 year old around their house and yard all night long every night is certainly a lot of activity.

Additionally, I know the long distance running community is filled with people well into their fifties and sixties, many of whom were not exactly athletic in their earlier lives (though clearly, some also were).

These are two narrow anecdotal examples that would begin to hint towards any sort of generalized lowered activity level, if it does exist, being caused by deterioration in physical capabilities, rather than a more generalized process of aging altering your interests on its own.

I do agree with your statement about recycling social circles, but have observed as I get older that the age range of my circle simply has grown wider, rather than just older. My current group of friends that I spend a decent amount of time with ranges from people around 26 to 35 or 36, rather than the 22-23 when I was that age. So, with eternal physical youth and an ability to meal learn and grow, I expect my social circle would likely stabilize at around mid 40s to late 60s.
