I wrongfully assumed that a subreddit called "rational" would be like LessWrong. I guess I should have figured that a subreddit with that name would mainly attract pseudo-intellectual and socially inedept neckbeards with high thoughts of themselves.

So congratulations, you won. I'll be deleting my comments in this thread, so you can continue your circlejerk and feel smart while telling yourself you're open-minded. Sad basement dwellers.

EDIT: Do feel free to comment. I won't be answering (nor reading your moronic, selfimportant bullshit), though. "Argumentum ad hominem"? Yes, indeed, but reasoning didn't work for you irrational tumblr feminists.
