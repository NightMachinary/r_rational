Relationships mature because you get to know them over time, and build upon shared experiences. Why would not physically getting older stop that?

As for a "young mindset", it depends - if you mean a level of maturity, I'd have to disagree, because that comes with experience which you'd gain just as much of over time. If you mean "more willing to undertake high-energy activities as part of remaining in their physical prime" then I suppose you could argue that your interests would diverge somewhat, but it would be a very specific type of person that wouldn't get bored of their activities over time, or at least be unwilling to try new ones with their older friends.
