Are you asserting here that the mental process of maturing necessarily involves a destructive element, such that you wouldn't be able to mature mentally without your body aging as well?

Unless there is some extra process beyond accumulation of memories and experiences you're saying is involved in "maturing", then it sounds like a larger issue with this would be an inability to form memories (or gain muscles, lose weight, or otherwise effect any meaningful change upon my mind or body).

Obviously, this level of definition of why natural language superpowers often are so confusing, since language isn't well defined.
