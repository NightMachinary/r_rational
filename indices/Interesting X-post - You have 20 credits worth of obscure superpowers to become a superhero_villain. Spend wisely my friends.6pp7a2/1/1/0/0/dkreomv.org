I think the immortal angst thing comes from this cultural ideal we have of the One True Monogamous Romantic Partnership that is supposed to be the pinnacle of your existence, and once you lose that you may as well be dead. But of course--as you alluded to--people already do lose their partners, grieve, and move on, all the time. And not everyone even wants the OTMRP in the first place. It's like--if mortals can live happy lives in spite of experiencing grief and loss, why not an immortal?

Well said about the inappropriate romanticizing of "growing old together." The idea of people loving each other for a very long time is what's nice; the part where their bodies gradually fall to pieces is the /downside./
