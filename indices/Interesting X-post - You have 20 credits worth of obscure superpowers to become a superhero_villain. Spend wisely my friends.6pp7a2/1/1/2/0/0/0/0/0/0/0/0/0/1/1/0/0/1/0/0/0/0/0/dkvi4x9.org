Oh, I don't know. I think it is important not to let your label turn into some kind of restrictive standard of behavior, but my experience is that these communities are generally very good about emphasizing that. I've never encountered any pressure to conform to a "gold standard" of asexuality, whereas I've often seen people reassuring each other that they don't have to feel beholden to the label.

In fact, there are plenty of people in ace communities who are more "less sexual" than "asexual"--like, you'll usually see a few demisexuals, people who require an emotional connection as a precursor to sexual attraction. So if there's been a dilution of the label, I'd argue that the result is greater inclusivity, rather than people being shut out as their identities shift.
