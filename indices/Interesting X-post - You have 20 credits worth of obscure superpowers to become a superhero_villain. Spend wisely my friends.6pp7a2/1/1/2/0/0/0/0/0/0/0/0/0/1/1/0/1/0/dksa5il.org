  Alas, there just is no fucking way of telling somebody young that their opinion might change as they grow older without them getting offended. Jesus Christ.
#+end_quote

Not while you're being an asshole that can't hold a debate, there isn't. If your argument has any merit, you should be able to support it instead of calling the person you're debating with a child. The reason you're having a problem here is because you're not actually backing up your assertions and no one's falling for it. Let me do a point by point breakdown of what you've said so far. If I've misunderstood something, feel free to correct me:

#+begin_quote
  Eternal youth only sounds good if you're young and naive
#+end_quote

This is false if you think about it for even two seconds. It's incredibly common for old people to end up with mental health problems because they don't want to be a broken down version of their former selves. They have pains, health problems, and everything is just generally shittier for them than when they were young and healthy. Do you really, truly think that old people wouldn't take an offer of eternal youth if it was on the table?

#+begin_quote
  The reason it isn't good is because your One True Love^{TM} will grow old without you and die, thereby making the rest of your eternal life pointless
#+end_quote

You're also getting disrespect for poorly thought out, sanctimonious garbage like this. Even if I accepted this premise (which I don't), the solution here is obvious. Take the eternal youth + no illness perk, and then wait until medical technology gives the same gift to everyone. With the rapid, exponential pace of technology growth and the growth of useful narrow AIs, I wouldn't be surprised if we can conquer aging in the next century. That's nothing for someone who has eternal youth.

  The "love doesn't make you happy" is very common for young people, but as they mature, 99.9% of people outgrow that.
#+end_quote

You going "Statistics!" is being ignored because showing that 99% of people aren't asexual doesn't tell you /anything/ about what situations actually make people happy. You're citing that as if 99% of the population needs to be in a monogamous One True Love^{TM} relationship and that's just not the case. Life long marriage isn't the norm by any means. If you like statistics, take a look [[http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/city/city_index/214133-city-index-marriage-lengths][here]]. So given that most people don't live "the dream" of marrying their high school sweetheart and staying together until death does them part, do you really think it's reasonable to call out someone as naive for already knowing what they want and not sticking to an illusory "norm"?

#+begin_quote
  so don't worry, I'll stop trying to get you to be rational. You can go get offended somewhere else now about your underdeveloped sexuality. Oh, and also, now you're on ignore, kid.
#+end_quote

Not much to say about this except fuck off, dude. Someone who can't prop up their points in a debate shouldn't be calling someone else irrational. Also you're the one that seems to be offended at the idea that someone can be confidently asexual. Just look at what you're saying. "too young", "child", "underdeveloped", "kid". Refusing to accept that an adult can be asexual just makes you seem like an immature person that won't accept something if it breaks their argument.

#+begin_quote
  It's unreasonable to expect nobody to ever make any assumptions if the statistics so strongly support it.
#+end_quote

Nope, you tried to pull something like a bait and switch. First you said "The "love doesn't make you happy" is very common for young people, but as they mature, 99.9% of people outgrow that". Then to offer support for this assertion, you said that 99% of the population aren't asexual. Notice that this does absolutely nothing for your claim that 99% of people need to be in a long term, monogamous relationship and that such a relationship is worth forgoing eternal youth. You aren't supporting your main claim, all you're trying to do is discredit the first person that responded to you. That's not the same as backing up what you said, so hopefully you'll understand why it's so absurd that you're calling other people "irrational" when you can't even hold a basic debate.

#+begin_quote
  If after he had said "I'm asexual" and I'd have said "You'll grow out of that", then I can understand why he'd get offended. However, that's not what I did at all.
#+end_quote

"I don't know your age, but chances are pretty high that you're not exactly an adult with that opinion."\\
"I'm actually starting to doubt that being true now. :)"\\
"You can go get offended somewhere else now about your underdeveloped sexuality. Oh, and also, now you're on ignore, kid."

No, of course not! All you said is that someone who holds her opinion can't possibly be an adult. That's totally different and in no way implies that it's something to be grown out of. Nope.
