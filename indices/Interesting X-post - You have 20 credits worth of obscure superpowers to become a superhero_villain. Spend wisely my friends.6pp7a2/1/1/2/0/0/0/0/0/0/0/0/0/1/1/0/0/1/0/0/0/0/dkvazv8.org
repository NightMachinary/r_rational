Yeah, and my own experience of my sexuality is... well... I'm /primarily/ a teratophile, not in the "likes-disfigured-humans" sense, but in the "monsters-that-have-teeth" sense. Honestly, anything bipedal and inhuman generally registers high on my scale - I blame Power Rangers. The vast majority of people aren't particularly attractive to me, at least not in the same way. I'm not incapable of sexual attraction to people as such, but it takes a degree more effort, so I have a certain (if incomplete) understanding of where you're coming from.

I think part of my concern regarding the so-called "dilution" of the label lies in the younger generation, and the current tendency to pick and choose labels whilst trying to discover themselves. Unfortunately, identities can be just as restrictive as they are freeing - just as you can find communities and solidarity through your identity, those very same communities often inflict a kind of unintentional peer pressure. Being involved in a community is great, but /leaving/ a community isn't; by necessity, a change in sexual identity would mean no longer being involved in that community.

So I suppose there's a balance to be had there. I'm just sort of thinking out loud; do you have an opinion?
