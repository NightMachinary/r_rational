Well, I'd say the answer is that I'm not certain. I never have experienced those things, and I don't expect to; for me there's not really even a frame of reference for those feelings. But if I ever do start to experience sexual and romantic attraction, I'll swap out my label accordingly. Aro/ace is just what most accurately describes me as I am now and as I've been up to this point.

For the sake of my mental wellbeing I pretty much have to expect that I'll never feel those things, though. I spent too many years thinking I was just a late bloomer, holding out for that one miraculous person who'd make me feel butterflies in my stomach and stars in my eyes, and it just left me feeling broken and disappointed. I had to stop thinking of myself as this incomplete person waiting to be made whole. I'd rather accept that this is who I am and move forward to build a happy life on that foundation, even if my idea of a happy life is a little unconventional.

In answer to how I experience it--it's kind of like not being into a hobby that other people are super passionate about. I respect the happiness it brings them, but I don't feel any interest for myself. Like, I meet people who I think are aesthetically beautiful, but the idea that I might want to have sex with them is totally alien.
