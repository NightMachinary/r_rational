I think society, as a whole, places far too much importance on romance - you should never have been made to feel like you needed someone else to make you whole. Any relationship that's so deeply dependent, I think, is unhealthy; one should never have the perception that they are merely a half of a human being, completed by another. Supplemented and complemented by, yes.

So for what it's worth: I don't think your idea of a happy life is unconventional. If anything, it's the way things should be. There's far better goals in life than romance, heh.

That being said, thanks for answering. I was primarily wondering because the labels, I feel, have been greatly diluted (and perhaps are not entirely necessary, but that's a different debate altogether; I recognize that there is solidarity to be found in others that share the label). I have friends who identify as ace, but have - ahem - proclivities that are quite clearly sexual in nature, even if they only experience it in art; there's no /real/ example of what they enjoy. Is that then asexuality, or simply that what they find attractive - unfortunately - does not exist?
