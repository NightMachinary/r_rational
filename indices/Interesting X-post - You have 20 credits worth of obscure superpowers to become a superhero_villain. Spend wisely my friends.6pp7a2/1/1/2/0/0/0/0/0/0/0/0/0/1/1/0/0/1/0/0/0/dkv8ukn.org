Oh, what I meant about feeling incomplete was the belief that I needed to "grow into" the ability to feel romantic attraction in order to become a fully realized human being, rather than specifically needing a partner--but I agree with everything you said about how our culture places too much emphasis on romance. One thing I really don't like is how we treat romantic relationships as a "step above" platonic ones--our fiction in particular often seems to glorify the newest romances above the longest-running, deepest friendships.

I think in your last paragraph you're referring to asexuals who have sexual fetishes? As someone who also falls into that category, I can offer my perspective.

The broad umbrella of asexuality is generally considered to include anyone who doesn't experience sexual attraction toward other people. That covers not only people who have little or no libido at all, but also people who do have a sex drive (and perhaps a fetish) but have no inclination to satisfy it through sexual activity with another person.

For me, the term "asexual" is appropriate and useful even though I have a sex drive, because the implications re: my relationships with other people are the same either way. Many of my personal struggles related to my asexuality are the same ones that asexuals without libido also experience. The question of whether I'd be more accurately defined as "my fetish"-sexual is mildly interesting on a semantic level, but it isn't a distinction I feel I need to make in my daily life.

I don't see the "umbrella" of asexuality as a dilution of the label; I see it as the label doing its job, which is to signal to others that I'm not a viable sexual prospect, anchor me in an identity, and connect me with the broader asexual community. It doesn't need to specify whether I have a libido or not in order to do that. Some aces like to use more expanded, precise labels, adding a variety of modifiers to "asexual" in order to pin down exactly how they experience sexuality. In the rare cases where it's necessary to get that specific, I think that's a fine way to distinguish different kinds of asexual.
