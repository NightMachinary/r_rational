I gave up on responding further after the replies to two of my posts addressing at least a few of the side criticisms I had (which ignored the obvious tone bullshit) basically responded with "You make sense but people are being mean to me and this other person is super irrational because they said the word offended, so I'm going to ignore everything you were saying."

So, thanks for further illuminating what I was similarly thinking rather than letting it go unchecked.
