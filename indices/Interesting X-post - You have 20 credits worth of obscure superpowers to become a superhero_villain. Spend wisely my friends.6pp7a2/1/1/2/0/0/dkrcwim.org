I am an adult, and I'm also an aromantic asexual. I am not able to experience those feelings whether I want to or not. So thanks for implying that I'm both childish and doomed to a life of misery for something I can't help, offense absolutely taken.

Fortunately, because I'm an adult, I've had the time and experience to learn that just because a lot of people find fulfillment in romantic partnerships doesn't mean that's the /only/ path to a happy life. Don't assume that what you need to be happy is what everyone needs.

Also not sure why you assume that an asymmetrically-aging couple can't be happy, given that that has never happened in all of human history. If eternally young people actually existed and their relationships all fell apart as their partners aged, then you'd have something to base that assertion on.

Edit for clarity: I am not offended that this person assumed I'm not an aromantic asexual. I understand that it's an uncommon orientation. What I took issue with was the "you must be a child if you think you can be happy without romantic love" thing, which I felt was a needlessly condescending generalization. I brought up my (lack of) orientation to give some perspective on why "romantic love is necessary for happiness" is not a universal axiom--being aromantic is /one/ example of a reason that someone might not desire a romantic partnership and be perfectly happy without one.
