I'm an adult in a romantic relationship, and I'd 100% prefer to outlive my SO rather than die with or before her, all else being equal and provided that my good health was assured (as it is in this scenario). "Would you like to die with your spouse at the age of 80, despite good health being assured for lifetimes beyond that" doesn't seem too different from "If your spouse died in a car accident in five years, would you prefer to have died in that same car accident or to continue to live?"
