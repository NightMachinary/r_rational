I've long wondered if there's some way we can grab asteroids such as that [[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bridaineparnell/2017/05/26/nasa-psyche-mission-fast-tracked/#25bd9a514ae8][$10 quintillion one]] and somehow drop them on Earth safely. So I'd take telekinesis, maybe stacked three times, and collect big useful asteroids on Earth.

Depending on the rules about bundling things into "one object" we might be able to move a lot of sea water to Mars, which combats sea level rising here, and helps with terraforming there. Presumably "the North Pole" is one object, but that's probably too much.
