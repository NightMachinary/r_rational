The interpretation where you still receive damage is by far the less sensible option. For one it would be literally useless, you could claim immunity to anything like say bullets and it would only ensure you stay indefinitely in a vegetative coma after getting shot. So yeah it guarantees you aren't getting any good stories out of this since you are getting no real protection from anything and will be put out of commision the /first time you encounter any danger whatsoever/.\\
I find it rather hard to imagine the author had the same interpretation unless they wanted to deliberately try to trick the people doing this CYOA. Even then it wouldn't make sense since most people wouldn't end up going with that interpretation because it seems obviously wrong for all the reasons I went over.
