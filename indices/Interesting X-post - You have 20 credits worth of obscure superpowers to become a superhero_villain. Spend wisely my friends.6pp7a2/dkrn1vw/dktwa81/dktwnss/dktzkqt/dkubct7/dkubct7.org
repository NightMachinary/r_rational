I don't know whether memory theft would allow me to play the part of Putin immediately. I don't know whether slowly bending Putin's goals to more closely match mine is possible to do in-character. I don't know whether he regularly carries out some horrific act I would be unable to replicate. I don't have the muscle memory of Russian, even though I would have an encyclopedic knowledge of it. I don't know whether the shapeshifting power also copies DNA. I don't know what paranoid countermeasures against things that are supposed to be impossible a man like him has set up.
