/Invulnerability/: to physical damage, this protects me from damn near everything except incapacitation by toxins, electricity or a few other means. Basically since the body is a physical thing nothing could actually kill me, though quite a few things could put me out of commision if maintained.

/Telekinetic/: There's no size limits which means no force limit, so I can use this to move myself at relativistic speed and have the destructive power of a nuke. In fact I really have no other choice but to use this to fly around as a nude bald man since my invulnerability will protect me but not anything else.

/Hold Breath x2/: I would use this to be able to use this to remain safe from poisons or nearly anything else for an hour at a time by moving my body back and forth to protect myself with a sheath of plasma that will destroy any poisons. Effectively by always staying moving I can ensure invulnerability, and rarely have to make myself vulnerable by going somewhere and slowing down so I can actually take a breath. Also because of my long breath time I can get places by just flying directly through the planet quickly, but not so fast as to cause massive seismic activity.

With these powers I could achieve world domination flying around the world and threatening to destroy governments cities by accelerating to near lightspeed. I would use this power to force demilitarization and make global laws actually conform to basic western idealized liberal values, as well as forcing massive government transparency and cooperation. Basically with a lot of these sorts of superpower scenarios you can make yourself effectively invulnerable then force world powers to do what you want creating a world government by force.
