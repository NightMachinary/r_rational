  I might go with "forces/objects within this universe" instead

I think you are missing the point you were /just/ making. Saying just "this universe" or "the set of all things that I don't want to cause harm to me" refers to a singular object, which just so happens to include as components everything you want protection from.\\
However "forces/objects within this universe" isn't a singular thing. The point is sort of to find a way of framing everything you want included as a singular noun.
