Sure I could just say damage but it wouldn't actually change anything. Once you get sufficiently broad (same thing if you say "everything"), you can't be killed. However the fact you can't die from anything still doesn't change the fact that you can still be incapacitated via poisons, oxygen deprivation, electric stunning, etc.
