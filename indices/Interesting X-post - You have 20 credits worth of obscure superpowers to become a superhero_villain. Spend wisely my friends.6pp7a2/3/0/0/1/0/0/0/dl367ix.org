I think your dichotomy doesn't necessarily work since you could easily go with a third option where you can still be incapacitated but you just aren't dealt any actual /damage/.

So things can only do you any ill temporarily, but not permanently (because if they could do that then it renders the power useless). So oxygen deprivation may not kill you but it would still knock you out because your bodies systems don't know that they can just keep functioning normally, similarly many poisons cause your body to act in ways not in your best interest but this isn't damage (well it would normally cause damage). Notably if the power could just protect you from any ill effects period then you would also be immune to any allergies.
