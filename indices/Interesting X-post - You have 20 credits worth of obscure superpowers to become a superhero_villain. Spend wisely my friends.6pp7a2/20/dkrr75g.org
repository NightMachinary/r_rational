Invincibility has a potent hack to it: the cause can be /very/ specific.

- Touching a copper plate with specific, 10 digit number on it. (or a set of names, to remember it)
- Chanting a specific song. Or a poem.
- Really, /desperately/ wishing to die for more than a day.
- "Being in a situation which will certainly inflict tremendous and long-lasting pain upon me."
- "Becoming brainwashed or permanently modified in a way my person before said modification would find a fate as bad or worse than death."
