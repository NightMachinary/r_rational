Ehhh I feel like this is waiting for a Color Pill story from it. To much vagueness in power descriptions; example: must things be tangible? Could you do invincibility to kinetic energy? (Would it be worth it, since you can still be harmed?) If you're hit by a car, is it the impact or the blood loss that kills you?

Knowledge Thief seems reasonable; find dying people. But, do you also get their life's memories?
