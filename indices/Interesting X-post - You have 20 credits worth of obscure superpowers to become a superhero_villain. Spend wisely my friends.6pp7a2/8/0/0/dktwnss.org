I've thought of a few sticking points with the plan. Most notably, I have no idea how I would go about replacing Putin in a way nobody would notice. If I can time when the memory transfer occurs, I might be able to do something like catch him in a bathroom somewhere, drop thermite on the body, then escape with my guards as the building burned down in an obvious assassination attempt. But I'm unsure how I'd even manage that.

Becoming an official body double before replacing him for real probably isn't practical either, as I would look too perfect and arouse suspicion, and I don't know whether he even uses body doubles.

There's probably a way to do this, but I don't know what it is.
