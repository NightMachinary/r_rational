I now replace Putin. Assassinating me is far harder, as you need a bomb or poison. Over several years, I slowly shift his Empire from its current state to one more in-line with international rules and regulations. I withdraw from Crimea, citing it as a waste of money that could be better spent improving the economy. The Mafia is taken fully under my control, and I work on turning it into something more like the Yakuza: dangerous, but controlled and mostly keeping violence in-house.

Once things are properly under control, I convince my oligarchs that the best way for them to maintain power in perpetuity and avoid the kind of revolution Russia has already had once is to set up efficient social services that will keep them happy. I root out corruption in the police, punishing abusive cops severely and pushing the more stubborn precincts into alliances with our new, far less violent Mafia. The long term plan there is to transform their front businesses into actual profitable endeavors and make them realize that going legit is very lucrative and doesn't carry the risk of assassination by rivals.

Economy revitalized, Russia becomes a true world power. Sanctions are dropped because a lot of the human rights violations are gone, and we begin exporting our former Mafia made goods around the world. With them, we export a new philosophy of stability: criminal underworlds tamed into something less dangerous, police still corrupt but usually not to the public's detriment, oligarchs living the high life while everyone else gets to live a reasonable, decent life free of reasons to violently revolt.

Oh, also the infinite frozen yogurt solves the negentropy problem.
