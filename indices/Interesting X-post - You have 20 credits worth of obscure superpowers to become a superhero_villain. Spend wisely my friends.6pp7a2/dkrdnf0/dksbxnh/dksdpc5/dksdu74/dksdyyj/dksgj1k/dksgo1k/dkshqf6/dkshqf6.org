Ah, an idiosyncratic definition of "intangible".

If you're intangible to electromagnetic radiation then you're blind and invisible, but since you're intangible to air your suffocated corpse is now inexorably cooling to zero Kelvin as you oscillate back and forth through the core of the Earth.

If you're intangible to gravity (whatever that would mean) your suffocating body is instead hurled into space tangent to the rotating Earth.

Anyway, there's no good ending here.
