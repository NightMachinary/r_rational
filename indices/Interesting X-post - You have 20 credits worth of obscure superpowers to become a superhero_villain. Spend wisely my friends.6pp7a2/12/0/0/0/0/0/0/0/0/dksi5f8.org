  Ah, an idiosyncratic definition of "intangible".

So idiosyncratic it's the first result on google for the word.

  If you're intangible to electromagnetic radiation then you're blind and invisible, but since you're intangible to air your suffocated corpse is now inexorably cooling to zero Kelvin as you oscillate back and forth through the core of the Earth.
#+end_quote

What information do you have on the realities outside the universe that you know that heat would dissipate?

#+begin_quote
  If you're intangible to gravity (whatever that would mean) your suffocating body is instead hurled into space tangent to the rotating Earth.
#+end_quote

My suffocating body isn't hurled anywhere because who says velocity exists outside the universe?

#+begin_quote
  Anyway, there's no good ending here.
#+end_quote

What part of intangibility the universe would ever hint at a good ending?
