What a fun exercise. I would steal the knowledge of Donald Trump instantly turning him into a vegetable. I would take eternal youth. Then I guess I would like strength as the most useful long term investment. I will use my knowledge to Donald Trump's empire to take some money. I would invest it in low risk funds and then wait. I think I'll take a job as a prison guard on death row or a banker on Wall Street so that I can get some use out of my life suction. I have one point left so I guess I take the fro-yo. I can always sell fro-yo if my Trump plan doesn't work out.
