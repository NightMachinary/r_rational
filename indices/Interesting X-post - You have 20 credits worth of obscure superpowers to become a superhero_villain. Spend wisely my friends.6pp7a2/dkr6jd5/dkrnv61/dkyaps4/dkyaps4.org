Telekinesis + Teleportation:

Immediately throw Earth at the sun. Teleport just as temperatures rise to unsafe levels. Teleport must take you somewhere safe, nowhere safe exists on the Earth, therefore it searches elsewhere in the galaxy and deposits you on a random inhabitable planet.

More of an evil/insane supervillain choice than a rational one, as your new life is likely going to be more of a struggle than one where you have 100 billion dollars, but it optimizes your kill-count.

On the other hand, a rational supervillain might be forced to take teleportation and explain this back-up plan in order to make the extinction threat actually credible.
