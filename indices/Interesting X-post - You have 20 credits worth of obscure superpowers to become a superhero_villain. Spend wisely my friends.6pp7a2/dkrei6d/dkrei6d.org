What's the curse on the yogurt? And what's 'unlimited'?

Telekinesis is the most broken one. Earth is an object, after all. Solve for global warming, check. Crush (literally) North Korean dictatorship, check. Beating Elon in race to Mars - WIP.

Teleportation is an obvious out-of-jail card, but I don't think it can be used for anything more than that. Unless 'anywhere' includes other planets (there are bound to be some safe ones) in which case you are screwed hard. So no.

Eternal youth seems useful, if morally dubious, provided you can handle being a loner.

Invisibility, flight, telekinesis. Be able to kill almost anyone on the planet. Be in general proximity of your target, wait for invisibility start, fly over them, kill them with something massive, or just shove them from a balcony or something. 2 extra points go in holding breath or hunger + froyo for the lulz.
