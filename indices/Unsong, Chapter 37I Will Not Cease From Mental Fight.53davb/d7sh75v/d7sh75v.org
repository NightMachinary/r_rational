Apparently Jinxiang means "gold hometown". I'm trying to think what that could be referencing. Is there anywhere in the US that's called the "golden city"? There's Golden State I think, and San Francisco has the Golden Gate Bridge, but I don't know enough US geography to come up with better candidates.
