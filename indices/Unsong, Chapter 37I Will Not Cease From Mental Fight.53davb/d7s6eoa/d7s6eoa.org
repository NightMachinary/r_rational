Let's talk about the Kabbalah of Trump Tower.

Trump is connected to the French verb 'tromper'- to fool.

In the Tarot deck, the Fool is either high or low, like the Ace. The Trump card, if you will. This is not a coincidence etc.

Aaron acted foolishly, and he is high on peyote, and high at the top of Trump Tower. No points for guessing what value the Fool has in this game.

The obvious interpretation of Tower is the Tower of Babel. Hell, it was specifically mentioned in this chapter. The story of the Tower is that mankind was punished and divided for building too close to Heaven.

So would Trump Tower mean 'To overreach in your deception'? A bit like what the Drug Lord did.
