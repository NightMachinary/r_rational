This chapter is based at least in part on asking DMT entities to factor very large relative primes. 37 is a prime number, and its only factors are itself and one. 38 is a relative prime of 2 and 19. This is not a coincidence because nothing is a coincidence.

Thus, the only possible chapter number for this chapter is 38, and your memories of it having been 37 must have been falsified. Perhaps by a DMT entity.
