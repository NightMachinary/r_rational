I just went through all 5 chapters, and I have to say, you really picked one of the most niche and obscure fanfic premises there is. Like, does the Lion Guard show even /have/ fans?

Personally, I hated that show, and I'm not a fan of the "talking carnivorous animals want to be vegetarians" types of plot (I didn't like the sharks in Finding Nemo that much), so I'm probably not the story's target audience.

It does make me want to read a fic about prey-predators social dynamics in Stargate Atlantis.
