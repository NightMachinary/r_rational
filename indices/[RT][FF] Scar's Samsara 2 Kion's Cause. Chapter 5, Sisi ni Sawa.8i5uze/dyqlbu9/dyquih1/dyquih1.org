I know, I know. I wrote this story because I felt like writing it - I knew from the get go that it wouldn't be as popular as the others, because of the source material. People who don't like Lion Guard very much are the target audience though, as I don't expect anyone to have watched it or liked it. Part of the fun of rational fiction is to try and fix all of the issues with an existing story, of which the Lion Guard has many. Just see it as a stand-alone sequel to Scar's Samsara.

Btw, if it's annoying anyone I can stop posting every update here on reddit: Don't want to drown out the subreddit if bi-weekly posts if that's an issue.
