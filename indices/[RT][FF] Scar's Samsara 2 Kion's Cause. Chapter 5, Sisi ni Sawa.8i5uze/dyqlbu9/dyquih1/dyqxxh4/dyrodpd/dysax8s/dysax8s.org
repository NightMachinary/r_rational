This is my very subjective perspective as a guy who reads fanfic and has never written any, but I think good fanfic material is stuff that frustrates its readers, because they see great potential in it or its universe, or they like the franchise in general, but they're disappointed by the execution.

Stuff like Star Wars or Naruto or Harry Potter is great fanfic material because everybody loves them, but they all have parts that the fandom hates and wish were done differently. I don't think anyone loved or saw potential in the Lion Guard.
