It's not annoying me; I'm not really thinking "Oh my god, if this idiot Sophronius keeps drowning out this subreddit with his dumb story I might miss the next r!Animorphs update!"

  People who don't like Lion Guard very much are the target audience though, as I don't expect anyone to have watched it or liked

I know you've already written your stuff and it's too late, but I don't think Lion Guard is good fanfic material.

It's bad, but it's not bad because the authors were misguided or limited by censorship or executing an interesting concept poorly. It's bad because it's a soulless cash-grab, with abysmal production values and unimaginative writing. I don't think there's anything redeeming about it; unlike a cartoon like, say, Star vs the Forces of Evil, which I also dislike, but at least has a personality and interesting ideas.
