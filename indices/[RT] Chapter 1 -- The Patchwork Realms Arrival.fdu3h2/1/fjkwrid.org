I thoroughly enjoyed that first chapter. I think you did a good job representing a non human intelligence at both cognitive levels. Plus he is rather adorable, as any good pupper would be. As far as the language goes, a dog who can't understand those he wants to get pets and belly rubs from, doesn't seem like an optimal doggo, so looking forward to your mentioned magical solution.
