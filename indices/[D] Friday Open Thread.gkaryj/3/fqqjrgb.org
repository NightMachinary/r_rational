I've had to be around while Disney's /Descendants/ is playing a few times lately, and I swear I can't figure out how a love potion was allowed into the plot or how they don't feel guilty hand-waving it away. The victim says afterwards:

"No, look, It's fine. I mean, you had a crush on me. I was with Audrey. You didn't trust that it could happen on its own. Am I right?"

Maybe there could be some subtle excuse, but subtlety is not in the cards for this film.
