In the sixth HP book the heroes find them being sold in, uh, a joke shop. Ron later accidentally ingests some which was aimed at Harry and briefly becomes obsessed with an unattractive girl he barely knows. It nearly destroys his (admittedly shallow) relationship with his first girlfriend. All in all, a lot of things in HP have some really skeezy implications, because Rowling isn't great at considering that kind of thing in advance.
