It's pretty common for people to fail to recognize forcibly changing someone's preferences as a violation of their preferences. You see it in fiction with love potions, and how mind control has to show the victim fighting back to make sure you know it's bad. And you see it in real life with angsty lovestricken teens wanting to "make him/her love me," and much more harmfully when people justify gay conversion therapy.
