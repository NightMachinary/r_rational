I just made an account and tried it out on the "time of day" experiment.\\
I feel that the tests do not measure what I care about, and even worse, sometimes they test something I explicitly do not want to optimize.

An example of this is the nonsense word recall test - I do NOT want to get better at remembering random 8- or 9-character long letter jumbles, I'd be fine if the test was about recalling random actual words, as I feel that would actually be meaningful to improve.

Similarly, I don't care about all the tests that are really just reaction time tests with or without inhibiting on some visual input, or just some unnecessary confusion thrown in, I think just one reaction time test is enough, and I conjecture that'd be relatively stable over time.

One of the tests I do find interesting is the "Visual Forward Digit Span", AKA digit recall, I actually do want to get better at this because I find myself copying IDs, verification codes, and so on quite often... But in those cases I can see the whole string of numbers at once, not as in this test where digits flash by one digit at a time, so again, this test tests something that isn't quite what I want.

There are also a lot of potentially interesting tests missing, most of the ones I can think of are various kinds of recall (shapes, colors, audio samples, ...), both immediate and delayed, any sort of reasoning / logic tests, hell, I would be happy with a simple fast arithmetic test.

Overall, I think this sort of site has a lot of potential, but the current set of tests is deeply disappointing.
