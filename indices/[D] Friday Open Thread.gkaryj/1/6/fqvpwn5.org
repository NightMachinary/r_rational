Something that doesn't perfectly match what you describe but is relatively established as a medium is forum quests, such as on Sufficient Velocity. Quests are closer to a cyoa, in that the author writes a chapter at a time and then all the players vote on what the MC will do next, which informs the next chapter that the author writes.

Large quests can often become a cacophony of noise as everyone furiously debates the best action, but smaller quests often become a much chiller discussion of what happened and planning of what to do next, and typically creative options are encouraged when the players come up with something cool.

Quests can be number-crunchy or entirely number-free, but the advantage to quests is that quests have gotten popular enough for you to browse a variety of currently active ones to find some to your liking, so it might work out for you.
