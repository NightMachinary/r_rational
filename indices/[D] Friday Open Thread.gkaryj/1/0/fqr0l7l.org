We've seen a lot of fun improv scenes in our Changeling game too. Like Igigigif says, there's lots of light systems, I don't want to steal his thunder.

Secondly, there really are lots of play-by-post people out there. Spacebattles, Sufficient Velocity and their sister site are easy to get into. I've had good luck with play by post on specific fan sites, if you have fandoms you really like.
