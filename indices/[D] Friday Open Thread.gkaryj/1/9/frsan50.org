I am also a roleplay-focused player. My first system that I played in was Pathfinder, a system based off of D&D 3.5 with ridiculously tedious combat. But I liked the idea of table top role playing games and had enough fun that I stuck with it. I then moved and found a new group and realized I was just playing in the wrong system.

I am now running a Monster of the Week game and playing in GURPS game and a Burning Wheel game (all played over Discord). I highly recommend Monster of the Week and other Powered by the Apocalypse games for a more rules-light collaborative experience.

In my Monster of the Week game that concluded a few months ago, the GM and I were very collaborative and worldbuilding focused, so we had play-by-post conversations outside the weekly group sessions where my character would investigate the nature of magic. (I do eventually want to turn the story from that campaign into a webcomic.)
