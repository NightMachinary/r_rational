I was in an RP guild in an MMO at one point. Pretty much everything [[/u/jtolmar]] said about forum roleplay also applies to roleplaying within an MMO.

The online RP communities I've participated in tend to focus more on collaborative storytelling rather than numbers-focused combat like traditional DnD. However, every community is different and has it's own set of rules.

When a group of close friends roleplay, they might have a good idea of what conflict-outcomes would make the story more interesting for both of their characters, so they would agree on some failures or catastrophes without needing dice-rolls to arbitrate. In other words, rather than self-centeredly caring about whether their own character 'wins', they care about what makes a better narrative, and they collaborate to achieve that.

In other cases, groups might rely on dice rolls to arbitrate outcomes whenever two characters are in conflict. Some RPers prefer rolling the dice because it decreases the potential for bias in favor of one character and/or it makes the unexpected failures and successes more emotionally satisfying.

Sometimes one member of the RP group comes up with an idea for an important storyline that would affect the characters, so that person acts as a sort-of GM to write the events as they happen while the other players write their characters' reactions. Unlike in table-top roleplaying, the unofficial 'GM' position can switch around frequently to whoever has a new event idea to add to the collective story.
