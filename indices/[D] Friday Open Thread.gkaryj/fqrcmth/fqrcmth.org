I'm still reeling over how good the latest chapters of Worth the Candle are. Like, yeah it's narratively satisfying, but I mean more so what I learned from them.

Self sabotage happens on such a subtle level that it's hard to notice in myself. But having the theme reflected and magnified in the way only fiction can...I don't know.

I'm still making silly mistakes, but it's been a bit easier to forgive myself and keep pushing though. People only do what they feel like they need to in order to survive, and I'm not an exception to that.

I don't know. I guess, let's try to be less hard on ourselves, especially if it feels like things are burning down around us. It's okay to not be okay, and holding ourselves to any higher a standard is energy that might otherwise be spent giving yourself a hug.
