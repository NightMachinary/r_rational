Worth the Candle is such a great work of fiction that it starts to edge out of Fantasy and towards Literary Fiction.

The character and dialogue are written in such a way as to provoke introspection without chaining an epic, galloping plot.

I find myself thinking about my past, about mistakes I've made, about the way I've made people feel. As a nerdy, bookworm white kid in a fairly rural town, who played DnD growing up, WtC speaks to me on a very deep level.

It speaks to me about the desire to play, to create, to imagine, to think beyond my mundane existence and let myself drift in theory and fancy. It reminds me of the dangers of doing so.

It speaks to me about the awkwardness and difficulty of my first romantic relationships, the mistakes and self-loathing and fleeting joys.

It speaks to me about the way people grow and mature, the way I have changed as I have aged. The nature of close friendship, the nature of kinship, the nature of society.

Worth the Candle is unique, powerful, and unremittingly interesting.
