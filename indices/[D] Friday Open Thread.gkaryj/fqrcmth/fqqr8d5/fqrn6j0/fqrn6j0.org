I watched "the hollow" on netflix. It's a kids show, and not a particularly good one. It did have a few interesting moments in season 2, but they didn't really explore them in any reasonable depth.

In season 2 it turns out that the cast are digital copies of the original players, who managed to escape from their server because one of their cohort cheated in order to keep the mind-wipe that was part of season one's gameplay from effecting her.

I feel like they could have taken that to some much more interesting places than they did, I guess they're just a lot more committed to the "kids show" motif than I would have liked. Like at one point someone gets "eaten", and the camera angles are very carefully framed to avoid showing the bottom half of them, through several different cuts and different camera angles. This is a good bit of "cinematography" or whatever the animation equivalent is, because the presumed gore-discretion-shot nicely demonstrates that the stakes are higher than the characters thought. But then they pull the camera back and the guy is fine, no visible damage or anything.

It's weird because you can see that there's somone interesting on that creative team, but it seems like everyone else is working to undercut them, like a design by committee where a few of them are trying to make a good interesting/philosophical show, but then someone else jumps in and says "alright what if there was a giant rubix-cube monster that tried to fight them while they solved puzzles".
