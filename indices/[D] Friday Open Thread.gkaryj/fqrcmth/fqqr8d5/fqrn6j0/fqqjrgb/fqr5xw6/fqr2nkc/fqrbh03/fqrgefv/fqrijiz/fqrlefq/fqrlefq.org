eh... it was handled /okay/ in canon. There's this whole thing about voldemort's mother using a love potion to ensare her husband, which was clearly depicted as rotten, but there was also some "wacky high school high jinks" which not a whole lot came of. At the very least, we can say that none of our protagonist's relationships were spawned from a love potion. I think the intent was that the voldemort's-parents'-story would be the final word on the issue, saying, yes, these are terrible, but the hogwarts love potion plotline I think is still tonally off.
