I did a bit of forum roleplay (on Acmlm's board lol) when I was a teenager, but grew out of it. You can still find that sort of thing kicking around on old-fashioned forum-style sites. You should be able to find one by googling for "forum roleplay" and digging through a few pages of results. I think one of my friends runs a Pern themed one, I can ask for a link if that's something you're interested in.

Generally forum roleplay is systemless and GM-less, though sometimes those are bent. Everything you'd expect to go wrong with completely freeform roleplay does - super overpowered characters, people wallowing in edginess, creepers - but people know this and those sorts of behavior are frowned on. There's also a common rule that you don't narrate the effects of your actions on other people's characters, which people are extremely, bitterly protective of, so make sure you grok that before diving in. Roleplay forums tend to be insular and cliquish, but not outright hostile to newcomers, especially if they take the time to understand the local customs.
