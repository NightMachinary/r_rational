Find a game with faster or less focus on combat. Shadowrun and other games that are more about espionage, theft and other non combat focused missions are good at this.

There's still combat though, but when you're fighting people with guns it tends to go a lot faster and be a lot more dangerous, so people are more likely to try and avoid it.
