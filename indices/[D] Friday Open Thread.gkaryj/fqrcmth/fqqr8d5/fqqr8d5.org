Has anybody here tried play-by-post collaborative writing? Like writing a story together, or playing DnD in a chat/forum? Can you share some advice on how to get started with this?

I really love everything about DnD except for the combat. I hate combat. Every time we get into a fight in DnD it turns into a 40 minute ordeal of casting the same spells, rolling dice, arguing about obscure rules, and doing basic arithmetic until monster's HP drops to zero. I know that a lot of people enjoy this stuff, but it's making me miserable.

What I do love is roleplaying, making up stories, finding creative solutions to the problems, talking to NPCs, improvising fun scenes and joking around. So I'm wondering, is there a way to get the storytelling/roleplaying things I like about DnD without getting bogged down in tedious fighting encounters and fiddly rules?

Obviously, just writing fiction would be a good solution, but I really struggle with this. Writing is really hard, and DnD makes it really easy. So I'm looking to get the best of both worlds. I think something like play-by-post could be a very fun way to spend time, get to know people, and break through the writer's block.

If you can think of anything else that can help me to get the fun of DnD and writing, without the boredom of DnD combat and without the difficulty of writing - please share!
