Definitely agree that this is pretty good stuff. It does suffer from the same problems as the source material, but that doesn't mean it isn't an interesting story in its own right.

What I find really interesting are the author's notes and the short analyses at the end of some of the chapters, notably the one about Matsuda after chapter 5. He really has a good grasp on these characters and literary structure, and it shows in both the story itself and these little asides.
