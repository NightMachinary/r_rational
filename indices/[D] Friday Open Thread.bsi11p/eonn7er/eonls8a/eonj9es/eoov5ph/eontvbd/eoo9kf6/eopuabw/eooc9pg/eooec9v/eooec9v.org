I read a few things before posting that comment.

Dream pain is /exceptionally/ uncommon. It's even more uncommon than being able to taste or smell during a dream, which is something like less than 1%. Loads of people know that /that/ is physically possible, yet none of them spontaneously start being able to smell or taste as a result of that knowledge.

Given that people don't start experiencing dream pain just by having been exposed to the knowledge that it's within the realm of possibility, I don't agree that it qualifies as an infohazard. Who informed you that it's an infohazard and what qualifies them to make such an assertion? Because the people who research this stuff for a living say that dream pain is a result of things like getting a cramp while you're asleep or having pins and needles from lying in such a way that you cut off circulation to a limb, or a result of chronic pain. The conditions necessary to produce dream pain (somatosensory stimulation like pressure or pain) /will/ produce dream pain regardless of whether or not the person exposed to those conditions is aware of that possibility, and it doesn't happen in the absence of somatosensory stimulation unless you've been targeted by .

EDIT:

Um, /targeted by/ .

EDIT:

Hmm...

I was just trying to be creepy there at the end, the pain dreams really did happen exactly as described.
