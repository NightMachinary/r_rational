  METHOD: One hundred and eighty-five participants completed a battery of questionnaires and recorded their dreams for two consecutive weeks.

  RESULTS: Retrospective responses to the questionnaire indicate that close to 50% of individuals report having experienced pain in their dreams at least once. A total of 3045 dreams were reported in the home dream logs. Eighteen of these dreams contained unambiguous references to the subject experiencing pain.

  After indicating interest, participants were contacted by telephone and asked to attend an information meeting. At the meeting, *the research was briefly explained* [emphasis mine], *the role of the participants was clarified* [emphasis mine] and two research protocols were distributed.

  The Sleep/Dream Questionnaire included one question that asked “Have you ever experienced sensations of physical pain in your dreams? If so, please describe”.

  Ninety-one of the 185 participants (49.2%) indicated on the Sleep/Dream Questionnaire that they had experienced pain in their dreams at least once.

And...

#+begin_quote
  During the two-week period of home dream recording, participants reported a mean of 16.5 dreams each (SD=7.3) for a total of 3045 dreams... Sixteen participants (five men and 11 women) (8.6%) reported a total of 18 pain dreams; two of these female participants each reported two pain dreams.
#+end_quote

So they told like 200 people "hey, it's possible to have pain in your dreams" and like 100 of them had had dream pain at least once before in their lives, and even with that priming, fewer than 20 people had /one single pain dream/ out of 17 dreams over a period of two weeks. Only 17.6 percent of the number of people who had experienced a pain dream before in their lives had another one after being told it was possible.

18 out of 3045 is 0.6%. Why did the number of pain dreams recorded in this study resemble the number of pain dreams recorded in the general population? If your assertion were correct, we would expect the number of pain dreams in this study to be higher because this was a population of people who were /explicitly/ informed that it's possible to have a pain dream.

EDIT:

There are two things I'd like to head off preemptively.

#+begin_quote
  "Two females had /two pain dreams each/"
#+end_quote

Yeah I left out some stuff about how females are statistically more likely to experience pain dreams than are males, the study is seven pages long, can't include literally /everything/.

#+begin_quote
  1 pain dream out of 16 recorded dreams is 6%. 6% is /WAY HIGHER/ than 1%.
#+end_quote

One dream is the minimum. You can't have half a dream. Therefore, 6% is the lowest it would've been physically possible to record. You'd have to have 96 or 104 recorded dreams to get down to one dream being 1%. If they were having an average of 8 dreams a week, that would've required running the study for 12 or 13 weeks. They ran it for two weeks. Feel free to approach a scientist and ask them to try to replicate the study but run it for 3 months instead of 2 weeks, but they're going to give you an emphatic and resounding "NO," so for now this study is the best you're going to get, and there's still the fact that only 8.6% of the participants had a pain dream even though 50% of the participants had had one before in their lives and all of them were primed with the knowledge that it's possible to experience a pain dream.
