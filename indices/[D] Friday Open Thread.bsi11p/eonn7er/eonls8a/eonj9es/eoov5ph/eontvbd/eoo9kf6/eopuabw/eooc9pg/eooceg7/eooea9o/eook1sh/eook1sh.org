Unfortunately I know of no widespread study done on it. It is indeed rare, enough so that it's hard to gather a significant amount of people for more than a case study. Still, experiences do tell us something, and I am not the only one to have experiences with the phenomenon. Someone I know has experienced it after hearing the information, and while that's not ironclad proof it does square with what else we know of how dreams work.

Lucid Dreaming, by Stephen LaBerge, is a great book if you want to know more about the subject in general.

Edit: spelling.
