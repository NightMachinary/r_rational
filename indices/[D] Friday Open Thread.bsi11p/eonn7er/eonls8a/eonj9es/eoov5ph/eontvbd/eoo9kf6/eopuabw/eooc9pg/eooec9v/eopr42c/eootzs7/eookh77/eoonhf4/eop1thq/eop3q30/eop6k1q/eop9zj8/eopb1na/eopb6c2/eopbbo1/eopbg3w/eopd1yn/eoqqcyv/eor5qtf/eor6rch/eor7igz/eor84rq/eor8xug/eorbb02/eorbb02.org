  Your assertion: roughly 1% of people can smell or feel in dreams. Yes?
#+end_quote

I didn't assert that, I read it in a study and relayed it here. And I worded it poorly.

#+begin_quote
  It's even more uncommon than being able to taste or smell during a dream, which is something like less than 1%.
#+end_quote

That has nothing to do with how many people can smell or feel in a dream, it's the percent of all dreams with that sort of content. 50% of people have had at least one dream where they experienced real pain. But each of those people has had thousands upon thousands of dreams each over the course of their lives. I wasn't sure of that at the time which is why I worded it ambiguously.

  One can always learn more.
#+end_quote

Yeah, you can, and you can learn a lot more from actually researching it than by taking some rando on reddit at their word. Did you look at those studies I included with that other comment? You seem to be pretty convinced that you know as much as you need to know about this subject - even though every legitimate study I've been able to find contradicts you - and you don't seem open to /anything/ which contradicts your assertions. Is that rational?
