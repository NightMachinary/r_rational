I do have evidence that this qualifies as an infohazard (a minor one, for the reasons you mentioned, but still). Someone I know did not experience pain in his dreams before learning about it. Now, he was able to lucid dream, so it may not be as easy to transfer the hazard as simply telling someone the information. It is still a risk, though.

Now as to being able to taste or smell, is that figure reported by people or examined more directly? What I know says it's the former, since every human on Earth dreams, even if they forget them easily, and the experiences tend to feel more real under certain circumstances. Everyone should be able to learn to experience with every sense during dreams. It takes practice and effort, but someone would need to have an exceptionally alien brain to not even be /able/ to.
