Wow. You really /are/ dense. Lemme try rewording that since you seem to be having a hard time with it.

#+begin_quote
  At the beginning of the study, 185 people were told that it is possible to feel pain in a dream.

  91 of those people reported that they had had a pain dream at some point in their life before the study began.

  16 people had a pain dream over the course of the study.

  16 is 17.6% of 91.

All 16 of those people could've been from the group that hadn't had a pain dream before. I doubt it, because I suspect that people prone to it are prone to it and people not prone to it aren't prone to it, but I'll grant that to you for the sake of argument. That would've meant that 17.6% of the newly-informed people experienced a pain dream after having been exposed to the information that it is possible to experience a pain dream. /But 50% of people experience pain dreams at some point in their lives./ Do you see the problem there? Hint: 17 is less than 50.

You latched onto something you thought was a "gotcha!" quote, and utterly failed to acknowledge the most important part.

Within the group of "people with severe burns or chronic pain," roughly 30% of their dreams are pain dreams. That's about the same as experimentally induced pain dreams caused by purposefully cutting off a subject's circulation with a blood pressure cuff.

Within the group of "people who experience pain dreams not caused by somatosensory stimulation," like 1% of their dreams are pain dreams. [My own original thinking, not part of any studies mentioned: Any given dream has a 1% or lower chance of being a pain dream. Most people don't have very good dream recall. It's entirely possible that literally every human has pain dreams, and the 50% who report having had pain dreams are just people who have better dream recall than average.]

Within the group of "people who experienced a pain dream over the course of the study we're discussing," 1 out of 16 of their dreams was a pain dream. 1 dream is the minimum. You can't have half a dream. Therefore, 6% is the lowest it would've been physically possible to record. You'd have to have 96 or 104 recorded dreams to get down to one dream being 1%. If they were having an average of 8 dreams a week, that would've required running the study for 12 or 13 weeks. They ran it for two weeks. Feel free to approach a scientist and ask them to try to replicate the study but run it for 3 months instead of 2 weeks, but they're going to give you an emphatic and resounding "NO," so for now this study is the best you're going to get, and there's still the fact that only 8.6% of the participants had a pain dream even though 50% of the participants had had one before in their lives and all of them were primed with the knowledge that it's possible to experience a pain dream.

At this point you're just being willfully ignorant.
