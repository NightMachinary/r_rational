If this /is/ an infohazard (which it isn't) then it's one of the most /extraordinarily poorly/ contained infohazards.

I'm sure I could find dozens and dozens more, but I think I've made my point.

This seems to be a "prominent" lucid dreaming website:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/can-you-feel-pain-in-lucid-dreams.html]]
#+end_quote

They don't seem to have any problem propagating that information.

According to this...

#+begin_quote
  [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298430929_The_Nature_and_Prevalence_of_Pain_in_Dreams]]
#+end_quote

... close to 50% of people report having experienced dream pain at least once, which is much more in line with the abundance of self-reporting across reddit than whatever other thing I read that implanted the "rarer than 1%" idea in my head, probably this:

[[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d277/b3611b5dc060b219fc8f9d1bc1a47c949a19.pdf]]

Another article citing 1%:

#+begin_quote
  [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4c1a/47dd3d548d872c96cd0bfa80788088117b40.pdf][Although some theorists have suggested that pain sensations cannot be part of the dreaming world, research has shown that pain sensations occur in about 1% of the dreams in healthy persons and in about 30% of patients with acute, severe pain.]]

They /could/ be compatible, if 50 out of 100 people reported having had at least one pain dream but 5000 total dreams were recorded (ie 50 dreams recorded per person).

There's this as well:

I am still unconvinced by what has been presented to my by you and by [[/u/Lightwavers]] as evidence.
