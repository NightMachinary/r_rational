A) Its of course only a infohazard here under [[/r/rational]] type folks. Most people aren't even familiar with the concept of an infohazard, let alone do they register the strong emotional response that for some of us are intuitive.

I suspect that the strong emotional response to this type of information is also responsible for it; you react in your sleep to this distressing event by dreaming about it, similar to other stressful events in ones life.

B) Its also an incredibly light hazard. Infection rates are rather low, length of acute infection is short (1 week or so), inflicted pain is pretty low. The one outlier does warrant a bit more caution in my opinion. But then I am very pain averse, and people who cheat on their partners in monogamous relationships or pig factory farmers inflict much more pain than a successful transmission every single day without a care in the world.

3) It is a psychological phenomenon, and self-reporting is the main and only practical route for detecting these in the first place. I get that you are sceptical and of course I'd love to see a goldstandard study with large N done on it.

I have experienced this, as has my friend who told me about it >10 years ago. I have no written record of my dream back then, and could have fabricated that too. Some others who I do not know personally have reported these experiences back to me. Still, epistemic and evidence status from outside view: questionable.
