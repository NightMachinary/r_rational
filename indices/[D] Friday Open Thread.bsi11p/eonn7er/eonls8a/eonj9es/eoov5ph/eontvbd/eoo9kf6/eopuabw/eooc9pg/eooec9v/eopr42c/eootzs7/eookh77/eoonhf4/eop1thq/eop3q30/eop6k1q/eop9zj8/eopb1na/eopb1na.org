Eh, I tend to take people at face value. It's easier that way. Assuming people are saying the opposite of what they mean becomes tiring.

You are missing the point. The experiment would be to prove that you---that anyone---can experience pain or other senses in dreams, which you seemed to doubt.

Yeah, but I recommended the book more to help you understand how to lucid dream. He doesn't go into the whole pain in dreams thing, he instead proves the existence and methods of lucid dreams through various controlled experiments.
