Has anyone seen the new Aladdin movie? I watched it yesterday and kept thinking how ripe for munchkinry that simple premise can be. The movie itself exploits that potential a bit more as for example, Jafar being turned into a genie is the result of Genie interpreting the wish in a clever way, rather than his exact wording. Well, the movie isn't great or anything, but it made me wish there was a rational Aladdin or generally One Thousand and One Nights kind of setting story.
