[[https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-real-reason-fans-hate-the-last-season-of-game-of-thrones/][The Real Reason Fans Hate the Last Season of Game of Thrones]] is that we don't really know how to tell *sociological stories*. I recommend reading the whole article but it's quite long, so I paste some quotes below. "Sociological writing" has a lot in common with rational writing.

  George R. R. Martin (...) specialize in having characters evolve in response to the broader institutional settings, incentives and norms that surround them.

  Benioff and Weiss steer the narrative lane away from the sociological and shifted to the psychological. That's the main, and often only, way Hollywood and most television writers tell stories.

  In sociological storytelling, the characters have personal stories and agency, of course, but those are also greatly shaped by institutions and events around them. The incentives for characters' behavior come noticeably from these external forces, too, and even strongly influence their inner life.

  People then fit their internal narrative to align with their incentives, justifying and rationalizing their behavior along the way.

  The overly personal mode of storytelling or analysis leaves us bereft of deeper comprehension of events and history.

  We also have a bias for the individual as the locus of agency in interpreting our own everyday life and the behavior of others. We tend to seek internal, psychological explanations for the behavior of those around us while making situational excuses for our own (...) - the fundamental attribution error.

  That tension between internal stories and desires, psychology and external pressures, institutions, norms and events was exactly what Game of Thrones showed us for many of its characters, creating rich tapestries of psychology but also behavior that was neither saintly nor fully evil at any one point. It was something more than that: *you could understand why even the characters undertaking evil acts were doing what they did, how their good intentions got subverted, and how incentives structured behavior*.

  The hallmark of sociological storytelling is if it can encourage us to put ourselves in the place of any character, not just the main hero/heroine, and imagine ourselves making similar choices.

  Well-run societies don't need heroes, and the way to keep terrible impulses in check isn't to dethrone antiheros and replace them with good people. Unfortunately, most of our storytelling---in fiction and also in mass media nonfiction---remains stuck in the hero/antihero narrative.
