Yeah, it is a good read and if they wanted to keep the season 1-4 quality they would have had to do that. I would also say that it is really difficult to do while simultaneously moving the story where you want it to be. It poses additional constraints on the characters (same as our rationality requirement here) and that makes all other aspects of storytelling harder.

We'll see if GRRM will be able to solve that optimization problem to a satisfying degree in the remaining time he has available.

I would have been happy with them playing it safe (playing tropes straight) if they really wanted to finish it within the few episodes. I.e. the night king remains the big bad till the end of the season, e.g. Jon kills him with a flaming sword in a final big battle. Dany gets the throne (and then burns it symbolically) or dies heroically against the white walkers. Bran uses his time warping powers to buy off the golden company or something from Cercei and perhaps tries to control the night kings dragon. Arya or Jaime kill Cersei (Arya also gets a last minute save by Nymeria and her pack). A bit underwhelming and not clever, but servicable and entertaining (like Marvel movies).

But somehow they tried to emulate the storytelling of earlier seasons, just infinitely more rushed and ... failed. Maybe they tried to follow what GRRM told them would happen? Idk.
