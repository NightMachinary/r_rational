This is partly the reason why, but there's a host of other reasons too. The rushed pacing of the last two seasons, the inconsistency of character actions and motivations, the sacrifice of sense for spectacle.

Not to mention the fact that various interviews have shown that D&D just wanted to end the show despite being given a blank check and an offer of however many seasons they needed to finish the show. It's just incredibly insulting to the fans how this was all done. MauLer has some great video essays explaining all the shortcomings of the current season.
