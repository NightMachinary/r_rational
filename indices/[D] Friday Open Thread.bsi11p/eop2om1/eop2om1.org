Does anyone know of good resources for ornate fonts? I don't mean fancy fonts or calligraphy, but rather the very elaborate letters you sometimes see at the beginning of a chapter which are as big as the following paragraph. Those are called drop caps and I was hoping to find examples of them for research.
