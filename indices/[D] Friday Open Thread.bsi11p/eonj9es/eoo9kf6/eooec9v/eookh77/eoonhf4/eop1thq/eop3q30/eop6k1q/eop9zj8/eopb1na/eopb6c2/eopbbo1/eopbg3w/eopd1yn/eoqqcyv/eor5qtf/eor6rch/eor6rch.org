I was annoyed because you said "The experiment would be to prove that you---that anyone---can experience pain or other senses in dreams, which you seemed to doubt." That's simply false.

Saying "I am convinced that dream pain cannot be memetically transferred" is in no way similar to saying "I doubt that people can experience pain or other senses in dreams." Not even close.

And then you said "Yeah, but I recommended the book more to help you understand how to lucid dream. He doesn't go into the whole pain in dreams thing, he instead proves the existence and methods of lucid dreams through various controlled experiments." I mentioned lucid dreams in the original post. That means I know what lucid dreams are.
