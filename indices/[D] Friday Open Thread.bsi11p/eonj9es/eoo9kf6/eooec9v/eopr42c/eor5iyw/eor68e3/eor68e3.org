Just because an infohazard is poorly contained does not mean it isn't an infohazard. Your sources back up the statement that pain in dream is something people experience. All we need now is a study testing whether the frequency increases when people are told about the phenomenon. Since you won't accept anecdotes (which is fair) we could set up a poll over the internet or raise awareness until it catches an actual scientist's attention.
