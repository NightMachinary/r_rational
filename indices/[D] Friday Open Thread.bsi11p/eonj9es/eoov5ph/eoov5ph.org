  I vividly saw a full-on skeleton with glowing eyes and sharp teeth, and it started biting my hands and my forearms

That's freaking terrifying. I'm sorry you have nightmares like that; most of my nightmares tend to be boring "I Won't Make the Rent in Time" sorts of dreams.

The ability to fly and throw Ki blasts makes my fantastic dreams less nightmarish, almost no matter what happens in them. Being able to fly is my lucid dream indicator. It is not as mundane as light switches or as dangerous as checking mirrors, but I find it convenient. As far as I can tell most people in my day to day life never notice me checking if I can fly with a thought.
