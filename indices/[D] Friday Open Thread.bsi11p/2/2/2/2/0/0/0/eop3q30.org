It's certainly not "hey, some dude I'm acquainted with (you wouldn't know him, he goes to another school) made a claim, and I believe him." I really don't trust people involved in the lucid dreaming community to have any knowledge about how dreams work, anyways. Too mystical and full of pseudoscience.
