Hey, I am Lightwavers source, thanks to Noumero for paging me.

I did get the first and only pain dreams in my life after being told that dream pain knowledge can be contagious by a friend, duration about a week, mild pain. Since then I've sent out word to 80 people here on [[/r/rational]] and asked them to please report back to me either positive and negative status. One third of people reported back, mostly negative.

3 were already naturally experiencing the phenomenon, so we have ridiculously high baserate here on the sub or rolled REALLY well with the small survey size. Two reported having started pain dreams.

One of these described their experience as "extreme pain, one week of pure torture".

Ergo: low infection rate (lower than naturally occuring), shortness of experienced period seems pretty safe, but the one outlier of "extreme pain" makes me wary to go parade this around.
