I've been informed that the knowledge that you can feel pain in dreams is a minor infohazard, so you may want to add something to the effect of that at the top of your comment. Knowing this community, it won't do anything, but I think it may be best to have a warning up anyway.

If you want to stop the nightmares, I believe the techniques for lucid dreaming will help. They helped me, at any rate. Keep a dream journal, make it a habit to write in it immediately upon waking up, note down comment elements of a dream, make it a habit to pause and do a reality check every so often or upon seeing one of these elements---all that good stuff. By making reality checks a habit, you increase the chances that you'll do one in a dream as well. And then you'll be in control. When facing nightmares with full awareness, I tend to subvert them instead of just blasting them away or something. For example, I might make the ogre with knives for hands have a slightly dumb but caring personality, and give him a backstory, and alter his appearance a bit to match. Do these changes often enough and they'll stick eventually even when you're not aware you're dreaming.

Hope that helps.
