  In my case it was related to sleep paralysis.
#+end_quote

When I was 3 and 4, I was /really good at dreaming/. Like, I could just decide before bed to dream and I'd do so, and it was even more like real life than the dreams I have nowadays. At some point around 4, I started having sleep paralysis, though I didn't know that's what it was or that other people experienced it until more than a decade later. I never saw humanoid shapes or felt something sitting on my chest or any of that common sleep paralysis stuff. I'd be lying in bed and feel like I hadn't gone to sleep yet, and dozens and dozens of what my 4-year-old brain decided to label as "pirates" would enter the room through the door. The "pirates" were circles - not spheres, circles - with staticky writhing outlines, and they moved along 2-D surfaces like the walls and the dresser/mirror and the ceiling. If I had to guess I'd say they were between 9 and 15 inches wide, and they mostly stayed towards the far end of the room. Of course I was very afraid of them.

At some point all that stopped and I didn't really dream particularly often for the next 15ish years, maybe once every month or two, and they weren't that vivid when I had them. However, for at least 5 years after the "pirates," I would hear voices that sounded like the living room TV was on, but it wasn't. I felt uneasy dread while listening the voices. Apparently hearing voices is another symptom of sleep paralysis.

  after all you're already disembodied, right?
#+end_quote

Nope, I definitely feel like I'm physically embodied in these dreams, that's what makes it feel so disturbing. It doesn't feel like sleep paralysis at all, it's not like I can feel my body lying in bed but it's paralyzed, I can feel my "dream body" exactly like IRL and everything that it does (or that is done to it).

  I hear video games can help people with nightmares

Definitely. I've had plenty of dreams that /could/ have been nightmares, but I don't count them as such. They're like "action dreams." Situations that ought to be scary and ought to make me run away, I just play along with it and fight. Like, it's been about a year since the last time I had one of these dreams, probably because I sold my xbox like a year and a half ago, but I used to occasionally have CoD Nazi Zombies dreams where I was running around weird Escherian buildings and not even shooting the zombies, just running away from and jumping over them. I had a dream once where I was in a pizza place sitting at the table and the waiter started trying to assault me with a gun, and I ran away into the kitchen and he was chasing me, but then I turned around and started fighting him and grabbed him and started doing that "jumping over and over and getting higher and higher each time" thing and just slamming the guy into the ground every time I touched down. There was one that started off kinda scary that involved being underwater and being repeatedly charged head-on by a shark, but every time I'd just put out my hands and grab it by the nose and bounce backwards off it, and after a short time there was a "scene change" and I was suddenly just sitting on a populated beach and the dream continued like a normal dream. Situations still occasionally happen in dreams, but it's rare, and when it happens I don't really feel fear because I'm never not in control of the situation.

I have a theory that the "occasionally feeling my body get ripped apart by a demon in my sleep" thing is due to the "mind-muscle connection" thing (focusing 100% of your attention on /feeling the muscle/ as you expand/contract it). I started lifting weights just about exactly 4 years ago. The first weird "physical dream" happened a little over a year later, a few months after I started "getting it" and really working out properly instead of flailing around like a noob. I recentlyish went about 15 months (maybe?) without lifting weights due to physical/health issues and moving into an inconvenient living situation, but I started back up again about 5 months ago around the end of December or beginning of January, and the latest one with the skeleton biting me happened within six weeks of starting to lift again, in like February. So idk. It's not like I'm gonna stop lifting, even if I had a /severe/ injury that sidelined me for like 5 years, I'd still start up again when I eventually recovered, I'm gonna lift until I'm in my fukin 80s (assuming I make it that long).
