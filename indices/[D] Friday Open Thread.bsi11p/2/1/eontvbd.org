The only time I ever experienced pain in a dream was a similar situations, demons and all that. In my case it was related to sleep paralysis.

Normally I can maintain a pretty good separation between my real body and my imagined body, that time I found I couldn't move either. After warning me about the dangers of "exploring the dreaming realm" the creature decided to "teach me a lesson". Eventually I managed to get around those restrictions by influencing the environment, having an employee of the building we were in sneak up behind it and hit it.

At that point I was able to move again and quickly woke myself up.

If you find yourself lucid enough you might try just occupying another body, after all you're already disembodies, right? You could also try moving an imaginary body while you're awake, to help you find that line between your real body and what you're imagining in a dream. Ideally you'd be able to feel both.

I hear video games can help people with nightmares, I suspect that's because it's getting you used to controlling a body that isn't tied to your real body, although in your case I worry that kind of thing might affect the physicality of your dreams.
