I almost never have nightmares, but when I do, they're always "physical dreams." Like, if a "vivid dream" is an accurate experience of your visual sense, a "physical dream" is an accurate experience of your vestibular sense (equilibrioception) and your kinesthetic sense (proprioception) and is usually also vivid. As far as I understand it, a "lucid dream" is usually both vivid and physical, so basically what I'm calling a "physical dream" except with the addition of also being aware that you're dreaming. I never break through into awareness during a physical dream, even when it's not a nightmare. And when the physical dream /is/ a nightmare, it's never about fear or any other emotion, it's just /pain/.

The worst one in terms of pain was the first one. I was standing in a room, and then my body went stiffly rigid and I rose about a foot off the floor. My head stayed where it was in space (maybe 7ish feet off the ground) and pointed forwards and upright, y'know, maintaining its normal spatial orientation... but the rest of my body slowly curled up backwards until my feet were in front of my face. Then "I" turned around (by that point I "knew" with dream logic that my body had been possessed by a demon) and then "I" floated out the door then turned and floated towards another door, and then I woke up. I could physically feel my body being contorted the whole time, and it fucking /HURT/, but the whole thing probably lasted less than 90 seconds.

I had another nightmare a few months later. I was standing in front of a door, and it started to open and I "knew" with dream logic that some sort of malevolent entity was on the other side, so I grabbed the doorknob with both hands and squeezed/gripped as hard as I could and pulled backwards as hard as I could, and I was fighting to keep it shut and it kept pulling open just a little bit and I had to keep pulling backwards like playing tug of war with the door, and I could FEEL my forearms just /burning/ with strain. It probably only lasted less than a minute.

I went a while without having another nightmare, and this one was comparatively mild. I was sitting in the backseat of a car that was driving through a graveyard that was very large with lots of hills, and then I felt myself being pulled down through the car into the ground. I "knew" with dream logic that it was the dead people trying to drag me down to hell. It was really short. The thing that makes me classify these things as nightmares isn't the content, it's the physical sensation. There's not even an emotional response, these things never make me feel afraid, it's just physical pain and then waking up soaked in adrenaline.

The last one was several months ago. Maybe January? Anyways, I dreamt that I was lying in bed in my bedroom from the house that I lived in from ages 3 to 19. My eyes were closed, but I knew where I was. I felt a presence. There was a door to the outside next to the window, which dream logic just accepted as normal because brains are stupid globs of jelly-flesh. The door opened. I "knew" with dream logic that whatever had opened the door intended to kill me. I kept my eyes closed and immediately started "believing" that it was my younger brother because "sneaking in through /my/ door" was a thing he would do sometimes so my parents wouldn't catch him (which is absolutely false and has zero basis in reality, but I was intentionally "believing" it because I "knew" that the entity could hear my thoughts and would attack immediately if It knew that I knew It was there; think HPMOR's description of an Occlumency barrier or the thing Mrs. Coulter does near the end of The Amber Spyglass). I laid there with my eyes closed pretending to believe that it was my younger brother, while the entity walked over to the side of my bed. I jerked up and swung to the left to try to start hitting/pushing/fighting the entity. The dream ended probably literally less than 2 seconds later, but in that brief window of time, I vividly saw a full-on skeleton with glowing eyes and sharp teeth, and it started *biting* my hands and my forearms, and I could physically feel the teeth penetrating my flesh. I woke up and I could feel the adrenaline soaking into my muscles, especially in the forearm area. I just so happened to be facing left with my arms outstretched, in almost the exact same position I had been in during the biting. I got up to pee, then looked at the clock and it was like 4:30am. I'd only been asleep for like 4 or 5 hours, but idk if you've ever tried to go sleep immediately after a surge of adrenaline but it just doesn't work so I just stayed up.

I have vivid dreams severals of times a week, sometimes 3 or 4 times in a single night and always at least twice a week, if not 3 or 4 times a week, and once every three to five weeks I'll have a "physical dream" where I can feel my body, and the content of those is almost always, like, I've discovered a new way of jumping. Usually it's something like either jumping straight up 10 feet, then when I land jump immediately and it's like 20 feet straight up, and repeat that until I'm 50+ feet in the air, or alternatively I'll "discover" how to jump while running and each bound get between 10 and 30 feet vertical but go forwards like 50 feet every time I jump and it feels like flying, and those ones are just radical. The jumping is always weird and different (though usually it falls into one of those two broad categories of jumping high or jumping long) and I can feel my hamstrings actually doing the jumping, and I can feel the same type of sense of acceleration as if the little hairs in my inner ear were wibbling around IRL. If the tradeoff for that is that once every 7 to 15 months I have to experience the sensation of a demon ripping my body apart, and a genie told me he could permanently poof away the "physical dream" nightmares but the rest of the dream stuff would go away too, I don't think I'd take him up on it.
