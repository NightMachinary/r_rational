  It seems to be a mix of Terraria and Minecraft, but with the ability to adjust the game toward whichever end of the scale you prefer.

Imagine: You start in a seemingly-infinite 3D world similar to Minecraft. You can travel Up, Down, North, or South with only the normal gameplay happening. If you travel East, however, you start to notice something: the boundaries between North and South are closing in, and you eventually reach a point where you are in a seemingly-infinite /2D/ world.

Again, you can explore Up and Down with only the (new) normal gameplay, but traveling East begins to restrict your options as the floor and ceiling converge. Once they reach each other, you are in a 1D world.

Finally, you can travel East far enough and reach a singular room at the end of the universe. It contains everything in one point, and is a truly 0D experience.

--------------

If you travel West from 3Dland, you don't reach 4Dland, instead you find an infinite expanse of non-euclidean space like [[https://zenorogue.itch.io/hyperrogue][Hyperrogue]]. "East" and "West" are now inadequate descriptors, but you can escape from reality by going West far enough (don't get turned around!) and return to 3Dland by going East (/exactly/ East. Don't miss.).
