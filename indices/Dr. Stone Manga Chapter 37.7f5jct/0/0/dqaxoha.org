Here's a quote from TV Tropes that best explains its connection to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]:

#+begin_quote
  To get from Stone Age to Modern Civilization, it took humanity 2 million years. We are going to rush through it! We will recover the world! We will find out the principles of the petrification and its recovery mechanism... We, two high school kids, are going to recreate civilization from scratch!
#+end_quote

So it's like an uplift story bringing a prehistoric society all the way to modern day civilization and does a really job of conveying how interesting and fun the process of science can be.
