That's certainly my reaction to it.

Seems the whole story did a 180-degree reversal toward the end of the Drow arc. Writer seemed to balk at the slavery thing (even though it wasn't even close) and wanted her to get her 'humanity' back for some reason. The main character is /all about/ self-mutilation to achieve her goals, it's just weird seeing her go on about being 'gloriously mortal' and giving up all that after the journey we went through.
