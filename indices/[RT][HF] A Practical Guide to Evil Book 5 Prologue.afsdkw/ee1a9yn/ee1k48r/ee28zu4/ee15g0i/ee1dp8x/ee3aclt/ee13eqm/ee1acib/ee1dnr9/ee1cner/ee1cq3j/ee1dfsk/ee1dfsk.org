A young, cynical orphan girl is approached by the most dangerous and Evil man in the entire Dread Empire. She becomes his apprentice to help the Kingdom he helped to subjugate.

Also everything is governed, in-universe, by narrative logic, and the orphan girl's main advantage is that she's exceptionally genre savvy.

But whatever impression you got from my shitty summary, it's better than that.

Also if you're a fan of heroic banter, you've never heard villainous banter.
