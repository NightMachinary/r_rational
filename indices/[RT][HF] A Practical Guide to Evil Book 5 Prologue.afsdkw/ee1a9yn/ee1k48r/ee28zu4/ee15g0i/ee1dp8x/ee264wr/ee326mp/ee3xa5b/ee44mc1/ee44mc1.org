I think, the quote of Masego is relevant here - "To think like a god is therefore to be a god". Cat has been slipping away from herself, without realasing it, and I think even us as readers didn't really notice it because the change is so gradual.

Then however, once she loses winter, the contrast is sharp and she realises how far gone she truly was. I think Warlock was right in a sense when he said Catherine died at second liese.
