i don't disagree.

However it's probably about expectation, if you expect someone to murder you sadistically and eat your children, then you dont call them brutal, you'll call them goblins, basically their name means they are expected to be.

The black knight i don't think is known for being brutal but for being efficent, at least the current iteration, and the squire not probably either since they can go either way, both white and black.

so if you don't expect someone to do something brutal it sticks to memory more then goblins being goblins.
