Lines like this puzzle me. Characters keep depicting Catherine as brutal... and yet she lives on the same continent as Warlock, who blew up an entire city and everyone in it, goblins, who skin their enemies alive to send a message, dread emperors, who have a room full of screaming tortured heads, Masego, who kills anyone who tries to talk to him, Hasenbach, whose brilliant plans include "trap Black in a non-evacuated city so the terrified civilians keep his troops in place while they burn alive".

Catherine is incredibly tame in comparison.
