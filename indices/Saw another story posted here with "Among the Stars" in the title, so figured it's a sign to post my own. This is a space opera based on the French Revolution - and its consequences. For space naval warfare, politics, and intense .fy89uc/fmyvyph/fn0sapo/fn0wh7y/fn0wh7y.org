Nope. It's going to be free from front to back. I'll eventually go through and do some major edits and revisions, and release that as a series on Amazon, but until then, I swear I'll never put up a pay wall. I'll do an 'early release' system on Patreon once I've got an audience, but even then, the last chapters will still be released in the same timeframe as the free chapter.
