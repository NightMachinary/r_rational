Several things. One is the characters' rationales for their political systems, sometimes however immoral. It's also about people's behavior, and how top-down authoritarian systems in the story try to second guess it to advance their agendas. Finally, the ultimate end of the series will be about the existential end goal of a civilization in a universe doomed to heat death, and so it's going to explore that topic and focus on what's 'rational' to do in those situations. There's also going to be large-scale strategy in warfare past the halfway point of the story, so there's a lot of rationality in that.
