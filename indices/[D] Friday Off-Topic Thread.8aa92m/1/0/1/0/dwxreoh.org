  What's your training like?

I'm currently in speed training, which involves sprints on Monday and Thursday, and fast 5 & 10 km on Tuesday and Sunday. Cross training is every weekday, and that's the usual gym workouts (the specifics of mine matter less than going out and developing the habit). It's a slog.

  You should let me know what you think of this one in particular though.

Nice song. Probably wouldn't add it to a workout playlist, but everyone has different tastes.
