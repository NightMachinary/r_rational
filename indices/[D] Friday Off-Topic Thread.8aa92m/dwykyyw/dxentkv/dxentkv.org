May just be a personal thing for me but I've found that the Martian holds its value well. I've read the book at least five or six times and immensely enjoy each re-read.

I also have really enjoyed several re-reads of Ready Player One though that's definitely for more personal, video game/pop culutre nerdy reasons.
