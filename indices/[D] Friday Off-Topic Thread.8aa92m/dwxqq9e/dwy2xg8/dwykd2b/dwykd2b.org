Yeah... he messed up his math.

Apply a coordinate transform that rotates the system 45 degrees... and this is just one dimensional time with stable time loops. It's interesting that he noted the diagonal of constant time, but failed to notice that the other diagonal was normal time.

Which isn't to say you can't posit multiple +timelines+ universes existing in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)][group]] configuration... actually, that probably fully describes the complexities of the hypertime framework: each instance of "time travel" yields a group, and additional instances can be described as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_product_of_groups][direct product]].
