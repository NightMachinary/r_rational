I've got two ideas, neither of them physics heavy (so maybe not what you're looking for).

The first is that it's all branching timelines, it's just that /some/ branching timelines fall into stable configurations, where a branch will create a "clone" of itself. In this model, the real power the "stable time loops" person has is creating (or finding) branches that are sufficiently self-creating, such that they /look/ like they're loops, but are in fact branches creating branches. (This is my preferred reconciliation for the Terminator timeline.)

The second idea is [[https://qntm.org/hypertime][hypertime]], which could work well because of how easy it is for an observer to not be able to make sense of what's happening with time travel. Not that much different; you'd have a huge "stack" of self-creating timelines, then the interloper "branching" out divergences in them. Hypertime models take a ton of work though; I plotted one for a fanfic I was writing, and while I got one that seemed to work, I wasn't sure that I could do the "this is actually hypertime" reveal correctly.
