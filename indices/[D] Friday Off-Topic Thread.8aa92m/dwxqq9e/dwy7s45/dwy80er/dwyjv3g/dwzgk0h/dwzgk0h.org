  You've been reading too much EY. These are not terms that come from physics.

What does it even mean for a term not to have come from physics? The discipline of physics isn't an entity, it's a set of ideas generated by physicists. Are Hugh Everett and Bryce DeWitt not physicists? DeWitt coined the phrase "many worlds" to describe Everett's theory, so how does the "many worlds" idea /not/ come from physics?

And EY didn't come up with Timeless Physics, [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrW7yf42vQYDf8AcH/timeless-physics][if you'll look at his article about it from 10 years ago you can see that he credits the idea to Julian Barbour in a disclaimer before the article even begins]]. Julian Barbour is a physicist, same argument as above applies here too.
