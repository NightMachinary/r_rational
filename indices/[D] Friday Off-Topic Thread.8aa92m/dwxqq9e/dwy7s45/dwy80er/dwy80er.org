The 'two' I was referring to isn't the two models of time travel, but rather the 'Many Worlds Interpretation' and 'Timeless Physics'. They are two very real ideas in physics which to me seemingly map onto mutable and immutable types of time travel.

However, your point about physics and time travel is valid. I shouldn't need to know more in-depth physics to write the story.
