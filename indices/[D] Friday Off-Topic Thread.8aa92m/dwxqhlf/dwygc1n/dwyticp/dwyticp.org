I think most of it is serious. For one thing, long videos aren't the kind of effort you would see from people who don't take these things seriously, and most of the posts are videos upwards of 10 minutes each. Also, the answers just aren't very creative, and I would expect that more from people with disfunctional reasoning over people intentionally using bad reasoning. Why would you come up with boring answers? Take the question of gravity, for instance. The somewhat novel answer for why things fall down on a flat Earth is that the entire world is accelerating upwards at 1g. You could experimentally show that to be false, because actual gravity gets weaker the higher up you are, but it would be rather expensive to disprove. The answer they ACTUALLY give? Things don't fall, they sink because they are more dense than the air. And they sink downwards instead of sideways because that's the direction things fall. Not even barely defensible the way that you would expect from intelligent people espousing intentionally false beliefs would be.

There are lots more examples of arguments that are much more likely to come from a diseased mind than a mind in it for the laughs. Arguments that simply wouldn't occur to a normal person. The above is just the tip of the iceberg.
