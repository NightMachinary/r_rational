So I browsed through [[/r/theworldisflat][r/theworldisflat]] for curiosity's sake. See if there were any ok points raised about there being a flat Earth, or much more likely just to laugh at people being dumb. And it surprised me, their arguments were much better than I expected, which is to say that they were abysmal and failed at even basic experimental design or consistency, but they did actually perform a few experiments. Also, their videos are too fucking long for the amount of entertainment they bring.

One video in particular was about how you could have sunlight on the bottom of clouds in a flat Earth model. The video surprised me because it demonstrated that the mechanics of it aren't impossible. The person set up a flat piece of plastic parallel to the table, a light source taller than said plastic, and the camera pointed at the bottom of the plastic. Moving the light source back made it eventually light up the bottom of the plastic. What the person failed to account for is that he performed the experiment on a white plastic table, and that the actual ground wouldn't reflect the light. Just so dumb and funny that these people take themselves seriously.

Also, one of their top posts is about how a flat and divinely made earth would be better than the actual model. Not why it was an accurate model, just why it would be a better place to live in. Yes, so convincing. That's also why I have a banking app that always displays my account balance as $100000000 instead of what it currently is, because I prefer to believe the higher number.

I know this is the intellectual equivalent of beating up the handicapped kid, but the people who believe this stuff are nominally adults. And also brave enough to show their faces against what they believe is a global conspiracy with easily verifiable counterevidence despite which there is no large group of opponents.
