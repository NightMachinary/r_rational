  And in both cases, trillions are murdered over and over every time someone time travels.

Heh, that would be an /amazing/ [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie][Break the Cutie]] for the protagonist when she realizes that she's unknowingly guilty the same crime as the antagonist.

I also like the nature of your simulation idea, because the time travel devices aren't meant to be unexaminable black boxes like we see in many different stories, but rather devices with underlying principles that can be used for alternative technology. A big part of the derivative technology is incorporating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle#Time-loop_logic][time loop logic]] into computer algorithms which is a big part of the story.
