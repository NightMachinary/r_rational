Yes, people, including physicists, talk about the "Many Worlds Hypothesis", but not in a serious manner. It's something reserved strictly for pop-science. It is an essentially unfalsifiable philosophy^{†,} something I believe the rationalist community generally rejects on sight?

/Nobody/ talks about "Timeless Physics". EY's post about it was absurd to the point of being ridiculous (that particular article is a good example of why I generally don't bother reading his crap). He even points to the damn Schrödinger Equation! You know, the one that explicitly involves time as a variable distinct from position? Quantum mechanics has already been formulated in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation][manner consistent with (special) relativity.]]

  The discipline of physics isn't an entity, it's a set of ideas generated by physicists.

As though anything any physicist thinks of is a de facto part of the discipline. Many scientists delve into philosophy and metascience -- that doesn't make those things science. While mathematical formalisms of physics (especially QM) are accessible only to physicists, the interpretation of those formalisms is philosophy -- by necessity an exercise carried out by those same physicists.

  And EY didn't come up with Timeless Physics

This is what bothers me. EY has popularized ideas (at least among this crowd) that he is ill-equipped to discuss in the first place.

^{†} Maybe an individual can verify it for themselves. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality][Maybe.]] And maybe it can be falsified. Perhaps. However, I am skeptical that any experimental outcome would be conclusive.
