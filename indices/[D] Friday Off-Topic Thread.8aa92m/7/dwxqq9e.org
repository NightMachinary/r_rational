I probably should save this question for the Wednesday World building thread, but I'm too impatient to wait.

I'm working on this time travel story where the protagonist has the power to induce Stable Time Loops which means she believes that time is immutable in the sense of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rrW7yf42vQYDf8AcH/timeless-physics][Timeless Physics]]. The antagonist is someone with a different time travel power, but unlike hers he can change the past and thus sees time as mutable in a Branching History Model.

The [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/moral-conflicts][Good vs Good Conflict]] practically writes itself where the protagonist is horrified at the antagonist seemingly murdering trillions every time he changes the past and the antagonist thinks the protagonist could destroy the world if she abuses the Stable Time Loops to create an [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ARaTpNX62uaL86j6/the-hidden-complexity-of-wishes][Outcome Pump]].

The part I'm ashamed to need help with...is the ending. I wanted to come up with a model of time travel that could permit both mutable and immutable types of travel and I've been having trouble coming up with explanations for how both can occur. Clearly a conflict can't be written if I can't explain how it's possible to have both versions of time travel in the same world.

The best ideas I have are related to how we can have both the [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9cgBF6BQ2TRB3Hy4E/and-the-winner-is-many-worlds][Many Worlds Interpretation]] and Timeless Physics at the same time, but I don't have a good enough physics background to reconcile the two. I know enough to explain on a pop-science level, but not with what I consider sufficient mathematical rigor.
