I'd have to dig out my scanner, because they're mostly paper notes; a lot of it is in the form of diagrams plotted with time on both axes. What I found helps most is thinking of universes in "stacks" and then migrating a diagonal line of the "jump" down and to the left, assuming that the lower left corner is "Past - Past" and the upper right corner is "Future - Future".

Here's [[https://i.imgur.com/sPBxewe.png][a cheaply done MS Paint version of one]], a rather simple case of Jumper 1, going back in time 200 years, and Jumper 2, going back in time 600 years from 300 years in Jumper 1's future. This also assumes a "top" timeline where no time travel took place, and further assumes (or doesn't show) any jumpers from within the three divergent histories, which further complicates things.

In short, it's possible for someone to go back in time and end up in a timeline whose /past/ does not resemble the one that they remember or have records of, which is one of the neat possibilities of hypertime. You go from 2018 back to 1963 to stop the Kennedy assassination, only to find that in the 1963 you ended up in, the Nazis won WWII, even though that's got nothing to do with you.
