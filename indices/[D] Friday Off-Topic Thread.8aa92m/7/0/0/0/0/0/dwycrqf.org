Nope, it was for a somewhat forgettable cancelled-after-one-season show called Timeless (it got uncancelled and is currently airing its second season, but I'd be shocked if it was able to pull the numbers needed for a third).

I also drew up a model for applying hypertime to Back to the Future, namely the "Other Marty" scenario, but never really found the ending I was looking for, which ideally would have had OT Marty show up. The diagrams were /really/ complicated, because you need to account for the subjective experience of at least four characters who are all hopping to and from different timelines with causal relationships being muddied by hypertime. (e.g. Doc goes from 2015 back to 1985 to tell Marty that it's his kids, and shows up in a 1985 created by a totally different Marty going to 1955 -- a 1985 where he was shot to death by the Libyans.)
