In Timeless they're not cops, they're: a pilot/scientist who works at the private company that invented the time machine, a historian brought in from the local college where she teaches, and a former member of the military who I /think/ is associated with the DHS. They don't really operate under a legal framework, which is one of the things that I found interesting and wanted in a fanfic -- not bureaucracy weighing everything down, but a group of people with only very tenuous connection to the law running roughshod through jurisdictions and practically immune from consequences.
