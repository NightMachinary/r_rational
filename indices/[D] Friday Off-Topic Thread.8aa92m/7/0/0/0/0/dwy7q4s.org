Thanks! That helped me realize a lot of different things about how hypertime would work and the picture was excellently suited to its purpose.

Looking back at sam's article on hypertime, this is amazingly well-suited to the show /Doctor Who/ and I think it could be used to explain a lot of the time travel shenanigans that occurred in it. I could be wrong, since it's been years I last saw it.

Was your fanfic a Doctor Who one?
