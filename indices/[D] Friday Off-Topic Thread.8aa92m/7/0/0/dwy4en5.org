I-I...I...my think-meats hurt...

I understand how hypertime is just time-travel set in a universe where time has two dimensions. But I cannot wrap my head around what is happening to the time line(s) after one jump. I really want a diagram to explain it.

It's a really good idea though, because while I can't explain /how/, I do see that there is the possibility for multiple types of time travel and it would permit mutable and immutable versions.

I'm curious about the fanfic you mentioned plotting. Any chance I could have a look at the notes? It's fine if you don't want to.

Thanks for your suggestions!
