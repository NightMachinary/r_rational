According to my rigorous statistical analysis based on the first 200 of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s top entries and caused by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8advus/rthfdcthe_last_sovereign_deconstructing_nsfw_game/dwyg86w/?context=3][this joke]], this subreddit consists of:

- 25% /Mother of Learning/
- 20.5% miscellaneous short stories
- 16.5% /Worth the Candle/
- 7.5% /Pokemon: The Origin of Species/
- 5% /A Practical Guide To Evil/
- 4.5% picking at non-rational fiction
- 3.5% transhumanist propaganda
- 3% /Unsong/
- 2.5% /SCP Foundation/
- 2.5% other longer stories
- 2% deep discussions regarding all forms of fiction
- 2% /Worm/
- 1.5% /Harry Potter/ fanfiction
- 1.5% porn
- 1% recommendation threads
- 0.5% r!Animorphs
- 0.5% picking at [[/r/rational][r/rational]]
- â‰ˆ0.5% other

(All of the short stories were probably written by one single author, of course, so it could likely be simplified to "38.5% Alexander Wales".)
