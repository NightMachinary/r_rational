  So noise cancellation earmuffs won't do the job?

No clue. They'll probably help, of course, but won't be a cure all. Though to clarify-- have you been using ear/buds/ or ear/plugs/? If it's earbuds (sound generating) I'd suggest trying earplugs and an external white noise generator (even laptop speakers could work, for example). It may or may not work, but earplugs are dirt cheap and it's useful to have some around anyways.
