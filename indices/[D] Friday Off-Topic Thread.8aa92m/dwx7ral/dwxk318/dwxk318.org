I'm going to second a white noise machine. Before my roommate lost weight and stopped snoring, I piped white noise through my PA speaker every night and wore earplugs, which in tandem significantly increased my ability to fall and stay asleep.

For the rest of the time, I'm just constantly listening to music anyways, which allows me to drown out most background noise even at lowish volumes because I'll focus either on the music or what I'm doing and ignore everything else.
