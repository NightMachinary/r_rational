It's not like he is completely unapproachable. He has made some concessions like not watching sports with a bunch of guys in our tiny room anymore.

But it's like he'll be all reasonable to your face, but he'll go around getting his way anyway. Like repeatedly bringing his girlfriend over despite my protests, being really loud over his phone, his music. He usually talks to his folks at night - and it can't be an another time because they are a different timezone away.

I made felt like a bad person when I brought this up and asked him if we could do something about this. It looked like he was trying to for a while but he then resumed his antics. That was the second time I tried to move out of this dorm, but it wasn't possible. This has been ongoing for a few years.. I can't afford to have bad relationship with him either cause I'm stuck in the same classes and social circle as him. Sigh.. Now I'm rambling.

Great idea about the fan. I do listen to a lot of white noise on my headphones, but I'm starting to get worried about my hearing from so much headphone use. So I figured I'd give something made for just noise cancellation (3M X4A) a try instead of an over-the-ear headphone.
