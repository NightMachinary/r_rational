Guess I should crawl back out of lurking..

I just resorted to ordering noise cancelling earmuffs, pretty much giving up on my roommate. I tried being assertive and directly confronting the situation.. But some people in life just seem to be charismatic enough to get away with everything. Anyone else really sensitive to sound and people - how do you guys generally cope?
