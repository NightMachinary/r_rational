Human tissues have a maximum serviceable life of about 120 years. Once you're a centenarian, it stops mattering exactly what killed you, since you'll be collecting serious co-morbid issues like baseball cards by that age. Getting over that hump will require solving thousands of engineering challenges, most of which I suspect will see zero progress on before 2030.
