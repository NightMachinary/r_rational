Well, Ray Kurzweil thinks that we're going to be injecting nanobots into our bloodstreams to augment/replace our immune systems by the year 2030, and he's had an 86% accuracy rate for about 150 predictions over the past three decades, so I'd assume that's a thing that's /definitely/ going to happen at some point even if he's overly optimistic about the time frame. Even if it takes until 2040, that's only 22 years. Beyond that, who knows what an artificial immune system made of nanobots could do? It'd certainly end death due to infectious disease and cancer and heart disease. Maybe another 20 years out from there, people stop aging completely and we've achieved functional immortality and no longer die from biological causes. Who the hell knows? For all we know, the average lifespan by the year 2070 could be 250 years and the "maximum" lifespan could be pretty much arbitrary and determined mostly by a person's propensity for risky/reckless behavior.

EDIT:

My dad's dad had two heart attacks (one of which required, like, quadruple bypass surgery) and a stroke, and died of colon cancer about 10 years later in his late 70s. My mom's mom has had a heart attack, and my mom's mom's sister died of colon cancer in her early 60s. Haven't spoken to my dad in about 7 years, but I assume he's still on blood pressure medication, and he had an angina attack at some point in the early 2000s. I've got the genes. I figure I need to make it to at least the year 2055, and I'll be 66 then. But it might not be until 2070, and I'll be 81, and that's a harder target to hit. So, I started lifting weights about 3 years ago. I figure anyone who's serious about all this futurism crap should probably be exercising on a regular basis and watching their intake of sodium, because heart disease is the number one cause of death right now in the developed world.
