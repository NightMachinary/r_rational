Currently the people who live the longest have all their ducks lined up in a row, and everything is about to fall apart when they die. There are just too many small things that need fixing to patch things just a little. To live longer than the oldest people currently do, we would have to crack the fundamental causes of ageing, at which point we live a lot more than an additional 15 years.
