The U.S. life expectancy has been going down for the last few years because there's no nationally coordinated response to the opioid epidemic. So many deaths are completely preventable. Universal healthcare, nationally standardized prescription drug monitoring to ensure no one is getting opioids from multiple doctors across state borders, more social worker funding, more methadone clinics, reduction of agriculture subsidies for corn, taxes on junk food, and tax incentives for exercising would all help a lot but very little gets done.
