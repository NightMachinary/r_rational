  AIDS treatment
#+end_quote

AIDS is already there, more or less: you ask doctors if they'd rather be HIV+ or have diabetes, and they say that HIV would be preferable. I mean, yeah, it's better to cure it, but HIV has gone from a death sentence 30 years a go to a stable (if fabulously expensive) chronic disease today. It's amazing to think what the future might hold if unfriendly AI doesn't manage to kill us all.
