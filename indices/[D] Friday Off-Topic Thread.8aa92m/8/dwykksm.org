So, I'm quite late to this thread (> 17 hours, by the looks of it).

Hope you all enjoy your weekend.

I've been learning so much new crap for work lately, it's been pretty ridiculous. I haven't really touched the Javascript programming scene in ages, but new frameworks and platforms are being released faster than I can shake a stick at.

I'm going to discuss how... schizophrenic I feel from all this.

I was hired as an intern in Sep, having never touched PHP or Javascript. Since then, I've learned about the web framework Laravel, (Web frameworks are p. awesome, if you ask me...) and become intimately familiar with it.

I've learned Javascript, jQuery, and datatables. A month ago, our team began to make a strong-ish push to move from the Frankenstein that is our current Javascript 'base to the Javascript frontend framework Vue.

That stuff is /pretty/ slick. It's strange to wrap your head around, has some interesting gotcha's (don't all js frameworks?), but overall Vues is pretty sweet. So nice to have a data-driven workflow.

Our stuff is still Frankensteinish, but it's becoming more and more structured every month. :P

To add, I've been reverse-engineering Halo 1. I've also got a number of projects in that vein as well.
