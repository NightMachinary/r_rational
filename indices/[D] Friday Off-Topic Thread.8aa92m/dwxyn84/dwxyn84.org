If anyone was curious about happened to my boss and the Saga of the Sick Note, I basically showed up at work after the long weekend, filled out my timesheet, submitted my timesheet, and he didn't ask for a sick note and I didn't mention it. So, all in all, I made a whole series of posts about something that became completely irrelevant - though is that a surprise to anyone?
