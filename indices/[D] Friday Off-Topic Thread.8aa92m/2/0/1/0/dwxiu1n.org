Cardio is great for your heart, but there are studies suggesting that weight lifting improves brain functioning, that it can actually stave off age-related cognitive impairment and slow the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's. We don't really know what causes normal Alzheimer's and don't know if it's hereditary, but we've found genetic markers that correlate with "early-onset" Alzheimer's and it looks hereditary, and my dad's mom died of early-onset Alzheimer's in her early 50s. I figure I, specifically, should be taking that into consideration, but I feel like most people who plan on living a long time should really consider lifting weights to preserve their brain into old age. I personally lift weights 4 days a week (upper body / lower body split, chest/back/shoulders/arms and quads/hamstrings/glutes/calves) and then do cardio twice a week (stationary bike, better for your knees in the long run than running).
