From what I've read, benefits are seen from doing at least a full body workout at least twice a week. If you do three sets of pushups, three sets of squats, and three sets of pullups, you've basically hit every major muscle group in your body.

Also, if you're doing those exercises to work your muscles and not to get your heart pumping, you should do each rep relatively slowly so that gravity and momentum aren't doing the work for you. Some people do like 50 half-pushups at mach speed and once a trainer forces them to do them correctly, get surprised that they can't do anywhere close to as many. Gotta slow it down and /feel/ it.
