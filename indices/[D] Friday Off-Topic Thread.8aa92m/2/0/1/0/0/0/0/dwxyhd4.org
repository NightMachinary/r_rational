Yep, I do a mix of the two speeds. The first set of sit-ups, push-ups, and burpees is usually done fairly quick just to get my heart going, the second set is done a lot slower, and the third set is at a medium speed. I'm usually a little impatient with the last set and I just want to get it done and out of the door to go running.

Probably not what I should do, but it's what I'm most comfortable doing in getting warmed up for running.

I keep wanting to have a separate set of exercises that's not just running, but I have trouble motivating myself into doing any exercise that's not running. So I compensate by having a somewhat lengthy warm-up routine to sort of trick myself into doing some additional exercise that isn't running.

Thanks for the tips!

Edit: I should also share that one of the main reasons why I got into running other than being so gosh darn quick as a kid was because heart disease and diabetes is really common in my family. Nearly everyone on my mom's side of the family has had a heart attack at least once in their 50s (no deaths from it at all at that age though). Only my mom's the exception so far, but she has another 6 months left to make it to her 60s!
