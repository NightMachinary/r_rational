Looked at it, seems he was a bit overly optimistic about 2019. Some of that stuff will be here by 2030, though, and most of the rest of it by 2050.

As for the pessimism, yeah, I think he's off by 10 years with the nanobot immune system thing, but even if he's off by 20 or 30 years, I still think it's going to happen.
