Just read the list of predictions on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil#Accuracy_of_predictions][Wikipedia]]. The ones for 2019 are extremely hit and miss: most people do own >1 PC, we do have wearable biometric devices, prosthetic technology has advanced by leaps & bounds, but most of the rest are wrong. No points for predicting that the global economy won't collapse.

In this case, I'm just going to say that while there are indeed medications that use nanoparticles, there is a 0% chance that medical nanomachines see any real use by 2029. Maybe 1-2% that they're being examined in Phase 1 trials by American or European regulators, 5% in China. It's not going to happen.
