I typically go several months between adding songs to my workout playlist, because a song has to meet high standards of awesomeness in order to qualify for being added to that sacred playlist.

I don't want to have to fast-forward past a long build-up at the beginning (lookin' at /you/, dubstep), I don't want a plodding lull in the middle, I don't want to ever have to skip a track, I want to be able to just hit "shuffle" and then have a consistent stream of bass thumping in my ear-holes without having to touch the iPod again until I leave the gym (a not insignificant number of people don't wipe down the machines after they touch all over everything with their sweaty hands (/yes I know machines are inferior to free-weights because you're not working your small stabilizing muscles when you're locked into a fixed movement pattern/ but real gyms are expensive and Planet Fitness is only ten bucks a month), so I consider my own hands to be thoroughly contaminated until I've washed them in the bathroom after I finish the workout, and I don't want to touch my iPod with contaminated hands).

Anywho.

I recently found The Best Song. It's an electro-house / dubstep fusion (electro-step?) with a chiptune aesthetic.

Artist: MegaNeko. Song Title: Robot Language.

It's almost perfect. My favorite part is definitely the little transition that happens at 1:23.

Go forth and get swole, broheims.

EDIT:

Additional songs that "go hard in the paint."
