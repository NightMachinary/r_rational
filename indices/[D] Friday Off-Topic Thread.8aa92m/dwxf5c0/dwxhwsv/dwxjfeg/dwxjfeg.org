I used to listen to lots of rap when I started working out, but I've gravitated more towards techno/electronic crap over the years, stuff mostly devoid of real lyrics. I don't like a lot of dubstep or trap or electro-house or DnB, but fusion songs that combine any two of those genres are great because the two genres will cancel out each other's weaknesses.
