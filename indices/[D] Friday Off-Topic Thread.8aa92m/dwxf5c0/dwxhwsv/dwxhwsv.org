I haven't run a marathon yet, but it's on the to-do list. At my current pace, I think I can crack 3:00:00.

The length of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8DuXELzXhw][Run the Jewels]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXIPsfiJ0o][Run the Jewels 2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saR7SYa6nAs&list=PL9hYR5qRkc2whsqANLMnk_418SF60df6b][Run the Jewels 3]], and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAFbNIyxIls][Cowboys from Hell]] all together is just about 3 hours, which makes a convenient training timer.

Other workout music I've added recently: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZU6F0srCl0&list=PLhFC8pd7oZvwJYhjmpZVyaKG7CUNoVvae][Crypt of the Necrodancer OST]] (which has several remixes in different styles), [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV5KAbV34NU][Walk off the Earth]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2_PAW_8fos][Eminem]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccY25Cb3im0][Nine Inch Nails]], and select music (usually boss themes) from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPZz6oJi8yE][Splatoon]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcoqR9Bwx1Y][Undertale]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-aexLJKwME][Bastion]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLBTIUzPpEQ][Bravely Default]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOz-T3NPtLA][Touhou]], and a few others. Just off the top of my head.
