I think I like the aesthetic of the first one and the last one (just from skipping around and listening to a dozen little samples of about three seconds each), but that's not exactly something I'd listen to while working out. Did you listen to "Click Clack"? It's closer to being 3 minutes of big angry violent noises than it is to being music, but I want heavy music when I'm lifting heavy weights.
