If this tech is central to your plot, and I mean central like magic in Harry Potter, then you may not want to share it if you're trying to get published. At least not until you are close to completion. I do think posting it here before you make a final draft is a great idea. You'll likely get some good ideas on uses and have any flaws pointed out.
