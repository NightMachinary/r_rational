- You'll remove some of the thrill and wonder from your readers, assuming that they read the discussion first.
- You'll (possibly) remove some of your own enjoyment from writing about it
- You'll dilute discussion about the cool thing by having it be split into two places

There are some secondary concerns, but those are the big ones in my opinion. In return, you get some feedback about the magic or technology, which can be helpful in pointing out flaws, or helping you think up new things to do with it.
