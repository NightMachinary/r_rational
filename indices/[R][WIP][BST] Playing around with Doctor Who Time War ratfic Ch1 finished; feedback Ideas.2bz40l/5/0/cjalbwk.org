  Wait, the Time War is being started by someone from outside the cluster? Isn't it against the Daleks? Galactic cluster? Time cluster? What cluster?
#+end_quote

I decided the Daleks needed an upgrade, to be feasible challengers of the Time Lords. An explanation of time travel, homeworlds, and the hypertime clusters will come in a latter chapter, after the companion is introduced.

  What is up with the surgical bot, and why should we care? Should we care that it's a Neurosurgeon? Should we care why it's unresponsive? This part is not very smooth and is an unsatisfying place to break off.

Agreed. I really didn't know where to go from there; I think I might hack the conversation between the Doctor and the Great Mother to include more exposition.

As for the Neurosurgeon bot, I suppose I didn't make that clear enough. It may or may not become important later on down the road. And if it doesn't, I'll chop it. Either way, that reveal (that the surgery bot sitting by the Doctor's hospital bed was a neurosurgeon) needs serious editing, for clarity and nonstupidity (there's no good reason for it to not respond to the first request).

Thanks for your response, VA!
