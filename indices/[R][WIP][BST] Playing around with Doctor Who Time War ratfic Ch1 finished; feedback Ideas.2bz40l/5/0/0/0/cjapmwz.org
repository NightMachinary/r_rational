  Particularly for the Daleks/opponents, if you can't make it clear pretty early in the story, it might be better to have a brief introduction in medias res where you have enough throwaway lines to make broad strokes clear before jumping back to the beginning. I think if there's one thing that invested fans and people with no knowledge of the show would both find confusing, it's that the Doctor is fighting a war and it's against neither the Daleks nor the Cybermen.

Noted. This is going to be a little difficult, given that, in this story, the Daleks are from outside of the Doctor's / Time Lord's universe, and nobody has any sort of clue as to what they are until much later. (The one difficulty of writing fanfic - everyone already knows what's what. This would be perfectly fine in a regular story, but since most of the readers are already going to know who / what the Time Lords' opponents in the Time War are, it's all kboshed. Why am I putting this in a Doctor Who setting again?)

I think I'll be able to work around that, though, by not having the Doctor directly interact with the Daleks until their identity is established (or pretty close to established, at least). It's going to be very much a Time Lords vs Daleks war, not a Doctor vs Daleks war. If that makes sense.

Bleagh, I'll reread your comment tomorrow and see what I can come up with then.
