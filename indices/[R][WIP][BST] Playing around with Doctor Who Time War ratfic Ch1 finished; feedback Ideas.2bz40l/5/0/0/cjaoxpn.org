I'm glad you appreciated it. For a bit more:

Particularly for the Daleks/opponents, if you can't make it clear pretty early in the story, it might be better to have a brief introduction /in medias res/ where you have enough throwaway lines to make broad strokes clear before jumping back to the beginning. I think if there's one thing that invested fans and people with no knowledge of the show would both find confusing, it's that the Doctor is fighting a war and it's against neither the Daleks nor the Cybermen.

And when I say early in the story, if you're three chapters or 10K words in and you haven't explained that, I think you'd have problems.

If you do go with /in medias res/, it's obviously pretty easy to jump back to this as 'the beginning', since it's when he first finds out the war exists.
