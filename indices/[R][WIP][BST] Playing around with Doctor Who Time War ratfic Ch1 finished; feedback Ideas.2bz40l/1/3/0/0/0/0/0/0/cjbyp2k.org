Teleportation! There's no teleportation in this universe. And yes, I did make a TARDIS that makes this work. Warp is a thing, via Alcubierre drives, but there's no instant teleportation. Time travel comes with extreme moral ramifications, and also involves a bit of getting lost, so that stops most people from exploiting it carelessly. Maybe I'll make a worldbuilding post about the fic later.
