You've not teleported; you've traveled to another timeline. The old one still exists.

In Doctor Who canon, one of the core elements is the importance of GMT -- that is, Gallifrey Mean Time. See [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2bxxmd/meeting_time_lords/cjajqcb?context=4][this thread]] for an explanation. I've incorporated that part of canon into my cosmology; thankfully, the multiple timeline theory [[http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2bxxmd/meeting_time_lords/cjaozoh][relieves some of the paradoxes]].

This is through the concept of homeworlds: Gallifrey is the homeworld of the universe / collection of timelines / "cluster. All the Everett branches and universes that have been time-travelled into existence are sort of condensed at Gallifrey. There are various smaller, localized homeworlds, but Gallifrey dwarfs them all. As such, one can travel between different timelines through homeworlds, so if you time travel away from a conflict, you can be tracked and followed. This also means time travel physically doesn't work in homeworlds; they can only be traveled to through space.

The Enemy, on that note, is the civilization of the homeworld of another cluster, and is trying to incorporate the Gallifrey Cluster into theirs. If they succeeded, Gallifrey would be unwritten from time, replaced by the Enemy homeworld. And that's the essence of the Time War in a nutshell.
