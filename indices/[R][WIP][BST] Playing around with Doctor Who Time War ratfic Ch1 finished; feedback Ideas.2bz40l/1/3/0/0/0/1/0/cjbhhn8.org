Well, the point is kinda moot, as each side has more than enough power to completely annihilate the other, so they would never be stupid enough to go to war in the first place. Doesn't the Doctor at one point use his TARDIS to make a star go supernova in order to talk to Rose while she's in Rose's World? When you have that kind of power, you can just destroy every star system of your opponent. They don't need to invade Gallifrey when they can make its star go supernova
