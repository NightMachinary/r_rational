  For example, you'll very likely have to change the fact that Time Lords are essentially humans with some extra organs and undefined temporal sensitivity. I can't imagine how any Type IV civilization would still view meatbodies as a sensible idea.

The Doctor and most of the Time Lords will be meat bodies, but there's a very good reason (or at least I think so) that I can't reveal without revealing a major plot point.

On that note, any other specific complaints about Doctor Who canon you have that maybe I haven't considered? This is a [BST] thread, after all.
