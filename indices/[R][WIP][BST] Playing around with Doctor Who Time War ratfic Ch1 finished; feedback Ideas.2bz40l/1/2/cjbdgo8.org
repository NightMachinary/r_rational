  If the Doctor Who universe is going to be given a rational treatment, you'll need to wildly diverge from canon with respect to the strategies the Time Lords use.

Out of curiosity, what in your opinion are the strategies Time Lords use in canon? Especially in Doctor Who, the word is kinda meaningless, so I'm wondering if you're including the EDA, Big Finish Audios, and Faction Paradox in that assessment.

As for the rest of the post, I plan to have most of it covered or rendered irrelevant, so that'll be taken care of.
