Which Doctor is this going to be based around, and how much lore from either series (old and new) are you planning on using? Will I understand everything if I haven't seen the early stuff? Will I be able to follow along anyways?

"They tried to impose their homeworld from Dronid." I think something's wrong with this sentence. I don't know what's going on here.

As for stuff I would like to see, in S02E03 (new series) "School Reunion," the plot revolves around the Skasis Paradigm, which is essentially a theory of everything that grants people godhood. I've always headcanoned that the Doctor first learned of this in the Time War, and things went horribly wrong when people tried to abuse it. Just a thought.

All that aside, so far so good. I'd read more of it.
