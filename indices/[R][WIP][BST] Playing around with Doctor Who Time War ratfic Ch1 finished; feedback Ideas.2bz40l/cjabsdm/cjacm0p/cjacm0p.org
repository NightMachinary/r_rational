  Which Doctor is this going to be based around, and how much lore from either series (old and new) are you planning on using? Will I understand everything if I haven't seen the early stuff? Will I be able to follow along anyways?
#+end_quote

A modified kind of Eighth Doctor, just because he's the one in the Time War (era). Since the crash went differently, there's no War Doctor. I plan to pick and choose from the lore, since there's just so much. But no, I don't plan on leaving anything unexplained. (Even if it means introducing a companion.) Someone with no knowledge of the show should be able to follow along.

  "They tried to impose their homeworld from Dronid." I think something's wrong with this sentence. I don't know what's going on here.
#+end_quote

An explanation of the mechanics of time travel, and therefore homeworlds etc, will come in a later chapter. Right now, it's fine if it's technobabble.

  the Skasis Paradigm
#+end_quote

Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about that! Around March abouts, Dropbox synched wrong with my writing app and I lost all my work on worldbuilding, which was a huge setback... But yes, I remember the Skasis Paradigm was something I'd written on. And ... Block Transfer Computation? Thanks for reminding me!
