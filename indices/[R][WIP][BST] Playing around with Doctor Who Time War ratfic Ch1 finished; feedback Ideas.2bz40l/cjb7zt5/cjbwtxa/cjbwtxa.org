This. Much as I love DW, I don't think there's anyway to make an honest rational fic out of it without totally changing /everything/ to the point that it bears no resemblance to the original at all.

For example, you'll very likely have to change the fact that Time Lords are essentially humans with some extra organs and undefined temporal sensitivity. I can't imagine how any Type IV civilization would still view meatbodies as a sensible idea.

So the Doctor goes from being a smart quirky alien dude to a quirky postbiological superintelligence. This kinda makes any plots with human companions boring, because it would be like taking your pet ant along to save the world. :(

Then again, the Doctor lies, so...
