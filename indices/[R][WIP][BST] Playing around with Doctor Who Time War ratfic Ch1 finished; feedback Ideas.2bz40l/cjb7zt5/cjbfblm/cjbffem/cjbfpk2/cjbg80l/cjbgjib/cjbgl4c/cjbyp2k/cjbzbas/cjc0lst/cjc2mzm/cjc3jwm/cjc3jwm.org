Well, yeah. Because it /is/ teleportation. You didn't look at the link.

- You can go back in time whenever you like.

- Every time you go back in time, you create an entirely new timeline.

- *If you go forwards in time, you stay in your current timeline.*

I'm sorry; when I think of "time travel", I automatically think of backwards time travel, since that's the only challenging part. I'm using different definitions. My mistake.
