If the Doctor Who universe is going to be given a rational treatment, you'll need to wildly diverge from canon with respect to the strategies the Time Lords use. The Time Lords are a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Type_IV][Type IV Kardashev]] Civilisation, given their access to incredible technology such as TARDIS'. If they are going to put themselves in personal danger, like the Doctor does, then they are going to be easily capable of creating personal equipment, like an invulnerable personal shield, and far better weapons than a sonic screwdriver. The Doctor's TARDIS alone seems easily capable of creating things like that, despite not specialising in creating things, and yet he goes out with little protection, leading to him being captured on a regular basis in canon, and in your first chapter where he is grievously injured.

The scene in that teaser video the BBC released before the 50th anniversary, about a foot soldier fighting in the Time War, would never happen because with access to the powers to the Time Lords have, you don't fight wars with foot soldiers. Even with a soldier based strategy, you would use invulnerable robots, not mortal soldiers. Civilian targets wouldn't need to be defended when you can just evacuate them all with a TARDIS to literally anywhere else in time and space.

Fighting a war changes completely with access to just teleportation, let alone time travel. Incidentally, you will need to make some forms of rules about sending information to past selves, because otherwise fighting a war becomes completely futile, as everyone hears the enemies plans before they are implemented
