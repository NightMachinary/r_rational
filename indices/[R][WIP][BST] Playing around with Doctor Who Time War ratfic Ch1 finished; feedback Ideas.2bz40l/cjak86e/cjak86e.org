It's interesting so far. There's a few huge unanswered background questions which are introduced pretty smoothly, which is well done.

Things that are less clear: Wait, the Time War is being started by someone from outside the cluster? Isn't it against the Daleks? Galactic cluster? Time cluster? What cluster? What is up with the surgical bot, and why should we care? Should we care that it's a Neurosurgeon? Should we care why it's unresponsive? This part is not very smooth and is an unsatisfying place to break off.
