TL;DR: In order for the story to not be arbitrary, you have to very carefully define to yourself the mechanics of how time travel works. It is surprisingly difficult to do so. I'm 60% sure the model I described there makes the universe conspire to prevent all time travel, but it's better than any of the others I've seen. I started programming a simulation of an extremely simple universe containing time travel under this model to test it but I gave up when real life kept me too busy.
