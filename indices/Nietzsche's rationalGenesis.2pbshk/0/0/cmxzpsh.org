He's interpreting the Bible in ways that are unfair and probably distort the text. However, I don't think his argument is unreasonable. (In this passage, when he uses phrases condemning science, I think he's speaking from the standpoint of the priests/God.)

He's pretentious and elitist. And he had severe headaches that eventually drove him mad, but that doesn't ever seem to hurt the quality of his work (for a contrasting example, see Time Cube). I've found many insightful ideas in Nietzsche. Why don't you like him?
