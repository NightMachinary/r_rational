I haven't read Genesis or Nietzsche... but this strikes me more like a Hermeneutical critique of God's mismanagement of an intelligence explosion by one of His creations and then labeling many of Man's deeds as sin (guilt borne from knowledge of right and wrong.)

If Nietzsche was the first philosopher to reinterpret the Bible this way and successfully avoid persecution while proselytizing an alternate message, he gets mad props.

All that said... his writing does come off as over the top and it isn't exactly rational. At least, I have a hard time following his logic.
