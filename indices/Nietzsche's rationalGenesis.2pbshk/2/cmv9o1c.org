Eeeeeeh, the idea that disaster and conflict keeps man from advancing science and becoming godlike doesn't make sense to me. War is one of the greatest incentives for progress we have. After all, necessity is the mother of innovation. We invented a ton of new technologies and fields of science to better defend ourselves and to destroy others. For example, we discovered the power of the atom via the Manhattan Project.

Although this raises the opposite question. Would we have had any technological advancement (or at the very least advanced more slowly) if we had everlasting peace?
