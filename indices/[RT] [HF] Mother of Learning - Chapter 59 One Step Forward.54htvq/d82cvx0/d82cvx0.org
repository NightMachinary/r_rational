Hmm. An interesting development here.

In a normal story, obtaining the crown would be saved for last, there would be an epic showdown in the Final Loop, a mad scramble for the gate with moments left before the End...

In this one, I see a few things -

1. They'll try to get QI's crown at the end of EVERY loop from now on, unless they don't make it to the invasion (aka, die early)

2. There's a mad scramble at the end and they DON'T make it to the gate before the End... but there's an admin failsafe that dumps them into Guardian-space anyway, because that would be sensible.

3. They'll try to get QI's crown at the end of every loop, but it'll come down to the last few possible loops anyway just because it's just so freaking hard.
