If you're talking about [[https://sketchmemo.wordpress.com/2015/08/22/109/][this]] image, I thought it was fanart by a fan. I saw it and used it as inspiration for my version, but as far as I know, it has not been named as official artwork. So I also used my interpretation of the character and the in-story description as my basis.

I think all of us have a little imaginative license to see characters as we want to. If you have read books where the cover artwork is wrong or just off, you are not expected to accept it as 100% canon.
