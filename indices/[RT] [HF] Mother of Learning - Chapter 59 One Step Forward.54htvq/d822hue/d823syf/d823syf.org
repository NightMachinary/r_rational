While I agree his opinions of his brothers are wholly subjective, I think Zorian was confirming Zach's surprise that he would use Damien's name rather than thinking Zach thought Damien wasn't good. Much of his dislike for Damien comes from how he thinks everyone loves Damien while he knows how bad his brother can be. I doubt he considered Zach an exception to that.
