I was expecting this chapter to be invasion defense chapter. A colorful one, considering Xvim and Alanic awareness about it. Instead, it is a transition chapter to that. However, I am pleased that it is revealed that Alanic has another esoteric magic to teach to balance out Xvim's nefarious suggestion. Brilliant planning!
