Zorian is far past the point where his mind probes would actually kill or significantly damage the target, so comparing it to torture is a bit much. The main problem is privacy, not pain.

Thing is, Xvim is already sharing skills, so how much can mind probing him really help? Sure he could possibly be keeping his better skills to himself, but there's no indication of that yet.
