Maybe, but I kind of wonder about this. The five parts of the Key are tied to the loop, and for a Controller to collect them is significant (it increases his/her authorisation level). It's not unthinkable that they would follow a Controller who collected them - especially since you have to present them to the Guardian, and you can only visit it via projection. But yes, it's also entirely possible that they have to be collected in the same iteration.
