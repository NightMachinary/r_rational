You know...that would make a LOT of sense. Back in Chapter 26, after Red Robe wormed the info on the aranea out of Zach's mind, Quatach-Ichl said "The aranea were never part of--" before being cut off by RR leaving, the unsaid part most likely being "the time loop". I always wondered how he would know, since his only info should have come from RR - but your explanation provides a very good reason why he might know so surely.

The one contradicton, though, is that he /is/ also the one who dumped Zorian into the loop via soul-blending. I mean, that particular result /was/ unexpected in every sense possible, but if he really did use to be a looper, you'd think he'd have a more sophisticated plan of attack against a potential time looper.
