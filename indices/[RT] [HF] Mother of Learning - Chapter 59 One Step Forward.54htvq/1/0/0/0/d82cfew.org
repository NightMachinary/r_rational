Er, no. The professional opinion of the Filigree Sages was that the Cyorian aranea had zero chance of reading the lich's mind. That thing's had a thousand years to gather every kind of magic it can find, with no moral compass worth mentioning. Even if you could somehow get into his mind, you might as well invade hell: highly unpleasant and quickly fatal (or worse).
