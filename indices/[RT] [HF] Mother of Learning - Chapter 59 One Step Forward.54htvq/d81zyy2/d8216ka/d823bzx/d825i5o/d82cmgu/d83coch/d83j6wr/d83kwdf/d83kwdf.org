Here's a quote from chapter 10 that should help:

#+begin_quote
  what I had been trying to build up to was that spell formula are... support magic. Magic affecting other magic. By itself, even the most elegant spell formula is merely a theoretical exercise. You need to actually cast the spells and anchor them to the spell formula before it's of any use. I note this because Ilsa seemed to think your skill in invocations would do you no good in my subject, which annoyed me because it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the discipline.

Meaning that if you can't cast the spell you can't make an actually functional formula.
