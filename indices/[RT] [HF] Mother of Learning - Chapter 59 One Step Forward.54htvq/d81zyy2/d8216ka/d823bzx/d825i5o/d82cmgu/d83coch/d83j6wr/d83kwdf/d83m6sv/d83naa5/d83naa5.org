What you're thinking of are auto casters, very hard to make and not very useful beyond basic spells. The rods we saw at the start allowed to skip some of the steps to allow for very quick casting, but they still needed someone with a soul to cast the spell. And anchoring the spell is the act of casting the spell for the spell formula.

The spell formula has to constantly drain mana to stay active, if it runs out the spell has to be recast. Here's a quote from the author on the matter:

#+begin_quote
  Wards, not having souls, cannot cast anything. So once the spells used in their construction are cast, they never really turn off. If they were to ever completely shut down, they would have to be remade from scratch before they could work again.
#+end_quote

I think you're confused because of what spell formulas have been shown to do, but what you have to realize is that by putting lots of mana into a defensive ward you're just strengthening a spell that's already there.

Also the coin had been anchored with Kael spell, so Zorian didn't have to do anything, the coin was likely just staying active thanks to ambient mana. Once it touched the lich it "released" the spell Kael had already set up on it.
