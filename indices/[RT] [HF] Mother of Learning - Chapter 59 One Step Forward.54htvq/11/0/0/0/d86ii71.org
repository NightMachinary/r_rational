Yeah. I just thought of them in particular because Zorian used to do them while he wandered around in the countryside. I'm not sure if skills-training shaping is something Zorian should prioritize. Given that he's probably good enough at shaping to proficiently cast most spells, and that there's now a time-limit, I think it'll be more useful for him to take books and add spells to his arsenal, as you've mentioned. Zach, on the other hand, could certainly benefit from additional skill at shaping, but I'm not sure if it's important enough when compared with the other options.

One thing that occurred to me while writing this, however, is that by bringing in tools and materials, Zorian could spend the whole time making golems and working spell formulas to prepare for the invasion or the likely key-collecting boss fights. That's lower-priority until they know where all the keys are, though.
