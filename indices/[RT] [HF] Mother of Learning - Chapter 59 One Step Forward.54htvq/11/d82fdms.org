So...what skills would a Controller practise inside a black room?

I can think of:

- Soul awareness meditation

- Deep memory probing, /if/ Zorian/Xvim/someone can bully Zach into admitting he needs to get checked.

- Learning new spells (hexagonal shield!), and/or making casting flawless. This depends on whether they have a resilient target inside the room, and whether their mana recharges normally. (Of course, given that Zorian's magic missile training method involved dropping the power of the missiles, Zach could probably practice it on him if need be.)

- Unstructured mental defences, for Zach.

- Going through the contents of any caches they find, eg the ones mentioned by Zach (lich sanctum, demon-worshipping cult treasury, vault under Marbolkano).

- General reading, especially whatever they can find about the Ikosian emperor.

Any more exciting possibilities?
