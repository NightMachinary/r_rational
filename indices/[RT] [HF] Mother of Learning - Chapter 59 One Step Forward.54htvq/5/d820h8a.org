I am starting to think that this arc will be longer than the two first combined. We had 4 and a half chapters covering just one restart, and we are still not done.

With Zach on board, there are clearly less opportunities to say "Zorian practiced mind magic with the spiders for 3 restarts in a row, and nothing else happened". Something will always happen.

On theorycrafing side of things, the information about simulacrum spell is intriguing. Does it have some sort of soul simulation or even a crude copy powering it up?
