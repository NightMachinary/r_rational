Yes, Zenomir will probably be revealed as a cult member at some point - and actually, with all of Zorian's cult investigation, it's a bit odd that he never investigated why telling Zenomir got him assassinated.

However, I doubt that it will be in chapter 60. I think this one will be an epic fight, ZZ+Xvim+Alanic against Quatach-Ichl. /Is Xvim smart enough to actually find a way to beat an indestructible ancient lich?/
