This is a bit late, but here's a prediction for the next chapter:

The polyglot teacher, Zenomir, the one who initially told Zorian about ancient Majara language, is one of the high-ranking members of the Cult of the Dragon Below. Not only was he familiar enough with Majara language to know what language it was upon hearing an imperfect transcript of a spell heard only once, months before, but he was also able to accurately determine that it was a soul magic spell. The latter would imply that he is familiar with soul magic himself, and the efficiency with which Zorian was targeted afterwards to be assassinated seems to be too much of a coincidence.

For that to happen without Zenomir himself being a member would mean that either Zenomir immediately informed the wrong person about Zorian's experience without making efforts to confirm his claims, and that he also specifically mentioned Zorian's name to that person. Or alternately, that his mind was read after he mentioned this to the wrong person, which would also be careless and odd, coming from a teacher at that institute.

So yeah, Zenomir is most likely involved with the Cult. That's my prediction.
