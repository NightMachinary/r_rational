Interesting, from which passage do you infer this? I remember the first time Zorian came under Nora tutelage she mentioned that people just take a working formula and modify it until it fits their need. It is sufficient. Only ones who wish to be a master should understand all aspect of spell formula so they can make the most efficient formula for their purpose.

An exception came when Zorian start making physics communication discs (no, not really). Without a psychic to test the creation, spell forge cannot design a working formula. However, if the formula design is to be leaked, any spell forge can just build them.
