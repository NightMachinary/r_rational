That passage clearly explain the important of invocation skill in testing unfinished spell formula. But, the word 'anchor' confused me. Isn't the spell formula act as mana shaper? You supply it with mana, and boom, a spell is invoked.

But I suppose a formula is a tool which it's user need to know what limitation it has and how to use it. Otherwise, you cannot cramp 3 spell formula into one tiny ring (it involves overlapping geometry that only activates if supplied with correct mana shape) or use multiple kind of magic missile in just one spell rod. If I understand this right, Kael must be really good at making his banishing silver coin. Zorian only need to supply it with mana and it worked just fine.
