Re taking over the rat swarm: I don't think that Zorian needs a specialised item to bind a rat to the swarm. His existing mind control and locator spells should be sufficient.

If he dominates two cranium rats, he should be able to make them telepathically connect to each other. He should then be able to dominate them as one entity - which would still be weak enough to easily control. Then he can use locator spells to find more rats, and add them to his competing hive mind. Until a) the original hive mind stops and talks to him; b) he takes over /all/ of the rats; or c) he reaches the limit of how large a hive mind he can control, at which point he has probably largely achieved his objective (subverting the swarm) anyway.

At some point along the way, his swarm will probably even become large enough to reach out and collect the disowned rats without needing to dominate them first.
