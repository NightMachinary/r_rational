  Zorian seems to be a better planner

This. It's not coincidental that Zorian is the one who transfers notebooks, collects wads of cash every time, and learned to interact with his soul and marker.

Zach has dated almost every girl in the class, but the one time Zorian even gave off the appearance of dating, he learned to sense his marker and gained a cool new ability (manual loop reset). Zach messes around, Zorian doesn't.
