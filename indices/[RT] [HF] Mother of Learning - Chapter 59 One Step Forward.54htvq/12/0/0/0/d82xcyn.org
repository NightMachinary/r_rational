Zach is an incredibly potent combat force and given the time he's spent in the loop he doesn't have many glaring weaknesses left, but Zorian still surpasses him in some things. His shaping skills are better, allowing him to do more esoteric things that Zach would need to spend a lot of time to learn. Being able to make artifacts well allows him to use any preparation time he has to counter specific threats, while Zach relies heavily on battering them down through force. Even aside from magic, Zorian seems to be a better planner and better at diplomacy. They complement each other very well. Neither has the same weaknesses as the other.
