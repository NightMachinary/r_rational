  Zach is too effective.

I actually don't think so. He has never beaten Quatach-Ichl before, never succeeded in fending off the invasion - and once they get out of the loop, the invaders will be able to summon a horde of high-level magic-resistant demons on top of everything else. And if the primordial actually gets out and needs killing...yeah, Zach is not overpowered.
