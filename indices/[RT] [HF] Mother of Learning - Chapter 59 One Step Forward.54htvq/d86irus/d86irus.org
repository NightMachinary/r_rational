You know, Xvim is not the type to bravely-yet-suicidally charge into battle. If he's saying this kind of thing, then he probably has an actual plan in mind, something more nuanced than "find a spell that can deal damage." Something that could bypass QI's near-indestructibility.

Chelik the golem (chapter 46) springs to mind. Hardly anything could hurt him, but he was still vulnerable to the earth swallowing him up and pinning him.
