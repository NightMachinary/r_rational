Um...maybe, but even then, Zorian might consider performing blood magic on them to be going too far. It's one thing to be willing to kill enemies in wartime, but we still don't approve of torture, for example. Even with enemies, there are boundaries.

And where would he even find someone who could instruct him? Kael certainly doesn't know how to go about such rituals, and probably wouldn't /want/ to know.
