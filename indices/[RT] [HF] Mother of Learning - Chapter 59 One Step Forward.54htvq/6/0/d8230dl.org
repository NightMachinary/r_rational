Most likely. Wasn't the first Ikosian Emperor the one who was claimed to have traveled to another world using the Sovereign Gate? So it's likely that they are artifacts created by the same person who created the Gate itself, and who gifted them to the Emperor. I doubt that the Emperor himself was the one who created them, else he'd have no need to travel through the Gate in the first place, and he'd have left behind more of his creations before he died.
