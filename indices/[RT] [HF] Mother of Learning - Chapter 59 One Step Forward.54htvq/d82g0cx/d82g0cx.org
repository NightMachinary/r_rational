Some typos.

"This one wasn't magically darkened, but Alanic forb+id+*ade* them..."

"If you won't take this with +o+utmost seriousness..."

"He+'s+ is trying to kill you. Pay up."

"He was working extra hard on his basic training and was not at all discouraged from following in Zorian's footsteps +when+ *once* Alanic pronounced him +as+ ready, despite Zorian describing to him in loving detail how horrible the procedure felt." (At first I thought that Alanic /did/ pronounce Zach ready.)

"There is also a high chance that leaders o+r+*f* the local Cult of the Dragon Below will be there"
