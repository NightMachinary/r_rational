Mother of Learning fanart I made while waiting in between chapters:

[[http://i.imgur.com/z7W9gc7.jpg][Zorian and Quatach poster.]]

[[http://i.imgur.com/DZcUowt.jpg][No text version.]]

I originally drew this as a poster to have printed for the wall, but it can also be used as a cover for anyone who wanted to print out a hard copy for offline reading. It looks pretty badass in full-res. Detail shot [[http://i.imgur.com/l9plevE.jpg][Zorian]] and [[http://i.imgur.com/o6eJ6Db.jpg][Quatach Ichl]].

I followed the written descriptions as best as I could, but filled in the gaps with artistic license, thus the schoolboy uniform for Zorian. Here is the original rough [[http://i.imgur.com/UCsdjau.jpg][concept sketch]] and an older drawing of [[http://i.imgur.com/4RyBayz.jpg][Red Robe]] shooting purple laser beams, whose design was inspired by the wizards of Magicka. He's not as cool and imposing as Quatach Ichl.

  I am very much in the â€˜use your imagination' category, which is why I never bothered to describe people too much. Turns out people don't really like this much, so I probably should have put in wordier descriptions. Oh well. Anyway, the only thing definitive about Zorian is that he is thin, has glasses, and that his hair and eyes are brown.

Looks like there is no definitive canon depiction.
