I'm still curious if/when he's going to kill the spider and go back to Silverlake. Soul magic seems central to getting a grip on what's happening considering how much it's used by the Sovereign Gate, Quatach Ichl and presumably Red Robe. Alanic is clearly not willing to teach him many aspects of it, so he's going to have to get /someone/ else. Even if Alanic did agree, it'd be worth it for the same reason that going to different spider tutors was worthwhile.

My money is still on the spider eggs being an ingredient for a potion that Silverlake thinks will solve one of his problems. Perhaps giving Zorian external soul sense to compliment his growing self-soul perception.
