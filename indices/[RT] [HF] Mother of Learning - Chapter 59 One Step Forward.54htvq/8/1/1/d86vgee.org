Kael's teacher was his mother in law. Presumably he got introduced to Silverlake through her, with both being traditional witches and all. Considering she didn't even know his teacher and wife were dead the relationship wasn't so close.

At this point there's little reason to deal with Silverlake. He initially wanted an expert's opinion about the loop and defense against soul magic, but he already got both from different sources. I think the Grey Hunter is more likely to be relevant, since it's a go to for that magic sense training Zorian wanted.
