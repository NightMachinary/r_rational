There was an interesting post to [[/r/worldbuilding]] a few days ago, which was a list compiled by an anthropologist of "universal" elements of human cultures. [[http://willsull.net/resources/HumanUniversals.pdf][Link here [PDF]]]. I'm not entirely sure how /correct/ it actually is, but the list provides an interesting starting point for making non-human cultures, since you can strip out some "universal" thing as a way of making a non-human culture distinct from a human one.

(The question of /why/ these might be universal to different human cultures is beyond the scope of that list, but it's also a fun thing to think about.)
