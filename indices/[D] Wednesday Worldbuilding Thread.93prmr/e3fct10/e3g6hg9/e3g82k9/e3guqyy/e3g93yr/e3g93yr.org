  Like, what exactly do they do on a day-to-day basis?
#+end_quote

There are as many potential answers to this as there are stories about gods. In greek myths, the gods behaved much the same as humans did. They slept around, partied, celebrated, or worked. There's no reason Boccob, god of Magic, Knowledge, and Magical Knowledge couldn't be satisfied with a day spent researching the secrets of the universe or organizing his library.

  Why do they intervene in the world, but only in weird, specific, inefficient ways?
#+end_quote

Why can a Wizard only conjure fire in a particular set of shapes? Why isn't there a half-squirrel half-alligator monster? Many rules can be broken, but there are some rules that cannot.

Alternatively, the limits put on the gods are a peace treaty of sorts. Unleashing the fullness of their divine might in the mortal world would destroy it, or at least destroy their potential worshipers. Therefore, they've agreed to a set of limitations on their potential behaviors. The specific shape of these limitations is a result of the balance of power when the gods agreed to them.

  Why are Clerics even a thing?
#+end_quote

Clerics exist because they're cost efficient. Gods don't generate divine power, they merely manipulate it (in the same way that necromancers manipulate necromantic power). Empowering a Cleric is as simple as providing a mortal with a connection to this power source, and once that connection exists developing it no more requires further investment from the god who formed it than a Sorcerer honing her power requires her to discover greater levels of draconic heritage. This is also why it's possible to have heresy in a world where the gods exist and can be spoken to.

  Some Gods hate other Gods, but for some reason they resolve these conflicts by making mortals fight other mortals on the material plane?
#+end_quote

The gods are risk-averse. The world as it is contains some things that are pleasing to any particular god. There are things that are on fire. The God of Fire would like /more/ things to be on fire, and trying to kill the God of Water might facilitate that, but it also might result in the God of Water killing him, which would result in less things being on fire. As a result, the gods are content to engage in low-risk strategies like empowering Clerics or granting miracles.
