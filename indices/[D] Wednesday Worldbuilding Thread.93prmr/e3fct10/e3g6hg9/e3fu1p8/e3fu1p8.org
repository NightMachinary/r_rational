I'm currently working on what I /hope/ will be a rational story dealing with telepathic alien dragons, so the lore has to be pretty huge. The 'deep' lore is below (I'm much more worried about fleshing out the more recent lore, not pictured). Could anyone critique it, tell me if it makes sense, or if it's too cliche, etc?

--------------

The Local Group is populated by numerous sapient races, and FTL exists, but the spread of eukaryotic life is explicitly slow. Life has been jumping from star to star for billions of years, the most common organisms being a kind of space-tardigrade that researchers on earth have never even witnessed.

FTL works based on a sort of gate principle: once both entrance and exit are built, travel/communication is possible, but frontiers must be reached using slower-than-light. Thankfully, sentient life has existed a long time. Most of the Local Group is connected to a network.

Sapient races have a life cycle just as individuals do, going into decline after some amount of time. AI is not a threat for this reason: too much intelligence -> decline.

The star network is maintained by a loose alliance of active races. Most are bizarre and have inexplicable goals, but some are humanesque. This alliance has lasted a long time, and there were numerous similar alliances before it, each with the same goals: spread life, expand the network, and maintain the gates.

It is tradition among alliance members to uplift other races in a way that is similar to parenting: each race hopes its successors will improve upon it and live longer than it. Humans are the child race of what we call dragons, reptilian quadrupeds. The prevalence of dragons across all human cultures comes from interactions with them long ago.

Until relatively recently, most species never dabbled with telepathy because it always resulted in hiveminds, but a few generations ago a sentient race arose that had a peculiar symbiosis with a sort of life form that took advantage of hyperspace to provide instantaneous telepathy. The life form creates a sort of black box in hyperspace that functions as a translator, allowing for hivemind-free (read: defense always trumps offense) telepathy. Most like-minded species were later designed with telepathy in mind, including dragons and humans.

The new hyperspatial life form inspired the design of similarly working technology, creating a telepathic interface for what would best be called “magic.” Earth was discovered when magic use was becoming wildly popular, and dragons intended for their children to be the first race to evolve with magic from the start. Unfortunately, in ~100,000 BC, it was discovered that magic use had a negative correlation with the nearby spread and evolution of life (it kills space tardigrades). Since spreading of life is goal #1, magic was almost immediately shut down universally, sans telepathy, which was only grandfathered as most races could no longer function without it. Earth was taken from dragon control after they fought to keep magic/telepathy running.

In the 21st century, humans are long overdue for contact, but the alliance insists they are dangerous for some reason, prompting some dragons to take action.
