My first thoughts as I read it:

- space tardigrades is in the new Star Trek series and they are used for FTL travel with a "network". You might want to choose another type of creature: maybe some sort of archaea? Maybe a mitochondrion, and then you get the cool lore that humanity has aliens in its very DNA / panspermia? Or keep the tardigrades, just wanted you to be aware.

- "Sapient races have a life cycle just as individuals do, going into decline after some amount of time" - you need justification for this as it hits my suspension of disbelief HARD. Personally I'd ditch it and instead say that Beserkers kill off races that get too advanced if you really want to do that

- "The prevalence of dragons across all human cultures" - I contest that: does the Middle East have dragon mythos? What about the ~200 Australian Aboriginal culture groups? The innumerable African traditions? Did the Maya have a dragon myth? If you're counting "flying gods" or "reptile gods" as dragons, you are going to hit suspension of disbelief for honestly no good reason. You could, for example, limit historical dragon interaction to Europe and China - but European dragons and Chinese dragons look completely different and have different backgrounds (European dragons are evil, Chinese dragons are good).

- "most species never dabbled with telepathy because it always resulted in hiveminds" how?

- "a sort of life form that took advantage of hyperspace to provide instantaneous telepathy" how? are we talking basically a hyperspace babel fish because that's what i'm picturing?

- I don't understand at all how the introduction of hyperspace into the process allows for hivemind-free telepathy.

- "magic use had a negative correlation with the nearby spread and evolution of life (it kills space tardigrades)" - how? if magic is so commonly used by the dragons, why are they allowed to travel at all - shouldn't their space tardigrades be dead too? Why did human magic use have an effect and not the telepathy that other races used for so long that they can't function without it?

- "dangerous for some reason" - why? Is it because the magic still extant on Earth has killed all our local tardigrades and if we spread the tardigrades will all die?

Sorry to kind of tear everything apart - but hopefully it gives you a lot to think about. All in all, it seems like a cross between Startreck: Discovery, Stargate, and probably the Pern series (I haven't read the latter but "space dragons" sounds very much like it).
