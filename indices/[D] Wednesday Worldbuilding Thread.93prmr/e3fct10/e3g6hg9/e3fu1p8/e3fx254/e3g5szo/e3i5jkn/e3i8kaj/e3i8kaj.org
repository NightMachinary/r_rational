Thanks for the suggestions! I'll definitely watch at least a few episodes.

The tl;dr that my original post should have been the constraints I'm working with, aka my backstory:

- A member of an alien species lives on earth in hiding for several years, not knowing it is an alien
- It looks like a reptile, but is mentally only about 3 standard deviations different from the average human
- It has telepathic powers that it has spread to the family that raised it and close friends
- It has a brief encounter with a member of its species and they are able to communicate some, that knowledge forming a fraction of my original post
- The other alien does not return when it said it would, prompting our alien to go public and spread the information it learned
- Earth is completely isolated from the rest of the universe: no ftl, no communication

The story itself will be much less hard sci-fi than the backstory; it's set a couple years later when most people have given up hope that contact with aliens will happen anytime soon; the primary point of interest being the spread of telepathy.
