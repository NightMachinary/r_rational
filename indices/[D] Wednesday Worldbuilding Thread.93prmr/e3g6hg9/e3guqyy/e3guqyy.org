One explanation that The Gods are Bastards gives is that gods are less super-powerful humans, and more "fields" or "forces" that occasionally manifest as conscious entities, but more often behave mechanistically and as a diffuse unconsciousness

Only specific foci or events can draw the attention of a god to force it to manifest, and the manifestation --- the physical appearance, behavior, agency and personality of the manifested projection differs with the scenario. For example, a god called upon to address an audience will be more grandstanding and forceful, a towering figure radiating with divine light, speaking with a thundering voice and declarative mode of speech. Meanwhile, a god called upon to give counsel to the high priest of its faith may be more humble and look like an ordinary person, speaking softly and with greater compassion.

In essence, gods are not beings in this mythology---they are complex forces of nature that manifest in a number of manners, including but not limited to as a conscious individual, and even then in a number of manners. They don't do anything in their off-time, since "off-time" isn't a concept that applies to something that is only conscious when there is specific work to be done. They intervene in weird, specific ways because they only gain the capacity of free will and action in said weird, specific contexts.

We could separate divine wielders/characters into ones that commune with the sentient aspects of the gods, and those that interact with the diffuse, mechanistic aspects, or "god fields". One might say that priests and priestesses are the former, while clerics and paladins* are the latter. This would justify clerics and paladins not really being that big of a deal, since gods probably don't even notice them most of the time. As long as they keep to the doctrine of the faith, they can manipulate the divine power that is hence automatically vested in them. Simultaneously, this safeguards the archetypical moral integrity and faithfulness of cleric and paladin characters---if they become evil (in the relevant god's book) or heretical (against the god's doctrine) then they lose their power^.

- Actually, in TGaB paladins are super important and incredibly powerful unique individuals, with their patron gods basically permanently keeping their eyes on them. But this is your setting, so that's not important.

^ One could create a "technically good" cleric/paladin antagonist that theoretically obeys their god's doctrine but uses rules lawyering to twist everything to their own benefit while harming others. TGaB has such a character, and it's an excellent way to subvert the traditional "holy and good" image without compromising the integrity of other divine-powered characters in the same setting.
