Thank you for the response! Some of the points you made look like I was just bad at explaining or skipped details due to brevity, but most are things I need to think through.

- The initial idea /was/ mitochondria, but I needed them to be slower than light, and it makes sense for something like tardigrade shells to survive in space. One of my fears was that mitochondria were too close to midichlorians, but I didn't realize tardigrades were already used by Star Trek! Just to clarify, they aren't used for FTL travel at all in this story; they just exist.

- Declines are super hand-wavey as is, so if you can think of a good explanation for them, I'm all ears. The way I imagined it was that each civilization might decline due to its own causes, but after /very/ long periods of time the trend just emerges without much further explanation. They would be purely cultural processes, where species don't exactly die, but lose interest in the galactic scene and whatever might have been their initial goals. Perhaps immortality itself would suffice, but then the question would be why doesn't it happen earlier. Immortality+endlessly progressing culture to its logical extreme seems like the most reasonable explanation to me at the moment.

- This is a good point that I didn't really consider. Either my alternate-earth would have a different history where other cultures also had dragons, or maybe dragons only landed in Eurasia (with a more recent timeline). I'm honestly on the fence between making dragons look like any mythological dragons or making them a bit more alien. I didn't talk much about them in this post because I'm still hammering that down and there's a lot to talk about. One huge difference between these and I think most mythological dragons is that these are quite small, at maybe 2/3 the size of a Komodo dragon. I also don't know whether they'll have wings, but if they do I imagine they'll have to be even smaller (even still, the strongest dragon could never fly in earth's atmosphere/gravity).

- Let me rewrite that: all previous attempts at telepathy resulted in either: sloppy, consciously encoded information (akin to having to control a muscle to pulse morse code), or some kind of merging between two individuals, ranging from 'leaking' information all the way to the two individuals merging. The problem with the latter, in all cases, is that neither individual can feel or control where their self ends and another begins, and no individuals possess the skills to stop anyone else from retrieving their memories or controlling their bodies. I'm not opposed to hive minds existing in the setting, so for some species that might not be a problem.

- The life forms are just a babel fish, and I have some idea of how they work, but I need to think through their evolution to find something that makes sense. As is, they are a symbiotic microorganism that lives in colonies that mirror the hosts' brains. If person A already possesses one colony, they may infect person B via proximity, creating an AB colony, which begins small and weak but can grow with proximity/practice/time. It takes months to grow a colony good enough for simple language based communication. If person B forms a BC colony, its growth is entirely independent of AB. No AI in this universe is powerful enough to replicate their results. Right now my best explanation for the hyperspace part is that physical space doesn't have any medium with a high enough bandwidth that's accessible to microorganisms: 100 trillion of these organisms could encode your entire brain without taking up any physical space, and many more would be needed for the black-box translation step.

- When magic is outlawed, dragons only use telepathy like most other species. Neither the life forms nor artificial magic have a good 'energy' explanation as is, so that might be the key to making everything to do with hyperspace make sense. How does the following sound as a description of this world's hyperspace:

Hyperspace is a plane where distance has a varying level of meaning. There is a concept of 'depth', where the deeper you go, the less meaningful distance becomes. Random interactions between particles become asymptotically less likely, but exchanges between particles that have already interacted (I hesitate to say entangled) become easier. At a certain, finite depth, the universe appears to be 0 dimensional. Interactions between particles tend to be over a long period of time, even if the particles only interact briefly in our universe. For beginning a connection in both FTL travel and telepathy, physical proximity in the real universe is important. The only instance of anything seeming to interact with anything else without physically interacting first is the case of the dying tardigrades. One major problem with this system is: what is the entry barrier? Why doesn't every life form already abuse it?

- The problem with the last point, and many of the points, is something I hope to get to in the future: Humanity's information about ALL of this comes from a 2 day encounter, and is reported by a single, potentially unreliable individual. Obviously in these posts my goal is to flesh out the backstory, but I unintentionally presented it as 'this is the information people in the story get.'

Thank you again for your response! I have not seen/read Star Trek or the Pern series, but it would do well to be genre savvy!
