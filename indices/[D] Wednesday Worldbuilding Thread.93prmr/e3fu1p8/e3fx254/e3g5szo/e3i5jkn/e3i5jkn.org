You really should watch the new Star Trek series - at least the parts with the Tardigrades and the FTL network as they're the things it seems like your concept "copied" (the first 2-3 episodes I think covers most of it, but [[/r/scifi]] or [[/r/startrek]] would probably be able to tell you which episodes to watch). I think, unfortunately, a lot of your idea could be seen as derivative of that due to timing and content - though I don't know for certain because I don't 100% follow your concept as it's very complicated.

If I have time at work today I'll read through the post I'm replying to again and provide some more detailed feedback, but if I never get to it I wanted to make sure that I recommended Discovery to you. If you're not in the USA it's on Netflix.
