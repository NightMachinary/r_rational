- Gods are constrained by what they can do in some kind of Mutually Assured Destruction scenario. Directly using godly power to reshape the world would result in a cataclysm of countermoves which doesn't benefit anyone. Imbuing power into clerics and paladins is permissible in a way that directly using the finger of godly power is not.

- Gods work on incentives that maximize their actual power when used in weird, specific, and (seemingly) inefficient ways. If you're trying to get around the weird game mechanical implications of D&D like "more experienced clerics get more power" or "clerics only draw from a specific spell list" or "clerics only cast a certain number of spells each day", you can answer those questions with background rules which (more or less) map to the actual rules. Maybe spell levels are /actually a thing/ that clerics discuss amongst themselves, and which relate directly to their abilities. They wouldn't necessarily call these spell levels, but "third heightening of the second aspect" or similar, which would reflect the reality of the clerical spellcasting system. As for why spells are the way they are, it might be the case that "pre-packaged" or "off-the-shelf" spells are substantially cheaper to power than custom-made ones (with obvious parallels to the real world).

- Gods need champions not just as a power multiplier, but because they need their power and influence to spread in the world, and a god can only be in so many places at once. You wouldn't expect a god to show up to solve any particular problem anymore than you'd expect a CEO to be handling customer complaints. There are some problems with this, namely that there /are/ situations that would seem like they'd merit the CEO showing up, but we can maybe patch that by depicting the gods as perpetually locked in a balanced struggle, with the actions of mortals being an effort to tip the scales one way or another, and all mortal struggles being essentially incremental plays for a better position in the eternal battle.
