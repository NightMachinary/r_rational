I've been trying to build a world for a DnD campaign and a problem I keep running into is what exactly to do with the Gods

Like, what exactly do they /do/ on a day-to-day basis? Why do they intervene in the world, but only in weird, specific, inefficient ways? Why are Clerics even a /thing/? Some Gods hate other Gods, but for some reason they resolve these conflicts by making mortals fight other mortals on the material plane?

I'm sure there are answers to these questions, but I can't think of any that preserve that "heroic holy warrior" feel that Clerics and Paladins are meant to have and/or avoid making the entire setting /about/ them. I'm not really interested in a deconstruction of the concept, just an explanation or a justification or something so I can get on with the rest of the setting
