If you mean literally build a base, then I can't think of any.

For plain power fantasy books, I recommend:

- Black Prism by Brent Weeks
- Blood Song by Anthony Ryan. The first book is very good, but the sequels get progressively worse
- Harry Dresden Series - Rough start, and too episodic at times, but good enough

Do you have any recs?
