So while I wouldn't say that this series is rational, it's got a fair bit of the thrown into another world of magic fantasy that people here seem to like.

Also the author is the same guy who wrote /Time Braid/ and /Perilous Waif./

Just be warned that he has a fair bit of sex and oodles of harem fantasies involved in this book.
