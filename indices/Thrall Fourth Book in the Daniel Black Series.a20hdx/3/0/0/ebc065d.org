A lot of fantasy that dabbles in power escalation feels like walking up the down escalator. Dresden is a case in point: in the first 4-6 books, if I remember correctly, the beginning of each book feels like nothing was gained in the previous book. It's pretty depressing to feel like "we" went through all of that only to end up still at the bottom of a hill instead of making noticeable progress.

Daniel Black, for all its faults, does not suffer from that problem up through Thrall.
