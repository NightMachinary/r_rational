I'm almost finished this book. I feel like it's a bit of a departure from the previous books in the series. If I were to graph the chauvanism expressed by book, it would be peaking with this last one. Maybe one day the MC will meet a woman that doesn't drool at the thought of his dick!

I also don't like how alanna turned out to be so special and overpowered, and I especially didn't like how she's just a shortcut for the author to just lazily vomit exposition at will.

This book is really scraping the barrel, imo, and I already had a pretty low bar for this series.
