Honestly, I saw it fairly early on (in my viewing of anime) as well, and I think it was a mistake. Eva works way better if you have some understanding of the common tropes of more standard mecha anime of the period before watching it, in the same way PMMM works way better if you have some understanding of the Magical Girl genre. I rewatched Eva later after having seen some other mecha series of the era, and it was better for it - there's a lot in Eva that seems to be deliberate reactions to certain standard genre-defining tropes.

Also, the question about seeing Eva to EY... In HPMOR he had Quirrell use an AT Field at one point (Ch. 74).
