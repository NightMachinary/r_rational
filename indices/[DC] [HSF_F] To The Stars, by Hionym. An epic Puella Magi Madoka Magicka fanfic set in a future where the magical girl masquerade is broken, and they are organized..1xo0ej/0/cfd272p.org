I'd like to offer this fic up. It's not a pure rationalist fic, but it fits IMO because of how the fic fills the time between the end of the TV series. It takes the dark world that PMMM built, and through pure human ingenuity and organizational work, mainly through the work of [[#s][chapter 1 spoiler]], results in a world much better off for girls than the series shows, beginning or end. Without removing the costs of power, it almost transforms the world to be unrecognisable, and then throws in an alien antagonist from left field.

My only complaint is that after the first chapter, the next 8 or so chapters are nearly all catchup, but besides the issue of worldbuilding pacing, it's a wonderful read of tactics set in a brilliantly original setting.

It's also awesome in how it uses the headcanon that [[#s][chapter 3 spoiler]], but doesn't make the consequences story-breaking.
