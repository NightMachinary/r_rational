This is delightful, and reminds me of the classic “Captain Gars” trope (the name of King Gustav of Sweden's alter ego, which was just an acronym of his initials) where the obvious alter ego is just maintained as a sort of “polite fiction.”

/Everyone/ knows who the alter ego is. Everyone pretends anyway, because refusing to go along with this lunacy wouldn't benefit them one bit. You'd just be making a powerful enemy and going against the grain of everyone else. I love the idea of people involuntarily being forced to play along from the sheer social pressure alone.
