  Everyone knows who the alter ego is. Everyone pretends anyway, because refusing to go along with this lunacy wouldn't benefit them one bit. You'd just be making a powerful enemy and going against the grain of everyone else. I love the idea of people involuntarily being forced to play along from the sheer social pressure alone.
