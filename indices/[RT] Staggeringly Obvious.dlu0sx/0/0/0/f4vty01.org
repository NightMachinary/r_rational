It doesn't appear in the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/PlayingWith/SecretIdentity][list of ways]] to play with the trope of Secret Identity.

The closest trope is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityImpersonator][Identity Impersonator]] where you have a body double in the same room as you to 'disprove' yourself as the hero. In your story, it's simply a never ending case of a "failed" Identity Impersonator which I have never seen being done anywhere else.

Thanks for the story. It was pleasure to read such a novel twist.
