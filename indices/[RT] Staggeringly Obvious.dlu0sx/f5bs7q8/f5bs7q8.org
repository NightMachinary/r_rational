Fantastic story idea, can't remember that I've ever seen it done before. Buuuut, I'm going to be that person. The conversation with the girl sounds very unpolished, to the point where it doesn't seem realistic (especially the girl's lines). I think if you went back for another pass you could make that scene clearer and heighten the tension as well.
