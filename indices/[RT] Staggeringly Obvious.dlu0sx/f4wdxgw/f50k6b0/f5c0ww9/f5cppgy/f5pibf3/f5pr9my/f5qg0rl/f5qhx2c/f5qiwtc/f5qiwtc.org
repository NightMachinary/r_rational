  No it doesn't. As history shows us, if someone is stronger than the government, they become the government. If in japan there is an association with a guy who can make a black hole wherever he likes, he is the fucking absolute ruler of the nation, wether he overtly wants to or not. If a 'contractor' group is the government's army, they're the government, man. It's silly.

We don't know what happened. It's strongly hinted that there was a time of anarchy when Quirks first arose - and that the current peace is what emerged from then.

Sure, black hole guy is powerful. But this is not a world in which superpowers are uncommon. Like, 80% and counting of the population has a superpower, though not all powers are useful. And powers don't make you invulnerable by a long shot. If the really strong are a minority, they still wouldn't manage to overcome the vast majority that can simply shoot them.

There's a few broken powers that kinda violate that rule. Black hole dude depending on what his body is actually like, portal black cloud dude, Endeavour and Todoroki are no joke either... but a lot of them have pretty silly and limited powers. People like the girl with earbud jacks attached to her body, or Iida who can run really fast, or the guy who gets somewhat stronger by eating sugar. Those aren't world-breaking powers. If everyone was more like them it'd be easier to buy that their world does indeed make sense.
