The fact that they're putting kids in the frontlines to prevent crime, in bright costumes, for one? 'Oh, I'm clockblocker, I can stop time with my hands.' - Try and stop a hail from a machine gun.

The 'super code' for another? Why would villains even bother with that nonsense. And don't give me 'driven to conflict by the shards' because humanity would have plenty of conflict, but unlikely to have the bright costumes.
