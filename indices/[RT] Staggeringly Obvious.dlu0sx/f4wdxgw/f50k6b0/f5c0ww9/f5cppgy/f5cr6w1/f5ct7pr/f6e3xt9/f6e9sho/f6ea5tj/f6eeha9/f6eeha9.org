I'm not angry. I'm just tired of having this same conversation over and over again.

Justifications for superheroes are silly. Superheroes are silly.

You can have your superhero stories, they're fine, and occasionally entertaining. I like worm.

But I need to suspend my disbelief that the world would somehow devolve into groups of people in garish costumes that would fight in the streets in the open like that.

I need to suspend disbelief that a teen who fights for his life against criminals (you know what those people do, right?) would still accept to be treated like a regular highschooler. People get emancipated for less in the real world.

I need to suspend my disbelief that criminals would give up their anonymity - their biggest advantage, bar none - for 'reasons.'

I need to suspend my disbelief why wouldn't the government just clamp down on these para-military organizations with people that can level cities - or allow them to form in the first place - rather than creating a special police unit, at least.

There is a reason why the state is the monopoly of violence.

But every time this gets brought up, including rational, people come out of the woodwork to defend this genre tripe.

I was /rude/, but I wasn't wrong.
