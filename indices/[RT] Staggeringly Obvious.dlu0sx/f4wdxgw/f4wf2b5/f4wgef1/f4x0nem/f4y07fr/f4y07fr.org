  Of course, even if you do have kryptonite, with this approach you'd end up attacking a guy who is actually immune to kryptonite, probably packing a gun, and has Superman available to provide immediate assistance.

You're a supervillain with kryptonite. I imagine you're going to do more than just throw an unpowered punch at the dude while waving a green rock in his face. Anyone that is looking to pick a fight with Goose or Superman will crush a baseline human like an insect.
