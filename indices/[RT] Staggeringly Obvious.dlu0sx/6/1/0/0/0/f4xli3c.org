Yeah, considering that the Masculine Mongoose explicitly has "meta powers," it's more likely to be a situation where if you tried to put a bullet through the secret identity's skull, you'd expect to end up with a flattened bullet than a dead hero (and that would have been an excellent decoy to run at some point: set up a fake assassination attempt that Bruce Kent inexplicably walks away from without any injury).

If the hero were Bruce Wayne, or Tony Stark, or Oliver Queen, on the other hand, and was just a badass normal with some high-tech toys, then this ploy would carry a much higher risk of backfiring, because assassinating the "millionaire playboy" would seem to be a workable way of ridding yourself of the hero.
