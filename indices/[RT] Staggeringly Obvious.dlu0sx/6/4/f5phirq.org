Depends on what the Goose's powers and defences are. If the Goose is like Superman, then little point in a surprise attack other than making him even angrier at you. If he's more like Batman, maybe, but also depends on how many defences Kent has. He's supposed to be a millionaire so you'll expect his house to be a fortress (in fact it's necessary to keep up the fiction; it would make him more suspicious as a potential Goose, which is exactly what the real one wants).

Of course, in general, in a rational world, any superhero at all who's not some kind of abso-fucking-lutely invulnerable would simply die in action way before the villains get the chance to start pondering other attack strategies.
