I want a comic world where Peter Parker joined the police academy after Uncle Ben died. A world in which he reveals his amazing spider-powers to his superiors and training officer. He joins SWAT and foils the kinds of crimes that involve criminal organizations, standoffs, holdups with hostages, or metahumans with powers.

Others join him in legit law enforcement, or make their place in industry and tech. There are one-off vigilantes, the occasional good Samaritan, but largely, it becomes clear that Powered crime pays even less than normal crime because of the world of hurt that will descend on you.
