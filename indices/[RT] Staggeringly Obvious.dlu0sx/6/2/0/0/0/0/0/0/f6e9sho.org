  They don't. The Wards are explicitly forbidden from going into situations more dangerous than the PRT thinks they can reasonably deal with. They're used primarily for patrol and PR events, with supervision

Oh yeah, it's totally not an issue then. Man man, with the power of buying a gun, totally won't spray lead hell on the bunch of them.

  It's only in a shithole like Brockton Bay that they actually see real violence on a regular basis

Are you retarded? All it takes is a multiple people shooting at kids and one of them is bound to die. There is no situation where this is okay.

I'm sure he'll be able to stop a bullet. They're just like insects. It's not like there is kinetic force hitting him faster than his (human, per my recollections) human senses can perceive.

Truly, he is better off in a garish costume, rather than body armor, as part of a military unit.

  likewise, Browbeat has his telekinetic shield and healing ability, Aegis has redundant biology, Gallant and Kid Win have Tinker-built armor, Vista can curve bullets, and Shadow Stalker can become insubstantial.

Yes, the exceptions exist, but then you have golem, who is open to being hit by bullets. Or Skitter, who is open to being hit by bullets. Or Jack Slash, who can also be killed by the power of bullets prior to Bonesaw. And everyone is painting a target on their backs.

WHY WOULD A CRIMINAL FUCKING WEAR A COSTUME IN BRIGHT COLORS AND HAVE AN OPEN FUCKING IDENTITY INCRIMINATING HIM IN EVERY SINGLE PLACE HE GOES?

This is a retarded trope.

  A random street-level cape can't get away with being too rough, going after civilian identities, or going too far with rape or murder

Well, if I dress like man man, not broadcasting my identity I can rape the children soldiers you bring around in form fitting costumes because if I wear a condom and again, NOT BROADCAST MY FUCKING IDENTITY, I can get away with it.

'Who raped you, Jailbaiterella?' 'Oh, I don't know, a dude in a hoodie and in a mask, he was superstrong.' 'Huh, well, since he didn't broadcast his identity we can't do much.'
