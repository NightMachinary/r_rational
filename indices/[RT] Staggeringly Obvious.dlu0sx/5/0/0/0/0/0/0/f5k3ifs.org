Maybe we hang out on different parts of Twitter? I'm thinking of folks like @MasklessGeek.

One advantage of wearing a piece of the ol' supersuit while out of costume is that the suit is useful. No need to rehash the whole powers vs. tech debate, I hope I can just say that the Mongoose with tech is in at least a slightly better position than the Mongoose without tech. Can we leave it at that? If something comes up while he's out of costume he's got to be more comfortable having a bit of his gear. I'm not saying I would've been able to call it before we saw it, but considering how much effort he must've put into his costume it shouldn't be a huge surprise that he prefers to wear something like it even when he's out of costume.

And the other advantage which we just saw is that it gives him (semi-)plausible deniability. It is decidedly not "proof" of his identity, just another in a long line of hints; everyone (correctly) sees the Smart Guy's gambit as a failure despite revealing Bruce's "bulletproof undershirt." I don't know if the Masculine Mongoose envisioned this exact sort of gunman scenario (though he easily could have, what with all the death threats surrounding him), but he must've figured that if he had to pull something while he was out of costume, it sure would be convenient to be able to pin it on tech rather than powers.
