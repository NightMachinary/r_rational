In /this/ case, yeah, Mask Twitter isn't unmasking anyone. But they have a /reputation/. Seriously, you give some people a veneer of anonymity, and they think they can say /anything/.

But you still haven't explained why the 'Goose would take the potentially unmasking risk of wearing a version of his supersuit under his clothes. I mean, what possible benefit does it give that's worth the potential risk of proving his identity? It /can't/ be comfort; the 'Goose may be immune to chafing, but he can surely find at least equally comfortable civilian clothes. And the 'Goose doesn't need bulletproof undershirts.
