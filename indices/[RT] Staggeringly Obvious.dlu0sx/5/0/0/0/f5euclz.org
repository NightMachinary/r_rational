The suit? No, the suit of the 'Goose is just ordinary spandex. Besides, Bruce, being the 'Goose, won't wear that in his civilian guise because that would be proof that Bruce /is/ the 'Goose and while other's lips may be loose, Bruce the 'Goose is very public in his denials of being the 'Goose.

It only looks like a super-suit because it's attached to the skin of the 'Goose. Besides, Mask Twitter is probably in breach of a dozen cases of unmasking supers, and the only reason they're not prosecuted is because none of them have any sort of decent proof. You can't trust what you read on there.
