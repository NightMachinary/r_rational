I don't know why people are getting all conspiracy theory about this.

It's ridiculous - take away the colors and the flair and suddenly most people can't even recognize the supersuit that they've seen a hundred times before.

The Goose's suit has got to be one of the most advanced garments known to man - obviously he's going to want to wear something similar when he goes out as Bruce. And obviously he'll go with a copy of it that is tasteful and subdued and appropriate to wear under Mr. Kent's formalwear.

Mask Twitter has been all over this. If the logic of it all doesn't have you convinced yet, then go look up the thread comparing images of the "damage" that MM's suit took when he got rocked by the Piper with the pictures of Bruce's new "bullet wounds". Same suit, different color.
