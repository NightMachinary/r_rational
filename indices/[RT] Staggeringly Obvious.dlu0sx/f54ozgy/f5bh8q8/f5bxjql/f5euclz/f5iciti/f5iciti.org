We're not talking about an unmasking here, just sorting out the Undershirt Conundrum. And in this case everyone else is making up convoluted stories while the folks on Twitter quickly settled on the one simple straightforward explanation.

We already saw what Bruce has to say about his super undershirt and he went with the "we happen to have the same tailor" defense. No one bought it for a second, but you know the drill - Bruce's denials don't have to be at all convincing, it just has to be impossible for any of us to pin things down definitively.
