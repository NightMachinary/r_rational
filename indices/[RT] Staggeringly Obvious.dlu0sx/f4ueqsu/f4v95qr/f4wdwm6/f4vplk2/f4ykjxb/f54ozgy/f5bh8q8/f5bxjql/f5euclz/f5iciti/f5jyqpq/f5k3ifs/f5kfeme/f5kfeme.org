I don't actually hang out on Twitter much at all, but wasn't there that one guy who got struck by lightning just after he posted what he insisted was the Weathermaster's real identity? I seem to recall that there was quite a lot of noise about that.

And sure, the Suit is useful when the Mongoose is on the job. I won't deny that (though I'm still not sure there is any actual tech in the Suit at all). But - well, let's talk analogy for a moment. Let's say there's a professional runner. When he's running, he wears running shoes, lightweight vest, etc. And this costume is pretty good for running in. But does he wear any of this costume when he is, let's say, giving a speech at a charity event?

No. No, he does not.

Similarly, the 'Goose no doubt has made sure that his Suit is exactly what he needs when in a standoff with the Weathermaster or something. But I explicitly /don't/ agree that that makes him in any way more likely to wear the Suit in his civilian identity.

In fact, I find it hard to imagine anyone, in any job that requires particular clothing, who would continue to wear said clothing on his off hours.

And it does /not/ give him semi-plausible deniability. If anything, it strengthens the case for Bruce being the 'Goose - not that that needed strengthening in the first place.
