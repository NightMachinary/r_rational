  The fact that they're putting kids in the frontlines to prevent crime, in bright costumes, for one?
#+end_quote

They don't. The Wards are explicitly forbidden from going into situations more dangerous than the PRT thinks they can reasonably deal with. They're used primarily for patrol and PR events, with supervision. It's only in a shithole like Brockton Bay that they actually see real violence on a regular basis, and it's only when the world is literally ending that they're put on the actual front lines of a conflict. Besides which, the costumes' showiness or lack thereof is kind of immaterial in the kinds of conflicts capes get into. Only for the extremely street-level capes, like the protagonist, are the costumes made to be camouflaged and combat-practical, and for most capes use of camouflage is rendered rather pointless by their powers. It's either redundant or completely blown the second they employ their powers.

  'Oh, I'm clockblocker, I can stop time with my hands.' - Try and stop a hail from a machine gun.
#+end_quote

Clockblocker could stop time for objects touching anywhere near his skin, not just using his hands. He was capable of freezing entire clouds of insects swarming his body, all simultaneously. It didn't really help him in that case, but a machine gun probably /wouldn't/ be able to harm him if he was on his guard. Likewise, Browbeat has his telekinetic shield and healing ability, Aegis has redundant biology, Gallant and Kid Win have Tinker-built armor, Vista can curve bullets, and Shadow Stalker can become insubstantial. Not that the Wards would be sent into a situation where a machine gun was even in play in the first place; the Wards were never used against Coil's gun-wielding mercenaries, for example. That's not to say a human with a gun is useless in the setting; Miss Militia's one of the better heroes in the city and her power is essentially just “guns, but with unlimited ammo.” Likewise, Coil's aforementioned mercenaries acquit themselves rather well, but people with guns are by no means an excessively dominant or insurmountable force in the setting, for mostly sound reasons.

  The 'super code' for another? Why would villains even bother with that nonsense.
#+end_quote

The “Unwritten Rules” are a thin veneer that binds the weak and not the powerful. It's discarded the second it's no longer advantageous to use as a cudgel. Coil, for example, outed the entire white supremacist gang, root and branch, when it behooved him to do so. A random street-level cape can't get away with being too rough, going after civilian identities, or going too far with rape or murder, lest the other parahuman villains and heroes gang up against them, but established powerful capes like Oni Lee, Hookwolf, and Lung can rape and murder all they want, because everyone else already wants to stop them anyway, but simply aren't strong enough to.
