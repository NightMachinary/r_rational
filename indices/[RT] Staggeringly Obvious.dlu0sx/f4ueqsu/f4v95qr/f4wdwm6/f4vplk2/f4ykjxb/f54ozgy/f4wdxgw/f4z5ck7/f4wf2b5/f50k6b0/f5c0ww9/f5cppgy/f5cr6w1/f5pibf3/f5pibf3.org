Not saying it's rational overall, but in My Hero Academia heroes are adults (well, the protagonists are teenagers but they're in school, do the occasional internship, and it's just generally accepted that in order to get good you need to start training early, like we do now for sports, so a bit of danger is par for the course) and they're basically private contractors that work next to the government. It's suggested that at least part of the reason why they exist is that, well, superhero fiction existed in this world and thus as soon as powers started appearing vigilantism sprung up. Then it was brought under control after some very messy years and the current status quo is a bit of a compromise. Still, powers are regulated and registered and can't be used without a governmental license, at least in Japan. There's almost no secret identities, heroes are more like celebrities, with the exception of All Might who has a secret that goes beyond just being a hero (his power is transferable). We haven't seen any example of villains attacking heroes at home, but they /have/ attacked UA school, and the school itself has security measures to try and prevent that. It helps that powers are relatively limited, there's generally no city or planet busters just going around willy-nilly (well, arguably, in the manga Tomura might be one now). A bullet is a bullet and will still kill most villains. Plus multiple teachers at school are also pro heroes.

I think that overall makes more or less sense. The existence of heroes is a compromise between the fact that superpowers exist, some are combat oriented, and they're very useful to apprehend superpowered criminals, and a bit of show business thrown in which makes these figures much flashier than they need to be. There's a lot of stress on public image and the rhetoric surrounding heroes. All Might was "the Symbol of Peace" and his disappearance has literally caused such widespread social turmoil it has come with its own surge in crime. Heroes, in this picture, are charismatic figures, not just average law enforcers.
