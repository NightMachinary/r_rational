  And the association which holds them all is the government. That's my point.

Isn't that basically what it is anyway? I mean, them being private simply means they have some degree of autonomy. But they're still tied to the government. We haven't seen much of MHA's politics (perhaps a bit too touchy a topic to go into in a WSJ series). But I mean, come on, whoever All Might said "this candidate is my man" of would have won ALL the elections ever.

That said, yeah, superheroes are kinda dumb, or at least they are if they're the major use of powers in a setting. I could imagine someone using their powers for fighting, and even wanting to be considered more special than the regular police forces, but they would be immersed in a society in which powers play a much larger scale transformative role.
