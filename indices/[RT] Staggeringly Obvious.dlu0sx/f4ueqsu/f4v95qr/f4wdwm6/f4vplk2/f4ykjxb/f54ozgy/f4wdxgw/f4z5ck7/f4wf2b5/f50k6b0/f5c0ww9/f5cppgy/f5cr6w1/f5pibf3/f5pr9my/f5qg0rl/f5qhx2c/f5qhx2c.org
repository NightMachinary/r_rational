  As I said, I think the justification for the existence of superheroes makes sense.

No it doesn't. As history shows us, if someone is stronger than the government, they become the government. If in japan there is an association with a guy who can make a black hole wherever he likes, he is the fucking absolute ruler of the nation, wether he overtly wants to or not. If a 'contractor' group is the government's army, they're the government, man. It's silly.

Superheroes are dumb, dumb, dumb. There are millions of better ways to apply super powered police/army sans the lack of uniform (which exists for a reason, really). Child soldiers school slice of life isn't it.

  But "growing out of manga" seems a pretty weird thing to say. There's manga of all degrees of maturity. Ever read anything by Naoki Urasawa? Or Inio Asano?

Sorry, I ate up 'shonen' for some reason.
