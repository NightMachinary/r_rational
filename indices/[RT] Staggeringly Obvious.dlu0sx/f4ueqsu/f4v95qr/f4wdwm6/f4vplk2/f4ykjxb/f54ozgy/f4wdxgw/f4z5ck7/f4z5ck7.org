I'd say it'd be rather less dangerous in a rational world than in a comic-book one. Suppose that in Worm you know that Alexandria is (her civilian identity). She probably doesn't get one assassination attempt per week in the first place. If for some reason you /are/ attempting that, why attack her civilian identity and get a hell of a lot more opprobrium for having broken the unwritten rules?
