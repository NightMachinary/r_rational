This depends on the superpowers involved. For example, if you want to get rid of Superman, attacking Clark Kent is always a bad idea unless you happen have kryptonite. Of course, even if you do have kryptonite, with this approach you'd end up attacking a guy who is actually immune to kryptonite, probably packing a gun, and has Superman available to provide immediate assistance.
