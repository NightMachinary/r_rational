As I said, I think the justification for the existence of superheroes makes sense. Other aspects of the manga aren't rational at all. For starters, these are squishy humans fighting superpowered battles. They'd be dead at their first clash.

And you're right, those powers are ridiculously OP and munchkinable with some serious thought. There's some mention of using powers for work purposes - though you still need a license. I think Ochako (the girl who makes stuff weightless by touching it) mentions wanting to help with her parents' construction company, and Yaoyorozu (the one who makes stuff out of her skin) says something about there being rules to prevent people like her from breaking the economy - which implies they HAVE thought about her powers, they've just come to the extremely stupid decision that she should not use them for fear of depreciating the goods she'd make. I premised that I didn't think the work as a whole was rational.

But "growing out of manga" seems a pretty weird thing to say. There's manga of all degrees of maturity. Ever read anything by Naoki Urasawa? Or Inio Asano?
