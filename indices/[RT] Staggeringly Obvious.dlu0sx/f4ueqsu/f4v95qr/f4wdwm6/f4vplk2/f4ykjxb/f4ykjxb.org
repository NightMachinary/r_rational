The "Fans!" webcomic had a storyline ( the arc in question began at [[http://www.faans.com/books1-6/index.php?p=357]] ) that does something like the premise indicated -- though the implementation is not the same.

Most relevant page (which explains the background and spoils the mystery) is probably [[http://www.faans.com/books1-6/index.php?p=388][this]].

  Some kind of magic /talisman/. It doesn't grant /wishes/... It grants /wants./ /One/ want.

  I got a hold of it at a, um, journalist's convention, and it turned out I secretly wanted to be known as a hero.

  Shortly thereafter, an /alien/ landed at my feet. He took his face from /mine/... and the rest from the kind of hero I thought would /please/ people.

  Now he's a cultural /god,/ everyone thinks he's me, and I can't bring myself to tell them otherwise.

  /God/, I hate him.
