I don't recall an exact case offhand, but for something related, there is Helmuth, of the Lensman series, who "speaks for Boskone" but the rank and file have never encountered actual Boskone, and the protagonist becomes convinced that Boskone is a fiction and it's all just Helmuth. The council of Boskone totally exists, they're just operating from another galaxy.
