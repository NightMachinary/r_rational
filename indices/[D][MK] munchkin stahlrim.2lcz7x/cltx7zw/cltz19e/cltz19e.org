There is the point that any mage in nirn outputs a lot more energy than their caloric intake allows. One master in destruction magic with perks on enhanced flames could outperform any other fuel for a generator, and the flame or storm thrall spell would do the same without the need to be there yourself all day long. The transmute spell shows the magic can easily create or destroy mass (lump of gold with same volume as iron lump) with a simple adept level spell! There is no spell crafting in skyrim but in other TES there was, so it is not beyond imagination a modified transmute lead to uranium-235 or whatever. stalhrim is consistently about 15% stronger than skyforge steel (the strongest steel in the realm which I will take as average modern steel) so you have a plentiful building material that is about 9 times less dense than steel, I'm thinking boats, skyscrapers, heck maybe even space elevators (the stalhrim bow demonstrates it can be ductile).
