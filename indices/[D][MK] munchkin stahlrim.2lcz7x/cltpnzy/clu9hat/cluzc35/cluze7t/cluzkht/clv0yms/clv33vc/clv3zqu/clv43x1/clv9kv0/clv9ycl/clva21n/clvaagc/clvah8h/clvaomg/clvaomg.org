  The game crashes sometimes because the world is insane and there's no fourth wall.

That whole thing came from a single blogpost that anyone who actually has a say in the game's lore has either failed to acknowledge or outright stated is false. Other than that... yeah, most of that makes some assumptions that aren't quite right. The "anything can happen" kind of thing can also be said about many worlds with not-too-fleshed-out magic systems; you could easily write something that's very rule-based in ES mythology, and most crazy things tend to have a common source. It would actually be a /very/ interesting thing to write rational fic for, huh.
