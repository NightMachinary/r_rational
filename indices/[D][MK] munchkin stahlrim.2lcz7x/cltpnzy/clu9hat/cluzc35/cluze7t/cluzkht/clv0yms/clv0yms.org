He unjungled Cyrodiil and he was an absurdly high-level Voice user. He ascended to godhood, whatever that means. I'm not getting a good clear picture of what he can and can't do. I'm particularly interested to hear if he did anything interesting after ascending. If not then it's doubtful what it means to say he did or didn't become a god.

Mankar Camoran is pretty crazy and I was under the general impression that a lot of the stuff he said was contradicted by earlier lore.
