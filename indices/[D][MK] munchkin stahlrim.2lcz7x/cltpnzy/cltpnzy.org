CHIM is a state of being reachable by mortals allowing them to become akin to gods.

Potion of intelligence enhancing loop. From the enhancement potions you can go from a normal human to a paragon to a god in under a hour. You don't have to limit yourself to just intelligence either. Even without the potions there are ways to make scrolls that enhance mortals to near impossible levels of skill and ability as demonstrated by the scrolls of Icarian Flight. Magical suits of predator level camo. The whole system is rife with ways to cheat built in.
