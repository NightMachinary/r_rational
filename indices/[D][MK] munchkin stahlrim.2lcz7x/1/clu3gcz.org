TES magic is already exploited to hell and back in-universe. Let me warn you first off by saying that this is a rambling post that lists off every way of munchkinry I can get to that's related to the first topic, Numidium.

So, Numidium. The Dwemer found a way to change reality through sounds and called it Tonal Architecture. They used this to make a giant robot and a trio of tools used to manipulate the Heart of Lorkhan, the literal heart of a dead God. When Kagrenac used his Tools on the Heart, the entire Dwemer race disappeared and became the golden skin of the Numidium.

The Numidium's very nature makes its word fact; unfortunately for reality, much of what it says is *NO*. The Numidium is also used for other purposes; it was held by the Tribunal, a set of 3 gods, all of whom reached godhood through exploiting the Heart of Lorkhan and one of whom reached further godhood elsewhere (more munchkinry...). Tiber Septim used the threat of unleashing it to force the Second Aldmeri Dominion to surrender to him and join his Empire.

A warning about the following paragraph: I'm reciting this from memory and have no idea where a few chunks of it came from; however, AFAIK the end result is about the same.

Tiber Septim's munchkin as hell, too. Born a Breton in High Rock/Born a Nord in High Rock named Hjalti Early-Beard/Born a Nord in Atmora named Talos, he rose to power in the ranks of Cuhlecain with the help of Ysmir Wulfharth, who earlier had been shouted to pieces by the Greybeards but still lives on as a shade/storm of sorts. Wulfharth was a Shezzarine, an incarnation of Lorkhan/Shezzar/Shor; he could also shout like nobody else, once having his shout turn everyone in Skyrim into babies. Wulfharth and Tiber's power combined were great, and he became known as the Stormcrown due to the way Wulfharth appeared in. Cuhlecain was eventually murdered by a High Rock nightblade... which fits Hjalti/Talos/Ysmir/Tiber well.

After Cuhlecain's death, Tiber began taking places over himself. His supreme shouting ability from being Dovahkiin combined with Wulfharth's supreme shouting ability and the fact that /both/ are incarnations of Shezzar/Shor/Lorkhan makes the invasion quite a force, even beating out such people as Vivec (the deal they made is not known exactly, but Tiber somehow manages to get the Numidium out of it; Vivec is later known to claim that he killed Talos). He eventually achieved CHIM, a state of something resembling, but greater than godhood attained through deep understanding of the universe (and its nature as the dream of Anu the Amaranth); he also underwent an Enantiomorph, a mythologically significant story involving 3 people, where they are all difficult to tell apart (thus why you get the Underking claiming he's Zurin Arctus in person but claiming he's Wulfharth in the book he wrote, which is named after Arctus) and which creates a God. This made him a God 4 times over. Munchkiny as hell. The only person who was ever even remotely able to stand up to him was Cyrus, who insists that he is not the HoonDing.

Speaking of which, sound-magic in general. Cyrus learned Sword-Singing and claimed to know the Pankratosword, a technique in which the sword is made so sharp and swung so precisely that it cuts /atomos/, creating devastating power. Yokuda was sunk through this. The Thu'um is something most TES players will know well, but its true power isn't even remotely shown in-game. At one point, Orkey (a weird amalgam of Trinimac, Malacath and Arkay, it seems) took the lifespan of the Nord people and gave it to the Orsimer, the Orcs. Wulfharth got it back with the shout "What Happens When You Shake the Dragon Just So", which gave all of the Nords... a bit /too much/ youth. Tonal Architecture is somewhat self-explanatory. Akatosh was created by the Marukhati Selective by standing atop Adamantine tower and singing the song that is the Aurbis... then switching the tune to one with a Man-loving time-god (the primary time-god "before" Akatosh was Auri-El, who is very, very Mer).

And that's all the windbag I have for today.

EDIT: /Atomos/ is not a typo, it's how it's spelled in-universe. Physics work differently in TES.
