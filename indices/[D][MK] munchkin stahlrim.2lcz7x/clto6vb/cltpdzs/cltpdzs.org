In Skyrim, they got smart and integrated recursive self-improvement into their design - you can still do it ([[http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Forum:Skyrim:Alchemy/Enchanting_Loop][potions-enchant loop]]), but you cap out relatively quickly. Of course, people figured out how to break it anyways - afaik the Fortify Restoration part of the loop was /not/ planned for, so it's rather imbalanced.
