You could literally do an intelligence explosion in Morrowind. It went like this:

1. Buy up the ingredients for a bunch of Fortify Intelligence potions.
2. Make lots of crappy intelligence potions.
3. Drink the best one, sell the rest, buy more ingredients.
4. Enhanced intelligence lets you make better potions (stronger, longer lasting, worth more).
5. Better potions further enhance your intelligence.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you are the smartest creature on the planet.

The game wasn't really designed with that in mind, since it broke pretty much everything. Once your intelligence was orders of magnitude higher than the game anticipated (in the millions instead of the double digits), your potion-making was also so good that any potion you made would last essentially indefinitely, so you could make a potion of Strength which would let you kill a god with a rusty spoon, or a potion of camouflage that would make you invisible, and these enhancements would be so good that they'd never run out. Permanent flight, the ability to leap across continents - basically do everything to the integer limits of the engine.

This could all be accomplished within the first half hour in the game - I discovered it on accident, and then had to reload from a save because stomping around in god-mode wasn't terribly fun.
