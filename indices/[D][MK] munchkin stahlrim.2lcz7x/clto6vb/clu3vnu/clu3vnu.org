If you're looking for stuff that should be possible in-game if it was a narrative about a rational protagonist instead of a videogame:

- Undead and summons can do useful work beyond simply attacking your enemies. There's no reason that anyone should be doing farmwork (or factory work) when that can be delegated to minions. That frees up more people to study magic, who can then use it for labor.
- Almost all of the forms of magic have practical applications. Flame magic can power a steam engine. Frost magic can preserve perishables (and on a large enough scale, probably make ice ships). Shock magic essentially produces free energy.
- There should be soul trapping farms, and dangerous creatures raised in captivity for their souls. Enchanting is ridiculously powerful.
- Very few people seem to have defenses against invisibility or 100% camouflage, which indicates that they're not really prepared against intelligent foes.
- Given magic, there's no real reason that there should be torches, since magic gives you permanent light for much cheaper (going by in-game prices, anyway).
- The ability to transmute mineral ores makes metals worth only marginally different prices (though this doesn't seem to be reflected by in-game prices).
