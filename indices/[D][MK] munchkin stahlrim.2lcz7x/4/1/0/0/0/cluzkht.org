[[http://www.imperial-library.info/content/many-headed-talos][From the Many-Headed Talos]]. An out-of-game Michael Kirkbride text, but the part that's actually relevant to CHIM was quoted directly in Skyrim by Heimskr. CHIM literally means "Royalty", and can be found in other things, such as CHIM-EL ADABAL, the Amulet of Kings.

The [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Mythic_Dawn_Commentaries][Mythic Dawn Commentaries]] also mentions CHIM; the entire third volume appears to be about it. "CHIM. Those who know it can reshape the land. Witness the home of the Red King Once Jungled." refers to the event mentioned in the Many-Headed Talos up there.
