They've got a patch for that, though; the time god's insane and the space god's dead. Time god's insane because he was created by an ape and his cronies, not to mention all the shit that keeps breaking him. It's not just a patch, either; they didn't just make that up for Daggerfall's weird ending, it's used all over the place. All of Elder Scrolls Online has an assumption that Akatosh is having an episode, thus the books from the future showing up all over. Morrowind has at least one book from the future (funnily enough, "The Dragon Break Re-Examined", which is explicitly about the phenomenon of the dragon break not existing). Oblivion's ending involves a dragon break, though only really on retrospect will you realize (there's a speech that takes place that could not possibly have happened given events that transpired immediately prior). Skyrim has a dragon break as part of the main plot, and you learn a shout from it.

What separates lame handwaves and interesting plot points is exploitation, and I'd say the ES writers are pretty damn good at it.
