Eventually I plan on writing one, but I have two more in the works first and not as much free time as I used to. Title: Nevervarine. Something initially like Morrowind but sidetracking into something radically different and sorting out a lot of lore stuff along the way while attempting to minimize the number of in-game sources who are simply lying or mistaken.

  That whole thing came from a single blogpost that anyone who actually has a say in the game's lore has either failed to acknowledge or outright stated is false.

At least we agree on that much. It's frustrating and time-consuming to explain why it doesn't work.

The anything-can-happen-ness is too high for my liking. It's higher than other canons. It seems to actively enjoy being directly inconsistent with itself and logically impossible (according to some lore people), but all the sources are in-universe and therefore potentially propaganda or mistaken so there should be a minimally complicated true timeline of events that explains the sources claiming the claims they claim. It will still be complicated but hopefully not absurdly complicated.

Poorly explained magic systems aren't so bad when there are limits implicit from the fact that some powerful wizard didn't just explode all their enemies or rewrite the universe optimally along their objective function. The power level of TES magic / gods is high enough to be very problematic without understandable rules. It leads to anything-can-happen-ness.
