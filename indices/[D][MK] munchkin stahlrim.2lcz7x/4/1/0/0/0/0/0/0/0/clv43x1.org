Voice stuff can turn an entire race into (literal) babies. Shouldn't count that out. Seriously, alternative explanations abound for pretty much everything. One writer in Elder Scrolls Online has a book saying that the "transcription error" idea is foolish and easily disproven and that Cyrodiil changing from jungle to upland is due to White-Gold's extreme mythological significance changing the land to whatever is most suited to the local rulers (which had been humans for ~3500 years at that point).
