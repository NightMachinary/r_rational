The point is that with the standard interpretation of ES lore in place, essentially anything can happen. That guy turned into a cow because the world is insane. The game crashes sometimes because the world is insane and there's no fourth wall. The main plot has a plothole because the world is insane. This girl has plot-induced stupidity about her powers because the world is insane. This logically impossible thing happened because the world is insane.

If anything can happen then nothing is interesting. It's just arbitrary. I am still hoping that some kind of rules can be deduced, if only by coincidence, and the rest of the sources can be discounted as in-story characters being mistaken or actively lying.
