He unjungled Cyrodiil through CHIM, not absurd voice use (though he may have been able to do that...). The usage of the term "I breathe now, in /royalty/" combined with Camoran's saying it's CHIM (the latter I wouldn't take as a source, but it bolsters the former) makes it more likely CHIM than Thu'um.
