Tiber Septim also had CHIM, and there /is/ credible evidence of his feats through that (ridiculous amount of pre-Tiber literature talking about the jungle climes of Cyrodiil).

EDIT: Mankar Camoran also speaks of CHIM and uses Tiber Septim's usage of it as a specific example of the things it can do.
