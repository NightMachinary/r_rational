CHIM is BS made up by Vivec to cover for the fact that the religion he founded around himself and his two best buddies has gods that were awkwardly mortal before they borrowed the power of Lorkhan. 99% of the sources on Vivec are either Vivec himself or his worshippers. There is essentially no credible evidence of any of his feats.
