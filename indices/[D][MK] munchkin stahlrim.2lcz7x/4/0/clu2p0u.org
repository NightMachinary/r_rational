  CHIM is a state of being reachable by mortals allowing them to become akin to gods.

It's not just intelligence, however; there's more to it than that, most certainly. I don't think potions could help you with that. While the intelligence enhancing loop might help you study and meditate, it likely won't help you mentally prepare for CHIM, which is described often as a constant battle to keep your existence around.
