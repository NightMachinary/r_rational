Not quite what you've requested, but /The King Must Die/ by Mary Renault is a great novel about Theseus which sets his life in historical Ancient Greece. It takes all the magical elements of the myth and translates them into plausible real-world events. Really awesome portrait of Ancient Greece, and a great story to boot.
