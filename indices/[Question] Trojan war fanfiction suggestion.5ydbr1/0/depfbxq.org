Not a fanfic, but the 'Troy' trilogy by David & Stella Gemmell is rather good. I wouldn't classify it as fully rational, but it's definitely got a few rational-style changes made to the original story. If you know the story of Troy, this shouldn't be a major spoiler, but it's an example of the sort of thing I mean: [[#s][Trojan Horse]]

It's been a few years since I last read it, but I remember enjoying it rather a lot.
