Somehow this is the exact sort of scenario that pays homage to the plots/plans from the original Animorph books while still being rational. I'm very very impressed that you managed to reconcile and still keep the original animorphs "flavor". Kudos to you, this is extremely good writing and if you ever publish anything I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

Keep up the good work, you're awesome and this story is awesome.

Quick question, is this story going to be reaching a final showdown sooner rather than later, or are we going to see more of this universe before the finale?
