It doesn't detect the direction or the distance of the signal, only that there is a signal.

The way it works is: there is a huge Z-space anomaly somewhere around the Earth. When something emits a Z-space pulse, the pulse hits the anomaly and bounces back to Earth. The detector uses the delay between the echoes to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration][trilaterate]] the signal's origin.
