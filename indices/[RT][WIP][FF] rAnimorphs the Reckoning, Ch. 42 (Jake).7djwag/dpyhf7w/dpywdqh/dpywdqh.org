Yeah, Jake's been hardest hit. In particular, Jake and Rachel are the only two left who lost significant chunks of their family (Marco has his dad, Tobias and Garrett have each other), and Jake doesn't quite have the steely set-it-aside that Rachel does. Plus, people keep looking to him for direction, and he keeps blaming himself for every failure ...

I think if Marco knew about Jake and Rachel's shoulder-Marco, his main reaction would be "about damn time."

It's very subtle, but the intended interpretation was that /Jake/ was going to do something about his "addiction" ... that that goodbye was at least him /trying/ to say goodbye-for-good.

Your thinking matches mine re: what V3 knows, what Telor knows. I'm imagining this probably isn't actually a death-knell for peace talks and negotiations, but that other events might outpace those as a result.

I don't think that's going to last.
