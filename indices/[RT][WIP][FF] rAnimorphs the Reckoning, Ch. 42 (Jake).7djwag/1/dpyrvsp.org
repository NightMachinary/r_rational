I woke up this morning to a surprise r!Animorphs chapter. Today will be a good day.

This chapter was superbly written and riveting as usual.

According to K.A. Applegate, author of the original series, Animorphs was always fundamentally a war story. Now that aspect is really starting to show through. Jake is starting to get war-weary. As he becomes emotionally exhausted, his empathy is diminishing and his attitude towards violence more callous. This plays out clearly in the scene between him and Cassie. In the original series, as I recall, Jake did some pretty brutal things in the end, like sending tons of reserve animorphs on a suicide mission, and ejecting a defenseless Yeerk pool into space. Or, you know, [[#s][major original series spoilers]]. Jake and Cassie have a falling out at the end of Applegate's series, but in The Reckoning, the Jake/Cassie dynamic is taking a significantly more disturbing turn. I'm wondering if Jake, unable to live with himself in the end, will sacrifice himself to resurrect Cassie.

It rubs me the wrong way that the Animorphs decided to betray everyone during the Telor deal, as opposed to waiting and seeing what happens and having a backup plan in case things go wrong. From their perspective, I think they should have calculated that teaming up with Telor was the best way to kill Visser 3, not stealing a bug fighter and trying to do it themselves. That should have been their backup plan after the betrayal, not plan A. Unless "plan A" was their backup plan, and otherwise they would have waited to see how the deal played out. I guess they didn't have many options, and bringing in a Chee was the best way they could think of to ensure success in a wide variety of possible outcomes.

Anyway, I'm super excited for the insanity that's going to happen pretty soon in the story. Hey TK, whenever you're thinking to yourself "I should be out doing important stuff in the real world rather than writing this story," keep in mind that getting people excited about the rationalist community via good fiction /is/ part of saving the world. As others have said before, this story is not even slightly embarrassing to recommend to people.
