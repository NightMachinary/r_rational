Having read a lot of Applegate and Michael Grant interviews and AMAs: nope, definitely mostly a cash-grab. They said on several occasions that they were doing it in large part for the money, and that the ghostwritten era being terrible was mostly their fault.

Maybe cash-grab is the wrong term. What I mean is, it was way more high concept and improvised than thematic. To paraphrase what they said about their thought process: "We need to sell lots of book to pays the bills! What's something we'd like to write about? Sci-fi! Also, animals! Okay, now we need villains. Those mind-control slugs from Star Trek! Now let's keep stealing stuff from Star Trek and see what works!" The graphic violence, real-world parallels and PTSD stuff happened organically, because that's how these two write stories.

And for the record, cash-grabs can be fun too, and lead to engaging storyverses! Just look at Stargate. (or, arguably, Star Wars)
