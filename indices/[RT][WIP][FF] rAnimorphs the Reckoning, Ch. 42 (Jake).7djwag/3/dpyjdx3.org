This chapter is awesome. I cannot wait for the next one, which I'm sure is going to be just as awesome. The writing style is engaging. The characterisation is so good that each character, and perhaps more importantly each character's opinion on each other (How Jake sees Marco Vs. How Rachel sees Marco) is unique.

I especially like how Marco and Cassie have, essentially, become opposites as far as their perceived position in the group is. Rachel morph clones Marco when she wants a rational, cold, perhaps a little cruel assessment of her own behaviour/situations. Meanwhile, Jake morph clones Cassie when he wants an ethical evaluation of future plans. Brilliant!

And even better the readers gets these two scenes as perfect juxtapositions of Marco and Cassie. Marco, always thinking, to the point where he most easily rationalises brutal/cruel/coldly rational decisions, and can sometimes even miss a nicer alternative (similarly to how Professor Quirrel also fails to see solutions that involve being nice to people), while Cassie, with her ability to ignore the current situation to unfailingly fallback on her moral code, may have gotten herself killed, but also manages to never transgress past the ethical boundaries she'd set for herself.

All in all, I'm loving it! And I can't wait to see how Jake and Rachel would react to finding out they were morph clones being used by someone else in need of a new perspective :)
