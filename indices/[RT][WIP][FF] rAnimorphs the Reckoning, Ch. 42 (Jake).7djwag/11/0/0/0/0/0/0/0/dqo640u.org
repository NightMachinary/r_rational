You know the position of the earth and the sun. You then get a ping from the primary signal, and then a long blurred out secondary signal that could be deconvolved using the delay after the primary signal and the assumption of spherical symmetry and the Earth's offset to give a distance to the sun and an angle to the Earth/Sun line. Might still only confine you to a circle of a given radius centered on a point on the Earth/Sun line, but if that circle overlaps with the planet Mars, or a point on Earth's surface...
