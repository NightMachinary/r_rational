Yay! I am whole again! Let feedback rain like a shower of happy thoughts!

- Wow, Jack is /not/ doing okay. It sounds like he's been hit way harder than anyone else. He really really needs emergency vacations. (or to reset himself into a less-stressed version of himself a few weeks ago, with all the obvious problems)

- Apparently now everyone has a mini-Marco in their head who keeps calling them idiots. Wonder how he feels / would feel about that.

- I hope that at some point someone takes the time to address the "Jake is getting addicted to mind-raping Cassie" problem. Like, the fact that I even had to write this sentence shows how ridiculously downhill this particular thread is going.

- Jake is being unfair to Cassie, which I guess is the point. He could have gotten better advice / moral commentary if he'd given her more specific information on what they're trying to do.

- Maybe the Animorphs should all have a specific "If I'm waking up in this situation / at this date, it means I'm dead and I shouldn't was time asking redundant questions" morph-form. It's starting to get necessary.

- I love the whole negotiation scene between Tyagi, Dragar and Elaine Gallagher. The way she freaks out when freed and the government agents just roll with it is chilling. (I wonder how she reacted to the Yeerks stunning everyone)

- I wonder how they found the guy who ends up as a potentially permanent Controller. Recruitment process must have been interesting.

- Jake makes a callback to the scene where he left Tom under a forcefield to deal with the Ax crisis. And... yeah, I'm glad he does. It was kind of a monumental dick move to do that.

- Stealing the Bug Fighter is a pretty clever plan! It didn't even occur to me they could do that. It's mostly reversible (the crew will know about the Chee unless they kill them) since they can always give the ship back, they're acting against orders, which means they're /probably/ not endangering relationships too hard like they would if Tyagi had ordered it, and it kiiiiiind of neutralizes the Andalite threat (unless the Andalites have planetary shields, which I suspect they have). Honestly, I was expecting something way more evil.

- Bonus: they can keep the stolen ship, and give Telor the ship Visser 3 gave them, and they basically have no way to complain about it.

- Wow, Yeerk history sounds metal. Also, surprisingly poetic in an translated language :p

- /Heir to the Empire/ reference spotted :D (it pinged for me mostly because Rukh appeared in Star Wars Rebels recently)

- As soon as it was mentioned that Tyagi showed up in person, I thought she might be a fake. Way too many reasons to not send the real one.

- Now there are three Tyagis around! Sort of. The "copying the President" thing is getting to be a security nightmare.

- Not sure why Tyagi asks for what time is it? She already knows about the morph armor, she'd have to know about it for the negotiations. Unless Tyagi set up morph!Tyagi in some way, which would be pretty metal but implausible.

- One thing they could do is give morph!Tyagi the morphing power, and have her morph-lock into Foster, assuming they kept a "back-up" of him around. This is a great plan with absolutely no vaguely horrifying parts in it. But yeah, it's not so bad after all, Jake!

- Keeping track of every "I know you know I know" element is getting complicated, and I think Jake is starting to slip up on that front. More on that later.

- Wait, is Jake planning to use the bug Fighter they just risked everything to acquire to just jump at Visser 3? Not sure I like where this is going.

- Honestly, I think by that point Visser 3 might be beyond the Animorphs' power to handle. There are way to many deadman switches he could have, pandemics he's delaying, armies of clones / horcruxes he's keeping, etc. At that point it's more logistics than tactics. This is getting more of a job for the US military + Telor.

So, the biggest question now is, who knows what?

First off, what does Visser 3 know? I'm going to guess: not much. He probably has his own plans right now, but I think he's probably too focused on his own projects, the North-Korean invasion, Kandrona, Silat, etc, to be paying the extensive attention he'd need to be aware of Telor's move. Unleeeess he has a way of spying on them that they can't detect (but I don't think so; when he used the Leeran on the yeerk Telor gave him, all he had was generic "newborn" data, not data from the central Telor intelligence).

What does Telor know? Well, first off, they had a plan in place to capture everyone at the rendez-vous. They triggered it when fake-Essak reach the Bug fighter, either because they wanted to be able to extract him, or because Tyagi mentioned the Andalite threat and they panicked. Did they know this Tyagi was a fake? They know about morphing humans, they just don't know about morph-controlling. For all they knew, maybe Tyagi was just a really convincing actor morphed into Tyagi.

Regardless, everyone on the ground has been captured, and no signal was sent. All Telor knows is that Dragar asked for an orbital strike, then their Bug Fighter made a few detours, then went silent. They're probably busy freaking out and/or having really awkward negotiations with the real Tyagi.

What does the military know? Probably everything. For some reason the Animorphs don't seem to be worried about the implications of being tracked by the US. They have no realistic way to run or hide if the US get serious about chasing them. I'm guessing that the US detected that Essak was actually someone in morph, and decided to suspend their contingency plan and let the Animorphs play their plan out once Telor double-crossed them. They're probably trying to intercept the Animorphs without being detected or triggering an international crisis.

Well, that's my thought so far. Great chapter as always!
