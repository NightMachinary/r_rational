Minor nitpick, you have used italics both for thoughts and for the excerpt that Jake is mentally remembering. I recommend that you put the excerpt in bold instead of italics to distinguish it more from the rest of the story. It feels like it would be defined better if readers see it as a piece of history rather than Jake having morbid thoughts.

Also, cheers on doing something this incredible!
