You know, I read the rules but didn't think that a write-up would count as 'my work.'

Not sure I have the patience to wait a week to read a few more chapters, so I'll probably just end up binging it then. : P

Oh well. Sorry for breaking the rules; thought I'd read them closely enough, but I guess I hadn't.
