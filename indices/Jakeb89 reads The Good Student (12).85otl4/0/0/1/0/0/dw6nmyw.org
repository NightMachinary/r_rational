I agree with the others that daily write-ups are excessive, but there must be some kind of compromise.

One possibility is going to SV/SB forums and creating a thread there. Their format is better for your purposes --- there's plenty of Let's Read threads there --- though the audience is a little different.\\
You could also try posting to Friday Off-Topic threads (such as today's).\\
As a third option, you could go to [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s [[https://discord.gg/5sutD3W][Discord]] and discuss it there on the appropriate channel, or even negotiate for the creation of some kind of #groupread channel (akin to the already-existing #groupwatch).
