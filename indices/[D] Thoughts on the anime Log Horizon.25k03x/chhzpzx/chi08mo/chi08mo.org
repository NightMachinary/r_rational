Agreed, the season ending was very weak. They seemed to have nipped the harem thing in the bud at first, by addressing the young girl's feelings for Shiro, but then they introduced the new villainess who seems to be fixated on him, which was disappointing.

I'm hoping the next season's focus sidelines that as much as possible in favor of exploring the whole Player Nation vs Player Nation concept, which has a lot of promise.
