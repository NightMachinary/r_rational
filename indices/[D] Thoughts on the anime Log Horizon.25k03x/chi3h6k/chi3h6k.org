It started well, went down the drama uber alles road pretty fast.

Aside from that, keep in mind it's an adaptation from a novel, and from what I've read it seems that the anime has been rushed quite a lot, and a few things have also been censored (quite important as well, like the whole backstory of the girl in the last episode), so as always to have the whole story it's necessary to read the original material, not the adaptation.
