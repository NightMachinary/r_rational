  "I cannot think of such disruptive change to story telling technique without going back to the middle ages".

Now all I'd like to say is that this has been done before, just not successfully, nor so mainstream.

  He's the protagonist! He just cannot die like this in the middle of the story! Ridiculous! What's the next season going to be about?

I'd also like to say that ASOIAF never really had a single Protagonist, and that's what most stories that kill off a main character are like, they either have a secondary character who is telling the story of the protagonist (who then dies half way through or something). In GoT there were a ton of chapters from other perspective.

It kind of defeats the whole "omg this is so unique he killed off the protagonist no one has done that before" when the whole point that makes that surprising is the lack of someone else to take up the mantle.

So yeah, the whole premise of this article is wrong, this isn't unique and GRRM certainly didn't invent it, though it's an interesting method of story telling. (Edit: When I started with this comment I did assume there would be more substance to the article than just praising GRRM for his uniqueness)
