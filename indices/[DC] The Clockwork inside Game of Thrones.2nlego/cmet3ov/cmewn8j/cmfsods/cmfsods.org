Not exactly this, but similar technique:

Antoni Gołubiew in his "Bolesław Chrobry" series written in 40s-50s of XXth century. It's historic fiction based on real Polish prince/king Bolesław Chrobry and real events, but it's shown from perspective of around 100 fictional and historical characters. King has not much screen time, most of the time it's a few pages of one character life, flashback from 2 years ago of different character for a few pages, etc. You are shown consequences of some decision of a king, then reasons for that decision from 3 different POVs, then the king talking with his advisor for a moment about this decision, then what happened to the farmer that escaped his lord 2 tomes ago, then back to the consequences of the decision, etc. It's rarely said when and where the story currently takes place so you have to guess basing on characters and what they know what time and place it is.

Reader associates with the side characters more than with the king, and many of them die suddenly in the middle of the book (well, historical ones die when they should, but few people know history well enough to know that). But there's many of them, so it's similar to the GoT storytelling - it always keeps attention because there are many others.

It's one of my favorite series, but I think it wasn't translated to English.
