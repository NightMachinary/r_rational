I agree. It's a fairly /rational/ fantasy in that there's no "well why can't you just use this obvious feature of the world to win everything" moment, but not a hard fantasy because fantasy elements /are/ introduced fairly willy nilly and a new totally unpredictable magical thing can appear at any time. A hard fantasy can't really have more than one or two fantastic elements, and the reader has to know about most of them at the beginning.

Even HPMOR isn't really a hard fantasy, by that standard.

But I think, when the "rational" distinction isn't made, all "rational" stuff falls into "hard" stuff simply because the stories have similar mind-feels. Both feel vaguely like a puzzle, both require an analytic mind to write, Language is fuzzy, blah blah.
