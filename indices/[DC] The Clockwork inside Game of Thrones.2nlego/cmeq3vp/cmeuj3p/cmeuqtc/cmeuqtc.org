I think there is a rigorous background structure for the magic(s), but we only learn about the principles and limits of magic when the characters do, so we're not quite at 100% comprehension yet.

Even then, I think it qualifies for its well-developed political system, history, and folklore, much in the same way as /Lord of the Rings/ does. Basically, I think the "hard" in "hard fantasy" can apply to a number of aspects, and while /ASOIAF/ might not be quite there with "hard magic", it's certainly there with "hard politics and society". You get me?
