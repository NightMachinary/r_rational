The first link has basically nothing to do with the [[/r/rational]] subreddit, and the second is mostly a rec for a story where most factions are driven by irrational motives and which is not particularly rational in any real sense IMO.

For that matter, I personally wouldn't have linked the parent article to this sub. The observations are facile, and what substance there was would be way more suited to [[/r/writing]] or some other similar sub.
