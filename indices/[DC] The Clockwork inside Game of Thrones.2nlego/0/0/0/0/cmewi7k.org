I think that a discussion of unorthodox or realistic narrative structure is always relevant to this sub -- a good part of the historical feeling of Martin's writing comes from the structure detailed in the OP, and that's definitely useful to rational fiction.

When I created this sub, I initially intended it to just be recs for the LessWrong / HPMOR crowd, regardless of the rationality of the story. That's why I added the hard scifi / hard fantasy / munchkinry / deconstruction / etc tags in the first place -- to make it accommodating for all flavors of LW-enjoyable stories. In my mind, if you don't feel like you could submit a story to this sub, but you would otherwise recommend it to the subscribers here, then that's a problem with the sub, not the story.

But. Yknow. That's just, like, my opinion, man.
