This article sort of reminded me of something else: Zalgo Jenkins wrote [[http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/4821-Notes-on-Plotting-Grail-Wars-a-k-a-If-Dan-Brown-had-written-Fate-Stay-Night][a neat little thread about the narrative structure of Dan Brown's fiction]]. It's ostensibly written to try to apply it to Fate/Stay Night fanfic, but I found it remarkable how regularly and thoroughly Brown had everything in his books set into patterns, and also how thoroughly Jenkins deconstructed and analyzed how the format of the book (pacing, high-level structure, etc) worked.

note: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3726889/Zalgo-Jenkins][Jenkins' FF.net profile]]; He is probably most known for Postnuptial Disagreements, a F/SN and Sekirei cross that was actually readable and interesting; the biggest improvement Jenkins made compared to others trying that crossover (esp. In Flight) is that he got the pacing and structure very /right/ - 88k words tells a full and complete and satisfying story quite easily when used correctly.
