Interesting that you say none of the characters do things just for the sake of plot. When I read the books, I couldn't look past Catelyn Stark. Everything she did seemed to be for the sake of plot. Sure, I understand that she was a worried mother, but it seemed to me at least that all her decisions happened to be bad in the best way to advance the plot. I didn't feel as if her back story adequately explained them/made me expect those actions, even in a retroactive aha way.

I assume some of the historical feeling comes from the fact that it is loosely based on the war of the roses. But I don't know enough of that history to say how much it is based on it.
