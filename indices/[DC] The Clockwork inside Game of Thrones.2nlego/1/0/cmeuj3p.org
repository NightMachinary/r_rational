Are you and I defining hard fantasy in different ways? To me, the fact that almost all the magic in the world of /ASOIAF/ is completely unexplained means that it can't be hard fantasy. I'd agree that the characters actions are presented well, and I never think that anyone is doing something just for the sake of plot, but the magic ...

There are about a dozen different types of magic within the world, and we only have vague rules for two or three of them. There's plenty of completely inexplicable magic happening all over the place. I would classify /ASOIAF/ as more low fantasy.
