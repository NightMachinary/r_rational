I have a weird relationship with magic. The Folding Knife is an interesting book, in that it has no magic at all. But it presents regular physical phenomena (like plagues) in a way that is akin to magic. ie: shit happens for no reason that anyone in the book can figure out. It's just there. A lot of real life is like that, right? Fiction simply gives us the illusion of things making sense, by author fiat. So if the author doesn't bother to explain the magic, any more than he would explain the mechanics of transmissible disease to a pre-modern society, does that still make it low fantasy? IMHO, as long as the magic isn't used as a Deux Ex Machina to get the protagonists OUT of trouble, it's fine.
