Pipes. Mana can be infused into physical objects and then extracted later. Turns out, the easiest way to move mana around is to put it in water and then pipe the water from one place to another.

This is actually causing some issues between the city and the country. Remember Pipeline #3 that Jess/Rob's Dad had a contract to work on? It was a 1m diameter pipe making a big loop out of the city and back again. Along the way were various stations where mana was extracted from the environment and put into the pipe, to be taken back to the city. The people and spirits who live out there were not happy about it.
