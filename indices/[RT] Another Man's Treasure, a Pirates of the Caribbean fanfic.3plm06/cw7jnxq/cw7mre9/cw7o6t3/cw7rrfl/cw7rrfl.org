Cthulhu Rae Jepsen's corollary to Yudkowsky's First Law is that you don't need to give Sauron a Death Star if Frodo's lightsaber comes with a dose of crippling illness (the longer version of the law already has that baked in, but I've always wanted to name a corollary). And we already took away Bond's women and martinis! :)

More seriously, the threats that our zombie Bond face are probably going to be people wielding the supernatural. If the British government has supernatural agents, then other countries probably do too. The later Pirates movies introduce a wacky amount of magic that can do all sorts of things, so it's not that much of a stretch to think that magic is everywhere. There's also the standby storyline of an agent disavowed by his government in the name of expedient amorality, which cuts the umbilical cord and sets him against the agency that made him everything he is.
