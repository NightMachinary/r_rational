Yeah based on this fic the protagonist would be undead or will be using undead. So they need something bigger to fight.

The original PotC already dealt with the problem of fighting undead so it wouldn't be as intresting.

Would you mind listing your ideas for supernatural 1700 gadgets? This sounds intresting.
