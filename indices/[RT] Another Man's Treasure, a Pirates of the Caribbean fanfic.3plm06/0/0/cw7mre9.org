No. I mostly posted this is lieu of posting a brainstorming thread, but this is about as far as I want to take the idea. If it kept going, it would follow one of the men suckered into having the curse placed on him as he engages in wetwork for the British government. Like a more violent James Bond but in the 1700s, with all his gadgets replaced by supernatural items, and unable to have his thirst slaked by any number of martinis. If I read the curse right, also incapable of having sex.

If that tickles me enough I'll write it, but I think the premise is more interesting than the execution would be.
