  This will either be like all other fights against nigh-invulnerable immortals and be an exercise in futility, or the divine power will smite the undead soldiers who have turned away from sound strategy in their empowered state.

A British Empire with a limited number of immortal soldiers against the Papacy and the Caliphate? They can have sound strategy and still be crushed in holy war. Magic in PotC in general seems to be limited in scope, not mass producible for anything. These would be special agents working behind the scenes; magic used for espionage and coutnerespionage.
