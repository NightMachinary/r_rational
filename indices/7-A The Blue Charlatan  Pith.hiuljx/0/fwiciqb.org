  “Let me guess.” He spoke back and forth between his two bodies. “You tried to study, failed, then slipped into a spiral of self-loathing and apathy. Now, you're trying to drink away that memory.”

As someone who read this from work, I felt personally attacked by this line.

On the other hand,

  There was no burst of energy or determination in my veins. I felt as frightened and unfocused and tired as I did an hour ago. And I wanted more than anything to get drunk, or play Jao Lu, or listen to the radio or watch something on one of those fancy new television sets.

  I sat down at the coffee table, next to Hira. And I flipped open the book.

This was chilling.

  The mobster shot his right-hand woman in the back. [...]

  The high-powered rifle round blew straight through her chest, turning her ribcage into a red hole. She dropped to the ground, splattering blood on the train station's floor.

  Half a dozen of the mobster's friends aimed at Ana from the walkway two stories up [...] But they didn't fire. Ana had positioned herself so that the mobster was between her and them. To hit her, they'd have to shoot through their boss.

  Ana shot him in the back of the head. [...]

  The man dropped to the ground. Ana exhaled, taking deep breaths, and the energy seemed to drain out of her. She rubbed the circles under her eyes, stretched her neck, and straightened herself up, adopting a cold, flat expression.

  “Brin didn't say we had to kill the target,” I said.

  “He didn't say we had to spare him, either.” Ana stuffed her gun into a holster on her thin blue combat suit. “Come on. We've got a bounty to collect.”

... Wow. That was /really/ fast. I mean, from our perspective. From hers, she's been doing this for a month.

But still, I'm shocked. She went from "lethal force is not an option" to shooting people in the head because it's tidier that way in a really short timespan.
