I like that we've sort of montaged the gang into being actually competent, ruthless mercenaries without skipping past any of the difficult interpersonal stuff or character growth.

Ana is sort of the exception there, but I'd hesitate to call the changes to her character "growth," and it's the sort of thing I can understand as being a result of her circumstances. She's being forced to confront more and more situations where lethal force is the only option, what few friends she had she's losing (Kaplen's suicide and Wes' betrayal), the situation with her body is accelerating as time passes and she takes more injuries that won't ever heal right, and to top it all off people are actively trying to drive her away from Tasia, who is her sole remaining friend and the only good thing in her life right now. Of /course/ she's becoming bitter and jaded and all too willing to use lethal force. I'd still welcome a chapter from her perspective, of course, to see the specifics and nuances of her new outlook, but the fact that she has a new outlook is hardly a surprise.
