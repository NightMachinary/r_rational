Despite the fact that Moloch is one of his most popular articles, I'm not sure that Scott Alexander intended for it to be the first SSC article that you share with someone. At least to myself, it feels like part of a dialogue (which feeling might be heightened by knowing that there are other posts out there that were written explicitly in response to Moloch).

Certainly, most if not all of his audience would be familiar with e.g. Nick Land to some degree, and I wouldn't be surprised if Scott had been writing for his present audience first and for a hypothetical unfamiliar-with-his-works audience second.
