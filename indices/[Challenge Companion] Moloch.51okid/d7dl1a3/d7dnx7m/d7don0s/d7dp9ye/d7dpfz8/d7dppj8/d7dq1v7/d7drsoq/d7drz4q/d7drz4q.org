You don't need to remind me of the standard arguments against democracy (median voter, rational ignorance, etc.); I largely agree with them, and I'm desperately searching for any better system of government. But, what about the standard arguments against monarchy - what if the king's a fool, what if the king's a greedy fool, what if the king's a naive idealist, etc.?

Or what if the king (or his advisors) is jealous of his neighbors and wants a total war? Wasn't that essentially what happened with Germany and Russia in WWI? You can blame it on the greed and pride of monarchs at least as readily as on democracy. I'd be willing to hear an argument blaming democracy (specifically the French Revolution) for starting the trend toward total war, but now that it's been loosed upon the world, even monarchs need to take it by the horns or be destroyed.
