Sorry; I was assuming you were some sort of reactionary!

I'd love anarcho-capitalism if it worked... but I'm afraid it won't without much more social cohesion than we have in the modern West. A village or even town as a whole can do the job of the police, but hired protection agencies can't be relied on because /[insert the standard statist arguments here]/. And individual criminality - against your in-group - is probably rare, but what about crimes against other groups in society? With society essentially breaking down around us - as both conservatives and progressives agree, though the latter are more likely to call it "breaking down the walls of privilege" - can we rely on inter-group violence to remain rare? Sure, each group can hire its own protection agencies, but that's civil war.

Yes, I agree that people need to be much more free to try their own mini-societies. Let a thousand systems blossom; let the fundamentalist Mormons have their compound next to the fundamentalist SJW's and fundamentalist Yarvin-Landists in Scott's Archipelago, and let each tend their own vine and fig tree in their own manner. But is it not easier to do this with an overarching police to keep each from going to war against each other?
