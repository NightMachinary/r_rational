Social trust is a huge of cource, but I live in cache valley not a hell hole like Detroit, I don't really care about places I can't fix and won't effect me in the same way I do where I actually live.

There is no system that works without social trust but the state is hardy a good source with the bickering about who should be in charge

What exactly do you think the state does? The fed prints money so the banks con the middle class, the poor ask for hand out that come out of taxes, the rich write thick legalese to undermine anything close to sensible law to socialize neg externalities and capture pos, and the middle class write insane labor laws to prevent the poor from competing, all the while war is a thing that goes directly on the youngs debt sheet.
