I think democracy is frankly retarded; all standard arguments of medain voters, bystander effect and rational ignorence etc.

but lets focus on a nonstandard one, what if democracy enabled total war? I know the standard narrative but here an alternative one; the great experiment in democracy first move was to bring back the full ulgyness of slavery to a western culture, its 2nd move was to cling desperately to it when the super power in the world(i.e. Britain) looked at it and was like "fuck that" and made it not profitable in the hopes it would mostly end what had been already dying out for century's

Then north wanted something or other /but/ not the end of slavery(otherwise they wouldn't have been delivering runaways back for decades, you don't suddenly go form -100 to 100) it really doesn't matter what cause it, but something caused the first prototype of total war (13 separate nations in two loose allegiances with the majority of a content picking a side) and democracy still was only extending voting to white men at this point

After this wild success Europe wanted in and we then get into arguably the stupidest war ever, because one guy got assassinated a domino effect caused 38 million to die and an unfair treaty get signed

That treaty lead directly to the stupidest war ever part 2 the 60 million.

America unhappy that it only got one bombing looked around for the next big fight and happily found russia and they kept upping their dick measurement contest till they both almost killed all of humanity, but before that happened russia luckly had a heart attack

So with the current situation today is america keeps on the lookout for someone even bigger to fight but luckly again the only guy bigger is china and they seem very happy with peace. But that won't keep america down they need new conflicts so they because the world biggest arms dealer and keeps selling to "freedom fighters" in the hopes a few win their battles and become dictators

Can you name something worse then slavery and total/nuclear war that monarchy's do cause I can't?
