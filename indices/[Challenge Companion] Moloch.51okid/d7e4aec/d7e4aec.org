I have a different take on the /Meditations/--I saw Moloch as the inexorable pressure on individuals to give up incrementally more of their terminal goals in exchange for instrumental advantages--because, as much as we'd like it to be otherwise, defecting in a zero-sum game often is the rational, superrational, or otherwise advisable real-world move.
