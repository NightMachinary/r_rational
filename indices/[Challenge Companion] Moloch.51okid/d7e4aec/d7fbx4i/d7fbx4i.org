This is my understanding also. Even in the context of Moloch as the evil personification of coordination problems, there wouldn't be a coordination problem in the first place if not for the exchange of terminal values for instrumental values. And because the exchange is even more difficult to reverse than to avoid in the first place, I'm reminded of the line from James Lowell via Unsong:

"They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin."

[edit: line is from James Lowell, not William Blake.]
