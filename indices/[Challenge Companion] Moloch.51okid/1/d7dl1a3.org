Firstly, that article for sure deserves its own post. First time I've seen it on this subreddit and I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=moloch&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all][searched for Moloch]] without seeing a previous post. Since it doesn't I do want to comment somewhat on it.

Secondly, and I can't figure out how to comment on the article and it's going to bug my if I don't say it anywhere, the article spells Britain as Britan.

Thirdly the conclusion of the article seems to be to fight Moloch you need a) in a world where singularities do exist and happen to create one that perfectly fits "Elua" or b) switch back to absolute monarchies with random citizen inherit rules such that random chance will hopefully stop us ending in the sea (which all other routes seem to lead).

Fourthly, behavioural economics (and all of micro economics really), this subreddit really needs to read into it. So much stuff from the nonsense balisisk (incredible threat) mentioned in this post to basically the entire rest of the content, be it the free rider or tragedy of the commons.

Fifthly, I'm very curious as to how people will actually write a prompt for this as a description of human history (imagined into the future) sure sounds like it would be apt. While you mention that your company experience is the prime example now that I know the name for this Pareto inefficiency it seems like Moloch is everywhere and that knowledge is nigh useless in relevancy.

Sixthly, kind of weird in the article that they named names and seemed to expect the reader to be aware of who they were. As well as including tweets and similar things, kind of struck me as odd. Perhaps the article could be made more clean, more readily shareable if the author had paraphrased or entirely built up the other viewpoints without specifying people. Maybe that's just my preference though.
