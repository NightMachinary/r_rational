  what if the king (or his advisors) is jealous of his neighbors and wants a total war? Wasn't that essentially what happened with Germany and Russia in WWI?

I don't have time to really get into this, but no, it wasn't. Some wars can be blamed on greed or jealousy. The partitioning of Poland is a decent example of this, from what I know. And if, as a non-historian, I'm wrong about that particular one, there are others. WWI isn't really close to being one of them, though.
