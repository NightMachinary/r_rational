Oh I'm an an-cap(far to the "left" of the standard an-cap position though); I don't think we need rigid government, a decentralized contracting system should work nicely(criminality is rare and cops don't exactly show up in time, that whole fear of "anarchy is chaos" should be thrown out) <insert the standard an-cap rant and links here>

What I think we really need is "Agorism" a culture of when you dislike a system, to just ignore it and start your own. You find new "molock"s in every new one sure but in theory so long as we can change systems we should always be able to move forward, killing molocks as we go

I don't really trust the state to be competent at war and I definitively don't trust it top be competent at policy; I'm not convinced thats actually true
