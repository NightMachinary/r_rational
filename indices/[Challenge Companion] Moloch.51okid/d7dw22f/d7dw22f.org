That's a very insightful and thought-provoking article.

I particularly liked the point that the system /actively stifles/punishes/outcompetes individuals who want to change the rules/. The whole, "Be the change you want to see in the world" is a noble idea - but expect the world to push back.

I was a little disappointed by its treatment of religion, which was mostly spoken about in the context of encouraging its members to have more children. Consider this angle instead: religions typically encourage their members to value others' wellbeing, thus working against Moloch at the grassroots level, and Abrahamic religions anticipate a future perfect monarch, which would defeat Moloch completely (just as a secular humanist might anticipate a future perfect AI).
