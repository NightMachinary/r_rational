Yep. The best case scenario for the Crusade was to actually let Cat win here, as that would've irrevocably turned her into a monster, a fully Evil insane cocky bloodthirsty Fae Demigod, but that would've set Cat up for an inevitable defeat later. Whether that required the Saint of Swords' death is even disputable, since she could've let Cat rampage for a while and then retreated from a rampaging monster.

Now that Cat has been defeated in single combat in her berserk form, she has been set up for an arc where she relies less on Winter, learns to controls it better and eventually perhaps even gets rid of it.
