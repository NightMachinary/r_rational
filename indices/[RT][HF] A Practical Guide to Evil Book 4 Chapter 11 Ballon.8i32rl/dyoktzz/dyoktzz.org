The Saint really fucked up here. Winter was taking over, classic evil, just like it has for some time now and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8hkrht/rthf_a_practical_guide_to_evil_book_4_chapter_10/dyknohs/?context=3][just like I called last chapter]] it got cut away from Cat. See, we know for a fact that classic evil *loses*, it's in Winter's very nature. She likely could have lost the war tonight, becoming the Winter Queen in full and forgetting everything Black had taught her, not to mention her own peculiar version of sanity.

Now, she's probably not totally free, but she has *clarity* again, and hopefully that's enough for her to realize that she needs to cut winter out of her soul if she wants any chance of winning this war.
