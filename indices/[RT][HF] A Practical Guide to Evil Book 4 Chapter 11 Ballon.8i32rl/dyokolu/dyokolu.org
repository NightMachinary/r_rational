Great fight, Cat is learning the beauty of plots within plots. there are at the very least three different things happening in this incursion.

1 killing the commoner leaders of the crusade.

2 Stealing whatever Thief stole.

3 destroying even more the reputation of Amadis Milenan as a diplomat, first Arlington now the Daoine, The dude cant seem to catch a break.

I loved this line "...On the other hand, now it was four on one. My odds had just gotten a lot better." So badass.

We also discovered that Cat can make trinkets from the heroes she squishes. all the heroes she killed off screen gave her power.
