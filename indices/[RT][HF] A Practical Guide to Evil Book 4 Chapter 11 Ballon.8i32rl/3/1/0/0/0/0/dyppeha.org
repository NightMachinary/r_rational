Given that the motive of regulating the engagements first appeared in the talk with the Pilgrim, if she's becoming human enough to get a name then the regulating Aspect would be some kind of double-edged restriction.

That said, I hope that she'll go the less direct way and instead will act through other Named. Not in sense of directly bestowing abilities, but more subtly, like appearing in a vision of a hero-to-be about to accept a Role from an angel to put it in a new perspective. Maybe even shield a claimant to the Name from the retribution for a failed test, like one run by the Seraphim in Ashur.
