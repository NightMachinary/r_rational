Anyone wondering what zeze is up to? He isnt with Cat because this is a quick assault into enemy territory, but everyone else had a distinct reason for not being on screen. Thief was stealing something, Archer is part of advanced recon team, and Hak is coming back from previous mission.

So what type of magic bullshit is going to fall next chapter?

Also, I wonder if Auger had any data on this, because this shit was planned. But at the same time, Cat's decision to go through with it was very quick and spontaneous, so maybe she was blindsided until it was too late.
