Wow, now THAT was a good chapter! I'd been somewhat disappointed in EE's writing style because Winter-Cat's personality so often seemed identical to non-Winter-Cat. But this chapter did a fantastic job keeping the two distinct and separate. Random thoughts:

  Chapter 11: Ballon

Totally thought the chapter title was "balloon" at first. Oops!

#+begin_quote
  I could not help but be thankful she'd chosen to whittle away at *my trump card* instead of trying to go after me.
#+end_quote

I think this phrase is getting a bit overused, or at least it's getting used for enough things that it's confusing to know which is an /actual/ trump card.

Chapter 1: Trump card refers to Ubua's scrying artefact that now is the centerpiece of the Observatory.

Chapter 7: Multiple unnamed trump cards are mentioned as a potential way to block the pass and stop the invasion.

Chapter 9: The "real" trump card is the fairy gates.

Chapter 11: Sounds like the trump card here is the Wild Hunt. There is also a reference to the "card" she and Masego cooked up at the Observatory. /Absolute positioning/ isn't labeled by this phrase, but I'm unsure if it was in use during this sneak attack or not.

  none of the unconscious markers the mage had used were markers I was familiar with.
#+end_quote

I'm not positive I understand what this means, specifically the "unconscious" part. If I'm reading it right, it sounds like Cat was trying to find the officer tents' locations by using the mage's memory like an SQL database, but being unsure what primary key the mage used for "officer tent locations." And then trying to map those entries to her own mind's entries, which she brute-forced through Winter magic. Sound right?

  Men shouted out in Chantant
#+end_quote

What language is Chantant from, Procer? Alamans? What would be the likely real-world equivalent? I'm leaning toward German, but that's because German is "Alemán" in Spanish.

#+begin_quote
  “You will make,” I said, “very useful artefacts.”
#+end_quote

Sounds like between the last chapter's whistle and this quote here, we know what Cat is doing with the Named she's killed. I'm wondering how that is done - is it a Winter ability, or an outcome of when she stole *Take* from Diabolist?

#+begin_quote
  Three of them.
#+end_quote

I wonder if we'll get the heroes' Names eventually. I always like learning more about the Name system. Here we have a caster, a knife-wielder, and a priest. And it sounds like the knife-wielder used two Aspects, one a displacement and the other a haste-effect. There was also the plate-wearing hammer-wielder skipped previously.

  That was no soul. It was a sword, and somehow more.

  “You hold dominion,” I said.

  “Only over the one thing,” the Saint grinned. “But that's usually enough.”
#+end_quote

All hail Shirou Emiya, the Sword Saint. “I am the Bone of my Sword..." and all that. Between this and the recent updates in /The Erogamer,/ I feel like Unlimited Blade Works is popping up all over!

#+begin_quote
  Thief had been on the prowl.
#+end_quote

Hmmm, now that is /interesting./ Wondering if she went to steal, to kill, to spy, or to release a nasty surprise.
