  I think this phrase is getting a bit overused, or at least it's getting used for enough things that it's confusing to know which is an actual trump card.
#+end_quote

Given that she also refferred to Aspects as trump cards instead of powers that she could rely on, it's more in the sense of tricks that will guaranteedly achieve their intended purpose (equalizing her power to the opponent's for *Struggle*, looking into other dimensions for the greater scrying bowl, getting the army to wherether she needs quicker than physically possible for the fairy gates), but don't necessarily win her the battle.

  If I'm reading it right, it sounds like Cat was trying to find the officer tents' locations by using the mage's memory like an SQL database, but being unsure what primary key the mage used for "officer tent locations." And then trying to map those entries to her own mind's entries, which she brute-forced through Winter magic.

Sort of? It's like using the locations you pass by every day as landmarks for things you move or don't use that often: individual for people depending on their routine and focus.

  What language is Chantant from, Procer?
#+end_quote

In [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/04/11/interlude-stairway/][interlude Stairway]] Klaus Papenheim indeed refers to Chantant as the Alamans language, though his own Reitz is the closer equivalent to German, considering that [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/crowned/#comment-4207][in the Holy Roman Empire analogy for the Principate of Procer the Licaonese principalities are more or less Prussia, and Rhenia is Brandenburg]]: more an army with a country than a country with an army and all that. Chantant is likely the calernian equivalent of French.

  I'm wondering how that is done - is it a Winter ability, or an outcome of when she stole Take from Diabolist?
#+end_quote

She stole *Call*, which is now a whistle. *Take* is either the Aspect that was mentioned to grow beyond what an Aspect should be or, more likely, gone after her transformation, considering that *Fall* is the Aspect she still can use the remains of. Making objects out of souls is a fae thing: the invitation to Skade in [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/fletched/][Fletched]], the barrier in the fortress of Dormer in the [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/11/20/chapter-45-falling-action/][chapter 45]] both were made out of some unfortunate mortal's soul.

  I wonder if we'll get the heroes' Names eventually.
#+end_quote

Unless one of the split armies would get into a pitched battle where Catherine has to devote enough focus to its Named, unlikely. Thief already mentioned that she found out some of the Names, and Cat only displayed interest in the Saint and the Pilgrim. Given that they are likely to split too, both are probably going to overshadow their respective sidekicks, not leaving enough narrative space. Well, that, or Catherine has some plans that dont include straight up conflict, in which case she may need to trick them or predict their reactions.

  â€œI am the Bone of my Sword..." and all that.
#+end_quote

Nah, not really. I mean, Nasuverse has some body-locked Reality Marbles too, and Shirou's "My face hasn't turned into swords yet" line made me laugh back then, but the closest thing we may be able to see is Catherine getting lucky and pulling off an Unlimited Lost Works. Otherwise the Saint is closer to Guideverse's elves.
