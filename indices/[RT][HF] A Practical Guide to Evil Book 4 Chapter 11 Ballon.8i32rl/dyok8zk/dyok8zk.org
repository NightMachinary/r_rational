Oh, heck yes. A good, crunchy fight scene, Cat acting like a hell of a villain, and the Saint of Swords showing us all what a badass she is. Given that she's capable of cutting through basically anything (apparently?) I wonder if she cut through Cat's mantle or something like that?

As an aside, I love that her mantle forces her to act like a stereotype of an arrogant villain. The Saint screwing with that might be a blessing in disguise.
