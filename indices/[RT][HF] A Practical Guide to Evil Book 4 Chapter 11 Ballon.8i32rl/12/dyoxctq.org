  Reorienting myself was the hardest part of figuring it all out, since none of the unconscious markers the mage had used were markers I was familiar with. Masego and I had figured out a way around that through the Observatory with the card I'd been keeping up my -- heavily armoured -- sleeve, but I was without the benefit of Hierophant tonight.

Another hint about absolute positioning, it seems. Hierophant is evidently needed to cast... whatever she'll need to get her bearings, but I'm at a bit of a loss to how the subjective memories could connect to a multidimensional scrying tool. At least the military applications of this can be linked to the ability to open gates with precise positioning and timing, though that doesn't seem so different from what she's currently doing at the first glance.
