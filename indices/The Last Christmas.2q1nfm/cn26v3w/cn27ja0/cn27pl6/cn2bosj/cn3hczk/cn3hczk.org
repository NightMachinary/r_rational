I don't post links here often, but once every few months I re-post the Ted Chiang thread, even though there's rarely any discussion. I post it as a self post instead of a link post, which I think does not grant Karma, and I tag it as a [Repost]. These two things in conjunction make people pretty OK with resposts since it's explicitly labelled and clearly not a play for more points.

Also, Ted Chiang deserves a repost from time to time since he's super amazing.
