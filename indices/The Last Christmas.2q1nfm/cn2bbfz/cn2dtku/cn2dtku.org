I am working on a rewrite - it's half again as long right now, and though I'd hoped to have it done for Christmas, I don't think that's going to happen, especially since I'm trying not to rush it this time (and I think in the last year I've learned the secret to roping people into editing for me, if nothing else). Anyway, here's all the stuff that I'm hoping to add/fix:

- Give better characterization to the three principle characters
- Clever exploits/consequences of the panopticon (naughty/nice) viewers
- Smoothed out progression of the elves
- Background on the bad Santa (origins/motivations/plans)
- Filled in some background stuff on the elves
- Close any plot holes that remain once all that's done

Anyway, I don't think that the story is truly terrible as it is right now, just below what I'd consider to be my quality waterline. And if I'm going to miss the Christmas 2014 deadline, I'll probably just blow right past that deadline and save the rewrite for the Christmas after this one and put it out at a more preferable time.

If anyone has any questions/complaints about this story, I'd be happy to hear them.
