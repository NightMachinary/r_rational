As a relatively new browser to the subreddit, I've never seen this. Nor, in fact, have I seen a lot of the stuff that is reposted. Reposting allows new viewers of the subreddit to view and engage in discussion about older stuff, and can quite possibly bring new viewpoints to the subject matter.

As to Top Posts/All Time, that's fairly useless. It's heavily "Chapter x" of various rational fics, with one-shot gems like this few and far between. This particular story, for instance, doesn't make the top 100, nor does any post about Demon. It's less accessible than you think.
