Is there a trope name for "Muggle gets summoned with magic with the explicit intent of being put into into the leadership position of some fantastical realm"?

Because so far "Two Year Emperor" "Erfworld" and this story here all share it. (This isn't spoilers, as it's pretty much mentioned in the very beginning of all these stories)
