There's also The Gotham Man which is sorta-kinda this, except without actual superheroes; it's a audience-chooses-plot-fork story where Bruce Wayne isn't crazy enough to dress up like a bat and decides to be effective doing good instead. Google isn't showing me the link, but it's been here a few times.

I also have an original rational superhero series on Amazon right now, "The Change Storms". The premise is "what would society look like if superpowers were real, and contagious?" It will eventually become rationalist, but that's in the next book. [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00XER9MPA?ie=UTF8&redirectFromSS=1&pc_redir=T1&noEncodingTag=1&fp=1][First one is here]] if you want it. (They're on Amazon, so obviously, they are not free.)
