I based The Volunteer from The Fall of Doc Future and the sequels partly on the Golden Age Superman (he started in 1938, so he's getting rather old) and partly on The Samaritan from Astro City--who was also based on Superman. He isn't a viewpoint character in the first book, but he gets a bit more time in Skybreaker's Call.
