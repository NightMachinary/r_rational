Not quite rationalist, but at least better than the source material in some very limited ways: [[http://catwoman-cattales.com/][Cat-tails]]. Hopefully this is the series I think it is. It's been heavily redesigned since I read the stories. (Warning: Imbedded audio file)

Edit: It is! The original books are [[http://catwoman-cattales.com/files/CT_Main.htm][here]]. You're in for a treat.
