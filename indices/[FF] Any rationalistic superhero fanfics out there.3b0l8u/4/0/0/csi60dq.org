There are also some pretty good Worm fanfics out there. *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cenotaph-worm-complete.273255/][Cenotaph]]* honestly comes close to the original in terms of writing quality and style, though with a more limited scope. It has a sequel somewhere, too. *[[http://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-imago-of-rust-and-crimson-worm-crossover.1326/][An Imago of Rust and Crimson]]* is great, but it updates very slowly with large chapters, rather than the generally-preferred often-and-small. *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/atonement-worm-au.312449/][Atonement]]* is entertaining and ongoing. Kind of a Spider-Girl vibe to it.
