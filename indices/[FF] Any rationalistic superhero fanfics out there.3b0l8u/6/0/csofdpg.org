I'm not sure how rationalist it is. Edwin seems to only be concerned with helping supervillains make money. He doesn't seem to care about figuring out what they actually want, let alone what he himself actually wants. He also focuses on telling them what to do, not how to think for themselves. Granted, they're not even smart enough to follow his concrete advice, so teaching them to be rational would be an exercise in futility, but from a Doylist perspective you need to teach someone how to think if your goal is to teach the reader how to think.
