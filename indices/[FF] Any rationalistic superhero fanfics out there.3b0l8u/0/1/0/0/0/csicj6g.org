Expanding on [[/u/JackStargazer]]'s comment -- when Zoat comments on other Paul's in other dimensions, those comments take the form of short stories. There's a whole "blue lantern" thing that I wish he'd do more of -- ideally in preference to Renegade.

Oh, that's another thing to be aware of. He's doing two stories in parallel. The main one is about Paragon!Paul, the SI, where he's a good guy who makes allies. His story entries start with orange text. There's a side story about Renegade!Paul. He's a good guy...sort of? Also an utter asshat. Everyone in the thread (almost) /really/ wants to see him fall on his face. His story entries start with red, except for the current arc which is all about him so he's the default.

I mention this because if you're reading the story only thread you'll be baffled why occasionally Paul does something and then time drops back a few minutes and he does it again in a different and more asshat-ish way.
