The current arc also is going to be following Renegade primarily - while I don't like him nearly as much as !ParagonPaul, I tolerate him in his worst for moments when he gives his much needed The Reason You Suck Speeches.

The main issue with Renegade so far is that he hasn't failed at anything. In fact, outside of ParagonPaul having a higher maximum power level due to his [[#s][Spoiler]], Renegade's asshatishness has gotten equal or better results in almost every single mission he's been on before the last arc, where he missed out on a huge technological breakthrough bigtime by being needlessly antagonistic.

This has mostly, I think, been due to the fact that we only see Renegade in short violent bursts, doing the things he is best at doing - overwhelming force applied massively, very quickly - and nothing majorly subtle, which is ParagonPaul's forte.

Hopefully, with a whole arc, we will be able to see things for once not going perfectly for our Anti-Hero. I don't think he's been quite the Karma Houdini others in the thread seem to, but he's certainly due to a comeuppance.

Personally, I suspect that at some point he's going to go off the edge after somehow [[#s][Spoiler]].
