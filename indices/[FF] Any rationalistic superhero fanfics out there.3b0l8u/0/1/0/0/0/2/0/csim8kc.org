/shrug/ I was baffled; it made me drop the story for a while although fortunately I saw a link somewhere and went back to read the main thread instead of story-only. The index and comments made it plain what was going on.

FWIW, I quite enjoy the fan commentary, so it might not be a bad idea to read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-eleven.311139/][the main thread]].

I've heard people complain about having to use the back button and scroll, but I just leave the index open in one tab, open each entry in a separate tab as I go. Read it, close the tab, you haven't lost your place in the index.
