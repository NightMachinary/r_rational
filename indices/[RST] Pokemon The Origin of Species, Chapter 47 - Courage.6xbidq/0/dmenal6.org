Hey everyone, welcome back! Managed to finish the chapter despite spending half the month teaching at ESPR. Hooray personal goals! It's been a ton of fun, but I'm still in London on my laptop, which means updating anything besides Fanfiction will have to wait. EPUB for patrons and website will be updated when I get home. Enjoy!
