At a steep discount red got 30,000 per abra, the others got more. Red declared his plan was to sell them "wholesale, at half market price" Abra without a psychic can only remember one place at a time, so round trips wont work, you would need 2 Abras then. 2 abras, at 30k, is 60 k, but that is at half value, so 120k is a decent number, before the pokedex.
