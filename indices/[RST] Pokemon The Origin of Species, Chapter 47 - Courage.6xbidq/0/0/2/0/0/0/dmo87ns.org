Well, in the games, an Abra goes for 180 coins in the Celadon Game Corner. Given that the conversion rate is 50 coins for 1000 dollars, that puts a single Abra at 3600 dollars. The Game Corner, like a modern arcade, is probably going to inflate the value of the Abra, so I'd round it down to 3000 dollars a piece. If we take the game price of the Abra as canon, and assume Red sold 30 Abra, his 25,000 dollar profit is about a 73% markdown - what a deal!
