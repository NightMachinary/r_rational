Oh wow, no, Professor Oak didn't mean 25k for each /abra,/ he meant each of the three of them. So Red was saying he made about 30k in total. Sorry if that wasn't clear, I can see why it might read that way and will fix it :) 30k for each abra would make them about a million each, which is a rather different scale of fortune.
