Glad you enjoyed it :)

1. 100,000?

2. Keep in mind that pokeballs on belts are meant for quick access for battles: "utility" pokemon can be held in backpacks.

3. This is true (except for Blue) but also just part of the "level up" process of a trainer. The more pokemon they get, the more tools and powers they have at their disposal, and teleport is a rather powerful one that gives our heroes an edge if they need one.
