So, interesting chapter. I liked the speech part at the end. I really like Aiko as a character I like. I am curious about a few things though.

1. They just used a lot of money to get her traveling, over 100,000 worth before the pokedex. I feel this needs to be mentioned, but I dont know what to make of it.

2.This means that of their 24 availible pokemon slots, they are using 5 just for abra's (assuming everyone has a GTFO and Aiko has one to go home and one to come back), 6 if red has a second for bills house.

3.From a tension standpoint, everything is a bit lower now, since they have the ability to sleep in a house with a mini poke center every night, or just pop over for a quick fix. Teleportation is hard to handle in most games and stories, so I'm curious if there is going to be a counter rearing its head soon.

EDIT- Points 2 and 3 are mostly null, 2 because you can have more than six pokemone, (although six on a belt is interesting. I wonder if they keep abra any where in particular.) and 3 because only a single person can use a single abra, bringing total cost up to... 4 abras if you do some pokeball shuffling
