I know this might be asking much, and I probably missed it early in the thread, but could you post what the new research explaining the Flying Type actually was? Cuz I found it really interesting, with the references to particles and wind and the such, and would to see whatever idea you came up with to explain Flying Type and its canon inconsistencies really fleshed out.
