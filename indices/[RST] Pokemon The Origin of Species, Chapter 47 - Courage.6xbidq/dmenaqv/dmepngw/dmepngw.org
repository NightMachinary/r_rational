Not sure how the typo thread works, but Paragraph 2 "he sits *sup*".

I feel like there may be a word missing in "Red pulls his mind back with a gasp, hand clutching his nose even as the sensation fades, was never really in his nose at all."

"Well, if you don't have to put yourself through that, then. Our normal diagnostic tools should be fine." - the If seems out of place.
