I definitely intend for his mom to come off as both a mentor figure but also a source of conflict: children and their parents rarely have a totally positive relationship all the time, even if they get along fairly well, and besides which that would be boring and provide little room for growth and character development :)

That said, I do find it interesting how few people seem to agree with Laura's views on this particular topic (the "insider trading" on the clefairies). I wasn't expecting the reaction to be so one sided, so she may be coming off as more unreasonable and antagonistic than I intended.
