I don't have a particular problem with Red's insider trading. If he was smart enough to leverage what he found out, good on him. That's capitalism.

However, he specifically promised his mother that he would not do it, in order to secure her cooperation, and then broke his promise. Dishonesty matters, and the fact that she became involved in something that she would not approve of, under false pretences, also matters.

I don't agree with Red's justification here. He had good reasons for needing the money, but not for lying. He could have borrowed from her - or from Professor Oak, probably - and used the Abra income to quickly repay it. He could have sold his Clefairy at cost price, which would not have violated the spirit of their agreement or her conscience. He could probably have delayed his research by a few weeks if really needed. He could have called her, explained his reasons, and asked permission, or for early access to his other funds - or at least forgiveness.

Instead he broke his promise, and then kept quiet. Naturally she feels betrayed and angry; how can she trust his promises in future?
