I do not want to offend, I do want to discuss and learn, so lets sit on the same side of the table and look at this together.

What is his harmartia? I had to look this word up. I don't think this story is written as a tragedy; it is still early. To say Red has a fatal flaw is difficult for me to grasp at this junction(used dictionary to form opinion). I think Blue does, and it almost destroyed him, but he recovered from the fallout through volunteering in the pokecenter, as well as other P.R. activities.\\
You ask several questions in your reply and I think they are rhetorical to get me to see through multiple lenses, thank you. I think that bit of backstory is important to understand the dynamics...in this case I feel that it can explain that Red is his mothers infinitely precious aspect of the physical realm, and that she is allowed to act irrationally. Her reactions still made me dissapointed, and thus dislike her, but I will think on it further to see where I may be wrong. I also have no intent to speak for the authors intent, this analysis is what makes it so enjoyable to read works with depth. Also, its interesting to probe my own thoughts and ask, "Am I projecting?" Furthermore, Aikos father is a foil to Red's mother, and I don't dislike him, I instead empathize. I think there should have been more of a self analysis undertone to Red's Moms thoughts if I was supposed to like her, i.e. she says she raised him better, but she must also realize that people are the product of their enviroment. This begs a nurture vs. Nature aspect, and she is glancing over it. Her methods are not likely to increase his baseline of honesty. Also, this was not a heat of the moment argument, but rather a simmering one, which in my experience is the most dangerous for relationships. Finally, i have to admit a personal bias, Reds mother is a woman, and I have immediately layered her in my expectations of how a woman/mother/female handles emotions, and their role in a relationship. What action could she have done to make me respect her more? She could have spanked Red, and told him he acted childishly and would receive a childs punishment. She could have also given him some money, and told him that she would rather have nothing then have her son lie to her. She could have begun her conversation with an anecdote of her lying to someone she loved.\\
I really want to know Daystar's intent, however isn't it peaking before Christmas? It's still fun to rattle the box a little and imagine whats really inside.
