I apologize if the tone of my last comment seemed to be aggravating or angry. I really enjoy talking about this and speculating on the future on this story helps the author. You are correct that I was using rhetorical questions to isolate important qualities Red's mother would see Red demonstrate. I was also using them to predict what Red will be doing in the future.

Your sentence about Blue is a terrific example of what I predict Red will do in the future. I really enjoyed reading the conflict and challenges Blue went through for his Shiftry. As Blue justified himself to people that criticized him we, the audience, got a look at the setting history of criminal violence. We learned about the differences between /violence/ and Pokémon battling from the perspective of average citizens. In recent chapters Red talked with Bill and Professor Oak about barriers to scientific progress. Red's focus is on academic research, but he has great passion for the wonders of engineering! He knows that pokeball technology could save lives and Bill made it clear that some morbid topics need to be approached delicately. Bill does not think Red should tell the public about goals to stop anybody from dying.

An important note there, and why I think it connects to Red's future challenges: Bill did not kill Red's conviction. Bill is not the kind of hero Red plans to be. Bill did manage to help Red mature a little bit and protect him from damaging his reputation. [[http://daystareld.com/upset-flowchart/][Red as a logical way of thinking]] which is balanced by powerful emotions such as passion. Bill, Red's Mom, and many other characters help Red improve his thoughts so that he can avoid pitfalls and help him grow. They have an important role in guiding Red as he tries to use his enthusiasm and passion in productive ways.

But. But I brought up Blue, Hamartia, and these positive influences on Red because they are building up to a critical moment. This moment will be a test of Red's character, his competence, and how he values other people. For example: if Red has the opportunity to free Mewtwo followed by a debate on the merits of peace, revenge, etcetera, then should be stand back and allow Mewtwo to eliminate Giovanni's Team Rocket? Mewtwo is a greater threat than the Legendary Birds in this setting. Red knows it is moral to protect humans from dangerous Pokémon. Red may see Mewtwo as a person and cause Mewtwo to allow everyone else in Kanto to live.

That scenario is one of many possible moral quandaries Red could face. Red could make the "right" decision and have people hate or fear him for it. Blue could easily suffer the same thing if he allies himself with Giovanni in some conflict.

I'll readily admit that the conflicts and challenges I see in this story's future could be off-the-mark. Red is a well-written example of a rational character because he does make mistakes. His mother may be an antagonist or she may be an interesting ally. She has her own goals and challenges in the future. I am glad that "like mother, like son" they each sometimes fail to find a perfect solution. I agree that she could have handled that better! Red also made a reasonable decision that hurt someone he cared about. Hahaha! I made this response just to make the points:\\
1) Red is like Blue. Red could be "Dark" without changing his personality.\\
2) Red is like his mother.\\
And yet I brought up so many other points. I love this story. Red isn't the character I identify with most, but every page inspires emotions like nothing else.
