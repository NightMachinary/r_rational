I wonder if Red will get any profits from this business arrangement. Or research credit if it is effective treatment for people.

This seemed strange for a second (why wasn't Aiko rushing to to heal her eevee ASAP?), until I realized there isn't really any urgency if eevee is safely suspended in pokeball.

And I guess Vermilion would have a bigger pokecenter (like a bigger hospital can often offer more treatments)?
