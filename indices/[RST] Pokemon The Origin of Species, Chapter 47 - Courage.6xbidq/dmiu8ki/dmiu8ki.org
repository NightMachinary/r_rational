DaystarEld, happy belated birthday, question mark?

I'm wondering if there's any real world inspirations for the cities in Kanto, such as Pewter being associated with Kyoto and Saffron with Tokyo and such. With Vermillion being a port city I imagine it would be much more alive than what we saw in Pewter and possibly Cerulean. It would be cool if we see something akin to freeways to accommodate for the increased traffic and other such ways pokemon help people around town.
