[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3540712/1/Deus-Ex-Pok%C3%A9ball][Deus Ex Pokeball]] is not the happiest short story, but it touches on a lot of commonly-ignored risks of the Pokémon world. The protagonist isn't a trainer, Pokémon are not always good at communicating, and power is never straight forward. It is complete. I think you'd appreciate it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4390479/1/No-Antidote][No Antidote]] you'll appreciate just for the recent comments about Doduo and Gyrados' typing. It is, without question, a Tragedy. Some of the ideas about training are as incredible as yours. It shows us the impossible-to-ignore side of adventure in Kanto from the Pokémons' perspective. The final chapters are... controversial, but I think they will make your jaw drop. I'm happy to say that the sad feelings of this story (those felt by the characters) are comparable to how you handled Red. Read it. It may give you ideas about Blue and Giovanni's personalities or body-language-type subtleties in how they'd act.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-special-kind-of-hell-pokemons.4309/][A Special Kind of Hell]] introduced me to the above two stories. It is screwy, it is a little monstrous, and it made me understand why carefully designing a character can have a satisfying payoff. Anyone that plans an atypical Pokémon adventure story should read it for what to avoid and how to pace content/action/lore extremely well. It is more "fanfiction" than it an original story like yours or like the above stuff, but it is worth bookmarking. Maybe it'll help you out of any writer's block.

Edit: I've noticed a distinct lack of conspiracy theories this update about Mewtwo puppetting Aiko or some other teenager in the name of /Friendship!/ Come on commenters, we're slacking.
