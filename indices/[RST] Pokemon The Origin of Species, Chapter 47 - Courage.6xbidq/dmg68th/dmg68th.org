I've said it before and I'll say it again. The obtuse mechanics for the Daycares and all of the civilians that players are unable to battle make it clear to me that you understand the creators' intentions for what the world of Pokémon is meant to be. It isn't about breeding the most powerful creatures for violence, but to make the world a better place for everyone. Sure stories like Falconpain's /Deus Ex Pokeball/ and /Antidote/ give battling an important role in the setting, but you demonstrate in big and small ways that they change every level of society.\\
It makes me feel how intricate bonds between characters can be while making me terrified of major changes like capturing humans in pokeballs, Mewtwo going on a rampage, or the wrong person upsetting a house of cards (Koga's daughter) with the best of intentions. You make us want to hug everyone, believe they can conquer the ends of the earth, and then introduces challenges that make it clear no one will come out unscarred.

Thank you for another terrific chapter! So who wants to talk about the future of that Eevee? Or if anything will come from sending a Pokedex scan of a shiny Eevee to Oak Labs before and after taking it to a Pokémon center?

Huh. There's an idea. "What if the Pokémon center's healing machine causes strange changes in Pokémon that potions, berries, etc. are unable to repair?" That'd be an interesting twist on [[http://pettynuzlockelg.smackjeeves.com/comics/1033352/a-petty-nuzlocke-challenge-new-cover/][Nuzlocke]] stories.
