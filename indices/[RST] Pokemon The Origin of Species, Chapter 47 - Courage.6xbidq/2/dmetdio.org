That last scene is my favorite in the fic so far -- I actually had tears bubbling up. I really like seeing Red as an idealist, like Harry, but gentler and more sensitive. In a different sort of story, I can imagine Red becoming a really interesting public figure: someone who remains bad at these sorts of things (interviews) but is constantly coming up with great ideas that further the public good. I'm imagining this innocent-child-prodigy-savior. It's a really pretty archetype (which might only exist in my head... you'll have to let me know whether it's what you were going for).

I don't think that's where you're taking this though:

- I think it would be hard to pull off since we live in his head, and this is not the main vibe he gives off

- [Redacted private future knowledge]

Still, I think it's worth putting thought into the broader narrative the world has and will have for each of the three (four?), individually and as a team, that will bring you some of the way towards creating an Epic^{1.} You've been showing us how society reacts to the team so far, and how this affects their choices, but this is the first time this has added something to the story for me. It recalls the scenes in Worm where we see Taylor from other perspectives. These scenes are some of my favorites. If you can manage to do the same, I'll be impressed.

One difficulty is that the image stuff (including information about how they are coming across -- not just how they mean to come across^{2)} seems somehow integrated more deeply into your story. This means other-POV interludes or scenes like this one are less powerful, because they are less surprising or demonstrate less growth/change.

Anyway, the team dynamics and the characterization of the trio in that scene are really excellent. It's good to be reminded how well Blue can pull this sort of thing off.

More than ever, I really want Red to do further impressive stuff.

On the hand... I wasn't particularly interested in the rest of the chapter. I was not very engaged with the Aiko plot -- it felt like something we just sort of had to sit through. It seems as though it ought to be possible to present the whole arc there in much fewer words/scenes, but I don't really know. Neither was I particularly interested in the psychic stuff. I'm hoping we don't see too too much more of this particular thing until something cool happens, with training going on in the background until then. The scene with the Eevee felt a bit forced to me. (Partly because she (I think) wasn't part of the normal rotation, partly because /of course/ he's able to help with the pokemon that's the most special. But at least it's sort of economical in that it introduces the Eevee and gives him his /I helped/ moment in one beat.)

Noticed some typos but didn't take notes... sorry! Hopefully others will catch them.

^{1} This also doesn't seem to be what you're going for, unlike, say [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11273833/1/Pok%C3%A9mon-The-Line][The Line]], and probably Game of Champions which I haven't read. I think it'd be more fun to read though.
