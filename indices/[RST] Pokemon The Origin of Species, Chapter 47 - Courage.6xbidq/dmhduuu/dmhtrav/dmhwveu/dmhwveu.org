It's an honor to have you respond, thank you. The great thing is you have written great characters; we defend them even when they are wrong, or perhaps its especially when they are wrong? I see Red as a friend. Your challenge was to even find a conflict, with Red being rational he is immune to so much. I analyze because there's more then just a surface story here, and while I may pay too much attention to something unimportant, it allows me to catch some gems as well. You are still providing realistic stimuli that could present challenges to your creations, and I hope not everything is perfect and obvious and intended, as then I couldn't think further on it. Furthermore, introducing insider trading is novel, creative, and a world building detail that impresses me.\\
Laura is a better person then me, that is clear, so I really shouldn't judge anyway.

Thank you again.
