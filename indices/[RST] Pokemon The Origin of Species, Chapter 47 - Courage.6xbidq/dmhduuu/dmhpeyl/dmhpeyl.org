Have you ever heard of a young boy being made the "man of the house" when their father dies? It usually is a little, but important note, in larger events. It adds a bit of background information on why someone interacts one way or another with their mother and siblings. In Red's case his mom fully believing in that idea is a bit loony. But seeing positive growth and strength in him after his father's death?

Seeing him as a potential prodigy of a researcher or trainer?

Imagining him being an incredibly responsible and respectable trainer that involves himself in catastrophes?

All of that is on top of the fact that DaystarEld has raised the competence and maturity of kids in his setting. So Red's mother might hold high standards for him. She may also see him as precious and rather innocent, such that after all of the terrible, spirit-breaking news she has investigated in the past (crimes) that she wants him to avoid getting on peoples' bad sides.

Red will do less-than-legal things (with little regret) if the opportunity is right. I'm not talking about making a rushed decision when lives are on the line. He will shock and disgruntle people while following his heart and standards. In spite of all of his talent and drive his career can take a nosedive if he is blacklisted. His potential will shrivel up if a lucky criminal attacks him with stronger Pok√©mon. His mother believes in him and believe he has earned such confidence from others, but Red has weak points. Red's /hamartia,/ if he has only one, could make this a painful journey.

I agree that his mother will act as an antagonist multiple times in the future. I also think that Red coming to terms with how other people feel and think about his actions is a completely valid way to direct the story. If we want his mother to spoonfeed him "correct" morality then we would've started the story earlier in the timeline.
