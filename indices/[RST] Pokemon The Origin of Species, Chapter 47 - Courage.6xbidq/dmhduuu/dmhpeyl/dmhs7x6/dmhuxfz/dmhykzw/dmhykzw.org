Reading your reply gave me great joy. There is an underlying danger when speaking about topics of mutual passion, which is that we inadvertently offend in our haste to share. Blame any akwardness on me, so no apology is needed, but your willingness to provide one is kind, and I too return the same. In response: 1) Yes, correct, if you mean evilish? A more ends justifies the means? This is interesting, because if Laura saw this in him as a child, it would explain her response! However this is still bargaining with my already incorrect assertion, i.e. daystars response. As we know, anger is very close to fear. Do you also mean he could turn his psychic abilities off? Perhaps its not either-or here, perhaps him doing so would cause him to lack empathy. Perhaps this is further explanation of Blues mental mindset. Red is like his mother: This is a broad statement, and I do agree with it; being generous to say red is inquisitive, brave, cognizant, and has a self defined moral framework that alligns with what is a majority would percieve as positive. Red is also unlike his mother - he has less personal experiences as to how the world works. He is likely more educated in the realm of physical laws. He has selfless expectations of people - he is considerate of oaks time and value, while cautiously using their relationship for mutual gain, and even then hesitantly. He has greater psychic ability. He is more isolated from the cruelty of the world at this time. You did bring up many points, and you are demonstrating a great deal of understanding. Furthermore, not sure if you saw but daystar commented to verify your interpretation of his mom, earlier. I really can't say much more other then it was certainly nice to get a greater understanding of the characters through you. I hope we can speak more in the further, and if you care to recommend any writing to me I would be thankful, and I would be happy to recipricate if the need arises.

Also, on mobile so not my cleanest response. Thank you
