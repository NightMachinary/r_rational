Thank you, I'm glad you feel that way because I get enlivened by your writing, I want to discuss, but always with the attitude of graciousness. While I do enjoy my ignorance at points, being able to discuss your work with you is even better, and even if you gave me your outline, the story is so good it couldn't be spoiled.
