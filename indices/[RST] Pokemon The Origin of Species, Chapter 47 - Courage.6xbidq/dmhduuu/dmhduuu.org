It also is going to be interesting how Red's mom reacts to the news conference. The charecters are all written dynamically, anticipating their actions is as engrossing as the story itself, and adds one more layer of my enjoyment.

I do not like Red's Mom as a character, she is actually in the role of an antagonist. I fell her getting angry at Red caused me to be sorrowful, knowing Red's personality. Her being the closest to him, she's seen no reason to doubt his actions (that I know). He is young, which does not free him from consequences. This could easily have been a teaching opportunity to bring them closer in a dangerous world, and also have a better discussion regarding goals, finances, and the role of ethics and morals in building a platform for long term mental stability and happiness. Does anybody else feel similarly or am I misunderstanding something?\\
I read this story leisurely and perhaps that in itself is a mistake. Thank you, [[/u/DaystarEld][u/DaystarEld]] for your hard work.
