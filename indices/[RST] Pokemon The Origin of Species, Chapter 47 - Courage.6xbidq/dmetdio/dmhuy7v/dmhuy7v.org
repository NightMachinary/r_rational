Glad you enjoyed it so much <3 You're pretty spot on with Red, I see him as being pulled in the directions of his heroes without being able to quite fill any of their shoes, but rather developing into his own unique person: his journey is shaped by the titans whose shoulders he strode up as he endlessly searched for something even higher.

  I think it would be hard to pull off since we live in his head, and this is not the main vibe he gives off

I'm trying to plant the seeds of this in his dissatisfaction with the status quo and the people who he admires. Professor Oak and Giovanni are two people he respects above all others, but Red has been happy to take what both have taught him and still find new ways to pursue what he thinks is most important/interesting/useful to others.

  It recalls the scenes in Worm where we see Taylor from other perspectives. These scenes are some of my favorites. If you can manage to do the same, I'll be impressed.

I love scenes like this as well, I think the closest I've come so far was the one where Giovanni, Misty and Brock discuss the "Young Oak and his companions," but hopefully I can manage to pull more off, despite as you mentioned already tracking these growths from within the characters' perspectives.

  I was not very engaged with the Aiko plot -- it felt like something we just sort of had to sit through. It seems as though it ought to be possible to present the whole arc there in much fewer words/scenes, but I don't really know.

Yeah, this chapter definitely bloated on me as I was writing it: it just kept striking me that the problem I'd set up was a hard one, and thus more and more words kept wanting to be written around their struggles while interfacing with it and trying to solve it, and the natural character interactions along the way also felt important. Aiko seems to be a character readers can take or leave, somewhat replacing Leaf in that role :) Maybe someday I'll develop enough to get (almost) everyone on board with every character!

  The scene with the Eevee felt a bit forced to me. (Partly because she (I think) wasn't part of the normal rotation, partly because of course he's able to help with the pokemon that's the most special. But at least it's sort of economical in that it introduces the Eevee and gives him his I helped moment in one beat.)

Got it in one: I was going to have him diagnose a few others too, but it was taking too long so I just cut them and stuck to the discovery with the eevee. Maybe I should add them back in later if I have some time.

Thanks for the feedback, as always!
