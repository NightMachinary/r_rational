  ...which implies that Zack, at a point in time when he was much weaker in magic, somehow got access to this Item that he currently doesn't know how to access.

I can pitch a wild speculation to that, the item in question is the one from the royal treasury, and the treasury staff has been infiltrated by the cult (would make sense for them to do so, honestly). So if Red Robe is a high level cultist he can have access to that trinket.

How to make Zach place the marker? Mind control, duh.
