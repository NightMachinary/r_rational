Exactly. For anyone else who had trouble remembering this part of the story, it's back in Chapter 4:

  "Ah, whatever," said Zack, rolling his eyes. "It's not like I'll be dead for good."

  Zorian looked at Zach incredulously, not really understanding what Zach was getting at. The lich seemed to understand, though.

  "Aaah, I see," the lich said. "You must be new to soul magic if you think this makes you invulnerable. I could just trap your soul in a soul jar, but I have a much better idea."

  The lich casually gestured towards Zorian, and he suddenly felt his entire body freeze up as if it was encased in some alien force. Another wave and Zorian was hurled with great speed towards the shocked Zach, where he painfully slammed into the other boy. They both ended up on the ground in a tangle of limbs, and Zorian was relieved that at least the unknown force paralyzing him was gone.

  "It doesn't matter if your soul can be reincarnated elsewhere if someone mutilates it beyond recognition before it gets there," the lich said. "After all, the soul may be immortal, but no one said it cannot be altered or added to."

  Dimly, Zorian could hear the lich chanting in some strange language that definitely wasn't standard Ikosian used in traditional invocations, but any curiosity about this was washed away by a wave of pain and unidentifiable /wrongness/ that suddenly slammed into him. He opened his mouth to scream but then his world suddenly erupted into bright light before suddenly going completely black.

He's very intentionally trying to merge Zach's soul with Zorian. This is also reviewed when Zorian talks with Zach in Chapter 7, which reveals that Zach spent some 7 months in a coma, and:

  "It's just that it wasn't only my body that was affected -- my mind has been a little spotty ever since I woke up."

  Oh no...

  "I don't remember how I started this time loop," concluded Zach, confirming Zorian's fears. "Or whether it was me who started it in the first place. My memory is full of blanks like that at the moment. I'm hoping it will all come back to me but..."

Zorian is not brought into the loop by some soul magic getting thrown haphazardly around a battlefield. Quatach Ichl intentionally muddled their souls together, with the goal of confusing soul magic that relies on Zach's marker being exclusive (like the time loop, or a lich's phylactery.
