The reset did happen properly, but I figure without QI there actively trying to mangle Zach's soul with a merge, it would have happened a few seconds faster and without Zorian getting a Marker. One of the Marker's stated functions is to trigger a reset before any major damage can happen to the Controller's soul, if QI was inhibiting the protection, it makes his contribution greater and the replication of such a feat much more difficult. If all QI did was smash Zach and Zorian's souls together then it makes it seem easier for people to get Markers, even if it probably has a low success rate.

Zach's mana capacity per chapter 62:

#+begin_quote
  I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too... convenient to be natural.
#+end_quote

So, at some point before he was aware of his capacity it seems to have been doubled, and the mostly likely event was his entry into the Gate. Zorian didn't have any grasp of his initial reserves at the start of the story, and he was a much better student than Zach. Max reserves are roughly 4x initial reserves, which brings Zach to where he was at the start of the story.

And the most likely mechanism for merging the Controller's loop soul and original soul isn't the Guardian of the Threshold, but the Marker itself, which has several functions, many of which are still a mystery to Zach and Zorian. All the Guardian has to do is place the Controller's original soul with the Marker inside their initial loop body, and the Marker should take care of the rest, duplicating itself and then using itself to merge the two souls into one cohesive whole. Although as I write this I am wondering if I'm flawed in my reasoning since it doesn't assume the Controller's loop soul to have a Marker already, and the world inside the Gate should basically be a perfect copy of the world outside.
