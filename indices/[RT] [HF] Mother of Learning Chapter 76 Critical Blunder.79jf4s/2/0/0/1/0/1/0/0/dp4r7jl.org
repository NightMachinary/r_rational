  the main thing QI did besides the attempted merge was temporarily suppressing the soul-protecting reset aspect of the Marker
#+end_quote

The impression I got was that the reset was working properly, which is why the reset happened as soon as the marker registered that it was taking damage. I guess the restart could have timed out normally, but having that happen right at the moment that Zach and Zorian needed it would have been a pretty big coincidence.

  As to why I think Marker duplication is an aspect of the Marker, it's because I think Zach's doubled mana capacity is because the Marker uses itself as the base to merge the Controller's original soul with their loop soul.
#+end_quote

Could you explain this? Not sure I follow. Are you saying that the marker has some ability to merge souls because when Zach entered the loop, his marked real soul merged into a "templated Zach soul" inside the time loop? I actually have my own (completely unsubstantiated, probably wrong) theory on Zach's mana pool, which is that unlike most people he is a vanilla human with no soul modifications. I imagine at some point soul modifications were a fad and everyone was making shifters, empaths, etc., and along with that there were a bunch of inefficient trash mods like "slight boost to eyesight" that everyone and their mother had access to. These all spread throughout the population and, in their passive state, are soaking up the average person's mana reserves without them noticing. In this case, the unmodified humans are the ones that would have the largest mana pools. I can also see this playing into who gets to use the Sovereign Gate - the gods might not even consider people who were "tainted" with primordial essence, so the Noveda's (who possessed the gate for a long time) would try to keep their bloodline pure.

  Also, is anyone else besides me going to be annoyed if after everything, it turns out that Tesen was RR?
#+end_quote

I hope he's not, but I still hope they discover a reason to slap him around. I vaguely remember QI calling Red Robe a brat or something as he was about to soulkill the aranea, so I was kind of assuming that Red Robe would be a kid. I guess even Silverlake would be a punk kid to a thousand-year-old bag of bones though, so that probably doesn't mean anything.
