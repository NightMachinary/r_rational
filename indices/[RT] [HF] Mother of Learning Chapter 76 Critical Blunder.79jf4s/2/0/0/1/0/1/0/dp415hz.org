I've been thinking that the Marker duplication is due to an aspect of the Marker itself, and that the main thing QI did besides the attempted merge was temporarily suppressing the soul-protecting reset aspect of the Marker. If it wasn't for QI doing that, Zorian would not have gotten the 2nd flawed Controller Marker.

As to why I think Marker duplication is an aspect of the Marker, it's because I think Zach's doubled mana capacity is because the Marker uses itself as the base to merge the Controller's original soul with their loop soul.

Also, is anyone else besides me going to be annoyed if after everything, it turns out that Tesen was RR? As long as he was downplaying his abilities to let Zach beat him up occasionally, it makes a lot of sense, but feels unsatisfying. Tesen would have had a far easier time getting access to the Royal Treasury for the Dagger (for the presumptive soulkill), could have foreknowledge of the Sovereign's Gate, could easily use his status to forge alliances with the high ranks among the Dragon Cultists and the Ibasans. And access to the Ibasans means access to QI means access to the Crown, which is probably necessary for temp soul markers, and he definitely had access to Zach, who was also probably necessary. Also he could have kept Zach in a coma for the first 6 loops after Zorian's inclusion to the loops.
