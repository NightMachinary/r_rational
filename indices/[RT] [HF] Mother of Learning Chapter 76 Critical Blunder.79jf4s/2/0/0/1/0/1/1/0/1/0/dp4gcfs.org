The soul marker seems to have been designed to be at least reasonably difficult to detect from the outside. I haven't reread the earlier parts of MoL recently, but I remember Zorian had some difficulty in finding anyone able to detect it at all.

But even if QI had been able to see a marker on Zach's soul, it's a bit of a leap to go from "this guy im fighting has some interesting thing stamped on his soul" to "this is a time traveler and the only way to permanently harm him is through soul magic". (I don't think QI would see his apparent age as all that strange. Transformation potions are restricted but not unheard of or all that difficult to get)
