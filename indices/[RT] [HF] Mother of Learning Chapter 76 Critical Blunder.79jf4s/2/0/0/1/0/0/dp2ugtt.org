Yeah, but it was a fluke. You could probably do a hundred soul merges on Zach and never get that result again. And it would be quite damaging to both Zach and the recipients. So, yeah, the Gate might not have passed a [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][thorough test suite]], but I don't think any process based on soul merging is a strong possibility for RR's marker.
