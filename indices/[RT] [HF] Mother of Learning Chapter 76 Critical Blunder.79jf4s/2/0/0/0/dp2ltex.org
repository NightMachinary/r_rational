Yes, the marker was seen from Veyers, though, or there would have been no reason to remove Zach's memory of him.

Red was thinking there could be tons of loopers because Zorian happened even after he thought he deleted Veyers and mindraped Zach so that he can't make more loopers. If he could steal the marker, someone else could too and apparently has.
