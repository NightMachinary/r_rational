The time loop only works every 400 years. Pretty unlikely that it was created for the Noveda family heir. Still I think it is possible that the Noveda family did study it thoroughly (as far as I know they were in posession of the gate before it was sold) and they changed something about the gate. They might have found out that it only works during the planetary alignment and with most of the family killed in battle and the rest dying to the Weeping they might have chosen Zach as the next looper.

We dont really know how many years/decades/centuries the gate was in the posession of the Noveda family, so they might have been using it already a few times but I still think it is unlikely that the gate was created by the Noveda family.
