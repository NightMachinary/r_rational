Some 30 chapters ago my theory was that the gods knew they would have to leave the world, and appointed a champion lineage to watch over some of their work, namely primordial prisons. It still checks out.

Zach is very unlucky in that a combination of unforeseen factors reduced the lineage to him and all the knowledge was lost, so he was thrown in without proper briefing.
