One possibility I'm thinking of is that Zach was introduced to RR as a potential teacher, through Varys.

Earlier in the time loop, Zach told everyone he was a time traveler, tried to learn about every classmate, and was also trying to master combat magic. He must have needed powerful teachers but doesn't mention specifically who taught him yet- just that being who he is, people are happy to work with him. It's possible that while befriending or getting to know Varys, he meets RR. Zach lost his house, Varys is being usurped from his- there's some common ground there. Varys maybe gets in better terms with Zach and they decide they can help each other's house, so he introduces Zach to a powerful person... whom also turned out to be a high ranking member in the Cult.

RR is skilled in mind and soul magic, as long as you don't compare to Zorian. RR learns of the time loop because he reads Zach's memories, and sees the potential of getting in and furthering his own ambitions- among which is a successful assault on the city during the planetary alignment. After RR sets up (whatever it is he does to get into the time loop), RR wipes Zach's memories of him, his knowledge of how the loop works, and Varys. As extra measures, Varys is soul killed as well so there is no way Zach could coincidentally lead himself to RR again.
