It seems to me there is a strong possibility that Veyers knows something that identifies RR from /before/ the time loop. Otherwise soulkilling him is unnecessary. After all his mind wipes itself every restart, so you only really need to make Zach forget whatever it is.

Perhaps Zach told Veyers of his plan to use the Sovereign Gate, Veyers shared it with a contact in the Cult of the Dragon Below, who saw an opportunity for him or herself. So RR knows he or she is probably in the loop from the beginning. RR gets Zach to install the temp marker (either by trickery or mind magic) then wipes him, soulkills Veyers, and goes off to do his thing, whatever the hell that is.
