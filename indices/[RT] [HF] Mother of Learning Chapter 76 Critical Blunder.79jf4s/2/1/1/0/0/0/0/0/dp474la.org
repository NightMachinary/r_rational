Temporary markers effectively lasting longer seems undesirable, but not all that critical, provided that the recipient(s) can't actually exit the loop in the Controller's place.

Remember, anyone who lasts longer than a month is considered a person by the Guardian's algorithms, and thus the Controller effectively kills a person by using the ability; the Guardian simply disavows responsibility. The six-month limit is just meant to discourage the Controller from doing that; they're already going beyond what the Gate itself is allowed to do. Not letting the copies escape to the real world is the critical bit.

Incidentally, I've wondered before whether Zorian might be able to point out to the Guardian that since he became a person due to (the programming errors of) the Gate, the Guardian has some responsibility to help him survive.
