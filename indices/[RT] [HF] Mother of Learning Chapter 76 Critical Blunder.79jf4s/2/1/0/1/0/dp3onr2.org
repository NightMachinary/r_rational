Mostly true, although once outside the loop you have to factor in summoned demons(granted, maybe also with angels). Also, I would expect the cautious Zorian especially to behave differently when faced with permanent death outside the loop, and the battle would be a lot different if he chickened out and didn't participate. If the fight at Cyoria or Iasku takes too long, you run the risk of one group reinforcing the other. If things go pear-shaped you risk fighting a lich, demon(s), a bone dragon, and maybe a fully transformed Sudomir all at once or close together. I'm fully expecting a brutal Final Month with Red Robe in the mix, but it could still be pretty bad without him.
