Consider that Zorian hasn't died in a long time, and the closest he came to dying was always when exploring something new.

Without RR the loop works as intended: it lets the loopers to study mission critical scenarios and figure out the best points of attack. For example, the fight at Iasku is completely avoidable. You can assassinate Sudomir and raze the mansion with artillery spells.

That's why there has to be RR to make things interesting: he takes out a big chunk of information about mission critical events and makes this information unknowable within the loop. Without him even extra cowardly Zorian can prevent the primordial summoning. I don't think Zach would ever shy away from danger and he is the big gun. Now, if Zach doesn't get out of the loop, things get interesting, but that's unlikely.

tl;dr: there has to be RR in the final month for literary reasons.
