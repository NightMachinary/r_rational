Those are all good points, and I agree with you anyway regarding RR; just playing devil's advocate and also thought it would be fun to brainstorm just how bad things could get outside the loop.

Also, I forgot that Zorian has simulacra anyway, so his courage level is pretty irrelevant.

The main point of my comment is that the loop is not a perfect simulation, the main example being the connection with other planes. They also have the soulkilled entities back in play, the marked people would evaluate risk differently, and they may also lose the brand when they exit the loop, which would open up other possibilities(can't think of anything helpful right now... maybe better relations with the Ghost Serpent). There could be other differences we don't know about.
