The theory I put forward (and it's not disproved; Zorian is still just speculating) is that RR didn't modify the temporary marker, but rather used compulsions to have Zach keep re-applying it to him every six months. Which could also neatly explain why he exited once Zach became aware of him and hostile to him: he couldn't 'recharge' any more without subduing Zach and performing further mind magic, which he failed to do.

Either way, though, we don't have an answer as to why the Guardian treated it as a full Controller marker and let him out of the loop.
