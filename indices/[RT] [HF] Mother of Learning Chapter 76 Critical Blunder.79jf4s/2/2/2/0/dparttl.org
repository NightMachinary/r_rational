Probably no. Unless by them you mean Veyers and no one else, and assuming Veyers is RR, and his corpse is a result of him leaving the loop. I've outlined why Veyers being RR is unlikely somewhere in this thread, so feel free to look it up.

I'm going to discuss why we have evidence against other people knowing about the loop: because no one acts on it. If they knew about the loop, then upon entering it they have no knowledge what iteration is it, 1 or 1000. So if they subverted the loop from the inside on iteration 1, they should make some attempts on iteration 500 (or whatever iteration we have now, I forgot). This is where they should get busted. To complicate it for them, Zorian has scoured the minds of multiple cultists, specifically looking for anything about the loop and found nothing. Whatever knowledge about the loop there was, it was taken out when RR left.
