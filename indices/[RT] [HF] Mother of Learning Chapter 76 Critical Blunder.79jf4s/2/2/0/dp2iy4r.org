The main problem that I see with that theory is that Zach doesn't seem to have the ability to grant temporary markers in the first place. If the ability is granted by one of the Ikosian artifacts, then at some point Zach must have had that artifact. No easy feat, as we have seen, and Z&Z speculated that the artifact to grant temporary markers is the crown that Quatach Itchl keeps on his head. So, did he lend Zach the crown, when Quatach Itchl doesn't really trust the Cult of the Dragon Below? Seems unlikely.

The other option is that the ability to grant temporary markers is inherent, Zach learned it, and RR made Zach forget it. Possible, and the more likely possibility, but given RR's displayed level of mind magic I'm still unsure.

Thinking about it more, maybe Zach was taught spells by the person who gave him the marker intended for managing the loop. What if Z&Z are wrong about what the dagger and crown do, and the abilities are just spells that need to be taught? RR could have stolen those from Zach's mind, wiped them (because wiping memories seems to be about the extent of RR's memory manipulation), then left Zach to his own devices?
