That's a good point about the lich but honestly, I don't see it being that farfetched. Especially if Red invents a clever enough lie about it potentially being related to the summoning, or if he was a contributor to Quatach-Ichl's gate project. The lich's relative amiability when Zorian killed that vampire heiress, and his "tough but fair" reputation among the Ibasans makes him seem reasonable enough. I guess it depends on what kind of "mundane" divine magical ability the crown might have.

But it's also true that we only have the barest guess that the crown is the temporary marker maker (or even that temporary marker making is conferred by an object at all, rather than a separate ability that must be taught by the Maker or one of His agents).
