I've argued it as an altered temporary marker in the past, but without any certainty. Age of Gods magic was kinda shitty, the modern shaping skills and structured magic seemed like they might have the ability to alter a temporary marker in a way that was never actually intended to be possible.

Still, even if they're right this chapter and it isn't Veyers, but rather someone else using an altered temp marker, that raises a few important questions.

Applying temporary markers should be a privilege of the Controller, probably with the Crown. Unless QI somehow had a hack for the Crown that allowed him to apply a marker despite not being the Controller? And in that case, why wouldn't he just apply it to himself? They could be wrong about the Crown being necessary for temp markers, but then what?

There's also the question of how anyone would know that they were inside the Loop to start experimenting, which still makes me think that someone intentionally activated the Gate a month early. Even if, as Silverlake implies here, that specific knowledge relating to the primordials would give easy, irrefutable evidence of the time loop, that still doesn't give whoever RR is much opportunity to set things in motion if they only found out while inside the loop.

If the Dagger allows Soulkill to be used, maybe RR has links to the Eldemar royalty somehow? (The Dagger is in the royal treasury in the capital.) Alternatively, RR wasn't able to access the dagger at first or didn't know what it did.

Soulkilling Veyers and wiping him from Zach's memory only makes sense if as either a red herring (which itself was nigh-indiscoverable) or to prevent Zach from determining RR by interacting with Veyers. It would kind of make sense if these things happened at two different times, first the memory wipe of Veyers from Zach's mind, and only doing the Soulkill of Veyers much later on when RR got the ability to do so.

It's notable that while Veyers has indirect links to the Dragon Cultists, he still should not have had easy access to the signature "red robe" unless he was a mage of Zach or Zorian's skill, since as far as I can remember those are hidden under the defenses of high-ranking Cultists.
