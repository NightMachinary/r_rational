Since we're talking about soul-killing and people with markers in this chapter...I wonder what would happen if you soulkilled Zach. It's gotta be an unexpected edge case from the Controller's perspective. I figure either (1) it doesn't work at all or (2) it forces Zach out of the loop and back into his real body. If the latter, then it may or may not destroy the benefits of the time loop. I can see this being an (extremely risky) way for him to get out if they can't come up with anything else.
