Zorian and Zach are busting into Noble Houses to train for retrieving the dagger. I'm hoping they hit all of Tesen's extended family and pick up some nice dirt, or at least find the places that Zach's property was sent so they can "repossess" it once outside the loop. Digging into Tesen's brain would probably be pretty useful for that.
