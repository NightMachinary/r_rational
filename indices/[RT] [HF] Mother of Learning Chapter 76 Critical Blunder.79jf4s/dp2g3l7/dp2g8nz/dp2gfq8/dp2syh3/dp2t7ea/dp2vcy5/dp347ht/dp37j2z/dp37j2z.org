They are doing the very same thing with Sudomir though. Sure, Alanic does not need to be as... delicate in his investigation because he has some kind of authority, but it never hurts to check up. If you know what and where to look for, finding a way to fake totally legal way investigate this stuff is easier. One minor slip up exposed to the public can be unraveled into something really big.

I was hoping for a Tesen mindscan for a loooong time. There's still hope by the way.
