It's not about the timing, it's about Zach becoming a monster who thinks nothing of beating someone in general or even just Tessen in particular to a bloody pulp. That could psychologically screw with him when he gets out and turn him into an actual murderer. Zorian expressed similar concerns about himself, that's why he didn't want to ambush and mindrape all the specialists on his list to get their secrets and abilities.

In other words, if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.
