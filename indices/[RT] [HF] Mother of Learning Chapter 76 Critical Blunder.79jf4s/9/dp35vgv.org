Man. And people complained about a chapter without a lot of action for the last chapter.

I feel a bit foolish that I dismissed mucking about with the temporary marker so early as a possibility for entry into the loop.

We've just recently had confirmation that the Sovereign Gates' safety measures are already obsolete in the face of modern magic. Red Robe taught himself unstructured mind magic just to mess with Zach's mind without triggering them, and that Quatach-Ichl bypassed the "soul-fuckery detection" function to do the soul meld as a matter of course.

This miiiiight also explain why Zorian was able to use the soul marker divination to find Zach but Red Robe appeared unable to find Zorian: there's a "stuck" identifier value in Zorian's damaged Brand copy that matches the same identifier on Zach's, and a differing value is enough to make it impossible to use as the key to find another matching marker. Or maybe despite it being possible to wreck whatever makes it actually temporary, the temporary mark might be nearly completely different from the Brand. Though not different enough that it precludes using the loop excision ability (which makes sense if it's tied to an item anyways).

PS: I only just now, writing this, realized that nobody103 has said repeatedly that names are phonetic, and based roughly on Croation. The 'h' in Zach isn't decoration. His name is probably pronounced /zat É/ (zatch). I hope I get "mind: blown" comments so I don't feel alone in this.
