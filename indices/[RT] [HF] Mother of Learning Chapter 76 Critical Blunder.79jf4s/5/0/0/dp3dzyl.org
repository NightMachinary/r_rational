Zorian gains far more from preparation than Zach does, but overwhelming firepower counts for a lot. In the assault on the Ibasan base, Zach instantly launched an artillery spell at a heavily warded building and it cleaved through it. And artillery spells are supposed to be super mana intensive, and long to cast. I'm really not sure Zorian could do anything against that.
