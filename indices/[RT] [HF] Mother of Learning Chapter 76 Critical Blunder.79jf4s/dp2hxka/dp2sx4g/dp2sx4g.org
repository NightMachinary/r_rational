My theory is Tesen is linked to RR. This chapter hinted back at him, saying that they haven't seen him since they started working together and he always had the best spot to know any secret of the Noveda. He could have abused it while Zach was still weak. Plus they fought tons of times together so he could have tried some soul magic on Zach and got the marker that way.
