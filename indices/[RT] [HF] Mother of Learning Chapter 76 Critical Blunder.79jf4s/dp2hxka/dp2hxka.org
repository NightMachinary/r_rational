So, here is my thought with the 'Redcloak is a modified temporary marker user' theory: How the heck did he get the /temporary/ marker. Immediate answer is that Zack, as the probable original marker owner, gave it to him. Well, how did he do that? Current speculation from our protagonists is that one of the seven Items probably grants that ability.

...which implies that Zack, at a point in time when he was much weaker in magic, somehow got access to this Item that he currently doesn't know how to access.

...which would imply that after after he Temporary Marker'd Redcloak, he lost the memory of how to acquire the Item. Presumably it's something rather straightforward once you know how to do it, otherwise this weaker Zack wouldn't have been able to. The protagonists just need to figure out what Zack used to know, and they could probably acquire a powerful tool (bringing some of their friends into the loop temporarily, for example)

Actually, here's a bit of wacky speculation: Zack acquired the information on how to obtain this Item through some sort of interaction with Veyers. Maybe his unique knowledge of fire magic was involved in some way. Maybe Veyers' House knew something that Veyers found out about. Maybe he had some diplomatic route to an Item. In any case, in this speculation Veyers is /not/ Redcloak, but when Redcloak was convinced there were other temporary marker users in play, he acted to keep Zack from setting up any temporary marker users in the future: 1) "Soul-kill" any people he thought might be temporary marker users. 2) Wipe knowledge of the Item from Zach's mind, along with knowledge that might lead to him reacquiring it, such as talking to Veyers again. 3) "Soul-kill" Veyers so Zach couldn't accidentally run into him again.
