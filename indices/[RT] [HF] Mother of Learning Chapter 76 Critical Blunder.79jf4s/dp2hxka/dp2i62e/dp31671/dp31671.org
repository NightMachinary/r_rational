  How to make Zach place the marker? Mind control, duh
#+end_quote

Doesn't even need to be full-blown mind control, which IIRC is pretty hard to do. Just convince him to bring someone he trusts into the loop, Neolu for example, and use transformation magic to appear as that person to get the mark. Then blank Zach's memories so he forgets that he did it.
