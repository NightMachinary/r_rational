He can break any mind shield from non-psychics who can't reinforce their mental shields given a couple minutes to work without interruption, the invisible magic missile is a party trick, he's better than said witch in an area she doesn't specialize in, and he commissioned the design of the war golems rather than design them himself.

In addition to the increased pace of "and we spent 5 restarts doing stuff", another poster said that Zorian is better able to take advantage of the time loop the better he gets. At the start, he basically just followed an average student's path. Go to class, learn spells, work on shaping, read. As he gets better and he no longer needs to do that routine, he becomes able to find ways to repeatedly make literal tons of money, offer that money for normally prohibitively expensive tutoring, spells, and magic items, take what would normally be incredible risks for huge rewards, and more recently use simulacra for a variety of purposes. He seems to be progressing extremely fast compared to how he was simply because he is progressing faster, and it's all explained. Had he tried to pursue the path he has taken in this story, he would have permanently died to the Sword Divers, or in an assassination, or after doing the soul separation awareness ritual enough times, or somewhere else.
