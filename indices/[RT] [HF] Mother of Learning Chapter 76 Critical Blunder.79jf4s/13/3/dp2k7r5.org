Zorian had advantages over those seven years that other mages wouldn't:

- One-on-one instruction from multiple Academy staff.
- Mentoring from an archmage whose approach was basically focused on preparing others to be archmages. You don't need perfected shaping skills in order to be ordinary, after all.
- Functionally unlimited money, allowing an unusual degree of experimentation and practical experience in fields such as alchemy and golem-crafting, plus no need for a 9-to-5 to support himself. Consider: Edwin came from a family of golem-crafters and was obsessed with the subject, but couldn't afford to actually make any designs himself, and he wasn't initially able to understand part of Zorian's blueprint as a result.
- Access to many restricted or outright illegal spellbooks, from the aranea and cultists and various other sources.
- Advanced tutoring from mages on Xvim's list.

And remember how Zach said that with his approach to learning combat magic, you tend to die a lot? Outside the time loop, most mages probably either have safe careers, or short ones.

ETA Also, Zorian's wards didn't necessarily have to be /better/ than Silverlake's, he just needed to stalemate her. And his mind magic is easily explained: first, it's an innate gift, and secondly, unlike most humans, he used the loop to get actual thorough instruction in how to use it. His mastery of magic missile was a deliberate choice as a result of his low mana reserves; Zach has much more overall combat skill, just focused on much more powerful spells that would drain Zorian too fast to be worthwhile. Plus, mentored by Xvim.

If Zorian and Zach fought, those invisible magic missiles would splash off Zach's shields, and Zach would quickly pulverise Zorian's shields in return. Zorian is probably too skilled to be easily taken by surprise, but fighting at Zach's level he would quickly run out of mana.

ETA 2: It probably doesn't hurt either that Zorian uses mind magic to memorise things perfectly. You and I might need to re-read a book, he just creates a memory packet.
