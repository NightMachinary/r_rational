The mind magic and war golems are less of a hurdle than you think. Remember that he has an innate talent for mind magic due to being an empath, so his rapid progress there is not a surprise.

For the war golems, he took advantage of dozens of professional golem makers work. He spent huge sums of money going to many different golem makers having them refine his designs over the loops. Let's say he bought 1 month of polishing each from 5 pro golem crafters every loop. After 12 loops, that's 5 years of pro-level research and design.
