Sure, but his skillset is so spread that it shouldnt progress as fast as it did. Shaping skills gives no bonus to mind magic, soul sensing, or warding. Im not sure if warding and making magical tools have use the same system. The point is, the majority his skills dont build upon each other, unless Ive completly misunderstood the system.

Going from my memory here, he used his first 7 months before Zach woke to get better at schoolwork, and didnt really progress much overall. Then he spent some time getting to the level of a academy graduate, when he leaves Cyoria after Arc 1. He then spends a few months with Alanic getting the basics of soul sense. Then the next year he focuses on mind magic, getting to be absurdly good after around 4 years in the loop. He also starts diving into golem making at this point. Going from a novice to someone who can make war golems in three years of unfocused study.

Where in all that could he have gotten the skills to rival someone who has hundred years of experience in magic in general.
