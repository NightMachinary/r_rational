  Where in all that could he have gotten the skills to rival someone who has hundred years of experience in magic in general.

His skills /don't/ rival Silverlake's in her fields of specialty: potion-making, pocket dimensions. And what he does know about pocket dimensions, he learned from her.

Combat magic isn't her thing, presumably not something she enjoys, so when she's out in the middle of nowhere, with her home practically undetectable, known only to a few, and protected by heavy wards, she doesn't spend time on it. She's easily good enough to fend off tourists, and isn't picking fights with anyone powerful.
