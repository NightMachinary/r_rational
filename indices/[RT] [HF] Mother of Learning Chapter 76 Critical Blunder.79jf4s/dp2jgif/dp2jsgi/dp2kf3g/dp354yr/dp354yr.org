I'm sure you're tired of people disagreeing with you, as I see all the replies are, but I have to contribute. I do have the benefit of rereading the whole thing (and then the world building blog and all comments... just that fixated) just about 8 weeks ago, so let me go through these.

  Shaping skills gives no bonus to mind magic, soul sensing, or warding.

Firstly, there are specific shaping exercises for mind magic, as well as soul magic and warding. Zorian may have a special bloodline ability that makes it intuitive, but his mind magic is still basically the same unstructured mind magic a non-bloodline mage could use, just improved hilariously by his clear sense for minds. Shaping exercises should almost help his ability /more/ than they would structured mind magic (there's a chapter where Xvim helps him with mind magic shaping by dispelling Zorian's mind shell and following it up immediately with a stunner, so Zorian has to train to instantly reform his defenses; I believe it's the same chapter that mentions Zorian finding a book with mind magic shaping exercises that he starts doing).

All shaping exercises help with all other shaping a little bit (this is mentioned very early on: that just doing the basic three---telekinesis, light, and fire shaping---improves a modern mage's foundation for all magic), but raw mana shaping and sensing improves all other shaping much more substantially, and Zorian has also trained that under the tutelage of an archmage, and by using incredibly expensive and rare potions to speed it up (mostly one based on the grey hunter that gives him its magic sense, to improve his ability to sense his own magic while doing raw mana shaping).

And don't forget that there's a lot of time we don't really see, and he's the kind of person who will spend his downtime waiting for someone doing shaping exercises. The benefits of which also carry between simulacrums, because it's still the same soul. Plus, he's had more than 30 days per loop (59, and up to 74 recently) for quite a few loops now.

Warding is just a normal branch of magic, though I can understand any confusion because it's so often used through spell formulae, which are also how magical tools (like golems) are made. But most spell formulae are still deeply connected with normal spell casting skills. Fundamentally, they are mostly used to maintain and enhance a spell that's cast into them: they act as more complex, harder to create, but much more potent and enduring invocations (also understandable confusion, since chapter 11, Limiters, published some... +three years ago?+closer to five, was the main time that was covered in detail, and it's quite explicit that improved shaping spells make for improved magical objects).

As for the timeline, he doesn't merely get better at schoolwork in the first period, or improve to graduate level, he gets to the point where he meets Xvim's insanely high standards on both the telekinesis and light shaping exercises and games the loop to get accelerated, apprentice-only instruction from Ilsa until he learns to teleport (when he starts this he believes he's already good enough to test out of the academy, which in the real world at least often implies more raw ability than completing ones courses), a skill that seems to be far ahead of typical-graduate level.

Now consider the main ways he rivals Silverlake: he's able to bring massive combat golems with him only because he has the divine relic orb, and he's better than her with wards (it's likely that his disadvantage using a small portable wardstone vs Silverlake's permanent ones is matched by his wards being defensive and hers offensive). Wards are actually one of the important components of golem making (half the reason golems are useful is that you can completely cover them with wards powered by ambient mana), which is adjacent to his core interest in spell formulae, and one of the areas he's had at least an actual year of hyper speed advancement via hiring and rehiring some of the best warding experts across the entire continent with his bottomless wallet and carrying journals across restarts. Hell, it's entirely possible that the specific blue-print for that stone he uses to beat her wards is something made as a collaborative effort by dozens of top experts in Altazia, and it's pretty much explicit that at least parts of his golems are too.

On the other hand, his alchemy abilities may be impressive, but they're not even in the same league as someone who's made a potion of unaging, and we know little about her ability in soul magic, divination, transformation, and many other fields.

And truly, age isn't everything. Xvim is only a mortal, but was able to block everything Quatach-Ichl (a thousand +year old gods-touched lich) threw at him.

+Though uh, perhaps in support of your point, Silverlake was there for the coming of the Ikosians. She's probably over 400 years old.+ One more edit: I had a sudden doubt and looked at the chapter itself: "When I was born the covens had already been on their last legs," so that actually puts a ceiling on her age, rather than a minimum.
