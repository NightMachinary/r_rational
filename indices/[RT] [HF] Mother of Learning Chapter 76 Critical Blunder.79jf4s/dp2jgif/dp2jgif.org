RANT.

Zorian seems to have powered up way too much in arc 3, compared to how long he has been in the timeloop. Around 7 years since he started looping, he transformed from a first circle mage, to someone who can apparantly rival Silverlake, a century old witch.

Earlier in the story he admited that without the time loop he would never become an archmage, but now, 7~years later, he can pretty much break any mind shield, cast an invisible magic missile, ward better than a century old witch, create war golems, and who knows what else. In my opinion he progressed way to fast, compared to what I remember of the MoL lore.
