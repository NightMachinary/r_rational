He has far more help and knowledge than he would have without the loop. Just like Daimen had the skills for the Gate-Spell but lacked the spell itself. In the MoL world people lack knowledge but once you have that knowledge acquiring the skills is rather easy. And especially in the last few months he has been using simulacrums to solve some problems. Think about the defense spell in the previous chapter that was created with his individual shaping excercises in mind. He didnt even create the spell himself, he paid experts to do it for him. Learning that spell afterwards is easy. And you shouldn't forget the extra time in those time dilation chambers they found, making every month into 2-3 months.

I dont really find that strange. Once his shaping excercises reach a specific point, learning new skills is supposed to be easy in MOL Universe.
