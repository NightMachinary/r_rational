I don't think he's quite rivaling Silverlake here, he basically just displayed his defenses, and made a note that it's a lot easier to establish defensive wards than offensive ones. She also stated that she's not a combat specialist either. His past year in the loop is closer to two years with time spent in the Black Rooms, and they've had basically unlimited funds to acquire top class teachers and training aids. While the simulacra can't directly impart skill to Zorian, they and his associates can do a lot the legwork to get Zorian to people that can help train him.

But yes, his growth in the past 1-2 years has been pretty extreme.
