I asked nobody103 on the world-building blog about gaining an ability to do without sleep. He said that he decided that it was possible, but it could have unpredictable effects on the mind, and so very few mages tried it. That not quite the same as making some kind of... soul bonded alarm clock effect, but might point at it as being too risky to try.
