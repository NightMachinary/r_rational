That's a good point. Something to keep in mind at least.

If Zach's description is roughly accurate, it's possible RR has no way to wake up earlier than he normally would, which may not be close to the 2am start. I'd guess it would take some risky soul or mind magic for one of them to wake up early on the first day of a loop.
