Hey, here's a possible cause for concern: we've been told about RR attacking Zach at the very start of the restart, apparently having rushed over without doing much beyond putting on the robe, presumably to take Zach unaware.

Except that we know from Kael's examination of the aranea that the restart doesn't begin at the moment Zorian wakes up. It begins at something like 2am. Wouldn't RR have tried to make use of that? If he could have attacked while Zach was asleep, his ambush would have actually succeeded.

Is it possible that it didn't really happen the way Zach described? He's the only source for the event, and we /know/ that his memory has been altered by RR before. And he hasn't let Zorian examine his mind since then.

I think it's pretty clear that the guy still in the loop and working with Zorian /is/ Zach. A disguise would slip eventually, over the years they've been working together, and the combat skill and mana reserves he's displayed make it pretty clear IMO that he's the real deal. But what we think we know from him about RR may not be true.
