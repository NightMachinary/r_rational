Technically it's the legal principle that if the Police or similar authority acquire evidence illegally, but then show that they could have or did find that evidence legally, the evidence isn't thrown out. Where I think the implication here is that they'd sift Tesen's mind for info, and use that info to find hard evidence that would be admissible, and never reveal anything about any mind violations that occurred in a divinely created simulation of the world.
