Zach is frustrated that he can't beat up Tesen at the start of the loop. What's stopping him from doing so near the end? It's not like anyone aside from Quatach Itchl is a serious threat in combat to him, so a surprise attack doesn't matter.

Also, Zorian could probably get information on shady things Tesen has done. That could be useful in a court case, depending on what Zorian finds.
