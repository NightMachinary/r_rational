We know that the Gate is normally activated during the Planar Alignment, and that activating it even one month early cut down the number of iterations it can run hugely (going by the "eleven lifetimes" comment we got from the legend of the Sovereign Gate, maybe by a factor of ten).

But it's been mentioned outright, in the story, that Zorian thinks the Primordial's prisons are special, possibly bridging between the Gate's pocket dimension and exterior reality, and that he might be able to use them to somehow get out of the loop safely.
