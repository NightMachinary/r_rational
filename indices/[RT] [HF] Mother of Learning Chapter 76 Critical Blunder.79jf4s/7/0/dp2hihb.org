No, I think telling the truth worked out just fine. They started by omitting any information about the time loop, and SL became extremely suspicious and nearly started a fight. After explaining the time loop thoroughly, she's just going to ask a few questions to confirm. Given that she knows that they outclass her in combat ability, and know specifics about her home, she's not going to piss them off for no gain. And she sees quite clearly that having Z&Z on her side can be extremely profitable.

Also, someone mentioned above that the title refers mainly to Fortov and Daimen, and possibly SL as well. Z&Z didn't make any substantial mistakes here, even if the initial diplomacy could have gone better.
