I don't think the temporary marker can be re-applied to souls that already have it, though. So that would mean RR's soul and mind would have gotten reset every 6 months. I guess he could have stored his memories in Zach's mind using memory packets, but he couldn't have stored his soul's growth, so he would have repeatedly lost all his progress at mana shaping and capacity.
