  I don't think the temporary marker can be re-applied to souls that already have it, though
#+end_quote

But there may be workarounds for that. Eg unlike the Controller marker, the temporary marker presumably does not embed itself into every part of the target soul; it's designed to be removed. So, presumably it's possible for RR to deliberately remove it during his last month, ready for the Controller to bestow a new one, thus maintaining continuity.
