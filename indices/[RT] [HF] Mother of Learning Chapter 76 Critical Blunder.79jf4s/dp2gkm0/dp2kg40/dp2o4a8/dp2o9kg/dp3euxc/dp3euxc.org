er... no.

You are kinda forgetting that the gate recreates the whole world from the template /including creating new souls/. That's why the limitation was placed in the first place, these new souls are eventually destroyed. According to the guardian killing off one month deviation from the original is not considered morally wrong. I don't agree personally, but that's what the story says and we gotta roll with it. That's the whole reason this 6 month-limitation exists in the first place. Cheating it with something as /trivial/ as simply overwriting is uncharacteristic of the guardian.

With that in mind, here's what the loop does:

#+begin_example
  take a snapshot of the world
  take the controller's soul out of their real body
  while the controller is inside:
      recreate the physical world
      populate the bodies with new souls that are not marked 'soul kill' # soul eject is a better term
      insert controller's real soul into their body
      iterate temporary markers
      insert passengers' souls into their bodies
      try:
         run a month
      except:
         something goes really wrong with the controller's soul or some primordial shit shows up
      finally:
         pluck the controller's soul out of their in-loop body
         if a passenger's marker has more time scheduled: 
            pluck the passenger's soul out of their in-loop body
         collapse current iteration # every soul not taken out is destroyed
#+end_example

This means we never remove temporary markers, we only apply them. Instead we just discard expired passengers just like we discard any regular one-monthers

Besides, it's just basic security. You do not mess with your Master branch! You only apply small patches to it. Should something go /really/ wrong with the gate, worst case scenario the real controller does not return and becomes a meat puppet.
