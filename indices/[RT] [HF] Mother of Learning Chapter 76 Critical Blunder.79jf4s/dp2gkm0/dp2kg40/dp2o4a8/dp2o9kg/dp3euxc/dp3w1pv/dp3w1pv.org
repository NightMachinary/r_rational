#+begin_quote
  we just discard expired passengers
#+end_quote

That approach might work, but it's not what the Guardian described:

#+begin_quote
  "And by temporary, I mean that the target of the lesser marker will retain their memories and abilities for up to six iterations before the marker dissolves."
#+end_quote

Theoretically, when such a marker is already close to dissolution, I would think a skilled soul mage could give it a good nudge to speed up the process.
