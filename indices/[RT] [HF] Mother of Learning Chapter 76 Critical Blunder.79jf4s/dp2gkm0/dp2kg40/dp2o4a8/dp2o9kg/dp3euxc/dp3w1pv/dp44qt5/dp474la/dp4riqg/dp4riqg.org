  Zorian might be able to point out to the Guardian that since he became a person due to (the programming errors of) the Gate, the Guardian has some responsibility to help him survive

This is pretty smart. From the standpoint of what I would want to try in this situation, I would hope that I could come up with this idea. In terms of enjoying the story, though, I hope he doesn't do this because any ending that results in two Zorians outside the loop is going to be emotionally unsatisfying to me. I would rather see them find a loophole that lets Zorian replace his pre-loop self.
