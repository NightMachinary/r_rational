The demons are a valid point, but they are at least partly off-set by angels. They do make thing a bit more difficult tactically, but not strategically. I.e. demons are irrelevant if your plan is to ruthlessly assassinate Sudomir and some mission-critical cultists and then raze Iaksu with artillery spells.

The long-term fallout is completely beyond Zorian's and even Zach's abilities. Remember, Ibasans took some important military island base, once this becomes known, it's war. Z&Z would be useful, but they aren't irreplaceable so they can sit that one out.
