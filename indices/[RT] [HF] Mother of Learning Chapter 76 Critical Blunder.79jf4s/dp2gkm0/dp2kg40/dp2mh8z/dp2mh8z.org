This makes a lot of sense to me. Also, it would explain RR's unhinged anger with Zach (repeatedly bashing Zach's head into the ground); RR knew his time in the loop was running out.

Here's another idea that builds off your theory, although even I don't find this idea likely: RR never found a way out of the loop. He was able to confuse the Guardian enough to bar the Gate, but finally could not exit the loop. From a dramatic prospective, this idea would be so anticlimactic that I find it totally unlikely.

They'd still have a lot to deal with post-loop though, so it wouldn't be /that/ anticlimactic. The threat of RR has given ZZ focus and they've both benefited tremendously.
