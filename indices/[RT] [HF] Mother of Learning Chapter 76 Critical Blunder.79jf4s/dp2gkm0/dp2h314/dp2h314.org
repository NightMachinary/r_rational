Zach is the original looper and as he liked talking about the stuff, he invited Veyers into the loop.

Then someone in the cult noticed Veyers was a bit too good and mindraped him, getting the marker and meddled with it until he got it permanent.

Then Zach needed to be dealt with, and the best way would be to wipe the memory. It needs to be wiped from the stuff Zach used to get Veyers into the loop.

The temporary loop clearly has to have been used, only one could have been the original looper, Zach. So Zach already has known about at least some of the artifacts.

Zach kinda has to be the original, because if RR was original, there would be no need whatsoever to make Zach permanent. Only other reason of Zach being permanent would be if someone completely different was the original looper and he tested the thing with Zach, who they believed would not be a threat and RR stealing the loop from that different guy then.
