Depends on what you define as "Noveda family". If Noveda family just so happens to be the last branch of the first Emperor whats-his-name family tree then it becomes pretty plausible the gate was created for the Noveda family. Well, not for Novedas specifically, but for the heirs of the first emperor. That are Novedas (read: Zach) in the present time.
