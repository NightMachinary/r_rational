I definitely used to assume that Zach started out with knowledge of the loop and the abilities to add temporary markers and excise people, and then Red Robe messed with his memory. But with connecting the orb to the gate, and finding out it had abilities tied to the loop, their theory that the dagger and crown are the excise and temporary marker abilities makes a lot of sense.

I may or may not keep to my original theory that Zach knew things about the loop, but Red Robe was able to acquire the crown and dagger for him to give him those abilities.

I definitely started assuming as of last chapter that Veyers and Zach got along (sympathy, doing badly in school and having your house legacy stolen by adults? It's a one-two punch), Zach told Veyers about the time loop, and Red Robe heard about the time loop via the lawyer, and then did whatever.
