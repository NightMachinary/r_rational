I'm on board with the Veyers and Zach getting along theory.

But that crown and dagger bit, it's a problem. How do you get the crown? Even the Master Cultist can't go and say 'hey mr Quatal-ichl can I borrow your crown for my project I won't tell you about?' Maybe they are wrong, the crown is responsible for something else entirely? I don't think /anyone/ in the world has access to the crown. The lich just doesn't seem the sharing type and is also undefeated.
