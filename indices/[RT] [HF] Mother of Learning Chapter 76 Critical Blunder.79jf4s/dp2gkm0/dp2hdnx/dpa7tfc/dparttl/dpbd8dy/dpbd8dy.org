  Unless by them you mean Veyers and no one else, and assuming Veyers is RR, and his corpse is a result of him leaving the loop.

I mean one specific cultist, who probably found out via Veyers because he knew what to look for. Possibly someone who had access to the crown already. Then they soulkilled Veyers and mind wiped Zach to cover their trail. Veyers could have been soulkilled before Zorian even entered the loop.
