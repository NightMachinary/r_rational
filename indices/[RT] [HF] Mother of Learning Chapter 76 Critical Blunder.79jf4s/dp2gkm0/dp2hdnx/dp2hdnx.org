Well, the temp marker theory was discussed around the time we learned about it.

There is a theory that Veyers is Red Robe. My objection to that is that pre-loop Veyers has no skills whatsoever to manipulate something as complex as a marker, even if a temp one is less complex than the original. And he doesn't have the potential to learn anything that complex in the extra 6 months that the marker would give him. I mean, his specialization is fire magic, something completely different.

My theory was that Zach in an attempt to stop the invasion alerted some top Cyorian official, that also happened to be a to cult member. Now /these/ people are skillful mages, so potential to manipulate the marker is there. And they have a motive not only to unleash a primordial, but to do is as smoothly as possible. After all, their target is mind controlling it, so naturally they are seeking all the chances to raise probability of success and survival.

Now, Veyers being a spy for the cult offers another vector to Zach but that ultimately leads again to the very top cultists. Veyers is a link, just as Zorian said.

I guess something normal Veyers did in the original version of the month leads him to Zach. Maybe he confronted him, seeing Zach as the reason for his own failure and then something made Zach spill the beans. If this happened with any consistency, he had to be removed.

edit: you know... after reading this chapter I kinda start to think this very plausible! That remark Zach just made about the losers' solidarity. They had A LOT in common in that, Boranova was the biggest loser of his class, and not entirely his fault. The unruly bloodline talent kinda made things hard for him. I can see Veyers seeking to punch Zach in the face, similar how Fortov seeks Zorian albeit for a different purpose. Sure, Zach would enjoy being prepared and kicking Veyer's ass... once. Twice. Thrice, maaaaaybe? Somewhere down the line I see him trying to figure this out and then sympathizing for the guy.
