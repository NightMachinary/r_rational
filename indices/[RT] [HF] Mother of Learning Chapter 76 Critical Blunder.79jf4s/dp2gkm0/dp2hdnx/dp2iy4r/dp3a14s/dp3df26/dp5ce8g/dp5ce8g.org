Ch. 26:

#+begin_quote
  As for the lich, he was utterly unfair -- nothing seemed to scratch those bones of his in the slightest. Zach actually managed to blow his shiny armor to bits with some kind of black bolts and even knocked the thing's crown off its skull, but nothing ever made a mark on the bones. What the hell was that thing made of?

Seemed inconsequential at the time when the crown was basically just a part of the lich's costume, but may be relevant if they just have to get their hands on it. Also, Zorian was quite successful against the lich shortly after this by touching him using Kael's coin of soul banishing. And Zach has some black blades, and Alanic a golden orb, and Xvim the magical prowess to go toe-to-toe with the lich in Chapter 60.

Gettingthe crown would be difficult and risky, but seems doable, especially if they can get support from a large battle group again. Finding the lich early would likely be an important step.
