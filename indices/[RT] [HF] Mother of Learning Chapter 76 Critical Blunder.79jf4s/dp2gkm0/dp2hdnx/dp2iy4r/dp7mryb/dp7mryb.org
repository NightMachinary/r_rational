What if Zach originally had the knowledge about the locations of the artifacts? After all it is possible he had worked his way into the Cults ranks to steal magic/abilities at one point probably to gain access to those artifacts. Considering how Zach played various people and factions to learn new tricks he otherwise would have been unable to and some of his quite reckless past action sin loop subtlety isn't really his first choice with situations.

Veyers is likely a link in all of that and a key incentive may be the crown and dagger being both easy to access through the (tenuous) relationship between the Cult of the Dragon Below and Quatach Itchl. With the right deal I suspect the Lich would be willing to borrow the crown especially if what he thought he could gain from the deal outweighed the losses.

This sort of involvement would give access to the artifacts and also lead to a perfect situation for a cult member to find a way to trick his way into the loop especially if Zach had given him extra time via the temporary marker to find a way to prevent decay and trick the guardian into thinking he was a controller, two separate functions which may very well be connected such that fixing one may fix the other depending on what variables encoded in the markers are used to indicate status.
