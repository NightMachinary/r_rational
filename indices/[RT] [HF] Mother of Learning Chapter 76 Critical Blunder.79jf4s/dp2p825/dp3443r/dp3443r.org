This is actually something I'd considered. I wondered if their assumption that he had just woken up was a red herring against the idea of him being a very early waker with a couple hours on Zach and Zorian, which might come to bite them in the rear when they leave the loop.

But after thinking about it on my second read through, I'm putting less weight on that idea. His concern about Aranea or others he missed at their colony, in the chapter Soulkill, seems fully genuine, which makes me think he rushed there almost as quickly as Zorian, and thus he must wake up pretty close to the same time as Zach and Zorian. It seems feasible they're in a kind of culture where there's a certain typical hour for waking up.

It's pretty hilarious that Zorian only got up at that time because of Kirelle, since he likes to sleep in normally.
