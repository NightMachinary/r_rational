We've observed very little, deduced a bit more. He hasn't actually demonstrated much soul magic, except that he hunted Zorian with soul perception. He claimed to use soul magic on the aranea, but it turns out that's just a Controller ability; still, he got a soul marker somehow, so he likely had necromancy skills even pre-loop.

His mind magic was inferior to Zorian's, but that may have just been his unstructured abilities, and for a non-psychic it was probably an impressive showing. His structured mind magic may be far more advanced.
