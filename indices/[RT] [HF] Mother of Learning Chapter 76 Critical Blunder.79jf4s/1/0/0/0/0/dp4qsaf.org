The critical blunder on Silverlake's part could be about telling them about the primordials when she didn't do so in the previous time loop. Last time, she didn't believe them but didn't even try the "very easy way to check if [they]'re telling the truth or not"?

That implies the previous version of her kept back the information on the primordials for a reason that the current her doesn't know at all.

Or Zach and Zorian are making a critical blunder with their assumptions/guesswork about Red Robe.
