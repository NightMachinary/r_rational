I doubt it; I suspect that she's just going to check the connections to the primordial pocket dimensions, and prove that the world is under extreme time dilation compared to them.

That's assuming that the primordials are outside the loop. Which I think is a reasonable assumption, because if the gods were capable of routinely creating and destroying them, they wouldn't have needed to lock them away in the first place. And if even gods can't deal with primordials that way, I doubt that the Gate can.
