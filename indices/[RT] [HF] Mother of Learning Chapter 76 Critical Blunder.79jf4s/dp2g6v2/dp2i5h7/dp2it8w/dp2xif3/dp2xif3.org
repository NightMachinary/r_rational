I'll admit I didn't keep up with [[/r/rational][r/rational]]'s MoL discussions lately, but back when I did, there was the following theory: the time loop is one of the safeguards of primordials' prisons, such that if a primordial is ever released, it initiates the restarts and tasks the Controller with stopping it from happening.

Of course, it needs to be reconciled with time loop's mechanic as we know it now. Since there's no real time travel going on, this system wouldn't be able to /prevent/ the primordial from being released, only triggering after it already happened.

Perhaps there's a copy of the world constantly running in a parallel dimension, one month ahead of the "real" one? But it would be imperfect, with no access to astral plane, which makes it dubious as a security feature. Hmm...

As a matter of fact, it probably isn't the primary intended purpose of the time loop, as The Guardian of the Threshold doesn't mention anything of the sort in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/55/Mother-of-Learning][Chapter 55]], saying that the time loop's purpose depends on the Maker and the Controller. I'm thinking that /if/ it is used as a primordials' prisons' safeguard as well, it was supposed to be operated under gods' oversight, and since they have disappeared, it activated, but picked not a person suited to the task, but somehow marked based on inheritance (?), and didn't explain itself.

Or were you referencing something else, [[/u/monkyyy0][u/monkyyy0]]?
