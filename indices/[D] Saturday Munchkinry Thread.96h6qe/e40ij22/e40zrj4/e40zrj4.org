There would be soon only some millions left of me.

Maybe I need to explain that.

I often joke: If I ever got a time machine I will kill myself (in the past), to see what happens.

Now, I'm not stupid (or suicidal), so past-me would know what future-me plans to do. And so past-me plans to kill everyone that looks like future-me (like exact copies of me).

Of course, I would probably not follow through with that. But if 1% does start killing copy-me's, the rest will start too. And some will be able to start a nuclear war. Or be in a lab with highly deadly diseases.
