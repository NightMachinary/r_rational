  If I'm the one who instantiates the change, I refuse to do it because that's killing 7 billion people and also needlessly putting humanity at risk.

Not just at risk. If all of humanity becomes one person, the human race would almost certainly be extinct in a lifetime. There's a slim chance of avoiding extinction if the person to get copied is a reproductive-age woman with a background in assisted reproduction technology who is willing and able to use sperm from sperm banks to create viable, genetically-diverse offspring. In this case, it's conceivable that inbreeding could be avoided by producing at least multiple sequential generations as quickly as possible, before the preserved sperm loses viability, though viability loss might happen in under a year if continued electrical power cannot be maintained.
