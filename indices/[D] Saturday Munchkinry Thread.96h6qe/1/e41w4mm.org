You are given the following mission, along with another, randomly chosen human:

#+begin_quote
  Exactly [X time] from today, you and the other person who got these instructions must both be in the same location (within 1m of each other). If you are, you will both be rewarded handsomely. If you aren't, you and everyone you know will be tortured and then killed. You have been given the equivalent of $[Y] USD cash in your local currency to achieve this.
#+end_quote

What is your strategy?

Choose your difficulty:

- 6 months and $10,000
- 48 hours and $10,000
- 6 months and $0
- 48 hours and $0

You know nothing about your counterpart, except that they were given the instruction in their native language, they are between the ages of 18 and 60, and their IQ is above 70.

EDIT: maybe the threat of torture is going to make people focus too much on not getting tortured; instead it's Fabulous Prize Beyond Your Wildest Dreams for a win and Sad Trombone Music And A Modest Fine for a loss, if that helps you think of something other than /murdering everyone you've ever met before the genie tortures them/.
