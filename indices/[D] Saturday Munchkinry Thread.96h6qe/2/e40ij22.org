Every human on the planet is suddenly replaced with an identical copy of you, each copy indistinguishable from you in your current state. Some fudging is involved in cases where your copy would be in a different position or velocity than you (e.g. sitting down in a car while you are standing up at home). Clothes and protective equipment are resized to fit the copy so it's unlikely anyone will die immediately, but the death toll will probably begin to rise quickly after a few seconds (car crashes, power failure, dangerous environments, etc.).

Some possible variations to this scenario: - People are replaced not instantly but gradually over time. - You know in advance/are the one who instantiates the change. How do you plan for this scenario given a day, month, year, decade, etc.? - Only people's minds are replaced, but not their bodies (as closely as a mind can be without replacing genetic information, meaning that some people may initially have your memories, skills, and personality but develop radically differently over time)

How do you make the most out of this scenario or any of the variations?
