If I'm the one who instantiates the change, I refuse to do it because that's killing 7 billion people and also needlessly putting humanity at risk.

If I know it's going to happen in the future, I make sure I obtain piloting, driving, and navigation skills so that a greater number of my copies will survive. I also try to obtain a good fundamental knowledge of everything, so that each of my clones can rapidly specialize after the change. I compile learning resources of very many fields on the internet--I try to make sure specialized knowledge is available of many fields for immediate download, so that when the change occurs specialization can be rapid.

At the moment of the change a race starts, between 'how long does it take for infrastructure to collapse' vs 'how long does it take for my clones to learn how to do every single human job without anyone to teach them'. I'm not optimistic about our chances of success, but I take steps to make it more likely my clones and I will survive.

Combine that with 'hidden illnesses are likely to kill us all at the same time' and 'everyone is genetically identical', and the outlook for humanity is particularly poor. If I have enough time before the change, I try to set things up to rapidly increase genetic variance (ie reproduce a lot in a short amount of time with the help of technology and stored gametes) but I don't think that's a challenge I can prepare for adequately.

It would be hard to convince anyone that this event is about to occur. If I can somehow convince others, I get their help setting up genetic banks and guides for professions so that the transition doesn't have to be the end of humanity.

In the case that this happens unexpectedly, we're probably doomed. All of my clones (which are copies of me and share the same goals) try to immediately figure out a way to make non-cloned humans from whatever genetic stores happen to be around. I don't think I can figure that out before the power shuts off. Any clones that can figure out what they should be doing to help maintain infrastructure obviously do that instead--so if I find myself in a powerplant, I'm going to try to keep it running--but again, without the specific knowledge it won't be long before everything falls apart.

In the case that the change is gradual, I figure out how to set things up so that humans are invulnerable to my copies replacing them. If that isn't possible I focus more on transferring knowledge. Depending on the rate of replacement, we might be able to transfer all relevant knowledge and also discover a way of reproducing in the long term: then 'the species of blasted0glass' takes on new goals. I don't consider that species as worthy as humanity, but it is better than nothing.

In the case that the change is 'mind only' and not entire bodies, the infrastructure collapse is unfortunate but not species-ending, so the long-term chances of survival for humanity are much better. I think this is the situation I prefer if the replacement has to happen at all.
