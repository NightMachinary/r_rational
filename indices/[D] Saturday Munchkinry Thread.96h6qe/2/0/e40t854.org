"Oh fuck, where's the captain and why am I in his seat! Holy shit, you're me too! What the fuck is going on?"

"I don't have a fucking clue. I'll check in the back, but stay here and look at those controls, try to get familiar with them just in case. Don't touch anything yet." /Unclicks seat belt and gets up./ "Goddamnit how do I open this fucking door."

"Okay fuck, it's dark, is there a cellphone in my pocket? Oh, a flashlight, that'll work. Okay, there's the steering wheel-like thingy, there's the throttle, there's the horizon indicator, level, good - thank god everything is in English - but what the fuck is this TFC knob? STD? RST? CTR? Hold on, where's the fuel gauge? Speed, altitude, hydraulic pressure, dammit copilot's stuff is the same, where the fuck is the fucking fuel gauge?! VOR, ADF? Heard about that, no idea how to actually use it. Seriously, this is not cool, where in the everloving fuck is the goddamn fuel gauge?! I'm gonna die. Wait, there's a button there that says fuel. Oh my god. What happens if I push it? Okay, there's a button near it that says gear, does it possibly dump the fuel? Not gonna press it to find out."

"Yo, we're all the same fucking dude. For real. No captain on board. We checked."

"Oh my god." /Pauses./ "I don't even know how to ask air traffic control for help. What if I'm fucking air traffic control too?" /Pauses again./ "Okay dude, go tell the others to start making calls if they can, see if they can reach someone with an internet connection to find some instructions for us."

"It'll be tricky. I heard a few of them saying their phones were locked and the language appeared to be Chinese."

"Oh fuck."

"Yeah."

"Umm, alright, well then have them try to work on it, and maybe someone's phone will be unlocked and they can make a call."

"I'm on it."

"... okay, back to the fuel gauge. Fuck fuck fuck, not it, not it. Wait, there! Total fuel 36.3 kgs x 1000. Okay, not sure if that's a lot, but it seems to be going down very, very slowly. Alright, theoretically, this thing is on autopilot and we're headed almost straight towards an airport with a long enough runway for a skilled pilot to land on it. Just maybe not me. Let's see if I can pull up a map."

"Hey, there's no cell service but one guy got his phone working over the in-flight wifi, called a random contact on Skype, the contact is another one of us but he has access to Google. He wants to know what type of plane we're in."

"Oh fuck. Um, it has four engines. The fuel tank holds at least 36,300 kilograms of fuel. Fuck fuck fuck. Okay, your lanyard says Cathay Pacific on it. Ask for someone to check their tickets, maybe they can Google what flight we're on and figure out what kind of plane this is."

"Be right back."

"... oh fuck, we're all gonna die. Okay, map. Sweet, there it is; wait, fuck, the knob says MAP, is it an acronym or an actual map? Alright, just in case, I'll wait on that until the other Me comes back. Let's figure out the autopilot settings. What the fuck are all these fucking buttons on the ceiling? No, no, no, no, no, 'Ext pwr 1?' Does that fucking shut off the power? Oh god. Alright, no, no, no, not it, oh cool a compass, alright I give up on the ceiling shit, maybe on the front panel."

"Okay, we got the flight number, we're looking up what kind of aircraft it is right now."

"Good, hey, I'm trying to figure out where we are at the moment, I found this knob here that says MAP, I think it's probably safe to flick it and see if we get a map. What do y-"

"Dude, the passengers have a display of where we are, it looked like we were over the Pacific heading towards the coast of China. I swear to god, just leave the fucking switches alone until we get more information."

"Got it."
