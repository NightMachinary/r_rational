I assumed that I can split the wish because it is hard to say what counts as "one wish" - I could wish for sorcerous power, which might let me do such things as divining what others would have done and resurrecting them. The powers you wish for don't even have to be magic - eldritch IQ should be quite enough to implement the other's wishes. If we assume the "one" must actually stand for something since the dark figure said it, we could hope it to mean "finite".

If we later find out the wish isn't even strong enough to undo the deaths (perhaps it's fueled by the sacrifice of 99?), we can agree ahead of time that the wish can then be spent another way.

It isn't a great method of finding trustworthy people, but in the end even blood sport could decide who gets to make the wish. In that scenario, a fitting wish to spread word on would be to grant everyone mana proportionally to the probability they had to win. It might even appease the dark figure if he's the sort of DM who would be annoyed by their coliseum becoming a hugfest. (That mana is then spent on what they would have wished for - perhaps they think their dead family deserves resurrection more than they do.)

As for participant bias, I think desperate wishers and munchkins who realize that resurrection is possible are more common than bloodthirsty killers, but maybe that's just my bubble.
