If those number of people have to be thinking of someone simultaneously, I think you could make a society function. If enough people are thinking about a group of people, does the effect split between them? Because books could be authored by multiple authors to keep the effect down. Humanity would be split into City States of limited populations, with limited information sharing between their populaces. Scientific knowledge could be shared, because scientists/engineers make up only a small percentage of the population, but cultural information like novels and music would be really limited. The city states would be ruled by councils of people, each presiding over a smaller slice of the city, coordinated by a higher level council for the entire region. Any edicts or laws are shared to the population over the course of days, so that the number of people thinking about the council at one time is reduced. The exact details of the governance are kept secret, so that control from the higher levels are always thought to come from the lowest level, so that the higher up people don't die.

Children are taught to never think of the author of a work, and all factual knowledge is written to remove any humanization. The reading is dry, but it allows for knowledge to be shared. Psychology never really gets off the ground, because no one wants to participate in a study that could mean perpetual headaches and potential death.

Actually, cultural stuff could still be shared. Van Gogh, for example, was never famous in life, but his paintings became priceless years after his death, when people saw them. Artists and authors could only share their works locally when they're alive, but after their death they could be shared everywhere. This would likely lead to a conservative society, because classics are the main works that people read, and new works dealing with modern issues are extremely slow to spread.

War between these isolated city states could be common, although it might be dampened by being able to remotely assassinate pro-war people in other cities. Unless both sides want to go to war, in which case war becomes completely inevitable, killing people in other cities is a matter of sharing their name to your own people who want peace. It would be an interesting dynamic.

If this effect appeared in modern times, society immediately collapses as anyone of influence almost immediately dies, and the people who realize what's going on won't share what they discover because they will be killed for sharing the knowledge, since the cause of why so many people in power are dying would be huge news. The world would regress and decline until the society I outlined above could be proposed without the proposer dying.
