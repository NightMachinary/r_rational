  Imagines 10 tons of meat materializing in front of a tribal villager. That's local currency for people that still barter goods >_<

OK, let's do this. It's dried meat for ease of transport.

I'm one of the Sentinelese, who are not only an uncontacted tribe, but they're doing everything in their power to remain so.

One gimme: my mate Greg speaks another, nearby language to a small degree. Very few people except probably for the Sentinelese live in completely monolingual bubbles so you gotta give me that gimme.

"Those people who come sometimes, the ones we keep killing for $reason, there's a lot more of them then there are of us, aren't there? And I've just gone and asked everyone else on this island and none of them got the offer, and I would notice if someone got a huge amount of dried meat. So I guess I've got to get out of here. Greg, I'll give your wife a month's supply of meat if you come with me, since you grew up on a neighboring island until you were 6 and still remember some of the local language there. Good? Good. Let's go. We'll take as much meat as we can carry, that should be enough to get to any of these local islands, which for all I know could be the only place people live."

--------------

"Greg, is he telling the truth? The Earth can't have /that/ many people on it. Okay, where do most of them live? 'Chi-na', never heard of it. Okay, let's go there. Wait, they're saying that people won't take dried meat? But it's really good meat! Better than fish, I think it's from one of those animals that washes to shore sometimes. Okay. What do people take? Coloured bits of paper? I hate these people and their crazy superstitions but let's do it. Will they exchange the coloured paper for some of the meat I left back home? I don't trust this coloured paper idea so I'd want to keep the rest of it. Coo, they will if we promise to escort them because our island tends to shoot visitors? That's fair enough. Tell them we'll need to do it afterwards, we only have 36 hours and it'll take too long to row - what the fuck is that thing? They say that can get to our island in twenty minutes? OK, but that's only because I don't want everyone I know to get horribly tortured."

--------------

"Cool, so, Greg, can you have them take us to this China place? Wait they are telling us we need to fly like a bird? Oh god in one of those horrible metal things we keep shooting? I don't like this. But I'll sacrifice myself for my family if it comes to that. Let's go. What, we need another person with us? They speak /another/ language? What do we need three languages for? This is stupid."

--------------

"So, this China place we're going to - very comfortable seats, by the way - where do most of the people live? Oh, the most important city is a place called Beijing? Let's go there, then. Oh, that's where this thing is taking us? Really convenient. Oh, it's a building that is full of people from all over the world who have just arrived? That sounds like my sort of place. If the other person doesn't live here, they'll find us, right?"

SOON, AN AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENT AND HER BEST FRIEND ARRIVE IN BEIJING INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND SCOUR THE ARRIVALS TERMINAL. NERVOUSLY, THEY FIDGET WITH THE CYANIDE PILLS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE POCKETS

"You know what Stacy, I thought this was going to be impossible - I mean, even if they thought to go to Beijing international airport, we'd never find them enough to get within 1m of them - but there's two guys here dressed in loincloths with a huge pile of meat in front of them, glaring at everyone."
