  tribal villager: yes, because they can get to Tokyo airport in 48 hours if they wanted to, and $10k would give them the means; you'd have to hope your villager would suddenly be motivated to work out how big the world is

/Imagines 10 tons of meat materializing in front of a tribal villager./ That's local currency for people that still barter goods >_<. Good luck carrying that out of the wilderness and exchanging that for a plane ticket.

Also, even if by some miracle they arrive at Tokyo airport, there's still no way for them to get within 1m of me except by pure chance, since they wouldn't understand the language of any sign I hold up, nor would I understand their tribal languages. Unless the Mysterious Force has a unique avatar I can draw on my sign.

  Geez, cyanide pills and mass murder: you munchkinry friends are a crazy bunch. If it makes you engage with the problem more, nix the torture/murder part and instead put a more Wholesome But Still Terrible consequence.

The reason we're thinking about failure is because this mission is really hard if the other person doesn't have internet. Other than hoping for a miracle like happening to choose the same location to be at after exactly 48 hours, and even then the 1m restriction makes that exceedingly unlikely. Though I suppose, we could try something clever about the 1m restriction: Graft tons of extra skin onto yourself, in long strings that you can drag around. Lay down massive trails of skin and hope that the other person is within 1m of your skin strings.
