  Geez, cyanide pills and mass murder: you munchkinry friends are a crazy bunch.

So sane it looks crazy. (Don't trust people who make that excuse!)

  Imagines 10 tons of meat materializing in front of a tribal villager.

If that happened to me, I'd hold a feast instead of bothering to try to find this random other person. Two birds with one stone--lace the meat with poison.

  Graft tons of extra skin onto yourself

Ah, what about cremating yourself and using your $10K to finance someone's travel to all the major population centers, aerosolizing your remains? With six months you could probably diffuse into the entire atmosphere. Your friends and family will miss you, but at least you know you did the right thing.

Edit: It occurs to me that I could amputate both my legs for the aersolization and get almost the same benefit, minus my death. So... just have to work on convincing people I'm sane at that point.
