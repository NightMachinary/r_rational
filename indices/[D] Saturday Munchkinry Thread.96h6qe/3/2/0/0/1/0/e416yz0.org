Well you could tell the genie at the beginning: only if I win, tell me the phrase "c3p0 is more annoying than sith jar-jar." Or something like: Only count my wish if I say 1234 before and after.

Now, you have a password for a safer communication. If I wasted my wish with this: "Make him see you telling him 'you won' and report back what he says."

You could find out if you where in a simulation.

If the genie accepts the 1234 rule you could always say: "i wish this never happened."

And still make your real wish.

If I wished "make him believe he won and tell me his reaction", a password is useless
