It is the morning of the 1st of June, just past midnight. You are having an incredibly vivid dream. A dark, indistinct figure has appeared before you, offering to grant you a single wish if you will compete in their "Great Game".

The Game is this: you and 99 other people in your home town/city must fight to the death, with the last survivor being crowned the victor and awarded their one wish. An intangible sphere will enclose an area 3 miles in radius, centred right in the middle of your town/city. If you step out of this sphere, you will die. Over the next 30 days, the sphere will shrink continually, until it shrinks away to nothing at midnight on the 30th of June. Only you and your opponents will be able to percieve the sphere - to everyone else it will be completely invisible.

Would you take the figure's offer? If so, how would you go about achieving victory over the month to come?
