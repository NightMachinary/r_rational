Every person in the world has a power. If they think about another specific person, they give that person a very slight headache. If only one person is thinking of you, it's so slight you wouldn't even notice it. But if ten people think about you at once, you can feel the slight headache. A hundred people at once and it's annoying. A thousand people and it's a full blown headache that makes it hard to concentrate. Ten thousand and you're in constant pain, you can still walk around and do basic things like eat, but it's impossible to think about anything difficult. A hundred thousand and it's debilitating, all you can do is lie on the ground in pain. A million and you're unconscious. Ten million and you basically die instantly.

The type of thought doesn't matter, as long as you're thinking of them the effect happens. You also don't need to know their name, or even really anything about them. If they use a fake name, it still applies. Or if they are referred to with a title. Something generic doesn't work, "the person who killed my parents" wouldn't. But "the general commanding the army who killed my parents" would.

This doesn't just happen overnight, but has been the state of the world throughout recorded history. Leaders are impossible. Once a few thousand people know about them, they get crippled by daily headaches. Widespread sharing of ideas is also impossible. Something like "the author of this book" is sufficient to trigger the condition, so a book that's printed a bunch would get the author killed.

How does society develop? Are there still cities like we know them? How would someone or a group of someone's rule without being crippled?

Alternatively, what would happen if this started overnight in our modern world?
