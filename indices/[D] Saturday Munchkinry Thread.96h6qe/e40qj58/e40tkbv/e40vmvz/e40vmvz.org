I think in my original idea the effect would not happen at all if you were thinking about a group of people. So a council would work fine. But it would have to be a true council, cause if there was an internal leader who led votes or was the deciding vote all the time, someone thinking about "the person who did this" would end up targeting them. It would be interesting if the effect was shared equally. You would need larger and larger councils to govern larger and larger groups. And they would still be vulnerable to attacks from rival cities.

I also considered having only negative thoughts cause the effect, so harmless thoughts wouldn't. Or even having positive thoughts negate the effect in equal measure to the number of negative ones.
