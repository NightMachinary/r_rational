Decentralized command would be the name of the game. If a thousand people thinking about you at once is treated as an occasional occupational but not life threatening hazard, a group of 20 people could be the council for a group of 50,000, because it's really unlikely that most of the people in such a subdivision would be thinking about the council simultaneously. You wouldn't get cities the size of IRL ones, but you would get things that are recognizably cities rather than small towns, since the subdivisions wouldn't necessarily need to be geographically isolated. Higher level councils could decide on broad goals, like "improve education" or "more healthcare", while the lower level ones make specific policy like budgets and individual laws.

I don't think that having groups be immune from the effect would be interesting. You would just have groups of the minimum immune size replace what individual people do IRL. If the minimum size to be immune to the effect is 3, then people elect groups of 3 people as the leader rather than 1.

The effect would make alliances incentivized. You REALLY want your neighboring cities to be friendly with you. Not doing so means sporadic assassinations of the people that they dislike most. Collectivism would be the dominant ideology, with individualism and capitalism being extremely unstable. Lethal force would be just too easy, and too hard to control. Just send a few thousand letters to random people with some cash telling them to think of someone at a predetermined time. Digital age information transfer would make it even easier, just text them instead, or put a message on TV.
