Geez, cyanide pills and mass murder: you munchkinry friends are a crazy bunch. If it makes you engage with the problem more, nix the torture/murder part and instead put a more Wholesome But Still Terrible consequence.

Assume that the evil force messing with you is playing reasonable fair in that it's physically possible for you to meet in 48 hours (i.e. not in a coma about to die, stranded on an island, or in space). But nobody's got immortality because of it or anything.

So, going through your questions:

- astronaut: no

- tribal villager: yes, because they can get to Tokyo airport in 48 hours if they wanted to, and $10k would give them the means; you'd have to hope your villager would suddenly be motivated to work out how big the world is

- deserted island: no if we're talking /Castaway/; yes if we're talking /Survivor/

- collapsed cave: no

- coma / about to die: no; I'd assume a coma patient would not be able to get an IQ score of 70 in a comatose state (which I guess would automatically rule out anyone who is asleep being offered the deal, so I will quickly state that the deal was offered to you in the middle of the night and the Mysterious Force woke you up to do so, just to demonstrate you can't use timezones to narrow things down)
