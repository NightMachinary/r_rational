Randomly chosen human? What if it is literally impossible for you to meet up in 48 hours? E.g., if the randomly chosen human is an astronaut in space, or a tribal villager in the middle of nowhere who doesn't even know civilization exists, or someone stranded on a deserted island or stuck in a collapsed cave? Or worse, someone in a coma or about to die?

The mission is especially cruel because it's going to be nigh impossible to convince everyone you know that they are about to be tortured and killed in 48 hours, and should commit suicide before then. You would have no choice but to murder them to save them from torture, and even then it is difficult to kill everyone you know within 48 hours.
