That's rough. There's almost a fifty percent chance my counterpart has no access to internet, almost a fifty percent chance they have an IQ below average, and a 4/5ths chance they don't speak English.

To summarize, my strategy is to advertise and head to the location I expect my counterpart to head to.

First I put the exact wording of the request on the internet, so if we happen to share English and they search for it they can find my listing. I will translate it into various languages (Mandarin, Spanish, Arabic, basically in descending order of popularity). If time permits, I make a page dedicated to the problem and advertise it online, to garner interest and increase the likelihood that my counterpart notices.

For the same reason, I register e-mail addresses related to the problem. For example, "[[mailto:findmebeforeXtime@whatever.com][findmebeforeXtime@whatever.com]]", or just "[[mailto:xtime@whatever.com][xtime@whatever.com]]". I e-mail the already-registered addresses to check if they are the person I'm looking for.

I find an expert in finding others--a private detective, say--and ask for them to interpret this problem.

I endeavor to use social media and the fact it is a weird story to make my case widely-known. If I can make the news, that's great news. The problem with this strategy is imitators and trolls: for that reason, I keep secret the amount USD that I was given for verification purposes.

If I have only 48 hours... well. I request that anyone reading this pretend they are in that situation, decide what to do, and see if it matches my own strategy (The following): I would head to the most populous urban area on Earth--Tokyo, Japan (according to Wikipedia)--and wait in the airport with a sign until time ran out. My hope is that my counterpart thinks the same way and ends up there. I decided on this after having found no better way to decide where to meet--I thought about landmarks, uniqueness, etc. I discarded the north pole as unreasonable, and various other cities as only important locally. I hope my counterpart also has a passport.

Final thing: I get cyanide pills for myself and those I know, to be placed in the mouth just before x time. This is just in case anyone wants a way out if I fail. I suppose I'd warn the police as well, but I suspect the evil djinn playing this prank can circumvent the police. I hope the djinn doesn't think to prevent a person from biting down.

If I get to choose, I choose the easiest difficulty or not to play. I doubt the reward is worth the risk.
