I'm not sure how I was convinced myself that the event is about to happen. I wouldn't even try to convince anyone else without some sort of evidence... I can't imagine what it would be, though.

I hadn't considered the 'kill first' angle. If I thought it would work, I'd consider doing it myself. Humanity is at risk after all.
