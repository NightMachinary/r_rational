I suspect that this is understating the difficulty of convincing others. Supposing you do actually succeed in convincing someone that they are about to be replaced, you now also have to convince them that killing you won't stop them from being replaced. If you try to do this convincing on a large scale, odds are either no one believes you or someone puts a bullet in your head.
