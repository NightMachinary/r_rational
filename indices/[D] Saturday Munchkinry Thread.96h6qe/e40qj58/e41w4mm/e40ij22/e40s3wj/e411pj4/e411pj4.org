I will assume that this wish has cosmic, but finite power, you can wish for more wishes but their total power doesn't grow, and therefore your reward can be seen as a finite nonregenerating mana pool for arbitrary magic.

Spread the word that among your wishes will be to resurrect everyone who would have wished the same for you. Arbitrary magic is quite useful for acausal trade.

At the beginning, it is unwise to try to kill people you meet - it has a good chance of getting you killed instead, and if you succeed you're still 1 out of 99. Also modern citizens seem like their psyche might have problems with it. Teaming is OP. Try to find people who will at least pay lip service to planning to make the above wish, which shouldn't be hard, because who wouldn't?

With luck, the team grows to encompass everyone or almost everyone, and then this is turned into a social deduction game. Good wins if the town can agree on one trustworthy person to make the wish, and a system of exiling people that does not lead to anarchy before the game is over.
