What would you do if someone argued that there's no way of knowing if you're allowed to wish for more wishes? It may well be that one wish is all you get, and/or the dark figure may reject any wish that is too complex (so trying to phrase your one wish to get multiple wishes-worth of utility won't work). After all, you weren't explicitly told that you could wish for more wishes - that's pure supposition on your part. And if you can't get more wishes, then spending your one wish to resurrect everyone, and effectively render the whole Game moot, would be a massive waste.

On top of that, remember that the Great Game is voluntary. All 100 players willingly agreed to the dark figure's offer. They all agreed to compete in a blood sport, revolving around killing their fellow man. That will likely skew the competitors more towards being treacherous murderers than the average person. Your mass-alliance plan could be compromised by its very first member. How would you account for that?
