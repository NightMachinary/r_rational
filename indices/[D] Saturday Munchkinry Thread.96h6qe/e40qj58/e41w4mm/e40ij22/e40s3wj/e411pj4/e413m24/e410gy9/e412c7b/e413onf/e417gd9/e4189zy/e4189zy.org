You complain about the wording for a wish in a fantasy setting we don't know the rules. And give fucking stupid worded wishes yourself. Loophole: I can wish for the document to be true... as my second wish... i don't get one? Uups.

The genie would need to give me the password. And I said it depends on the wish and gave examples...

Most wish granting powers have as a rule no more wishes. Did I skip OP stating otherwise? Or what you can wish for? Or when (for example at the start when you have to decide if you play)?

So what would happen if I said no? 100 people running around killing not more than 6 miles away for 30 days... Maybe without me knowing why. (Memory loss magic) i could leave, but would I?
