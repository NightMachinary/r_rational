The group doesn't just want to make this have never happened, that would be pointless, they could have just refused to play. If the wishing power is only just enough to resurrect everyone who died, this plan is stupid.

If you hallucinate that you win, of course you imagine him telling you the password you set up.

I could imagine the solution to end up being something like twenty people drafting up a contract reading:

  If Sally would have wished this document to come true, she gets resurrected and a pony.

  If norax1 would have wished this document to come true, he gets resurrected and his portion of wishing power converted to money and donated to climate change lobbyists.

  If Yudkowsky would have wished this document to come true, he gets resurrected and a hard drive whose contents maximize the future satisfaction of humanity's CEV.
