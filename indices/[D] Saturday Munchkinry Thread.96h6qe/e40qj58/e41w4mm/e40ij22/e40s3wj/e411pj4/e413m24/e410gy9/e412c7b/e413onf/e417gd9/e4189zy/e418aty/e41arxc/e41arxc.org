  Most wish granting powers have as a rule no more wishes. Did I skip OP stating otherwise? Or what you can wish for? Or when (for example at the start when you have to decide if you play)?

I will confess to intentionally wording the rules of the wish ambiguously, to obscure what one could actually achieve with it. The idea being to leave some doubt as to whether or not killing 99 people for one wish would actually be worth it.

However, my intent was that you wouldn't get to discuss the wishing possibilities with the dark figure at the start. You would have to accept the terms of the Game at face value, and just hope that you survive to get your wish.
