I'm not sure if I'd actually take it.

My strategy would be to take the offer, rent an apartment as close to the city center as possible. I'd fill the apartment with provisions on the first day, and also a trunk to hide in. I'd enlist the help of my friends to move as fast as possible--in fact, I'd also get a friend to be the one to sign the lease so that they can leave later and make the house seem unoccupied.

I'd tell my friends of the circumstances and use them to get things I need from outside.

My logic regarding this situation is thus: killing people directly is a great way to get arrested or stopped by non-participants. It's going to look suspicious when murder rates shoot way up in this location, and the perpetrators die inexplicably when taken out of it.

So I have a friend call in a chemical attack threat. They'll evacuate the area. I'll hide in my trunk, and other participants won't know to hide--they'll get violent with emergency services and get taken out one way or another. If that is insufficient to remove the competition, I'll have another friend let the authorities know that terrorists are hiding in the area and that they'll attack anyone trying to remove them (they will!).

Maybe hiding in something other than a trunk is better. I feel like this strategy could use improvements. Suggestions welcome.
