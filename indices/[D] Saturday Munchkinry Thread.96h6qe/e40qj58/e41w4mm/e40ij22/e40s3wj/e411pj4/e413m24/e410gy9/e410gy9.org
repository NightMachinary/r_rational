Yeah, I would take it. Depending what he can fulfill. Immortality for all? New knowledge? Changing the past? Giving me enough power to make more wishes true, than he will. Or just a plan with enough information to achieve my goals.

I would try to let the other 99 people know, I will wish for everyone to be alive. And that I want to work with anyone who wants together.

If I really win, I will wish something else. Like no oil or coal or gas in the earth (or better so cheaply available). Of course I would first check what would effect climate change the most. Or what the guy do.

I would try to win by forming a group with the others who want and kill everyone inside the bubble. Maybe starting fires.

I would also get outside help by employing mercenaries. (The dark web will help, even if most hitman there are police officers.)
