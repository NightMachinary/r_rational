In that case I would act like I said I would.

Trying to get a group together. Maybe even writing a contract with a loophole.

Maybe using secretly a mercenary as middle man. (With headphone and videocameras)

Getting hitman to kill the others. And poison for my group. If I remember correct, there are some that show symptoms only after 2 weeks.

Starting fires and drive by shootings. Blaming other players and hoping police will catch them.

Maybe getting safehouses by secretly killing the people in houses/flats. And hoping nobody moves in within the month. And police will lose interest after two weeks.

Also I will have the bubble shrinking measured and monitored. Trying to kill others so that most players are in my preferred area.

And the evil and immoral stuff (that can be pinned on me or can't be kept secret) will only be done after other players made the public aware of something (like calling an evacuation or burn down whole neigboorhoods)

So my starting strategy is to act like a group player, and keep my head down, while getting hitman and mercenaries to kill the others.

While getting prepared in secret for the endgame. (Safehouses and weapons) And information where the bubble center will be
