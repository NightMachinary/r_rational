Well, maybe, but I think you're assuming that the way the skills are arranged on the character sheet means something? The skills' position and their actual governing stats seem only loosely related, for example Art appears to be under MEN but in fact its primary stat is CHA, and Skin Magic next to SOC has primary stat KNO (Ch. 30). So I don't think you can reasonably make any conclusions about which stats govern which skills from the layout alone.
