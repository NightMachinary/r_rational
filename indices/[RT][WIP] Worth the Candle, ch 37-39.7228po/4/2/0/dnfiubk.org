Blood has rather good drawbacks for the cost. The fire one is a light source, short ranged attack, and is capable of negating overheating through exercise or environmental effects. The cost is body heat, which repleneshies quickly. The heartbeat enhance thing is not only fantastic for speed, but is also a decent melee attack. I wonder when he realizes that combining a super punch with a weapon makes it vastly better, regardless of if your hand is strong enough. Make Anyblade into a halberd or long sword, then do the heartbeat punch to swing it impossibly fast.

Also, throwing weapons. He could probably throw his special dagger /through/ someone if he notices the synergy.

Both blood spells have a minor or even situationally beneficial cost, and hes only just begining in blood magic. I think he might reconsider his decision to focus on physical stats if he gets some pointers on what blood magic can do for him.
