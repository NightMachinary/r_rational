Sorry, I didn't think this counted as a spoiler.

Our most recent character skill listing was at [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27331518][the start of chapter 34]]. The undiscovered skills are just written in light grey text, so as readers we can see them clearly by highlighting with a mouse. Though I suppose anyone reading on mobile might have a harder time doing that.
