  So contrary to typical expectations, to maximize pure combat power in the long term, he would have been better off maining the social stats. Though that might give weaker results in the short term.

As you say, it's better long term but worse short term. Given how his life has been from coming to this world, it's only been recently where picking the physical stats seems like the objectively worse decision. Maximizing the magic abilities takes time to learn actual spells and uses, rather than the "I am now stronger and better with swords" of the physical skills.

I'm personally curious about steel magic. Metal bender? More for large scale things? The potential utility is amazing.

Side note, and only because I finished this story recently: what happened to that Quill guy's sword? It appeared to be able to cut through steel, and was by far the best weapon seen at that time. Sure, not a good primary weapon until he learned to use it, but even now it would be valuable to have a weapon with unexpected piercing power.
