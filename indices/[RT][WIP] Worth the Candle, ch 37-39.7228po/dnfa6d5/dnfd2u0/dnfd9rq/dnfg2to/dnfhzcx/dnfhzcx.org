Perhaps this gives us some clue as to the nature of the reality Joon finds himself experiencing. In plenty of RPGs your main character can never learn to be a farmer even though there are clearly farmers in the world growing food. So there are a number of options as to what the skill list could indicate:

- There could be more options than listed so far.
- The list might represent a fixed set of skills which the game system can support Joon in learning beyond natural human learning.
- It might be impossible for Joon to learn skills other than those listed.
- There might be future-narrative-prediction involved such that the system only lists skills which Joon will end up learning during the course of his plot.

Specifically regarding your example of flower magic, an earlier chapter said that some sorts of magic aren't able to be learned by just anyone, but may depend on uncontrollable factors like bloodlines or such. Flower magic could be like that.

  There were twenty-seven different kinds of magic, and that was the conservative count. Many of those only included in the less-conservative count were hereditary, racial, or otherwise not the sort of thing that was available to just anyone. Looking at my character sheet and assuming it was laid out in a sane way, I would have access to at most fifteen of them, though probably less. (I was extremely interested in learning more of them, but Amaryllis thought that all the low-hanging fruit had already been picked. That didn't stop me from asking questions, but she was right that there were significant barriers that it didn't seem like my ability to learn things really quickly would overcome, or which would be useless to us without the necessary resources to capitalize on them.)
