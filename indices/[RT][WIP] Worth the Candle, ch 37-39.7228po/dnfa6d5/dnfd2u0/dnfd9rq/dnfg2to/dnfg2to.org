Those aren't all the available skills are they? I don't see flower magic there. Just how many skill types are there?

I feel like they might be a problem. The thing is there's woodworking and horticulture, that kind of specificity kind of implies chemistry or architecture or masonry as just as viable skill classes which implies hundreds or thousands of possible skills covering every profession or subject. That seems like a bit much and overly complex. Or like why are pistols and shotguns their own skill classes? If they are then it stands to reason crossbows or whips would be too. If there's such a deluge of skills then there's some serious potential to stack lots and lots of virtues.
