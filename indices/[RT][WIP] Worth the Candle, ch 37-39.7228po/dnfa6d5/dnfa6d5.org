+Haven't yet finished reading the new chapters.+ Thanks very much for the entertaining story, cthulhuraejepsen =)!

Regarding Joon's recent efforts to min-max the system, I think it's somewhat ironic that he is missing some key information. He considers the social stats to be dump stats like in most games. However he did notice that of the magic he is familiar with under the mental stats, they don't seem to be as all-powerful so far as he would hope.

We as the readers are aware that many of the strongest magics are actually classified under the social stats. Gold Magic and Revision Magic we've already seen to give variations on straight-up invincibility and other superpowers. Wards seems like the most exploitable generalized magic he's seen so far. Of the skills we haven't yet seen, Library Magic (SOC) certainly sounds much more useful and exploitable than Livestock (MEN) or Woodworking (MEN).

So contrary to typical expectations, to maximize pure combat power in the long term, he would have been better off maining the social stats. Though that might give weaker results in the short term.

As part of the irony here, this allocation of the strongest magics to social skills seems like exactly the sort of expectation-subverting humour he recounts using as a DM. Oops. Hoisted by his own petard.
