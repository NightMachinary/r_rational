This is /Worth the Candle/, a self-insert litRPG portal fantasy with some harem elements that is probably better than you would think it is given that description. I may need to get better at blurb writing. Click [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126][here]] to start at Chapter One or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249?view_full_work=true][here]] to get the entire work on a single page.

Book I comprises ch 1-14 (~60K words), Book II is ch 15-33 (~80K words), and everything from 34 to present (~40K words right now) is Book III.

Apologies for the delay, I kept thinking that I would just do a multi-chapter release once I had hit a good mid-book stopping point, but it kept taking longer and longer to get there, and then eventually six days had passed. While this story does not have a definite release schedule (because that's how I like it) I do think that six days is probably a bit longer than I personally would like, especially if the chapters are just piling up and waiting to get posted.
