I assume you'd realistically swap out the penny for, say, a quarter? Reason being, you don't want to show up at a bank with tons of bills with the same serial number. Although I suppose if you choose to split up your stash through various banks, you MAY be fine. But I don't know how stringent they are at checking these things internally, so you could still possibly get caught.
