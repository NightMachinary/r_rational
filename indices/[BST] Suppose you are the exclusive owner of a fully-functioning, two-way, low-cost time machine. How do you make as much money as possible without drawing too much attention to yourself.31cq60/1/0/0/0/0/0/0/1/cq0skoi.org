Indeed. If somebody ever invents time travel, they'd have to very carefully test it. They could fuck up their own family tree and never see their loved ones again, as an example. On the other hand, an orphan might save his family, and give an alternate version of himself a different childhood. You'd necessarily end up with two versions of yourself with every backwards jump.

I like the idea of "read only" past time travel (a type of #3). There are so many mysteries that could be solved, it would totally make up for the inability to change anything.
