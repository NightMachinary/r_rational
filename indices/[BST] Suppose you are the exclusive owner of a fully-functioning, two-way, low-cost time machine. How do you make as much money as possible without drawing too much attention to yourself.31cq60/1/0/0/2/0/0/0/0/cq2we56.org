I think you're unreasonably pessimistic about immortality. But, whatever.

I'll put a blank piece of paper down on the table, walk out of the room, and turn it over just before I go to the future. If it now says "OK to go #NNNNNN" with the next sequence number correct, I'll go into the future, check out out, come back while I'm out of the room, and write the message. If not, I'll make another post on reddit and try again.
