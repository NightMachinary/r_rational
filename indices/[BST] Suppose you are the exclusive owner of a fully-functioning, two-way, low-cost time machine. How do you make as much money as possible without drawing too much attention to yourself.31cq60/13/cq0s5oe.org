I'm curious. Has there been any stories or hypotheticals on how time travel affects economics if more than one person has access to time travel? How about a society where time travel is common?

Because I'm working on a story where the time travel model is a stable time loop (with a duration of at most three days) with a significant portion of society having access to it (it's their magic system) and I've been bashing my head against an imaginary wall trying to think through the economics of it.
