This strikes me as akin to gaining the ability to teleport and using it to ensure that you never miss your bus again. Money is just so /limited/ a goal when you have time travel.

The first and most important question is whether this is a single-immutable-timeline universe or if it's a multiple-branching-worldline universe (these are the only two types of time travel that are logically consistent).

If it's the immutable timeline type, you don't have to worry about disrupting the markets - they have already included the effects of your time traveling and all you'll do with your efforts is to make them turn out the way they did. So if you want to make scads of money in this scenario you'll need to do it secretly. False identities, shell corporations, buried treasure you can dig up later, that sort of thing.

If it's a multiple-branching-worldline universe, there's two strategies you could take. One, you could try to emulate the immutable-timeline scenario by working hard to be behind the scenes. This is a lot trickier since it's actually possible to fail at that in this scenario, but on the plus side if you fail you can just jump worldlines and try again. Or two, you could just "go nuts" and steal as much high-density valuables as you can cram into your time machine and then cache them all at some point in the past before your depredations. Then maneuver from there into a worldline that you didn't otherwise tamper with.

Personally, though, I wouldn't be so worried about wealth. I'd want enough gold coins stashed under the time machine's seat that I could get stuff done no matter where I wound up, but my main purpose would probably be technological and social betterment of humanity. I'd try to craft a better world to live in rather than trying to be rich in this crappy old current-day world.
