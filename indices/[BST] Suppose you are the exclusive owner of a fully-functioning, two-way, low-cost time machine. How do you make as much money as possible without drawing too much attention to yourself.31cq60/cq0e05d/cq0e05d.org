Use the time travel machine to win a big lottery once. This is your seed money. Winning the lottery once is hardly suspicious.

Then use the money to start an acquisitions firm. A company that buys out failing companies and restructures them to be more profitable. Design the company such that you draft operations plans that the company then follows for months/years at a time. With someone else as the executive officer.

Then buy out a company, and make a plan to flip it (and give it to your 2nd in command). Travel 5 years in the future to see how profitable it is. If it's not profitable, go back, try a different plan and/or company, repeat.

From core-timeline, you'll just appear to be a business savy genius. It's not exactly low-key, but few people go from nothing to wealthiest-man-in-the-world without some public scrutiny. Maybe even throw in some big public failures from time to time to make it more believable.

Maybe at some point you can branch out into the insurance industry. I suggest moving to Omaha first, if you go this route. Because this is basically Warren Buffet's plan-to-get-rich (except replacing "being born wealthy to start with" with "winning the lottery").
