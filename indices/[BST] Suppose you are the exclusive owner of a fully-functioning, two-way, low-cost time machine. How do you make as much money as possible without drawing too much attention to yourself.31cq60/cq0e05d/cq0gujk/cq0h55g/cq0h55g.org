That has the downside of being far more suspicious. Even if you're very hands off, at some point you're going to need to give them a nudge.

Also, a lot of modern technology required many peripheral advancements to be viable. Modern computers required advancements in materials science, miniaturization, manufacturing techniques, design techniques, ect ect. Many other products are similar.

There are relatively few cases where a new technology came along by itself. And if some lab started pumping out discoveries in 4-8 entirely different fields of research that all converged together, that would be both notable and highly suspicious.
