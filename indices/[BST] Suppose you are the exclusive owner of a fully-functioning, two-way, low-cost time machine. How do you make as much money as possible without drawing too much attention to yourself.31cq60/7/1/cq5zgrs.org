If you're trying to be subtle about it, don't bother mining; just buy up a few thousand Bitcoins during the period they were trading well below $1.00, and sell them at the ~$1,000 peak in November 2013. Of course, you don't need a fully functional time machine for that; you could do that if you merely had the ability to send a single message backward in time to your younger self circa 2009.
