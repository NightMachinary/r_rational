Ok, I know I'm not an expert, but I thought I had the fundamentals down.

  All mining servers are connected.

I know that typically miners act as nodes to maintain the block chain, but what would prevent a miner from simply connecting once they've discovered a new bitcoin?

Worst case scenario, you could just connect to the network, claim a bitcoin, then disconnect and reconnect somewhere else or through a proxy or vpn.

Since anybody can mine, there can't possibly be any limitations on that kind of thing.

#+begin_quote
  At worst, such a miner would simply gobble up all remaining coins as a very gradual and already pre-set rate.
#+end_quote

As I understand it, the pre-set rate is controlled by increasing the difficulty of mining. If you had a supercomputer from the future that could come up with the next bitcoin at the press of a button, that would walk all over any attempts at keeping the process gradual.

So yeah, you could gobble up the remaining bitcoins as fast as you cared to move your computer around to maintain your anonymity.
