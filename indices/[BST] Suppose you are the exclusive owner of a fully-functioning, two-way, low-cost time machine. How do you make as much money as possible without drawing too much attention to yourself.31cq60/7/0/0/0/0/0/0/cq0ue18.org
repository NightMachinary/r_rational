Time machines can solve NP-hard problems in polynomial-time. This is fundamentally different to just having huge amounts of computers and increasing the difficulty will actually just make the disparity worse because everyone else now has to put in exponentially more effort for your polynomial increase.

To make things even worse, you can also roll back arbitrarily large amounts of the block-chain to perform double-spend attacks.

Tor also makes locational secrecy viable, since you only need to be able to communicate with a single full node for this to work, so no Russian goons are going to interrupt you.

Regardless, the main result would be to destroy bitcoin (and any other cryptocurrency) as a viable anything.
