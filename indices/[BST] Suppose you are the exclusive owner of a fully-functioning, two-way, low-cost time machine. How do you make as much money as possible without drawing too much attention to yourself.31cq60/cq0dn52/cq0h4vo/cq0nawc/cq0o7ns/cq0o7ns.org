  It's anonymous.

It is not, and does not claim to be. Both mining and using bitcoins is, at best, pseudo-anonymous. There is always an identifiable party on each end of every transaction. There is always a trackable transaction, as well.

  You can claim bitcoins without revealing your identity

More true, but that is not the same thing as mining them.

The way bitcoin works, it would be easy to determine the physical location of a single active bitcoin miner. All mining servers are connected. That's how they work. Messages are sent between them constantly. This makes them easy to locate, especially if you were a government or powerful interested party. And nothing interests people like the NSA like cutting edge computing they had no idea existed.

  On the other hand, doing it too much could devalue bitcoin.
#+end_quote

No, it wouldn't. That's not how bitcoin works. Bitcoins are designed from the ground up as a deflationary currency. Limited total possible supply drives individual value gradually up so long as use is (in a complicated way) increasing faster than they are mined. There simply aren't that many unmined coins left for those sorts of effects, even from a very fast and efficient miner.

At worst, such a miner would simply gobble up all remaining coins as a very gradual and already pre-set rate. I'd expect action from the bitcoin server community long before then, however. They'd push out a software update, something to limit the output of coins even further (which they've done before) or negate a single bad actor like your system would be seen as.

But even through massive quantities of bitcoin transactions, you couldn't affect their value that much. Nor would you earn much money, relatively speaking. Not time machine money.
