I take a penny. I go back in time one minute and add that penny to the 'original' penny. I do it again. I stop whenever I get tired of doubling my money.

Because, really. Why would I bother going through the hassle of all that other stuff when I could get a functionally limitless wealth in little more than an hour through simple doubling?
