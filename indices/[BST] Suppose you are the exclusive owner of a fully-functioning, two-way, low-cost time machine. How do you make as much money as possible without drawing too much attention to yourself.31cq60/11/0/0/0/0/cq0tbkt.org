There's a limit on how far back you could go and find a civilization that would be capable of initiating industrialization. If you wanted to go back farther than that, you'd have to create your own civilization from scratch, which would be a huge nightmare.

In this case, you are one person with one time machine. If the time machine allowed multiple people to travel, perhaps you could colonize North America say, 50,000 years ago with people and technology from a post-need society.

Like, say, Atlantis?
