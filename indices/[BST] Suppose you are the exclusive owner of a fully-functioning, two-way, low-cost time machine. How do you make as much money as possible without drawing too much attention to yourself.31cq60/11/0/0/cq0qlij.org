As painful as it is for me to say it, I'm not sure you could prevent slavery from existing prior to the industrial revolution when machines started doing the work of men and animals.

Conceivably you could go back and try to adjust some of the great ancient civilizations and try to nudge them into an industrial revolution. Egypt, China, Greece, Rome, Japan to name a few.

Imagining what the Egyptians would have built with even steam power available to them is thought-provoking. If the Egyptians had managed to enter an industrial revolution at their peak, and their building fixation had been adjusted to something a bit more community-minded rather than giant places for dead rulers, we would have been on the Moon and Mars a thousand years ago.
