It would be pretty easy just to research the biggest lotto win ever, then go back to the drawing just before that. Play from a state that allows anonymity. Once you got your seed money, put together a team of investors, and nudge them from time to time when a big stock jump is coming. As others have said, if you're ever worried about looking too perfect, just throw in a couple conspicuous losers.

I've even thought about splitting up the money and spreading it around the world and into multiple front investment companies. If any one of them is average, but you own dozens, that would be huge money.

And as others have said, just earning money would become so trivial as to be meaningless. I'd start tackling real issues like why some countries can't shake off the civil wars and revolving door of dictators. I'd use that huge pot of cash to start up a political research group that could put together action plans that would push nations into healthier election formats (look up "The Problems With First Past The Post Voting"). Improve basic health care availability, better education, clean fuels. So much good could be done, the power would be godlike.
