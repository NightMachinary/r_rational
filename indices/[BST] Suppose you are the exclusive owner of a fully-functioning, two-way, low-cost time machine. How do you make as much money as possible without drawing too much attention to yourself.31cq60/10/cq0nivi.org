It's been said before, but I'd win a large lottery like Powerball on a large jackpot week that it wasn't won. The time travel would only need to be a few hours, and done one time.

I would then invest it all in market index funds and carefully choose a time in the future to move to, when science and medicine are highly advanced, but finances are still needed.

Then I would peek into the future every now and then to make sure I didn't disappear. If I find myself gone, I find out why and fix it.
