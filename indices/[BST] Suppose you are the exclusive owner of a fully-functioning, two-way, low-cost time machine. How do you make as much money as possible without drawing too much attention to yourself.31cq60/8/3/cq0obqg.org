Sure, I picked money. It is something lots of people relate to, and is an easy proxy for some arbitrary goal state.

Heck, if time travel is possible, it is self-financing, and self inventing.

"Past me, here are the plans to a time travel device that I, uh, /invented/. Yeah, that's the ticket."

*/Zap!/*

"Oh, hey there past me and alternate-timeline me, here is the time machine that you gave me the plans for and I, uh, /built myself/. It sure was expensive gathering all the raw materials, and seeing as how you have to do it at least once, you better figure out how to get some kind of stuff you can trade for things you don't have that you need that maintains value over time, and is mostly untraceable."

*/Zap!!/*

"Oh hey there me's, time travel party, right? Here's all the super-fungible <stuff> we all will need to finance my/our multiple iterations designing and building time machines."

/chorus of thanks/

"Say original me, before you go, answer me this, while the rest of us have been doing all the hard work, we forgot why you wanted to have time travel in the first place."

"Mostly to keep myself focused on a narrow task so I'd stay out of trouble. But now that I have a really cool time machine, (thanks by the way) the question is what /won't/ I do?" */Zap./*
