In practice: I would go forward in time, see if they've invented immortality yet. If so, make myself immortal, otherwise come back and make a different random comment on reddit and try again. Due to the butterfly effect, even a minor change in the present will completely rewrite the future so just about anything would do.

Once I'm immortal I won't need a time machine to become as rich as I want.
