If it were possible to affect your own timeline as opposed to creating a fork with each use of the time machine, it would be impossible for you to change the past since everything you would do you have already done.

By this reasoning, only three possible variations exist:

1. Time travel is impossible.
2. Time travel creates alternate timelines, not changes to your actual past.
3. Time travel with perfect safety precautions (artificial or natural) exists and is in use.

Unless you are a person with a functioning time machine, there's no way for you to know which of these is true.
