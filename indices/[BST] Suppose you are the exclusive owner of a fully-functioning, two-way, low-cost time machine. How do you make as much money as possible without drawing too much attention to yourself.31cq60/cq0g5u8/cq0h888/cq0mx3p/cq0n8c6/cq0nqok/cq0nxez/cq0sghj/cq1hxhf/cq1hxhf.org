Unless time travel maintains the connection between alternate timelines (ie. dresden codak time travel). Yah, but otherwise you got to be careful about not butterflying your friends and family out of existance. Even going back five (or a year(Red Navy(t) =/= Red Navy(t - one month)) years would overwrite their personalities, create new, different shared experiences, change revelations and hardships.
