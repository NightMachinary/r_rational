#2 is a bitch. It means you might never, ever be able to return to your original timeline after your first trip. Think "Sliders", but with no hope of ever returning.

That's why you don't travel into the past, just your own future and back again. One trip to the past and you could return to a "present" where you were never born. Or anyone else you knew. Likely, even.
