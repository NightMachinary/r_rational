There was no literal math done. I just meant that it was MUCH more likely. Humans have nuclear weapons. With a certain number of unfortunate variables, we could have a world eradicated by nuclear fallout. The number of variables you would need to uncover a world where we've created immortality? Much, much smaller. Based on our current technological abilities.
