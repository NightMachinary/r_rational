I suppose that one might also attempt to inflate the size of the Powerball payout by going back in time each time somoene else won. By going back, any number of things could be done to influence the brownian motion of the pingpong balls in the hopper.

I wonder what the range of the "butterfly effect" might be in this particular instance. Would it be necessary to be present in the studio? or just spill coffee on the person who starts up the machine? - anything to subtly change the time/manner in which the machine is started when they pick the numbers.
