I know it is always my answer but I will say it again. You sell stocks short knowing what they will be at a later point, buying them later to fill your obligation. This method allows you to basically suck money out of the stock market with no prior investment capital. Finally have you ever heard of a single investment banker unless they do something else to call attention to themselves?
