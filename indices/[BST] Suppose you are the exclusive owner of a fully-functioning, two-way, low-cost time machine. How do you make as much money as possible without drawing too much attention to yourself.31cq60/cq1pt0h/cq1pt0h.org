If the timeline is somehow magically consistent, like in HPMoR, precommit to having the only stable timeline be one where I travel to my current location in spacetime plus one minute with a completed fAI which also includes a clause that I get 10^{20} kg of money. Otherwise I go to MIRI HQ and work with them to make it happen. Give the fAI the time machine and all of existence which is smoothly connected to me is retroactively optimised. And I have more money than has ever been minted.

If every time travel back to a point before a parent time travel splits the universe (Terminator rules), time travel to MIRI HQ next workday, check the plan, then wait till 2035 or Armageddon to travel to a mathematician's house (probably someone recruited during the 20 yrs) the evening after. Bring them on board, repeat until the plan "fAI and a dwarf planet of cash" is complete. Then time travel to an infinite number of points in the past of all spacetime to bring suboptimality down to an infinitesimal fraction of existence. And to get my 10^{20} kg of cash.
