If time traveling takes you into the past of your own worldline then yes, you're right. My assumption would be that traveling to the past shifts you into a new worldline as [[/u/Gemini27]] suggested. Your old wordline continues on perfectly happily, different only in that you aren't there anymore. The new worldline you're in is exactly as it was except you're now there.

You could argue that your actions in the new worldline are causing people to not exist, but that's true in real life as well -- talk to a guy in the mall for a minute or so, he gets home a minute or so later to be with his wife and a different sperm reaches the egg than would have a minute before. That's not something you can avoid.
