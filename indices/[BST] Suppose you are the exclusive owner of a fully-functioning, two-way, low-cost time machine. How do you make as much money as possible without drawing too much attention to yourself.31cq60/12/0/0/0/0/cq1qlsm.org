  My assumption would be that traveling to the past shifts you into a new worldline as [[/u/Gemini27]] suggested.

Entirely possible. But the horror is still that you can't ever go back. Go back too long before you time and everyone you knew is lost to you. To you, they are as good as dead, as you are to them -- unless you can do something more like dimensional travel or dialing in other timelines.

That's why /Sliders/ worked: they weren't time traveling, just dimension jumping. That (mostly) didn't affect the next "world" they ended up in while allowing for spooky similarities. That kind of thing doesn't make sense for time travel.

  The new worldline you're in is exactly as it was except you're now there.

Well, with events and people new /to you/, if you went back far enough. A corollary of being in a paradox-free timeline situation is that going back before the voyages of discovery doesn't result in the third US President being someone else, it means the US most likely doesn't /exist/ as the US anymore.

Paradox resistant or automatically resolving universes (high irony environments) for time travel is fun sometimes, but seems like the least likely. Either all time travel should be already accounted for casually speaking in a single timeline, or stuff should likely get really wild for any time traveler heading into the past.
