Not that similar. Traveling to your own past /will/ almost certainly remove anyone not yet born from existence, replacing them with possibly genetically similar though otherwise completely different people. Hopefully not including you.

You'll return to a really odd future-present. It isn't like the spermatozoa that was/will be you is somehow guaranteed or fated. Nor is any other. If even the temperature of your father's scrotum is different, let alone your hour of purely maculate conception, you don't get made. Lots of people don't get made. That's the real horror.

Kill Hitler by simply walking around Europe in the 1600s, stopping a single stranger on the road for a fraction of a second. Of course, you've now "killed" virtually everyone else you've ever personally known as well.
