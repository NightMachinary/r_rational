I'd add to this: get a few R&D departments and set them to work on various projects. Using the 2-way travel, you can get them to essentially start up entirely new industries over time. Make sure you have a few failed ideas, too, to avoid suspicion.

TL;DR, use time travel to invent new stuff, basically be Elon Musk but better.
