First point in rational analysis with lots of unknowns: assume you are *not* in a privileged position. That means you have to act as if there are other people with similar time machines right now. So to speak. Whether from the future or "native" to when you acquired your tech, you have to assume they exist. It doesn't matter what you think you know, you can't assume you alone have this ability.

I'm also not sure why "making money" instead of "living in a medical and technological wonderland in the future" is your goal, but fine. It is. You will live in the "present" and only travel to the other times to make money in a way that is useful and significant in the "present".

Also, this is assuming we have reason to believe that time travel isn't horribly dangerous for various unavoidable reasons beyond grandfather killing and the like. Even then, I'd say anything involving your own past is off limits, unless you want to deal with all your friends, family, and loved ones being lost the first trip you take.

Since it isn't maximally dangerous, we must posit that you yourself don't disappear, Back to the Future style, after a single change. It needs to be paradox resistant time travel, if not actually totally free of such complications. But there are still major issues.

After returning to your "present" from the now-changed past, using almost all realistic time travel mechanics, everyone in the light cone will now have a new, changed history and present reality, even if it isn't obvious. There will also be two of you, unless you really fucked things up. Which is likely. Uncomfortable to say the least.

That leaves your own future and back again. This is still mind-bogglingly dangerous time travel, so keep it simple.

--------------

I'd just do a present-future-present open loop scam, and screw "the market". Basically, an item dupe bug. Load a warehouse with something like rare earth minerals or expensive computers (not gold, diamonds, or drugs -- remember, low profile). Things with elastic demand, relatively inelastic supply, and high value for their size.

Go into the future. Grab your own future stuff from your own future warehouse. Go back to your origin point. Drop off the stuff. Now you have twice as much stuff with no messy paradoxes (most likely). Fudge accounts payable numbers and pay all your taxes and no one will ever care. It will make /me/ wealthy to have a successful business, one that has an unreasonable edge over others, and it doesn't interfere with itself by depending on the future being anything but physically present. There are a lot of options there, but this one has almost no risk.

Hell, if you're really the business type, set up a "just in time" process to deliver stuff to businesses unreasonably (though not impossibly) quickly. Invest in companies you see doing well in the future -- not a sure thing, but better than playing stupid financial games like that article suggests isn't happening with time travelers. Claim exactly what Walmart did in the '90s -- that your advanced computer ordering and prediction systems are just that good.

While you're at it, assume the Waldens, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and other outliers like them were and still are time travelers. And assume they have ways to detect time travel and try to develop those yourself, with a crack team of scientists sworn to secrecy. Your background checks will be nasty, because they'll actually be checking into your future from secret hidden bases your employees don't know about, to see if they ever betray you after you hire them. Most defection scenarios are easy to catch this way, at least in the short term.

*tl;dr*: assume you are not in fact alone. Deal in physical goods taken from the future. Make your own future from future knowledge instead of murdering your own past. Don't play games where people might be watching, like banks, stockmarkets, or gray and black markets for expensive goods.
