  Now, I like this idea, but the problem is that if I were Q-type, my actions would actually look pretty uninteresting to an outside observer; I would become a model citizen, put my head down, and study/schmooze like mad until I worked my way into a career where I could have an extraordinarily high impact, like disease research, asteroid mining, or nuclear testing/control/safety. That's horrific in the abstract sense but it's not very visceral and it's not a terribly good springboard for the type of story I would want to tell.

That seems like a /really/ long-term, complex, fundamentally /unsure/ plan. What if the government just starts testing people for being Q-type before giving them the nuclear codes? Then the whole plan goes up in flames. This seems like relying on a lot more than three things to happen, and the real limit is two, so you should probably just drug someone's drink with cyanide in a bar every so often. Maybe find some junkies and deliberately induce overdoses. It'll really help if you take your victims from a stratum of society people already deride.

Maybe try knifing minorities in under-policed communities? If it counts, you could engage in some stochastic terrorism. That's really easy nowadays.

After all, it's the expected integral of people killed over time that matters, but you're usually very uncertain and not very able to control your exact life-trajectory, so you need /some/ episodes of murder to make up for the uncertainty about your Grand Plan.
