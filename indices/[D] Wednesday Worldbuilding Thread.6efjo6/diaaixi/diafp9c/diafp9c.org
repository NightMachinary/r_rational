What if you weakened Q-type a bit.

Instead of being 100% dedicated to killing, they're reversed altruists. Over time, the Q-types put more and more weight on their anti-altruism goal.

You can still have a handful of competence-porn serial killers in the same what that the real world could have a handful of competence-porn EA people. Those people would be terrifying legends, but rare.

The bulk of the Q-types would approach hurting people in the same messy, not-quite-optimal way that a community-minded person might go about helping.

Their emotions would have the same availability-bias and scope-insensitivity problems that the rest of us have, just towards reversed emotions.

To get specifics, I'd go down the list of non-EA charities and ask, "How is this project generating Warm Fuzzies?" Then reverse that payoff for your Q-Types.
