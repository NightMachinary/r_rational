  not their intelligence, skills, impulse control, etc. If they gain only one goal, and that goal is killing as many people as possible, then the less intelligent/patient/skilled ones will get in their car and drive through a crowded sidewalk, while the opposite will try to work their way into a nuclear power plant and coordinate a series of critical system failures

No, the way I understood it, their impulse control gets rewritten by "kill as many people as possible", as does their impatience and their emotions.

That won't be enough to avoid /mistakes/, though. They won't become perfectly rational. Less methodical and critical ones would reach to some cached "how would I kill all these people" thought, and decide that the best way to do it is by driving a car through a crowded sidewalk --- /not/ because they're impatient, but because they would honestly think it's the best way. Ones previously less inclined to take whatever they do seriously won't take their new goal seriously as well, would go about it incompetently. More methodical ones would go for the long-game.

Since they're used to put themselves into other people's place to predict them, they would try to continue doing that. Only later would they realize it's not working properly anymore, try to readjust. Maybe their old mental models of close friends are still workable, maybe not; their ability to socialize would be severly impaired in any case.

"Infinite willpower" would let them put indefinite amounts of time into working on fixing their disabilities, learning to act, --- /if/ they think of it, that is. But they would still occasionally make mistakes, it would still be hard for them to model large groups of people, or get complicated social interactions right, simply because they no longer have software for that.

Their mistakes won't always be internal, either, they would occasionally try to make small talk about how they want to kill everyone --- they're not used to live surrounded by enemies, after all, they may forget about their orthogonal values, get distracted.

Living would be /really/ complicated for them.
