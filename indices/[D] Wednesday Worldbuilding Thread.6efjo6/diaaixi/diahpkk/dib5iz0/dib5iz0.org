This is my reaction too. A Q-Type does not, by my read, immediately become a Moriarty-level Criminal Master Mind. Their VALUES shift, but not their intelligence, skills, impulse control, etc. If they gain only one goal, and that goal is killing as many people as possible, then the less intelligent/patient/skilled ones will get in their car and drive through a crowded sidewalk, while the opposite will try to work their way into a nuclear power plant and coordinate a series of critical system failures.

Unless you do mean that they gain willpower and insight and acting skills and so on, [[/u/alexanderwales]]? It's fine if they are able to commit ALL of their willpower to that goal without getting distracted by vices or boredom or whatever, but that's different from gaining an inhuman focus for maximizing the goal, in my view. Like, if the average person's goals all got deleted except for "eat cookies," they would not become super rich so they could eat a limitless amount of cookies. They would operate within their means to maximize cookie eating at the expense of all else, but if they HAVE no means, like they don't have a job or savings or can't think of a plan to get more money, they might just start stealing cookies.
