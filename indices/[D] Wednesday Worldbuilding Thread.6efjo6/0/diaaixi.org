Q-type mental disorder is chiefly characterized by a complete replacement of all previous values. Instead, the infected will dedicate their will entirely toward killing as many people as possible. They will eat, but only because survival is instrumental toward killing. They will socialize, but have no compulsion to do so outside of its instrumental value in killing more people. They are not like you or I, where they might get distracted by other pursuits or bored of what they are doing, and they can be thought of as effectively having a limitless supply of willpower, all put toward their goal of killing as many people as possible.

Now, I like this idea, but the problem is that if I were Q-type, my actions would actually look pretty uninteresting to an outside observer; I would become a model citizen, put my head down, and study/schmooze like mad until I worked my way into a career where I could have an extraordinarily high impact, like disease research, asteroid mining, or nuclear testing/control/safety. That's horrific in the abstract sense but it's not very visceral and it's not a terribly good springboard for the type of story I would want to tell.

I'm not sure what the best hack is to my Q-type definition though. Ideally the effect leads competence porn serial killers who put great effort into not getting caught and who don't care about gathering trophies, taking credit, or selecting particular targets (and in fact will shun any consistent MO, because that would make them easier to catch). Ideally it's something that can be summed up in a pithy line of dialogue and not "the causal distance between the killer and victim is less than thirty minutes from action to effect", which does not flow off the tongue.

Secondarily, I'm not a hundred percent sure what the MO would actually look like, if a serial killer was attempting to kill as many people as possible before their own capture/death. Pick targets that are unlikely to be missed, move around a lot, cover your tracks ... I'm not sure that I can model it that well, so any help would be appreciated.
