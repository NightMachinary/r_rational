I'm a fan of true crime as well (though mostly just the extreme cases). Mostly I find it a little shocking how far the most successful serial killers got without having terribly stable brains. Ted Bundy got away with it for a long time and was only caught because he got really, really brazen. I think that would be a lot harder in our current era of ubiquitous surveillance, but still doable. A lot of psychopathy comes with a lack of impulse control, so the Q-type disorder would turn that on its head.

Engineers or contractors intentionally setting up disasters-in-waiting is a neat story idea, but different from the directions that I'd naturally want to go it. And I would also probably want to change the story so that they were doing it for a noble or at least morally ambiguous reason, like because they were trying to sabotage a violent regime or something.
