To depart from all these abstract comments, here's some concrete examples:

- Hyatt regency walkway collapse killed a lot of people as the result of a very simple engineering error that was initiated by the contractor. So have Q types working in construction roles and sabotaging the job in small but serious ways: I assume they're patient so they can wait 5-10 years for the collapse to happen.

- Basically look at any bridge or building collapse and someone screwed up to make it possible (e.g. a bridge collapsed in the 1800s because they just built it twice the size not realising that the weight scaled up by a cube but the strength only scaled up by a square) - Q-type's goal is to /be that guy/. With modern technology and standards either do it in the third world (engineers without borders is a thing: the old adage goes a doctor can kill one person at a time and an engineer can kill thousands), or be one of the construction workers.

- Another thing: landfill collapses in places like India and Brazil can kill thousands of people and are easily preventable which means easily causeable. Design a bad landfill located somewhere dangerous and then wait a few decades for it to collapse.

Small-scale, some murderers who got away with shit:

- probably the murderer who comes closest to the Q-Type modality is Israel Keyes, who killed an unknown number of people (some think he was all talk and only killed 3 since he died by suicide and didn't confess to any more than that; others think it could be dozens based on his boasting). He did things like hiding "murder kits" consisting of weapons, cash, duct tape, etc around the US and then coming back years later to use them in murders. One of his documented murders consisted of him flying into one city, hiring a car, and driving a long, long distance to a completely different city to murder a couple, and then driving all the way back. Definitely a guy to research.

- The Original Night Stalker is known by many names and committed a great deal of rapes and eventually murders in California in the 70s, and they were only linked together in the 90s when DNA was able to link them. He did things like sneaking into peoples' houses and stashing equipment to commit murders with, cutting phone lines, etc. As a rapist he targeted attractive women and their husbands, so that's not ideal Q-Type, but he did all sorts of sadistic stuff like phoning victims up 20 years later even though they'd moved house (again, probably not a Q Type trait, but still pretty creepy)

- Long Island Serial Killer is a currently "active" SK who is murdering prostitutes, has been for a long time, and seems to get away with it.

True crime's an interest of mine, and I work as a civil engineer, so hopefully some of these examples will spark something in you.
