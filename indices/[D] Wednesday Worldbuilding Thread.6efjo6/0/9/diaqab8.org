One option for building tension might be that Q-types /have/ to kill at least one person every time interval or something bad happens to them. Maybe they die, or maybe they are "cured" (which means fewer people die and is therefore unacceptable).

They still want to kill as many people as possible, though. So you'd have people trying to work their way into high positions while also killing someone every week/month/39.7 days.

In a story where the protagonist is trying to stop these people, there would be a build up in suspense as they are using the killings to try and track the Q before they can set off a disaster.

If not killing results in a loss in the mental illness, there also might be a moral/emotional component as to whether the protag wants to kill the Q or capture and cure them.

Edit: Oh, and the Q has to kill the person themselves at close range. This would prevent someone setting up minor "disasters" to kill a few people every month, like burying poisoned needles in a playground or spreading a disease at a nursing home.
