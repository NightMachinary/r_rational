  Q-type mental disorder is chiefly characterized by a complete replacement of all previous values. Instead, the infected will dedicate their will entirely toward killing as many people as possible

I think the problem with such value-hijacking things is that it's assumed anyone infected by those would become a perfect actor. They won't.

Social interactions are full of unconscious cues, microexpressions and body language subtleties that won't be present in such a being. They would seem unsettling to ordinary people, firmly occupying Uncanny Valley.

Moreover, we draw from our own desires and emotions when interacting with other human beings, use them to empathize, understand, and indeed /model/ people. Having a deviant mind would lead to flawed intuitive models of others. Sociopaths already have a hard time dealing with it, and they merely lack empathy; what that implies about a being completely devoid of emotional makeup, but having neither an increased intelligece to create better models, nor a special acting ability to make up for it (pun honestly not intended)?

I'm reasonably confident they would seem autistic to the outside world, idiot-savant types, excelling in whatever field they choose to pursue but notorioulsy bad with people. They would probably occassionally slip into modeling others as bloodlusted as well, perhaps even doing so /out loud/. I'm doubtful of their ability to fool anyone for extended periods of time.

  Secondarily, I'm not a hundred percent sure what the MO would actually look like, if a serial killer was attempting to kill as many people as possible before their own capture/death

Mass poisonings? Move between cities a lot, contaminating food/water supplies whenever you go?
