Makes sense, I was thinking that depending on how the story is set up, the world might know about the Q-Types in the first place because of these less-effective ones, and mistakenly believe that it just turns people into near-mindless killing machines until the first "sleeper" Q-Type sets homemade bombs off all over the city or poisons its water supply.
