I mostly agree, except impulse control is the one benefit that they get, mostly because all other values get stripped from them and there's no time preference to "kill people" except for that imposed by uncertainty (i.e. if I don't kill anyone this week, then maybe I'll randomly die of a stroke and not /ever/ get to kill anyone). Everything else /should/ flow from that, assuming that they think of it (which not all of them will). They don't gain acting skills, but /if/ they've decided that getting captured is a risk, they will try their best to not get captured, and part of a likely strategy for that is learning how to lie.

How powerful "infinite willpower" is probably depends on what you believe about willpower in general. I generally think that it's very powerful and consider a lot of rationalist techniques to be ways of circumventing the need to expend willpower, or to reorder time preference, or otherwise hack values.

(I am naturally less interested in those people who would be stupid about it; there's plenty of true crime stories out there about killers who were sloppy and irrational about it. For the purposes of the story this idea is currently embedded within, they're all probably drawn from the equivalent of SEAL teams, which means a certain level of intelligence and skills would be built-in. Not sure that I'm going to leave this idea in that story though.)
