Serial killing is ineffective if you want to maximize death. Instead of killing individuals, consider spreading lethal disease or poison working at fast food. Or contaminating a glove with something really nasty and going around turning doorknobs. Contaminate frequently used bathrooms: almost none even have cameras! If the Q-type is careful and meticulous, there's very little chance of them getting caught.

Maybe good places to go for killing people are third world countries, in the hopes that law enforcement is more ineffective there, medical care is worse, people are more vulnerable to disease, vaccinations aren't as widespread.

Intelligent people can research and synthesize diseases to operate on a larger scale.

Even if you're not very smart, well, you have limitless willpower, and that counts for a lot lot lot, so hitting the books is a good plan, learning about rationality and planning skills, and putting off murder until you're clever enough to evade getting caught.

People who believe abortion is murder can work on that.

The natural Schelling point would be starting either war advocacy or extremist environmentalist blogs and Q-types can find each other that way, share ideas, and work together. If Q-types are well-known, the natural Schelling point is anti-Q-type blogs. Since they have limitless willpower, they're much more likely to think about where the point is for five minutes and come to that conclusion.

Once a community is formed, a standard FAQ and things will likely be created: "So you're one of us: here's a catalog of the best ways you can kill people without getting caught" and "here's how to do encryption and op. security" and "kik me if you have any questions, newbies, I'd be happy to help ;)"

This would be a really cool setting to explore online, just because of how surreally creepy it could be and how fun internet settings are when done well. Maybe competition with confirmed kill counts.

This would be an interesting way for an apocalypse to happen. (Albeit really edgy.)

It's interesting that Q-types have infinite willpower and seemingly negligibly low time preference (behaving as a model citizen until reaching a good opportunity), but they don't just wait for humans to, like, die on their own.

If Q-types value killing people and not /extinction/, they might want to help create more humans. That could be through fighting against abortion, working to create a superintelligence that will maximize humans, under the premise that they will all inevitably die through entropy.

I'm imagining the universe tiled with constantly dying and reincarnating humans.
