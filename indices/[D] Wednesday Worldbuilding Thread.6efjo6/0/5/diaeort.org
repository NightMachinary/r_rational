Well for one thing it seems likely they would put significant effort into infecting other since that may effectively double the number of people they could kill (or increase it exponentially if the new infected also infects others).

Anyway I agree that if there were relatively few infected they wouldn't actually do serial killing instead messing things up on far larger scale which will probably indirectly kill thousands, however even if there was a larger number they would likely deliberately lay low so as to not draw attention to their existence and will likely coordinate to the degree that will be safe and if caught commit suicide. Mass death could be done by starting wars, or starting and maintaining cold wars on the chance they might be able to kill billions, developing bioweapons, etc.\\
Still it's not going to be flashy and unless the hero's get very lucky they will probably be successful in wiping out most if not all of humanity without anyone even knowing of their existence.
