If Q-types knew who each other were and were willing to cooperate on projects, the obvious path to maximum death is for them to get placed at every link in the chain which causes global thermonuclear warfare. Infinite willpower means that they would be incredibly likely to succeed, especially if they can get all of their non-Q-type rivals killed in plausible accidents by other Q-types.

You could change the definition by saying the Q-type maximizes the number of people who they personally see die. This slightly increases the risk of capture (which is actually a good thing for worldbuilding, as it means it is /possible/ for normals to break into the conspiracy), but also gives them far more available avenues. They could be battlefield commanders who send their own men on suicidal charges or nurses at understaffed hospices. They could undetectably trigger industrial accidents, cause open-pit mines to flood, bomb large sporting events, or even work for the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders.

Now that I think of it, they could hack hospital security systems to view death from afar as well. There's lots of options if Q-types don't have to personally cause the deaths.
