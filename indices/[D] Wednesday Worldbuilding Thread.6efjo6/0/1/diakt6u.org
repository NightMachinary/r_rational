Some potential hacks:

- Add a personal experience component. "A Q-type wants to watch as many people die by their own hand as possible". (You could fudge the meaning of "watch" a bit.)

- Make it serial: "A Q-type has a target, and wants to kill that target more than anything. Once that target is dead, they want to select a new target more than anything. They can't change targets."

- Make each kill less important. Maybe the worst thing in the world for a Q-type is if they fail to kill /anybody at all/. So they value 10 kills way less than 1 kill, 100 kills way less than 10 kills, etc.

I think the third hack is my favorite. You would probably end up with Q-types who are hyper-competent leaders in their plausibly-world-ending fields, and then in their free time they murder people. (Also, these murders could increase in scale as the story goes on. Once the Q-type has killed 10 people, it sets its eyes on 100, then 1000, etc. etc., all while pursuing its dream of releasing a genetically-engineered superbug that ends all life on earth. It's a free dramatic arc, and an excuse to have prominent and well-respected experts murder people at night. You could also maybe have a side story where the government secretly tolerates known Q-types because they're so productive in their fields, and only kills them off when their nighttime escapades get out of hand. There's a lot of fun meat on that bone.)
