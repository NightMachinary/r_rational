If you're trying to create something similar to serial killers, take inspiration from serial killers. They don't intrinsically value death, they just gain pleasure from arbitrarily killing people and want to pursue that pleasure. All you have to do is attach similar arbitrary conditions onto Q-Types.

I'd recommend basing it specifically on the serial killer from the Sherlock episode /The Lying Detective/. All he wanted to do was "make people into things", so didn't really care how the person died as long as he got to personally watch the light go out behind their eyes as he murdered them.

The key to creating these kinds of antagonists is to make them very individualistic. They don't want to just know people died because of their actions, they want to commit first-degree murder. They don't care about sheer numbers, just whether they get the personal satisfaction they desire.
