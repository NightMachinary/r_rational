The Dead come out at night.

Ghosts burn and evaporate in the light of the Sun. This is known - has been known for centuries. But only Sunlight works - no lantern, no candle, no torch, no flame. Even /reflected/ sunlight works, though. (In modern times, people would pick up that it's the ultraviolet wavelengths that kill the ghosts).

So, in the daytime, travellers are safe. But in the night, ah, in the night the Dead roam. They ooze out of graveyards, slip out of the tombstones, whisper from bodies at the side of the road; the ghosts drift through the night, desperate for a touch of life again, for the chance to breathe, to see, to eat, to be.

To be caught out by the ghosts is to die, for the ghost displaces the mind already in the body, possessing it - and then fights for control with dozens, nay, hundreds of other ghosts, for the Dead outnumber the living, several million to one.

Sometimes the Dead will take over animals; these are rarer targets, as the body shape feels /wrong/, and only the most desperate will go for this option. But, for all that, possessed animals, animals with temporarily human intelligence, are at times seen of a night. And a /human/ body - ah, to the Dead a human body is all they desire, and they will fight, and fight hard, to hold onto one.

There are wards that can hold out the Dead. But these wards work on the principle of repelling /disembodied/ spirits; a ghost in possession of a body will not be stopped by the wards. It is fortunate, then, that not all bodies can support a ghost - a squirrel, for example, only has a small brain, and any ghost that wishes to possess one must discard much - memories, skills, instincts, /identity/ - in order to fit inside a squirrel. (Sometimes the Dead do such a thing. They squeeze within a squirrel, hop over the wards, and then - well, without their knowledge, memories, and skills, these desperate souls are no longer capable of remembering the part about taking over a human body, and usually live brief, squirrelish lives. But beware the ghost who is smart enough to choose a creature with a /large/ brain, like a tiger...)

When the ghosts take some unwary traveler, invading his mind, pulling on the levers that control his body, they care not for the safety or happiness of the original mind. They care only for themselves; for the ability to feel the breeze in the hair, air moving through the lungs, the beating of the heart. And the warmth of the sun on the skin - ah, how the ghosts long for that feeling once again! But it is a feeling that they can never have, for the lightest touch of the Sun dissolves them, freeing their victim - and it takes significant time for a ghost to reconstitute themselves after that point.

Some ghosts take their victims, dragging them to dark caves and hidden places through the days, holding their bodies out of the sun, so that they may longer prolong the half-life existence of their possession - many of these have forgotten small details, such as how or what to eat, what is poisonous or what is not - and even for those that have not forgotten, even the cramp of a pained stomach is heaven compared to the non-feeling of having no body at all.

But the wardings on the cities have one other weakness, and it is a severe one; it only prevents ghosts from /crossing/ the boundaries of the wards. It does not protect the populace from the ghosts of those who die /leaving their bodies inside the city/.

Muggings do not happen at night in the city. No mugger wants an angry victim's ghost taking his body. Muggings happen under the Sun, in well-lit areas instead - with the body dumped outside the city walls. Elderly and the terminally ill are kept in the Hospital at nights, a small region outside the city walls with its own, entirely separate system of wards and walls; and any activity that carries risk of death is carried out under full Sun, and outside the city. But for all the care that the people take, every now and then a man or woman will die within the city; and then that ghost will terrorise the city for a single night, usually attempting to possess either the nearest person, or the nearest person that the dead person did not like; one night of fear, danger, and the possessed person very quickly trying to accomplish the last aims of the recently dead, and then their body is removed from the city the next day, laid to rest in the Mausoleum outside the city, one more screaming, ghostly voice to wander the wilderness at night...
