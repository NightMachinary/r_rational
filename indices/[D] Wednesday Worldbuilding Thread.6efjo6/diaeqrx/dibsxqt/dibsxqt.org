If it's a D&D setting, you could have the mist reverse character alignment after a minute or so of exposure. Towns of lawful neutral people become chaotic neutral and disband into roving murderhobo parties, then the next night comes and they realize their mistake but it's too late, all the guards are dead and the night creatures consume them. Paladins become useless as they lose the favor of their patrons, villains become lawful good and start massacreing their minions and freeing their slaves, all kinds of chaos.

The creatures that live in the wilds are either too unintelligent to have alignments, lawful neutral, or the mechanical automatons of a long-forgotten precursor race. You could even have a plot about how this precursor race caused the mist as an attempted superweapon gone horribly wrong.
