Thanks! I just got the Warded Man on audiobook and am looking forward to seeing how Brett executes the premise.

Hopefully, I'll be able to hit some different themes.

One of my goals is to build a world where D&D's "points of light" setting makes sense. I really like the idea that there's some vast, unexplored expanse with ruins of a previous civilization.

But, whenever I encounter that in fiction, I always find myself asking why human farmers haven't already expanded and settled all the arable land.

The other goal is to build a world with some deliberate value dissonance. Lately, I've read way too much fan fiction where characters in a high fantasy world have the values of 21st century moderns.

Stuff like, "Book Burning is Evil!" works in our world. It's a much more complicated debate if some books teach people how to create the zombie apocalypse.

I lean libertarian, so I'm imagining the centralized wards as a way of making an authoritarian government become as defensible as possible.
