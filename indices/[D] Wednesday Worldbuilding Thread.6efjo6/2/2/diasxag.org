You are super super reinventing the premise of Peter V Brett's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Painted_Man][The Warded Man / The Painted Man]] series. Go read that series, it does a lot of what you're describing and it's pretty cool - and also you can make your stuff sufficiently different from his that you do something new. In his book series, at sundown demons rise from the earth and attack everyone not behind serious magical wards - until morning comes. These demons are supernaturally persistent, strong, and evil, but not particularly intelligent for the most part. Everyone can create wards on whatever using most mediums that you could draw or write on, but there's a lot of hazards with trying to etch complicated wards into the dirt earth - because a gap in the wards or the wards being covered or interrupted at all is quickly lethal, and the wards have to be precisely drawn accurately in order to have an effect. Some people travel by carrying wards etched on a series of laquered planks that they deploy around themselves near sunset, but it's tough and expensive to travel.

Sara Douglass had an apocalypse happen in her epic fantasy series the Wayfarer Redemption books that also bears some resemblance to this concept - in her fantasy series, the Timekeeper Demons mentally attacked and possessed anyone outside with any part of themselves being directly illuminated by the sun at certain hours of the day; they mentally dominated those possessed permanently and mostly caused them to attempt to attack others and kill them, or get them into sunlight, or to commit suicide, all in thematically appropriate ways for each different demon (each of them being tied to specific emotions like hunger, despair, etc). Douglass's work is substantially less recommended than Brett's, and anyways to understand it you have to read the (previous) Axis Trilogy as well, which itself is wholly unrelated to your premise.
