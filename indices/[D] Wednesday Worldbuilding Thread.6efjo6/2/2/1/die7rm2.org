I'm on Chapter 4 of the audiobook of 'The Painted Man' and I'm really glad you recommended it.

I can definitely see the similarity of the premise.

Do the characters get smarter as the book goes on? I feel like the author has missed some steps in the world building.

The characters live in a world where being caught out after dark means death. But they say stuff like, "Every dusk, I'll be on the porch waiting for you until you return."

If darkness kills, why would you ever be traveling anywhere near dusk? In an emergency, sure. But under normal circumstances? The culture should have rules like, "Tea starts 1 hour before dusk and is religiously mandatory."

Getting in 30 minutes before dusk should be a cold-sweat inducing story you use to frighten children. On par with, "I was caving, and lost two of my lights! I had to rely on my spare the whole way back! I could have died down there!"

Or the first act would have been outright solved if the civilization used mile-markers on their roads. Which you'd do if travel-time were a literal matter of life-and-death.

The annoyance is inspiring in a way. So, I'm happy I'm reading this, and hope I can have Level-1 intelligent characters reacting to similar sorts of problems.
