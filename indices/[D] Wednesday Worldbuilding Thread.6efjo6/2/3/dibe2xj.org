Quick brainstorm:

During the night, the spirit world overlaps with the real world. I'd create some kind of apocalyptic event in the past that eroded the barrier between the spirit world and the real world. The barrier is still strong enough to stand firm during the day, but when night comes it becomes thin enough for spirits and ghosts to prey upon the minds of the living.

The dead, broken and twisted remnant spirits of the passed, always hunger for the bodies they /ache/ to possess again. They swarm any human being walking unprotected and try to tear their mind apart in a frenzied animalistic attempt to /get in/, to /have flesh/ again. To /live/.

The strong willed can resist these attacks... for a while. But if you are unprotected for too long, your defenses will be worn down and your mind torn apart, sending you into babbling madness and eventually death. Thus the ghosts attacks are doomed to fail, they will never gain the life they crave, but they are too far gone to see anything but the hot pulsing glow of life.

This way animals and monsters would be safe, and it is damn scary to go out at night because you start to feel the prescence of malevolent things trying to /get into your mind/. It starts weak, when only a few ghost fragments are drawn to you. But as more and more are drawn to your unprotected mind, the wailing and babbling and the /scratching/ on your mind becomes more and more discomforting until it becomes unbearable. You lose coherent thought and act only on fight or flight instinct, consumed by panic, fear and pain. People have clawed their eyes out, bashed their own heads in or attacked people that stand between them and percieved safety - even family and friends.

I would keep the only visual component some kind of mist, and let the other effects be entirely mental.

Excess but non-lethal exposure results in ticks, tiredness, nightmares, madness or paranoia, as the mind is more and more ablated by repeated assaults. Perhaps a slow erosion actually has the chance of leading to possession.
