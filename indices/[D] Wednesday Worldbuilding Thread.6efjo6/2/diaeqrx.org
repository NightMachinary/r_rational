I'd like some help fleshing out a natural hazard for a rationalist fantasy story.

For inspiration, I'm looking at the [[http://wiki.mystara.net/savage_coast][red curse]] from D&D's Savage Coast setting, [[http://pern.wikia.com/wiki/Thread][thread]] from Anne McCaffrey, and the [[http://www.jim-butcher.com/books/cinder-spires/the-aeronauts-windlass-1][mist]] from Jim Butcher's Cinder Spires.

The goal is to have something that limits habitable land, slows travel between towns, and can be resisted with planning or costly resources.

The setting's geography looks a like Greece. People live on islands, or on the coasts of larger landmasses. The interior of the landmasses is mountainous, so people travel by boat, or by caravans that follow the coastal trails.

Currently, the hazard is a magically-active mist that comes out at night. If you're caught in it, unprotected, it has some sort of corruptive effect.

To get around this, every settlement has magically-warded walls. People are safe so long as they're able to spend the night inside a town.

Town-walls are expensive, so there's an incentive to make towns as big as possible. The limiting factor is that farmers need to be able to walk to their fields each morning.

Travelers rely on a network of semi-permanent way-stations when they're between towns. These are buildings or forts that are set up every 10 miles or so along the coast. Unlike town walls, these protections need to be activated every night they'll be used. This activation can take an hour or two of work and is moderately costly.

Finally, there are (expensive) rituals that can protect a temporary camp, and (very expensive) talismans/magic that can protect people who are moving. These are used by adventurers, scouts, and certain kinds of extremely expensive couriers.

--------------

How would people exploit this? Imagine you've got a D&D party, and can cast "Protection from Mist" as a 3rd level spell. What kinds of things would you do with your (very rare) ability to move around freely at night?

What sort of resource would people use to power the temporary protections? I'm thinking that "sentient creature blood" might work, but that feels like the obvious answer.

Then, what would people do for the corruptive effect? I want to do something that leaves plants & animals unaffected, and allows there to be monsters living in the wild. This makes me think that the effect should somehow be mental.

At the moment, I'm tempted to say that mist lowers people's inhibitions, and makes them susceptible to to the influence of whatever supernatural creatures happen to be lurking nearby.

But, I'm having trouble making this effect sufficiently scary. And I'd like there to be some kind of semi-permanent effect that comes with excess exposure.
