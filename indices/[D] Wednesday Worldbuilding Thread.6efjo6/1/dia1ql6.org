Because my imagination is nothing if not overly ambitious, I have decided my [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6d2pfy/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dhzlbgd][kitchen sink superhero setting]] would be incomplete without ripping-off Dragon Ball. Clearly, I have gone mad and lost all sense of good judgement, so in an effort to preserve my well-being I have decided not to suffer from my insanity but rather to enjoy every minute of it!

The premier superhero league in the world is The Ideal, originally established as a parent organization to the various teams and social clubs of good samaritans before being declared a nation in its own right by an international treaty. Heroes have dual citizenship and their secret bases are legally considered embassies, though there's still a bureaucracy to hold them accountable.

However, China didn't want local heroes to be outside the control of its government and couldn't make it's own metahumans without violating the same international treaty, so they hired an expy of Bulma to find people with powers and manipulate them into protecting the state from magic and villains without joining The Ideal.

Definitely-not-Bulma is the highly independent daughter of definitely-not-Doctor Doom who made this deal because she wanted to study magic in China without interference...and because she wasn't very emotionally intelligent due to her upbringing and couldn't make any friends. Even in this version she still originally wanted to conjure a romantic partner.

She ended up convincing the Chinese government to not crack down on the secret societies of magic users in the country by using her wealth to become a major political figure in them who discouraged criminal activity. The rowdy metahumans also tended to get beaten up in the underground tournaments she sponsored.

I don't imagine keeping the state happy would be hard, she just had to point the demigods who trusted her in the direction of supervillains and mystical artifacts that needed protecting. However, I don't think there's a way to rationalize them resurrecting people the villains killed without The Ideal demanding that power be used for a more global benefit.
