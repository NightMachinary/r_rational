  However, I don't think there's a way to rationalize them resurrecting people the villains killed without The Ideal demanding that power be used for a more global benefit.

The Ideal can demand what they like. Officially, this power doesn't exist; and any claims that person X died and was resurrected are clearly false because he is clearly still alive. Maybe there was a clone, or a lookalike, a stunt double... or perhaps he only /thought/ he died (China explicitly denies the existence of memory implantation technology as well, by the way; in fact, they spend more time denying memory implantation technology than they do paying attention to the persistent rumours of resurrection technology).
