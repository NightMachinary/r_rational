I... don't actually know a thing about Dragon Ball. But, if it was months later, and you're dealing with an authoritarian government, then there are other options as well.

Consider; what if the town was never resurrected? Instead, one of these Chinese heroes had... a lot of guilt over the destruction of the town. A /lot/ of guilt. Severe mental trauma kind of guilt. And, after therapy proved useless, said authoritarian government spent a month or two looking for lookalikes (they didn't have to be exact, this hero hardly even knew anyone in the town anyway), rebuilding the place, legally changing all the new people's identities to the old people's identities, and then more or less telling this hero "Look, they're back, now can you stop moping around and get back to work?"

It's... a bit of a dark take on the resurrection...

--------------

Second option - the attack that 'killed' the city wasn't a lethal event. It was a 'throw-the-city-into-the-future' time travel event

--------------

Third option; some villain (or some hero?) was on the scene in time and managed to (somehow) 'trap the souls' of the dead, preventing them from crossing into the afterlife and holding them still. Then several months for the cloned bodies to grow, and they get restored... Charon would know that something was fishy from the time of the original attack, of course. Then you have a form of resurrection that can only be used if the right guy is /right there/ at the time of the original death.
