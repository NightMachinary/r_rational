I think I can work with the last one. I already planned for the Celestial Federation to be full of martial arts demigods, but it also features a bureaucratic spirit world similar to Ancient Chinese mythology, which I conceived long before deciding to steal the Z Fighters for my own setting.

It combines magic with transhumanist technology to assimilate ghosts into a digital afterlife, so villains with pieces of that tech could come to Earth intending to build their own power by snatching souls. There'd actually be a reason for so many Dragon Ball villains to just want to kill people.

The government would certainly be happy with the PR that comes with restoring those people to their old bodies with magitech created by the state. Even if the Ideal demanded control over the project, the state could still reasonably claim credit for contributing to research into superpowers for the public good.

This could even make for an interesting plot hook: the people who's souls were found but were unwilling or unable to be restored to their old bodies. Some of them might've gone to the country of Sanctuary like other nonhuman refugees, but others might try to reintegrate into society on their own terms.
