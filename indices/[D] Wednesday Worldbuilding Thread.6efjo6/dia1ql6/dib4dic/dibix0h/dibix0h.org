I don't mean when the heroes come back to life, I'm referring to when the Z Fighters resurrected people en masse. Nappa and Vegeta blew up a whole city and a news crew who all got wished back to life months later. DC comics also pulled this kind of thing with Coast City, but that was an event many heroes were involved in so they understood how it happened and knew it wasn't repeatable.

The Ideal would be especially suspicious of people coming back to life since one of their members is Charon, the ferryman to the afterlife. This seems like the sort of thing he'd notice and the heroes would trust him on. China can prove /they/ don't have any resurrection technology or magic, but if the Ideal finds out who does they are going to ask for it from people who want to undo tragic deaths.

If I'm going to include this, and I'm still crazy enough to want to, I need to change how or why the Z Fighters resurrected people. There has to be a reason the Ideal or the Z Fighters would be unwilling or unable to transfer possession of the power. There also has to be some reason the Z Fighters don't go global, otherwise they would've undone the damage caused by wars or mundane terrorist attacks.

The reason for reimagining the Z Fighters as a deniable Chinese team is so they are largely separate from the rest of the setting. They've still gone on international adventures and met other heroes, but are fundamentally committed to protecting their homeland even when they don't think they're working for the government. They don't want to be part of a group that meddles in affairs unrelated to that.

Plenty of heroes have their own small corners of their world where they spend most of their time and are largely left to themselves, but can all contact each other at any time and regularly meet up. The Z Fighters would help with global threats, but I don't want them to be easily reachable or have close relationships with other heroes. Otherwise, Goku and The Ideal would constantly ask each other for help.
