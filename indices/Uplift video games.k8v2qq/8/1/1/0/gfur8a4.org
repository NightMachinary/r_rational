It may be healthy to use [[https://github.com/cameroncondry/cbc-kitten-scientists]]. The UI is terrible, but it basically does auto-clicking so that you don't have to return to the game every 5 minutes. By default it does /way/ too much, so I disabled everything and then added things back slowly.

Not having to refine catnip all the time is much nicer.
