Have you heard of Idle Games? You don't (generally) play as an individual making individual efforts, and they're not particularly story focused, but due to their low-development cost and mechanical purity they can have really wild scopes which lets them really dig deep on a concept, taking things to their logical conclusion pretty hard. There are at least a few set in civilisations which you manage on various scales.

Kittens is really excellent, you lead your tribe of cats to the stars (and... beyond), I /do/ find myself losing weeks to it at a time... alternatively I recently played a few hours of Evolve, it's decent, more active, has you directing some smaller scale actions sorta thing. Probably best to put "Idle Game" in the search criteria for both of these titles...

There's a subreddit called Incremental Games that's got a whole bunch more of them.
