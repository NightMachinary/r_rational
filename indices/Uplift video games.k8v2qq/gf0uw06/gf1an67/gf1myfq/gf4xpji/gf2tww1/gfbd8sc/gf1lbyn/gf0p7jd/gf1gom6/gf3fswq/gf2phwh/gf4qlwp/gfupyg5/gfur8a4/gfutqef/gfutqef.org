I don't refine catnip unless I need a quick boost in wood. I'm not crazy! If it takes a little longer to get there and I waste some efficiency... eh. I'm mostly letting it run on its own in a tab and visiting occasionally for some conversions/upgrades to get to certain objectives (right now I'm aiming at a Steamworks).
