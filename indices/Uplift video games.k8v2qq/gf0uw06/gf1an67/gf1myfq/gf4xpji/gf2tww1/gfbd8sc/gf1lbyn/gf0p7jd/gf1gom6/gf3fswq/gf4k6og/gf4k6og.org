I'll second Paperclip Maximizer, a good intro to idle games. Not too long like some of the others, with decent progression balancing well enough to introduce things just when a previous dynamic get's old.

The concept is disturbing in it's implications, but it's a good cautionary tail. Ensure anything you create shares all your value objectives, otherwise it will maximize to given parameters.
