FYI: If you're maxed out on Factorio, or find the factories to be overwhelming, I can totally recommend Mindustry; instead of having one huge map, the game's split up into multiple smaller maps so you get to "reset" your factory often.

The game also has blueprints unlocked from the very beginning, which is nice.
