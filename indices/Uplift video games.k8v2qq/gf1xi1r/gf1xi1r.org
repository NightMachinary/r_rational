I remember Dark Cloud 2 feeling like this, albeit with a bit more time traveling. You are an inventor, and 1/2 the game has you sort of develop villages in the past to help establish things in the future, and you can apply your inventions more directly to your personal ridebot as well for the other half, the combat portions.
