In /Tyranny/ you roleplay as the main lieutenant of a Sauron-like evil overlord. You get to slowly control more and more the diplomatic and military fortunes of the campaign that is conquering the last free corner of the world for his dominion, and depending on your choices, things can take different turns. It's not exactly what you're describing (the whole game likely takes place over a space of mere weeks), but it's an example of something similar (also just generally a really good game).
