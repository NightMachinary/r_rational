Ok so I read the chapter, not bad, not very long, lots of soft recaps for all of us who may have forgotten the story so far (please have mercy for this heresy Ouri Sama!) and reminders of who is who. One great thing about this I love: The part where they discuss business and law changes that come about from free matter/object replication. Not too detailed, but absolutely great showing what happens in real life if you introduce superpowers. And of course this is not even the first time this story did it.

Void bless us all! Happy days indeed! New year gift came early! huzzah! etc etc!
