While it's kind of cool to come back to this story old enough to recognize names like Northrop Gunman and De Beers, I'm just not invested in the story any more, especially with a such a weak and exposition-heavy returning chapter. Even if the author sticks to the premise, the story is never going to be what it would have been because the author is a very different person now (unless something odd happened to them). I'd rather have them start a new story under the same premise, so we can get a proper introduction (First Chapter) to what the story will be.
