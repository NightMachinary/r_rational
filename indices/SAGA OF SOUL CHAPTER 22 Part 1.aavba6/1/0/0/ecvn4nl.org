Just continue the concept of the double factorial for triple and quadruple factorials.

If 10!! = 10*8*6*4*2, then something like 10!!! = 10*7*4*3 and 10!!!! = 10*6*2.

With four exclamation marks, you multiply the given number by every other fourth number down to the smallest number before reaching 1.

22!!!! = 22*18*14*10*6*2 = 665280.
