there is a lot of dungeon fiction out there. yet no rules for doing it in D&D. making the dungeon a demiplane (similar to the shadowfel) would solve this and allow for dungeons to spawn and grow in the world, without worrying about whats physically in the location below the entrance.

from there, its a question of what limits are on how a dungeon can grow. using CR is one way, but for traps its down to the DC to spot are remove them. say each level has no more monsters than would let a party of 4 or 5 heroes level up. each level below they get stronger. the 'wandering monsters' can spawn out of the very walls if the adventurers wait too long in one spot.

in a world with such dungeons, what would be the rational response to them? destroy them while they are small and weak (lowest risk), farm them for resources and treasure, or just try to avoid them? eventually, after however many decades they may grow to the point they attach to a dungeon dimension which could allow travel between points.
