I think you would see different cultural camps:

- Cutie absolutists, who think that cutie marks /are/ what you are, and what you should be judged by, and any deviation from your cutie mark is just a temporary state before regression to the mark.
- Cutie inclinationists, who think that cutie marks aren't who you are, just who you're inclined to be, and you should only be judged on what you do, not what you're /inclined/ to do.
- Cutie nihilists, who think that the cutie marks essentially don't mean anything at all, save for what meaning people give them, and all this bullshit about your cutie mark is a social construct.

This assumes that things are muddled enough that it's legitimately difficult to tell which is actually true, though I think there's quite a bit of nuance even if the object-level truth is clear.
