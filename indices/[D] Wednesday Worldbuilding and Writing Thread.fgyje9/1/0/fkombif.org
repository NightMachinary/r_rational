In a rational world, I think they'd become similar to the national park system. They start out wild areas that only the crazy and most rugged of individualists go into. Maybe for leveling up or money, and they're slowly tamed until eventually they're safe enough for families to bring their kids into, and take pictures next to the caged mimic. With, of course, a guide to help them through and fight any dangerous monsters.

There's also the potential for large corporations to effectively strip mine some dungeons for profit, workers wouldn't be able to level up too much bc there'd effectively be a team of 12-50 going up against monsters made for a team of 4. They'd be similar to coal miners. Certainly not treasure hunters. With the amount of “rare” items found by the typical DND party, these “rare” items are not necessarily that rare.

As lower levels are reached, private companies will be forced to develop large armies to lead into the raid. This could develop into a slave economy, where to serve business needs companies will often turn their armies to the outside world, and get enough people to work the dungeons. At this point, the companies would look more like Feudal states. Killing tameable monsters would be looked down upon as a waste of valuable labor. Maybe even monsters would be preferred over humans at this point, as they are stronger and require less effort to take care of.

As you said, they could also be used as safe transportation alternatives.
