Nobody? Let me think of something. Um. Damnit I have a great munchkinry question but that'll wait for Saturday (Note to self: the IQ question).

WARNING: Ponies, but we're just importing an underexplored MLP concept onto modern society

--------------

My Little Pony's lore has each pony having a 'cutie mark', which is a symbol reflecting their special talent they get on their butt at ~puberty. The cutie mark appears in dramatic fashion when you perform your "special talent" at the right age. So, for example, if you're really good at growing apples you'll get an apple cutie mark; writers a quill, photographers a camera, etc. I don't know canonically how well this is controlled: like, if you're born with your cutie mark ready to appear, or if it is determined based on what you actually do with your life, or if it's some combo of the two.

How would human society be different if we had cutie marks? (Let's assume they're on the shoulder so we're not looking at butts all the time). I'd imagine they'd be part of job interviews, you wouldn't hire a wedding photographer who didn't have a camera cutie mark, etc. People would research the nature-vs-nurture of cutie marks, and if it's nature children would be pressured to do, I don't know, corporate synergy at age 12 so that way they can get a "synergy" or "team player" cutie mark? What about the kid who spends her teen years doing [regrettable thing], gets the associated cutie mark, and then beocmes a born again christian and has to live with the shame? Will there be scandals as politicians change their cutie marks to be more appropriate when they begin their careers? Will the enlightened nordic countries ban showing cutie marks in public?
