In MLP canon, cutie marks often took a metaphorical or hidden meaning. Applejack's cutie mark represents her being true to herself by returning to her roots, in other words although it may literally boost her Apple growing ability, it also represents her honesty and common sense. Likewise Cheerile's Mark is 3 flowers and represents her students growth and not literal plant growing. Twilight Sparkle has a mark representing her magic, but her true specialization in magic, the magic of friendship she didn't discover about herself until years later. The Cutie Mark Crusaders have helped ponies that misinterpreted their own mark.

  Will there be scandals as politicians change their cutie marks to be more appropriate when they begin their careers?
#+end_quote

I think politicians will heavily reinterpret their marks into palatable and presentable forms. The scandals will be the cases where they outright lie about the how they got their marks. “This bloody knife represents the time I acted decisively to save a friends life protecting them from wild dogs, not backstabbing.” Followed by the story comes out from friends or family that they actually got it betraying someone during middle school teenage drama and then convincing a friend to help spread the wild dog story instead.

  Will the enlightened nordic countries ban showing cutie marks in public?

I imagine it would be a faux pass to interpret someone else's mark and not take them at their word and probably illegal to outright discriminate based on marks.

  People would research the nature-vs-nurture of cutie marks, and if it's nature children would be pressured to do, I don't know, corporate synergy at age 12 so that way they can get a "synergy" or "team player" cutie mark?

Probably easier for the parents to instead help their kid come up with a fictitious just so story that totally puts a different interpretation to the mark.

  What about the kid who spends her teen years doing [regrettable thing], gets the associated cutie mark, and then beocmes a born again christian and has to live with the shame?
#+end_quote

It would be direct proof that conversion doesn't fundamentally change you, which would directly contradict fundamentalist Christianity's claims, but hard evidence against them not stopped fundamentalists from shaming people (see conversion camps). If anything I imagine the pressure would be to show off their “sinful” mark during testimonials and talk about how Jesus totally lets them resist... simultaneously lying to themselves and other people (similar to ex-gay testimonies). I imagine countries that practice FGM might try burning marks off.

  I'd imagine they'd be part of job interviews, you wouldn't hire a wedding photographer who didn't have a camera cutie mark, etc.

Cutie marks are often metaphorical or abstract and can have varying levels of focus. A party planning or artistic or fashion related cutie mark might be just as good as a photography cutie mark for indicating being good at photography for a wedding. Whereas insisting on that camera cutie mark got you someone who got their cutie mark because they love going on vacation and taking lots of quick photos... with a minimal boost to skill actually applied to the photography part and lots of effort and skill put into the vacation planning part. Meanwhile the perfect photographer has a ray of light mark indicating their ability to always get perfect lighting in their shots.
