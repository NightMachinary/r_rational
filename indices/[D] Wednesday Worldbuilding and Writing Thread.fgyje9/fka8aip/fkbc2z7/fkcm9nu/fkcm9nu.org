In the absolutists/inclinationist camps There might also be a split between prescriptivist and descriptivists. In MLP canon ponies often have narrow savant abilities relating to their talents, I.e. Rarities gem finding spell that funds her generosity and gives her raw materials for her fashion work. If this phenomena exists their might be debate about its origin and connection with the marks.

Prescriptivists might think the phenomena behind cutie marks also grants skills and increased learning ability relating to the mark. They would point to examples like Rarity or Pinkie Pie, where the subject instantly shows skill relating to their mark (or near future about to appear mark) that they had no time to train in or develop talents for.

Descriptivists might think that marks only indicate/hint at what might be developed or is “naturally” their they would point out that the “Rarities” that instantly manifest skills are extremely rare, the “Pinkie Pies” learn naturally but quickly through motivated hard work, and that many cases that prescriptivists point to are actually “Rainbow Dashes”: some initial talent followed by years of practice and hard work to first show the savant ability when they get their cutie mark followed by years more of practice after to regularly utilize their savant ability.
