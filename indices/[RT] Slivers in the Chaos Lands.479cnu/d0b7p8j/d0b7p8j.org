This is a quest that I just started over on SV. The premise is that you are a new-born [[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397585][sliver queen]] in a land of shifting realities and constant war. The Chaos Lands touch everywhere and everywhen, but they are nowhere and nowhen themselves. People and places drift in from outside and then, sometimes at least, they drift out again. The laws of reality change whenever there is a Chaos Shift. Our protagonist, a cuddly newborn omnivorous fast-spawning killing machine, must survive while surrounded by ogres, orcs, elves, and that M-113 APC that just wandered through.

Slivers are an MtG borrow, but the Chaos Lands are original.
