I'm on there as "rangerscience". Tots wall of text'd.

In my ideal world this will remind me of various games I played in college - various degrees of free-form RPGs.

Most valuable things in those games? History books, followed by weird.

Edit: WOOPS. Missed a key hyphenation - free-form CIV-rpg's. One time I played the only person in world making trains. Three months of play (about a year in game?) I had superheroes, crazy mutant war dog mounts, and blimps - but I would routinely risk it all for /one. more. history. book./ Helped the world underwent a /clearly/ human-triggered catastrophe a few centuries earlier and the people who knew the most (and probably did it) took the brunt of that and so were all dead and in ruins.

Good times.
