+Yes. Dredge is a replacement effect and can trigger separately for each draw. The card Breakthrough used to be used in dredge decks because it gave you 4 "draws" and then let you re-discard the dredged cards.+

Edit: Never mind, read that wrong. You need one "draw", per dredge trigger, but can dredge multiple times to the same effect. So Ancestral Recall would let you dredge three times off of one spell, but your draw step only lets you dredge once.
