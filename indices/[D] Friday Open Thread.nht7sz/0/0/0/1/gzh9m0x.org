I'm late and it's kind of tangential, but this is why I really enjoy Endless Space 2 and to a lesser extent, Civilization: Beyond Earth. Both have tons of flavor and theme for me to role-play with in my mind. They don't get as specifically in-depth as paradox games, but I still really enjoy them for the role-playing potential. Even if it's a sort of high level aesthetic role-play.
