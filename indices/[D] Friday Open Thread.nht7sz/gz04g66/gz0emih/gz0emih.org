Y'know, the deserts/desserts thing was called out and pointed out in-story with the joke about being stranded in a massive dessert and so on, but it hadn't occurred to me that Bucket's just world fallacy + the deaths of the children by means of confections == "just desserts." Man, that story is like an everlasting gobstopper, there's just always more delicious layers to suck on.
