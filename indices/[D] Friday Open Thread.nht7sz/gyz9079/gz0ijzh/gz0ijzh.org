Have you thought about a pulse oximiter?

It's somewhat unlikely that your room is low on oxygen. A pulse oximiter will end up getting you the same information (whether or not you have enough oxygen), but unlike an oxygen meter it isn't worthless if it turns out your hypothesis is incorrect since you'll still be able to use it for medical diagnostics. IIRC, I think pulse oximiters are cheaper too since they're a relatively commonly used medical device.
