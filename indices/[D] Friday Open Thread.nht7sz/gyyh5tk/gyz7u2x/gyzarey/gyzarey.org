I like to roleplay in paradox games, which means I care about 'historical' outcomes. In particular, the more simulationist a game is, the more outcomes feel like they're 'plausible' rather than just me playing a historically-themed board game. Victoria 2 (and the newly announced Victoria 3) are by far the most simulationist of the paradox games. Conquering europe in EU4 or HOI4 feels like winning a game of chess, but raising literacy to 100% as russia in Vicky 2 feels like I'm the enlightened national leader that brought my backwards nation from poverty into prosperity.

It's why I'm super hyped about a lot of the systems that Victoria 3 got announced with-- market management, standards of living, interest groups, employment, technological growth, etcetera. It's just so much more engaging for me to craft an industry that enriches my people to increase my power to allow my diplomatic influence to spread over europe to reclaim territories full of my cultural minorities than it is to spend bird mana to turn Italy Brazilian or bullhorn mana to kick the communists out of belgium.
