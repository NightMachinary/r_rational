[[https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=2fe3172d2b9fe684977d184f1b6226d5][Pushing It]] - The Best Short Puzzling Game You will Ever Play!

It's short with only 12 levels, but unlike most other games where they baby you by taking several levels to introduce each new mechanic, this game ramps up the difficulty and creative puzzle design at a very quick pace. Each level requires multiple insights into how to beat it which is impressive considering how short and small each level is.

Why am I posting it to here? Because I figured you guys liked using your brains and this really is one of the best short games I have ever played.
