From what I have seen, when it comes to accomplishing goals, diligence can stand in for intelligence. That is to say, a very diligent person with average intelligence can accomplish goals as well as a very lazy person of above-average intelligence.

So. We have three major potential states under consideration here; average intelligence with average diligence, poor intelligence with excellent diligence, or excellent intelligence with poor diligence.

It may well be that all of these are approximately equivalent in terms of accomplishing desired goals. Or perhaps desired goals are the product of diligence and intelligence, in which case the best goal-accomplishment point is average intelligence with average diligence.

However, goal /accomplishment/ is only /half/ of the question under consideration; after all, you can only accomplish the goals that you first set. And goal /setting/ is weighted much more towards intelligence. Doing your due diligence will help to avoid certain traps in your goal-setting, of course, but it's a long way from all that is necessary.

...so, I think I'd go with about +80% to intelligence; this doesn't torpedo diligence completely, but still improves my odds of picking and accomplishing good goals.
