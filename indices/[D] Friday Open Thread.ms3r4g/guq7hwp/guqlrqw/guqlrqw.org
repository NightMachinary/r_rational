Congratulations on the grant!

The sliders and their traits are very difficult for me to think about, you need to know: population levels and distributions of traits, what that would look like in an individual, and how that would effect your individual life.

Intelligence is relatively easy: IQ starting at 100, low elasticity, maxing at 229 at 100% (by my quick Google search). We've all experienced people who just seem naturally smarter, able to retain, apply, and learn things faster so 229 IQ I imagine as becoming millionaire pro-athlete natural levels of those traits. Read the book once and quote most of it, know it's inconsistencies vs other theories, etc.

Diligence is much harder. I have no idea what the baseline level looks like or how it drops. +100% would be better than intense buddhist monks: able to happily live in austere environments, and burn themselves to death for what they think is right without flinching. I don't even know what that would look like applied to modern life. Would I be perfectly executing conscious ideas all the time? Could I think "be content" like the monks using my super will? Would people here consider that wire heading?

I'm leaning towards extremely high diligence, intelligence is massively over rated. Just keeping IQ above like 80 wouldn't be a huge problem(~10% of population below that point). IIRC 70+ people are societally functional and <1% of the population is below 60. This is also hard to picture since I believe low IQ equals low diligence in real life, long term planning and conscientiousness are pretty nerdy, and low IQ is typically the result of wide reaching problems.
