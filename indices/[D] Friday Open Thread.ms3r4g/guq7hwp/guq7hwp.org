Suppose you had a slider that could trade off mental acuity / intelligence against conscientiousness / diligence / executive function. Specifically, it is calibrated against the current global population, and operates on a quantile scale -- you start off at the median of each trait, and any increase in the quantile of one is met by an equal and opposite decrease in the quantile of the other (i.e. their sum is constrained to 1 or 100). So you can make yourself very smart and very lazy, rather dim but quite hard-working, etc. You can only do this once, and it affects as yet "unmalleable" aspects of each trait, but you can still adopt compensatory strategies to make up for what shortcomings present themselves. Where would you plop yourself? The slider tops out at making you just a smidge smarter than the smartest person on earth + just a bit lazier than the laziest person on earth, or vice-versa.

(also, on an unrelated note, my PI just told me that I'd gotten an NIH T15 lol -- despite me playing 0 role in the application process. Easiest free money I've ever received! haha)
