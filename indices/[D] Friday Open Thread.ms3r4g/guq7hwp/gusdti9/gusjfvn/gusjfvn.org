I had an idea for a fantasy novel.

Actually, I had the idea over a year ago. It ended up being hundreds of pages long.

Here's chapter 1 of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/30168021/chapters/74324781][Gradient]].

"Rayan and Osmond are shamans. They possess the Wind's Gift, a telekinesis ability unique to the Walkish People. Their tribe is attacked by the Balladians, whose own magic involves singing fire into the world. The Balladians seek a shaman for reasons unknown. Rayan and his mentor seek answers. Join them on a journey deep into Balladia, and into the secret and dangerous knowledge where magicks intersect."

I plan to release a chapter a week while editing.
