I have to say that I find it odd that when the characters found out that the creatures of the swamp are strangely intelligent not a single person suggested making a ninja capable of communicating with them. Or even the possibility of communicating with them. That which has the power of reasoning abity can be reasoned with at least in theory.

Also I am real sad I am too late to join this game and make that suggestion.
