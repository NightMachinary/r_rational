Re-posting my post from SV. I suggest we do the mission to go into town to trade. We already have to get through the swamp to get to town and can scout what and where things to be gathered from the swamp on our way in and out to report to our group. We won't be getting as much as if we scouted the swamp in full but we will be starting to forge/scout a safe path out should one be needed, which is important. Knowing what the lay of the land look like outside the swamp which can be done by obtaining a map or tracing one with our finger in town. If we want to risk it we could ask about the swamp from the people living next to it to see how traveled it is by ninja. This could lead to more jobs or a way of bribing the villagers to not report our being here if we can make the swamp safer for them to gather resources from if we report back our findings to Shikigami-sensei.
