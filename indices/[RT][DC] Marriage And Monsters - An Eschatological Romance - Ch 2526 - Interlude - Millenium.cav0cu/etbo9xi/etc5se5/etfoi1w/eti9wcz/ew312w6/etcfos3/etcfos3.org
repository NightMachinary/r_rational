I love the world and the narrative, but it's disappointingly not rational. This example in ch 26, when Sean tries to make it a useful letter is the best one - he's no Harry Potter. Instead of listing his experiences and observations for his smarter partner to analyze, he just jumps to conclusions and states his hypothesis with no darn proof! And this is a chosen and beloved partner of our rationalist hero? I really wanted to skip this part.

There were other irrational moments in this book, this is just one example.
