I'm actually really surprised that he would do a Kickstarter again, given how it turned out for both him and his backers last time. I know from his perspective it might seem like the problem was entirely with the Evertide, but even then, he has to realize that it left a sour taste in everyone's mouth, and that it would be the thing his fans would think about when he did a new Kickstarter.
