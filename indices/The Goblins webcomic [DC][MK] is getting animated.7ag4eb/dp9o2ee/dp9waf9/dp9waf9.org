Important clarification: This is a /kickstarter/ for an animated Goblins series.

Given the creator's past track record, I doubt that this is going to happen, at least not without racking up unexpected expenses and running into severe delays that seriously hamper the quality of the product.

In fact, I strongly advise against donating to this campaign. There was a previous Goblins Kickstarter (this one for a card game) and... Let's just say that the story of its creation (or lack thereof, for a period of several years) is a frustrating one.

Much of the blame can be laid at the hands of Evertide, the company responsible for producing the card game, but Tarol was incredibly flaky and uncommunicative on the matter. Not only do you run the risk of your money going into a deep pit, but you can't reasonably expect a response about it.

(I recognize that he's got some big names attached to this project, but I still wouldn't risk it. He's dropped the ball too many times before, and to be honest I'm worried that this project is going to be /too/ big for him.)
