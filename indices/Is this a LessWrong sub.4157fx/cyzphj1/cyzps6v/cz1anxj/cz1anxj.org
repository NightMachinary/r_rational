  Well I think that life is primarily a negative experience
#+end_quote

Hmmm... I'm not sure about "primarily", but I actually partly agree. Life is /currently/ a /sufficiently/ negative experience that there are great parts of it which I have zero desire to repeat. /That disturbs me immensely/, and makes me feel as if I must be some unusually emotionally damaged individual, especially for having a materially privileged life, but no, the more other people I meet, the more it turns out that /life just sucks like that/, at least right now.

[[http://meaningness.com/kitsch][I just don't consider this a universal or eternal truth.]] I consider it a local trend of my local space-time, and remind myself that "final truths" and "eternal laws", as actually viewed by humans, have actually tended to change about every one to two generations. The things I know as "eternal" will completely cease to be by the time I'm middle-aged. Therefore, I should disregard them and press to make life and the world /better/.

  and people deserve to die and move on to the next life to reap their karma
#+end_quote

Aside from [[http://meaningness.com/atheism-first-step][telling you there is no next life or karma]], I fail to understand how this ties in with the first part of your sentence. If existence is mostly negative, why would it be /right/ for people to go on to yet another lifetime of negativity?

  And I believe that ethics can only be determined through philosophical insight, I think that the Is/Ought barrier is pretty strong.

Tell us, what's the causal structure of the "philosophical insight" to which you refer?
