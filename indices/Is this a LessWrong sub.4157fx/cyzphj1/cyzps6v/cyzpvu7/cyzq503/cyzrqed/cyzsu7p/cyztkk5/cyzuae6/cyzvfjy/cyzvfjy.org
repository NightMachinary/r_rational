One of the major points that Yudkowsky uses to argue for here-and-now immortality is that desiring, or expecting, some continued chain of afterlives (or a chain that terminates in a "forever") still /is/ immortality, it's just one that doesn't take place in this subset of reality. Now, generally, the LW writings on this are a little... aggressive, but the question's still valid.

That said, what I'm hearing from you is that it is not the seeking of immortality that dismays you, but the seeking of permanence....?
