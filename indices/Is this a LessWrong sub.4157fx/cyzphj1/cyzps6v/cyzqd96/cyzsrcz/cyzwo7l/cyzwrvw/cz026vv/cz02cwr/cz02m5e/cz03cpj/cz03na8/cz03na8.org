I am not a mathematician, so I will not post layman-understanding level nonsense, but I am given to understand that people had to investigate and compile information to arrive at the theories you posted. These people were, in all likelihood, fairly smart.

They then had to prove said theories beyond reasonable doubt to other, reasonably likely to be fairly smart, people, who then would verify, eventually agree with, and disseminate this information.

By this logic, while I personally cannot give you the proofs, I can posit the position that, were you to study advanced mathematics and take a course that covers imaginary numbers in detail, you would have you fill of proofs, as well as how we arrived at them.
