Proven, mate. Proved is the current variant to use when discussing something done by a person in the past (Ex: Bob proved Cindy was drinking the last of the coffee by checking the break room camera), while Proven is used for non-direct descriptions (Ex: Bob's theory of Cindy being the coffee finisher was proven after Steve reviewed the break room camera.)

Anyway, on topic, and I'm saying that they were proven experimentally for their field. Mathematical logic is the study of numbers and number theory. Philosophical logic is the study of ideas.

These are two distinct forms of logic, and are very different from one another.
