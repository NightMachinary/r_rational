If you feel compelled to value one moral system over another, you must have had a reason to do so.

a) If this reason involves departure from empiricism, you may as well not have used logic to get this far, if you were just going to scrap it at the last instant.

b) If your reason for choosing one over the other did involve logic, I argue that it is /that logical system itself/ that guides you, since it precludes it.
