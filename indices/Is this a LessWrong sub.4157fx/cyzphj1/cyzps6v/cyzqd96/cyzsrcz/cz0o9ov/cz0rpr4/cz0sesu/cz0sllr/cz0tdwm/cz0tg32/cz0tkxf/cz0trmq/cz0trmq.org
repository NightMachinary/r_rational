I disagree. I believe that since I can't survive without supporting companies that do horrible things, that ethical consumption is a fools errand. Even if I go buy land in the middle of nowhere and subsistence farm I'm still owning land that was stolen and probably murdered for, since I'm in America. The only solution is to be homeless and naked and only eat fruit plucked off of wild trees that you found.
