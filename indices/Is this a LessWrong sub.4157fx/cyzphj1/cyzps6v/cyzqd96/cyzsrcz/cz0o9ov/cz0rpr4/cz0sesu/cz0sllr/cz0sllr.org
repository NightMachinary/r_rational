There's a very real causal difference. If you buy a chicken burrito from a 7-11 that chicken has already been slaughtered. Your individual demand from not eating meat won't result in there not being chicken in the freezer there. It's a very specific circumstance that isn't very lendable to punch-in-face analogies.
