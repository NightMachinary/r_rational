You do not experience the same reality as I do. That said, I somewhat subscribe to the idea that we can share an experience set and means of interaction but without "sharing" a reality.

If this is life, then, I guess, you'd call the series of reincarnations as meta-life?

With that word-usage - Why do you expect this life to be a primarily negative experience for all people, but (to put words in your mouth) the meta-life to be a primarily positive experience for all people?
