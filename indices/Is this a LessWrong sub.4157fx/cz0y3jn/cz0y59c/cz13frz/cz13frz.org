If you're discussing in good faith, stick around. "I'm bailing because there's too much discussion" sounds, at least in my ears, like an excuse. Few people bail on conversations that they are enjoying, and they generally don't leave long, ambiguous, mystical screeds behind.

I will comment that, had your excuse been something like "I'm really enjoying this, but I have a paper due tomorrow and need to go write it" then I doubt anyone would have said anything.

Speaking of which, I have a quest due tomorrow and need to go write it.
