Don't worry about it. This is likely just a misunderstanding caused by a cultural gap. As I said earlier:

  Also, I just want to make this clear just in case you don't understand and get offended, when we disagree with or contradict other people's opinions, we're NOT claiming any superiority over them nor trying to establish ourselves as dominant over them in any way whatsoever. Many of us are genuinely glad when we are proven wrong about something.

If someone gets defensive about a belief and starts responding to people rather than responding to the things that they're saying, it looks to many of us like that person is shutting the door in our faces on the discussion. People here consider that very rude. To us, communication is information-sharing. If no information is shared, then nothing is communicated. This conversation was started because someone was curious about what you believe and why. They were asking about your beliefs, not about you. When you began answering their questions and engaging in the discussion, they thought you were ONLY talking about beliefs, they didn't see it as an attempt to get to know each other by exchanging cultural ideas.

This kind of cultural misunderstanding happens all the time. This article does an amazing job of explaining it:

It's really fascinating, I highly recommend reading it. I hope you don't get the wrong impression about this community. We're actually a really thoughtful and friendly bunch, we just have a bit of a...PR problem I guess you could call it because of misunderstandings like this.
