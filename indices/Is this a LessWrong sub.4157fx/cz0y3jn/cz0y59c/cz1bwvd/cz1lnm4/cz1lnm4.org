Rude, or merely accurate? [[/u/portodhamma]] is obviously not willing to discuss in good faith, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4157fx/is_this_a_lesswrong_sub/cz0vj4e?context=3][they shroud themselves in mysticism and "I know better than you cuz my friend said so"]]. You will note that I only used such accurate terms [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4157fx/is_this_a_lesswrong_sub/cz0rlj0][after giving them the opportunity to respond with a rational basis for their beliefs]]. I think they may be more comfortable in subreddits like [[/r/occult]], [[/r/alchemy]], or [[/r/astrology]], where claims of knowledge aren't so well scrutinized.
