I think you'll be fine with the discussion. I'm not a True Believer and don't write like one, and I think I more or less fit in with the community. I don't necessarily /disagree/ with immortality, atheism, transhumanism, etc. But I'm not about to proselytize or present those views in an unexamined way (speaking as though you are Right is one of those things that I find annoying no matter who's saying it and about what).
