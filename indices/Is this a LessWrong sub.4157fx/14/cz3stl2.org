I think a lot of the works of fiction presented on this sub has themes of:

- Technological utopianism: the human condition can and should be improved upon with technology.
- Transhumanism: technology can augment and improve human experience and capability.
- Anti-deathism: death is neither necessary nor inevitable.
- High stakes: it's about saving all of humanity's future.

It is not always apparent, but I suspect most stories will have an end-game utopia incorporating those themes.

Anecdotally, I would think that most people come for the litterature first, and the themes second, but this is a sub for the specific genre of fiction --- sure, we have the necessary description in the sidebar, but there is also a â€˜culture' surrounding ratfic.
