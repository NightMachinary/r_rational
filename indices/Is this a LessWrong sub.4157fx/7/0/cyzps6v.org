Well I think that life is primarily a negative experience and people deserve to die and move on to the next life to reap their karma. It's not a scientific perspective, but one I formulated through study of religion and personal experience. And I believe that ethics can only be determined through philosophical insight, I think that the Is/Ought barrier is pretty strong.
