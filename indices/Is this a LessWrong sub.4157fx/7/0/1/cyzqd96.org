Would you make that choice for them?

The general thought around here tends to be preference utilitarianism. That is, if you'd prefer to die you deserve to be given that option. Some would qualify that saying that you should at least make an honest effort to enjoy your life so that others aren't sad about your passing.

But many people do strongly want to live. They should be allowed to, indefinitely if they want.

As for ethics being only determinable through philosophical thought, well most people here and on lesswrong would actually agree with you, more or less.

Rationality is a tool for accomplishing your goals, but your goals themselves can't be decided "rationally". There's no "rational" axioms, no rational reason to want to be happy.

But rationality can help you notice contradictions in your goals, help you figure out what you really want, and when your goals truly do conflict they help you decide which ones to pursue.
