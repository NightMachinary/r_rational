>Why virtue ethics?

Largely because of two things: I believe motive matters in determining the goodness of an action, and deontology and consequentialism were ruled out.

To elaborate: I find it impossible to conceive of a set of maxims that apply to every situation and I find it horrifying to assign ethical culpability when the consequences of an action can be ridiculously, insanely hard to predict with surety.

EDIT: I could really go into things like metaethics and epistemology but I'm on mobile and it's cold so I won't.
