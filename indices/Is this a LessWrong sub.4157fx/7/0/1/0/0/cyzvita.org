Ahh, well there's your problem. Virtue ethics.

In all seriousness though, why virtue ethics?

A rationalist-ish take on the whole veganism thing could look like [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/23/vegetarianism-for-meat-eaters/][this]].

TL:DR

  This argument is so simple I feel dumb for not thinking of it myself; instead, I take it from Julia Galef and Brian Tomasik. Suppose I get about a third of my daily calorie requirement from meat; that adds up to 250,000 calories of meat a year. Further suppose that it's split evenly between 125,000 calories of beef and 125,000 calories of chicken.

  The average cow is very big and makes 405,000 calories of beef; the average chicken is very small and makes 3000 calories worth of chicken. So each year, I kill about 0.3 cows and about 42 chickens, for a total of 42.3 animals killed.

  Suppose that I stop eating chicken and switch entirely to beef. Now I am killing about 0.6 cows and 0 chickens, for a total of 0.6 animals killed. By this step alone, I have decreased the number of animals I am killing from 42.3/year to 0.6/year, a 98% improvement.

As an example of the general approach. The question then becomes one of whether you value cows more then chickens, and if so how much.
