I would think that justifying an /obligation/ to refrain from immortality or to never have kids is a far tougher prospect than saying that it isn't virtuous behavior. This is coming from a virtue ethics standpoint, of course. I would regard veganism as virtuous,but I would only extend obligation to refraining from actually hurting animals yourself.
