I'm actually going to specifically disagree. If I take "entropic origins of life", "causaul entropic forcing", and a bit of musing on evolution (I'll go over those), I get that you /should/ be attached to your physical form.

First thing's first, however - the afterlife isn't a thing you should consider. Primarily for two reasons. The first is that it's /after/ this one, and live in the moment and all that. The second is that, if you are being virtuous for the sake of gain down the road, are you being virtuous? I'd definitely say that for the most part, virtue is an in-the-moment thing.

But back to the entropic stuff. There's three principles in play:

- A dead universe with entropy eventually develops life, due to 1) life is "better" at "entropy" (read the source material, these are both well-defined in this context) and 2) dead matter undergoes something resembling evolution that eventually results in live matter.
- An extremely reasonable explanation for the fundemental process of "intelligence" is "maximizing possible future". In more rigourous language, it's "maximize the entropic adjacency of all possible future states". Again, source material is good on this.
- Finally, it seems very reasonable to me that the story of evolution is the story of 1) bringing life to dead things (dead matter, then non-existence imaginary stuff, like ideas) and 2) ever-faster rates of change, currently culminating in an individual's memetics.

When considering all four of these things - "you can't take it with you", "dead matter becomes live matter", "live matter becomes smart matter", "smart means most possible futures"... it seems to me that the push of the universe is for you to have a physical body. If that's the push of the universe, seems like it'd be the virtuous path.

Notably, also implies we should terraform Mars.
