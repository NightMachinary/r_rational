Well, I'd probably typically write in a standard British English way, which is probably along the lines of writing in American English, but spelling some words like "colour" and "mum" as such, and perhaps forgetting a few of the weird 'translations' (like "pants", and "biscuits"), but pointing them out whenever I do write them (which is rarely).

It definitely /is/ an American English forum, though, and if I wrote something dialectal (I don't even know if I could, though? I don't usually use any dialectal wording) I'd include a translation. I'd personally be inclined to write "I proved" and "I've proven", but I'd be inclined to do that while speaking, too.

So, no, you're not incorrect, and I don't know if that person /is/ British, but I was just saying that if they /were/, it's actually, apparently, acceptable. It definitely read weirdly when I first saw it, though, so I'd say you're correct.
