That is a very strong claim to make, and it presupposes your worldview being correct.

Why would a virtuous person not be attached to their physical existence? Or an enlightened person? For both of these persons, the physical is all they have or can know, and both are obstructed from further good deeds and/or wisdom by the destruction of the carrier of their mind.

You can't be virtuous or wise if you die, mate. Death is a great big off switch. There is no "next life" to move on to.
