  Well a virtuous/enlightened person is not attached to their physical form.

Maybe. But that's only really talking about a virtuous or enlightened person in conditions of extreme social and technological impoverishment. A person in a healthier, more developed, more grown-up society and ecosystem could well live a "virtuous" life, by whatever definition you imagine it, and also live indefinitely.

One of the troubles with things like deontology and virtue-ethics is that they take the society around them for granted. They can only function in a single historical-material moment.
