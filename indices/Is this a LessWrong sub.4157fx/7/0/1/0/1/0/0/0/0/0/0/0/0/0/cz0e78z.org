  Proven, mate. Proved is the current variant to use when discussing something done by a person in the past (Ex: Bob proved Cindy was drinking the last of the coffee by checking the break room camera), while Proven is used for non-direct descriptions (Ex: Bob's theory of Cindy being the coffee finisher was proven after Steve reviewed the break room camera.)

I'm pretty sure the technical terms are "the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterite#English][preterite]]" (or just the simple past, "I proved") and "the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle#English][past participle]]" (also used in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_voice#In_English][passive voice]], like "was proven"). According to [[http://grammarist.com/usage/proved-proven/][Grammarist]], "proved" is (at least sometimes, though not that often in my experience) acceptable in British English as a past participle (e.g. "I have proved" or "it is/was proved").
