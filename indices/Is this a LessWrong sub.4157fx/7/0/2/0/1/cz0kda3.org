Would you think that Buddhism is a religion for those who see more bad experiences in life than good ones. I for instance don't want to kill myself because I believe that all the joy I have here would be irrevocably lost to me with the only thing I would face being utter oblivion. Oblivion being something similar to Nirvana but negative (instead of becoming one with everything you merely become nothing) though I don't see much practical difference between the two.
