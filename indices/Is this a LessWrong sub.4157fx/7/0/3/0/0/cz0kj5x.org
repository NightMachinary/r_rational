Many transhumanists don't actually cling to form or bodies though. They hope for things like body hopping, uploading, and even at some point cybernetically expanding their minds to levels that transcend physical dimensions. In a way they too thrive for reincarnation, just all in the one reality they /know/ to exist and without the loss of memory and personality that goes along with it. Though if I got you correctly you believe that we all already have achieved immortality and that you hope to get rid of it.
