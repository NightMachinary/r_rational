Why?

And to clarify: By deserve to die I didn't mean if everyone should have the right to die once they truly wish to do so. I meant if everyone deserves to have their lifespan limited regardless of their wishes and even though no reward or punishment that would be different from anybody else's reward or punishment awaits them.
