  Ok first, life-extending treatment is just that, life-extending. That is a fundamentally different goal than immortality.

So life extension is okay then? Is that regardless of length? If there were a medical procedure to increase the duration of life and health for a hundred years would that still be acceptable in your worldview? What about a thousand or ten thousand years? What about living till the heat death of the universe or beyond it. After all /true/ guaranteed immortality is pretty much impossible anyway. There could always be something out there to finally kill you.

  And rebirth does not necessarily lead to better conditions.

So what about people who are happy and healthy but are aware that they may have accumulated more bad karma than good? They don't necessarily fear death but prefer living a nice life to living a hard one. Wouldn't it be only sensible for them to try to extend their current life for as much as possible?

And I know that any life in any world is suffering due to wanting and craving things but in my own life experience I have more joy and positive emotions than I have pain or negative emotions. So you may understand that even Nirvana itself does not seem like something to strive for to me as it would mean an and to all of these experiences that I rather enjoy experiencing. Why would it be the moral thing to do to give all of that up anyway? Who do I help? What moral good do I advance by doing so?
