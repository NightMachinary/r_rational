Ok first, life-extending treatment is just that, life-extending. That is a fundamentally different goal than immortality. Accepting death should be on your own terms, though, anything less is murder and a removal of any choice.

And rebirth does not necessarily lead to better conditions. Bad karma is called bad for a reason. Good karma itself will not lead to enlightenment, though, only detachment from craving and aversion will.

And yes it will die out, even though /it is/ a missionary religion. As it said to have died out before. But it will be rediscovered (In the same way,even if civilization is destroyed, people will still rediscover calculus in time,it's a fundamental fact of the universe) and the cycle goes on. Buddhism is about the personal, and doesn't concern itself with effecting all of humanity.
