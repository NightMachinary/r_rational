If I understood it correctly then many Buddhists believe that once you die after achieving Nirvana you lose your "self" in Nirvana like a drop of water in the ocean. In other words finally and actually dying with nothing akin to an afterlife awaiting you is the /goal/. You can say that adherents of the Abrahamic religions believe they are struggling to attain immortality but Buddhists seem to believe that everyone already has that and that we should try to get rid of it.
