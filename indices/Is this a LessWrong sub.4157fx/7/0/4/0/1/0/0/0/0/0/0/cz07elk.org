I was under the impression that Buddhism's ultimate goal is to reach nirvana, a release from suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth. Which can be achieved during life, or death, and does not necessitate the existence of some other realm of being. For example, the Buddha is said to have reached nirvana while still alive, thus he lived without suffering.

Becoming immortal sounds quite like that goal, despite your unexplained and repeated objections.
