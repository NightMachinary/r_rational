Reaching nirvana doesn't require you to die first though, unless that's a specific belief of a subset of Buddhism. Also Buddhas (those that reached nirvana) are said to come back and help mankind, not disappear forever, meaning they aren't stuck in the cycle but can supposedly choose.

So if you were to reach nirvana and simply not die, that wouldn't violate any tenant or virtue in Buddhism.
