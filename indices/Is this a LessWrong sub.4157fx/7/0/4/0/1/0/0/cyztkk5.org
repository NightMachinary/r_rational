I actually find this belief system interesting. Though I have a few questions, if you wouldn't mind.

What is your position on life-saving medical treatment? If the point is to accept death and impermanence, should life be fought for at all?

Is the 'next life' in your conception a sort of Dharma wheel of reincarnation into a better life in this world, or a progression to a steadily better world ending in the Buddhist Nirvana? Do your actions effect this at all (does virtuous action lead to virtuous reward?)

Doesn't that kind of belief necessarily remove itself over time from existence?

If you bar both reproduction and continuation of life, and are a non-missionary faith as Buddhism is, the spread of the idea is necessarily limited. Unless it is vastly more persuasive than any other idea, or there is some huge external pressure, its proponents will fade away rapidly as they die and not be replaced by new believers.

It's sort of like the extropian argument against people who are Pro-Death for religious reasons, only it happens much faster, because they aren't reproducing or accepting any life extension.
