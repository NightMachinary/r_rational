You keep using that word, "believe".

Unfortunately, "believe" isn't usually an acceptable scientific proof. Do you have some sort of reproducible evidence that pointed you to this world view?

How are you determining that we are "trapped" in samsara? How are you so certain we aren't living in Midgard, or that this isn't the actual afterlife where we pay for our per-comitted sins, or that we aren't wandering around the river lathe and hallucinating, or any number of other, similarly ridiculous religious hokum?
