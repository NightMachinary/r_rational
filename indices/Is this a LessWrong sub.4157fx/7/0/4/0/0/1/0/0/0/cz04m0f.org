I'm not asking you to convince me, mate. I'm asking you to defend your worldview using a rational basis.

You're essentially dodging the question by saying "Well, I don't need to justify what I say to you."

Well, then keep your bloody mouth shut. I honestly find it disingenuous to state something as fact, then refuse to defend it when called on it.
