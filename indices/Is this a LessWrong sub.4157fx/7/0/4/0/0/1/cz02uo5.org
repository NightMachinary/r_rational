Ok first of all, it means that being trapped in Samsara means you will experience dukkha, which /can/ be translated as suffering and is the translation I prefer. I don't think death leads to escape from Samsara, but I do believe death comes for us all and isn't the worst thing possible. The only way to escape Samsara is through he Eightfold Path.

And you should read Kant's /Critique of Pure Reason./ It really goes into metaphysics and its importance.
