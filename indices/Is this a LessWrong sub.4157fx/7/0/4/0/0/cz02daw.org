That's a really fucked up interpretation of Buddhism, mate.

When the Buddha said that "life is suffering", he specifically referred to "want in life" is suffering, and that you end your suffering by ending you want.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you comments in this thread have lead me to understand that you see death as the ending of that want and suffering, on the assumption that there is some metaphysical life and karma cycle to wade through posthumously.

This is incorrect for a number of reasons. Firstly, "end of want" is a goal to reach through meditation and study, and is supposed to end you up at "working for more, content with that I've got".

It's the origin of the phrase "Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, carry water and chop wood."

Secondly, you can't enter into a rational discussion of the universe and bring metaphysical anything into it. For the purposes of rational conversation, introducing an inherently irrational element disrupts the whole thing, and invalidates your side. What sort of proof can you present for this karmic cycle and these next lived you mention?
