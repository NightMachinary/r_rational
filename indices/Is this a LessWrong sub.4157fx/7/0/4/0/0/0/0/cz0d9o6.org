It depends on the school of Buddhism you study. Like the monotheistic religions, there are a lot of sects.

On the grounds of rational agents, I'm labeling religious beliefs as inherently irrational due to that fact that they claim both dominion over and authority on information states that exist outside of reality. If we want to discuss extra-reality, then we may do. So, but we can't claim that our discussion will be rational within the boundaries of our reality.

An example of inherently irrational agents would be discussing classic fantasy magic. In our universe, rationality dictates that a human may not draw on natural energy unassisted, force it through a huge occult phase or state conversion and then release it as directed energy or matter, but a classic mage can summon a fireball and call up a golem without much issue.

In our universe, this is irrational, because the axioms that govern our existence show it to be impossible. As such, attempting to hold a conversation with someone who posits that such acts are possible in out reality contains an inherently irrational element, and is thus inherently irrational.
