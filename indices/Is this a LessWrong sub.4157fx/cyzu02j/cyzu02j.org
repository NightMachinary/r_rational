Welcome!

The reason most people in this community don't question the nonexistence of any gods is probably for the same reason that they don't question the nonexistence of Middle Earth. They've already done the questioning, found the evidence to be fairly conclusive that deities don't exist, and moved on to more interesting topics.

If you have found any evidence that a deity or deities exist, I'm sure many of us would love to hear it and discuss it with you. Just because most of us came to the same conclusions doesn't mean that none of us are open to discussion.

As for transhumanism and immortality, my understanding is that they are more of a value, something to strive for, not necessarily a belief that they are likely to happen. In this respect, google dictionary probably gets it wrong.

What exactly are your objections to effective altruism?

The reason that most people in this community agree on those specific three things: 1. that people should be allowed to live as long as they want, 2. that god(s) don't exist, and 3. that some charities are /significantly/ better at helping people and helping more people than other charities is because:

(1.) We like to be unusually honest and consistent with ourselves (so if one of us ever said that immortality was bad, we wouldn't contradict ourselves by saying that living forever in an afterlife was good.) And (2. and 3.) We each evaluated the evidence and came to our own conclusions.

NOT because of mob mentality.

Also, I just want to make this clear just in case you don't understand and get offended, when we disagree with or contradict other people's opinions, we're NOT claiming any superiority over them nor trying to establish ourselves as dominant over them in any way whatsoever. Many of us are genuinely /glad/ when we are proven wrong about something.

That being said, the rational fiction subreddit specifically is more about rational writing and literature, and not all of it focuses on those particular three subjects. You should be able to find a decent amount of rational fiction to read and enjoy which doesn't focus on atheism, transhumanism or effective altruism.

Some examples I would recommend include:

-Mother of Learning

-Worm

-Hogwarts Battle School

-The Martian (yes the same one that the movie was based on!)

-Forging the Sword

-Shadows of the Limelight

-Dungeon Keeper Ami

-What if Sg-1 Weren't Stupid (it's a lot better and funnier than it sounds. Must read if you're a stargate fan!)

-Stargate Physics 101

-Interview with a System Lord

-Twisted: the Untold Story of a Royal Vizier (okay, this one is kinda transhumanist, but it's a musical retelling of Disney's Aladdin, performed by Starkid, the same people who did a Very Potter Musical! Totally worth it even if you don't agree with transhumanism.

Enjoy!
