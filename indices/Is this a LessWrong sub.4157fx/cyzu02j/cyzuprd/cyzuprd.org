First of all, thank you for your suggestions! They should be very helpful, as I've already read and liked some of them.

Secondly, I was not trying to question atheism as a position, but on the internet, there's quite a bit of ideological baggage that comes with many atheist communities.

I also don't wish to remove any options for people to extend their lives, that's practically murder. However, I don't think eternal life is a good thing, and striving towards it is an unhealthy choice(clearly I mean spiritually, not physically.)

Also my objections to effective altruism are more along the lines of my inclination to virtue ethics as opposed to utilitarian. I can't save the world but I can act like a good person and gain contentedness from that.
