  I was not trying to question atheism as a position, but on the internet, there's quite a bit of ideological baggage that comes with many atheist communities.

You object to the atheist tribe, which is reasonable. A lot of people object to the lesswrong tribe, but they're still the best resources we have for a lot of skills. Some people from the Center for Applied Rationality are dissociating those skills from lesswrong as a tribe.

On the whole, we try to discourage tribalism here, so hopefully you won't have a hard time of it. People might need to be gently reminded occasionally though. Tribalism runs strong in humans.

That's actually one of the bigger complaints about lesswrong, that they encouraged tribalism for the sake of strength and unity, but that that gets in the way of other things we value like discussion and lack of tribe related bias.
