For what it's worth: immortality and effective altruism are not "new atheist and transhumanist platforms". Immortality and charity are major components of many religions.

Indeed, opposition to them tends to be from either secular or explicitly atheistic grounds (not that this has any epistemic ramifications WRT whether they're good ideas.)

In general, this sub is much more effective-altruist and transhumanist than it is atheist. If you dislike those things, I would probably not /recommend/ the sub (although that doesn't mean you'd necessarily hate hate it.) There /is/ "discussion challenging basic ideas of the LessWrong movement", but it's not a focus, and those ideas /are/ often assumed.
