I wouldn't like associating atheism and transhumanism with LW just as much as doing it with rationalism in general for the same reason that I don't like EY's influence too.

That being said, it's hard to make a good story in this genre if the plot\protagonists ignore things like atheism (unless it's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist][flat earth atheism]] --- which, interestingly enough, was [[http://i.imgur.com/xn4cYl4.png][Hariezer Yudotter's]] reaction to souls) and transhumanism.

Many of the stories I've noticed here so far also frequently deal with munchkining, loophole abuse, deconstruction of classic genres or works, and (sometimes) exploration of paradoxes and philosophical concepts.
