I am interested on your take on why I want immortality:

I want immortality because it seems like a pre-requisite for "fork-and-merge". That is, I want to make both choices, experience both outcomes, and then return to being a single individual. Ideally, I would like to do this without regards to time - fork myself sometime in the past, and meet them throughout the resulting "timeline".

For example, if I'd gone with the other choice for college. Or, being pursuing two different careers.
