  I haven't read the Metropolitan, but I doubt many people here would side with Lex Luthor over Superman unless the characterization is completely changed, but people here seem to love it.

/Metropolitan Man/ does feel quietly critical of many Rationalist beliefs and tropes, although it's very much internal, self-reflective criticism.

  I just want to be able to discuss some of the ideas presented in linked articles without hostility being thrown my way. Tbh, even the people who said I wouldn't like it here have been pretty polite and respectful so I'll probably be just fine.

Hmm. Maybe.

The overwhelming majority should be fine, but I do remember some people jumping down the throats of religious commenters during discussion of a fic with religious themes (/Ginny Weasley an the Sealed Intelligence/).
