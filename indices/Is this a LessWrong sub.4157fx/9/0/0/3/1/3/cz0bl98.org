I'm hoping that someone can see the argument I'm trying to make for why all existing things are within the sphere of rational definition by the physical sciences and can spell out the point for someone unfamiliar with the jargon:

AIXI (which keeps track of probabilities for all the infinitely many possible scientific theories, and does whatever action has the highest expected value for its utility function) runs purely on science and does well at fulfilling its utility function; therefore we may as well act like we think AIXI would to satisfy our own values.
