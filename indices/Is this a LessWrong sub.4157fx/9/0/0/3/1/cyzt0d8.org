The funny thing is, I don't believe in any gods either, and I believe my stance on immortality is harder to justify than yours. There's a lot of baggage that comes with many atheists regarding scientism that I don't want to be attacked over not sharing like I would be in [[/r/atheism]].

You guys have been really respectful of my beliefs, so I think I might stick around.
