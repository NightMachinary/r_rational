Well that depends. Did they do experiments in a lab whose outcomes they didn't know ahead of time? Did they account for errors and adjust their experimental apparatus to eliminate known errors? Have they been genuinely surprised?

Having your experiments go wrong on you a few times straight, resulting in shitty data from which no substantial inferences can be drawn at all, will teach you more about the nature of knowledge, and quickly, than most epistemology lectures manage to leave behind in your head after six months away.
