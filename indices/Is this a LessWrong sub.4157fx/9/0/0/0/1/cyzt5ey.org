I do appreciate moral complexity in stories, regardless of the protagonist's beliefs. To often we see fiction with no examination of why someone thinks they're right and their enemies are wrong. I'm glad /The Metropolitan/ has that more than the usual Superman tale. And you were right about me making assumptions on a work I never read.
