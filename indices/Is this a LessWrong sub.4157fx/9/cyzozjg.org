  will I like the discussion in this sub if I'm not a proponent of immortality, effective altruism, or other new atheist and transhumanist platforms?

Probably not. Most of the stories being shared here, and much of the conversation about them, take the goodness of transhumanism, immortality and effective altruism for granted.
