Coming up with good priors is hard. Even good priors don't really encode information /unless they are from empirical data/, they're regularization methods. Posterior distributions can rarely be actually evaluated numerically, usually just sampled-from.

In short, it's a shining example of taking a normative theory and representing it as applicable to the real world while failing to mention that applying it to the real world is really, really, /really/ hard.
