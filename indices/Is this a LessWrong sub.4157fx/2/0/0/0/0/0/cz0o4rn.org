Thanks for typing all that out.

I think we mostly agree here. Though I imagine most people who are inherently selfish don't care that they're being inconsistent. Their goal isn't "to be selfish" but rather to do whatever they want to do so long as the consequences aren't too harsh.

Nothing in your response is really saying that such a person shouldn't do illegal things to further their goals (in the hypothetical situation where they're fairly sure they'll never get caught). It's just saying that being selfish is a weak justification. But I don't think selfish people really resort to that sort of justification unless they've already been caught. Internally their actions need no justifications because they're what that person wants to do.

Edit: I would also argue that it's impossible not to act out of self-interest. The people who didn't take more free candy did so because they wanted there to be candy for other people, or because they don't want to be perceived as greedy. That in itself is self interest, just of a different sort.
