I kind of mean a bit of both, but it's hard to explain. Basically, there are a lot of things that average, mentally healthy humans value, that aren't entirely selfish. In "Predictably Irrational" the author relates an experiment on human behaviour, in which the students on the MIT campus were offered chocolates for 1Â¢ each, or for free. The students that were offered the free candy took on average 4-5 less candies than the students that were offered the candy for one cent. Even though, predictably, more students capitalized on the free candy (as expected of selfish humans) they showed concerns for scarcity, concerns for the commons, and refrained from taking more than one. (IIRC, the average for the free candies was between 1.5 or 2.5)

Basically, people acting out of self-interest don't /always/ act out of self-interest, so if you use "I act out of self-interest" as an excuse to do something ethically questionable, you aren't being consistent. To clarify, I mean ethically questionable as in something that indisputably has a negative effect on people (like stealing or murder).

The same goes for stealing or murder for a good cause. Another experiment in "Predictably Irrational" showed that when given the opportunity to cheat on a test (without accountability) students cheated by a consistent, if small, amount. When put in a morally compromising position, we often take a little off the top for our own benefit, so long as it has no visible negative effect on the populace. We steal pens at work. The IRS "loses" a ridiculously higher amount of money than all of the burglars combined.

So what do you think will happen when someone steals from the rich and gives to the poor? Who do you think will care, when they skim a little off the top? When you murder somebody for the benefit of society, how to you measure utility? How do you know you are consistent? Where do you stop?

I'm not referring to no-win scenarios, like choosing between a thousand people dying or a million people getting the flu, but I am referring to individual actions.

TL;DR: We consistently underestimate our generosity and consistently overestimate our honesty, and those two things are a deadly combination. When think to yourself "Things would be better if I were in charge" you're making the error of /assuming/ you'll resist temptation, when historically the most infallible people still fall apart. When you /are/ in charge, and you think to yourself "I can take a little bit of the money, I'm a selfish human, after all." you're making a weak justification for breaking what is an entirely sensible ethical code. (an ethical code that most prototypical humans have gained, either innately or through social osmosis)

This goes doubly for anyone who's never read a blog or self-help book on personal bias, because they're unlikely to know they're making an error in the first place.
