Could you break it down for me what point you're specifically trying to make? I can't follow what you're trying to get across with your comment.

Not that your comment is incomprehensible or anything, just that I think I have not read up on all the topics you're referencing and would prefer not to read through everything in those links to understand. I did briefly glance at them (and have read a good chunk of LessWrong in the past). I'll try to summarize what I think your point might be and you can tell me whether I missed the mark or not.

1) You're saying that there's no value in declaring yourself to be "selfish" or "Evil" because broadcasting that fact hinders your goals of being selfish.

2) You're saying that behaving in ways that are typically considered selfish are objectively more likely to cause harm to the individual than if they were not to behave this way. Thus by doing things that are traditionally considered immoral, you are actually hurting your goals of self-betterment

If number 1 is what you're saying, then I completely agree. It's stupid to advertise that your beliefs are contrary to those of society, especially if you're not doing so with the intention of changing society's beliefs to be more in line with yours. It's basically attracting negative attention for no benefit.

If you're saying number 2, then I would say that I mostly agree with the sentiment in practice. But there are many specific situations both hypothetically and in real life where people have committed actions that are traditionally considered unethical where the benefits outweigh the negatives for them personally.

If both of my guesses are wrong... could you explain in more detail what you meant?
