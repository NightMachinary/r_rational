I think now would be a good time to mention [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Ethical_injunction][ethical injunction]]. Sure, you can have whatever end goal you want, but if you fall into the trappings of human bias while doing it then you're /not/ an effective rationalist. It's not smart to make the claim that you are effectively selfish or effectively evil because unless you're really careful about messing up, you're not actually effectively anything.

The same goes for positive things, i.e. "I only worship god because believing in him makes me feel happy". See [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/][Belief in Belief]].
