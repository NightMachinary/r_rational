I think there is room to disagree when it becomes clear that a person's values and end goals are different than yours.

I don't mean when debating concrete facts. I mean when talking about what course of actions should be taken and describing things as "Moral" or "Ethical".

Basically a person can be perfectly rational and believe that it's okay for them to steal from other people as long as they don't get caught becuase their value system only involves improving their own lives and they care little for other human beings.

As long as they're reasonably certain they'll never be caught or held responsible and they're stealing in such a manner that doesn't significantly hurt humanity as whole, you can't rationally say that their reasoning for stealing is wrong based on their intended goals.

You can only say that you disagree with their end goal.
