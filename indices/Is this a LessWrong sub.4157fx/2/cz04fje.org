I had a post here, but I've edited it for the sake of clarity:

A lot of people that read HPMOR also read and absorbed the sequences at LessWrong, as well as a disproportionate number of authors. They not only have evidence for what they believe, but are used to justifying it to people who are disenfranchised. So, no, it's not a LessWrong subreddit, but don't expect to say "I disagree with immortality" on this subreddit and not get dog-piled. It might be a vocal minority, or a vocal majority, but they are vocal and they have incentive to argue.

This isn't a statement of belief, it's just generally how rationalists act; there's no room to "agree to disagree" in the philosophy.
