Would you feel comfortable if /one/ man had unilateral control over the worlds nuclear arsenal, no matter how sane and reasonable he is?

There is definitely room to be sympathetic to Lex Luthor. I suspect a lot of people here have less tribalism then average. You don't need to side with Lex Luthor to appreciate his competence, and you don't have to be against superman to realize that he's a potential world-ending catastrophe.

We don't tend to side with people. There's plenty of criticism for both Lex Luthor and superman in the discussions around it.
