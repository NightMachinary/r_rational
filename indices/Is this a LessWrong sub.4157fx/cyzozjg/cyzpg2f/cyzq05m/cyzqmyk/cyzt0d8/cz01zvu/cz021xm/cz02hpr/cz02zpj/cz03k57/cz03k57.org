Engineers learn about the nature of the physical universe. In your example, aeronautic engineers will learn about everything from mechanical principles and chemistry to specialized branches of advanced physics.

Information is the universe, and the universe is information. You cannot, in a physical deterministic reality like our own, separate the two. Through the study of information, you gain knowledge.

Yes, MOST engineers don't pursue the study of the study of their fields, they simply study their fields. In such a manner, most people in general do not study the field of investigation and reason, because it is not their primary focus in their existence.

Nevertheless, these people are all dependent on information state analysis for their day-to-day existence, and without the ability to process this information and derive knowledge from it, these people cease to be people, and become lifeless meat. We call this process termination death.

There is no credible evidence for any sort of non-physical intelligence processor running under, over, or in parallel with the purely physical information processor we call our brain. And believe me, people have been looking for one for a long time.
