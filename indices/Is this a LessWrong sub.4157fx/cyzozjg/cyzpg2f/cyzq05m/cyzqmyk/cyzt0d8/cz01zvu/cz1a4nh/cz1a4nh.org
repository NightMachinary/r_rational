  Seriously, scientism isn't a thing.
#+end_quote

Let me put this in Bayesian terms. There is a /vast/ difference between stating what the posterior distribution /is/, stating a predictive distribution that marginalizes out the latent variables (ie: the parameters or causal structure being inferred), and just standing there yelling that everyone needs to shut up and accept that maximum a posteriori estimator as The Truth Because Science/Bayes.

That last thing is what sometimes gets called "scientism", and as you can see from the statements above, it's a genuine error.

But unfortunately, the actual word "scientism" is usually just used for "the natural sciences need to stop encroaching on my field's reserved turf."
