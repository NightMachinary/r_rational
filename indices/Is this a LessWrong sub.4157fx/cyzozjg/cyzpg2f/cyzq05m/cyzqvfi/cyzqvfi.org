Worm isn't widely accepted as a rational story I don't think, at least I've seen a lot of discussion over whether or not it even fits.

  I haven't read the Metropolitan, but I doubt many people here would side with Lex Luthor over Superman unless the characterization is completely changed, but people here seem to love it.

wat, if you haven't read it of course you have no idea why people might side with Lex Luthor in the story... That's like saying you haven't read history but have no idea why people could not like Hitler since he was such a charismatic guy.

  will I like the discussion in this sub if I'm not a proponent of immortality, effective altruism, or other new atheist and transhumanist platforms?

Depends what threads you read, most of the discussion is on the stories posted, and not all of them are immediately about those three things.
