Probabilistic thinking probably doesn't seem like something profound because you're already practicing it, but a lot of people coming from the atheist/skeptic movements got stuck in boolean logic.

It's also very useful for working in groups. Like a mini prediction market.

The trick with lesswrong is that it seems profound at the time, then a few years later you look back and wonder what all the fuss was about. It codified a lot of thoughts that 17 year old traverseda didn't have the words to explain. I would have gotten there eventually, but it certainly sped things up a bit.
