India isn't really a Hindu nation / America isn't a Christian nation but most of it's citizens are - as in, there's a deeply embedded social norms against attacking non-conformers despite a majority consensus concerning belief. (But certainly no barrier to aggressively criticizing non-conforming ideas without targeting the human behind them)

I'd say it's roughly the same relationship of [[/r/rational]]'s relationship to transhumanist/atheist/effective altruist/ lesswrongish ideologies.
