A few comments for you:

1. This sub is for discussion of fiction. This post is off-topic, despite the fact that one of our mods was polite enough to respond.
2. The answer to your question was in the sidebar -- the sub is about discussing fiction, not the philosophy of any particular group.
3. In programming circles, the response to a question like this would usually be "TIAS", meaning "Try It And See." In other words, instead of posting this question, you would be far better served to just read some of the stories and see if you like them.
4. Your question eseentially boils down to "no matter how good a story is, I do not want to read it if it will expose me to certain ideas." Given that fact, the fact that you did not read the sidebar, and your unwillingness to TIAS, I've got a fairly high prior that no, you will not enjoy this sub. I hope you will try it anyway and then tell me that I'm wrong and you actually do enjoy the fiction and community here, but that's not what I would expect to happen.
