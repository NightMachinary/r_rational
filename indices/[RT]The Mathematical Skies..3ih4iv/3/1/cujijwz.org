The direct latin translation would be something like "unknown land". The phrase was used on maps in Ye Olden Times, to refer to the western continents beyond the oceans; because of the mystique North America held to the people of Europe in those days, the phrase itself became heavily romanticized. So the usage in the story isn't calling from a direct Latin translation; it's tapping into that romanticized connotation.
