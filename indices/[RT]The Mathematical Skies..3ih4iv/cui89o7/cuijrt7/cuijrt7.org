I actually used "Caelum Incognito" in another project :) Yes, Terra means Earth (we say "Terre" for "Earth", in french)

But in this context, I would have said it means "Land". The expression "Terra Incognita" is mostly used for "unexplored territory".

I already met the expression refering symbolically to knowledge, fields of research, and even refering to "a new love story" :)
