A funny thing is, one of the running themes in Twig is the sort of background fear that everyone has about how biotechnology is starting to grow beyond any single person and becoming its own thing, with primordial life that can self-tile the entire world if not contained, and regular humans quickly becoming obsolete.

I've never seen a work hit those notes quite like Twig does.
