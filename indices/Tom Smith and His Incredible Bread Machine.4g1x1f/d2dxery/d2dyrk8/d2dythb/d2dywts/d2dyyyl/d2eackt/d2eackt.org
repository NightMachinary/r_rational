  I could post manna as a counterpoint to the libertardian message, if you'd like.

Also agreeing with [[/u/PeridexisErrant]] that "Manna" is horrifically irrational. I mean, seriously, it has a "happy ending" where a guy's got a brain-to-nationwide-AI interface /implanted in his central nervous system/ and no thoughts are given to what makes that social system work well rather than badly. Insofar as it qualifies as inadvertently-socialist fiction written by someone completely benighted by the neoliberal view of history as a March of Progress towards American Capitalism, it fails to consider what comes /after/ the revolution it proposes (ie: what comes /after/ you share the robots and AI among citizens).

So it ends up with a very bog-standard critique of automated capitalism, followed by proposing that a totalitarian regime (literally capable of shutting off the citizens' bodies remotely) with little worldbuilding effort will bring about an egalitarian high-tech eutopia.

And the characterization /sucked/ so fucking much it was /embarrassing/ to the entire genre of social science fiction.
