  [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is a pretty avowed socialist last I checked ;p

Yep, which is why I'm automatically disinclined to like anything from mises.org. However, I do share [[/u/PeridexisErrant]]'s actual objections here: rather than the work having a specific statement to make about economics, even an Austrian one, it simply portrays a straw benevolent rich industrialist being mindlessly attacked by a straw ignorant public and a straw evil government who of course give him zero legal options for how to run his business and the whole problem is caused by a straw tax that's literally just called the "business tax". And then, just to top off the massive heap of straw, after the straw government straw-nationalizes the straw-bread-bakery, they somehow sell bread for half a cent plus $0.995/loaf in taxes, a nice straw tax rate never seen anywhere in the planet or real history to my knowledge.

  Because if you're letting a bunch of other crappy posts through, and dropping this one, my estimate that there's some political bias at play goes up a bit.

If I was exercising all my political biases, personally, a whole lot more would probably be removed :-p. Or maybe not.

But, as a general rule, low-quality content that acts as pretty mindless entertainment is less likely to be kept up than low-quality content that is low-quality because it's propagandizing a point of view in really transparently obvious ways /while pretending not to/.

If you want to post propaganda and have it kept up, there's also a simple rule-of-thumb: just let it be completely obvious about being propaganda.
