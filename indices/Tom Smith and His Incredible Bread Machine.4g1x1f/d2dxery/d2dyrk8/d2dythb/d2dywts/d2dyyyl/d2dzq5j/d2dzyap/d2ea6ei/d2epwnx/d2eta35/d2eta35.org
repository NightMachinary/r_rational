  You're not claiming that the post is subtle, are you?

I am claiming that it's overly subtle. Instead of just saying, "Boo government, we at the Von Mises Institute hate the government, it does so many bad things!", which would then encourage questioning of which bad things and a desire for examples, it instead sets up a fictional world in which the desired ideological point can be shown-not-told, irrespective of real-world truth.

It's subtle in the same way that fairy tales are subtle.

Or perhaps "sanctimonious" is the better word. Yes, very probably.
