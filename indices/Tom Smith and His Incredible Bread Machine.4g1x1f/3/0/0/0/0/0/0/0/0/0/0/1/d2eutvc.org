I guess I would say: if someone wants to be anvilicious in talking about real life, fine, but if they want to be anvilicious by constructing a fictional world in which their point is /obvious truth/ and then just letting the reader's irrationality transport their point back into the real-world, then I'd call that a nasty piece of Dark Arts -- proof by fictional evidence.
