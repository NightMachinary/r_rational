I notice that you've started with a chatty first-person narrator, and then you swing right away to a third-person scene with only an odd italics line to separate them. This feels like an odd choice.

You also call Sirius and Lily "bodies" despite them being alive, which threw me off for a bit. I also saw "never the less," which should be "nevertheless."

I agree that it doesn't flow perfectly, but assuming this is a first draft, that's not the biggest problem. If you have a chatty first-person narrator, the flavor of their chattiness needs to carry the scene; it's a style that really depends on your ability to deliver distinctive and memorable prose. I bet the flow will go better when it's a bit more conversational.

Just off the top of my head stuff. If /you/ find the story compelling, it's worth pursuing, if only because it's always better to be writing than not writing and the best way to get better at writing is to keep doing it. Good luck!
