Worth pursuing. Has a ... 30? ... percent chance of being good, given its current state as a draft/concept; my base rate prediction was 10%.

Definitely issues with grammar, style, and flow, but contra to other commentary I wouldn't actually recommend "working" on those, so much as just writing perhaps 10x as much as you've written so far, and then throwing it all out and starting from scratch once you've sort of settled into a groove. i.e. write the first five to ten chapters, then trash them and rewrite those /same/ chapters, but without /actually looking/ at your first draft.
