Looking back on it, I think I sound a bit too harsh in that post. From my POV the problems are there, of course, but there is a large subjective element to it. And some of them, like the soulmates and Harry having a brother, are really not even problems by themselves. It's just that they usually come up in bad fanfiction, so they taint this draft purely by association.

I hope you don't get discouraged by my comments.
