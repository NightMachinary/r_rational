A wizard of Dumbledore's caliber walks into a room after a disaster of some kind without observing anything of the immediate environment? He doesn't even know where James's lying just over the fireplace?

Why does Dumbledore need to put some extra tidbits to the security question? Among themselves - capable people - they should have always maintain the precautions - especially during distress, why the need of refering to Mad eye?

Dumbledore came here for some serious business, yet stood chatting, commenting on his students performance, while there's a body in the room. What's the list [first, second, third] for? Get to the point!

I still don't understand the point of Remus just standing there after knowing his two very powerful friends being dominated out the window. When hostile knock your door, and clearly you're incapable of stopping them, flee. Don't just stand there and ask question! You're the last stand of the two infants, for Merlin's sake!
