  can I pm you a copy to critique again?

I don't see why not. Be aware that I have an unusual work schedule, so it may be a few days before I can get back to you, especially toward the end of the week; but I'll be happy to give you a re-read when you're ready to continue. :)

When your post showed up on my feed, I read the title and clicked through to say something that got lost when I read your chapter and decided to discuss the work itself instead. I'd still like to share my original thought:

  Remember that writing is a thing you do for you. You asked if we think this story is "worth pursuing", but what /we/ think is only relevant in the most tangential possible way. If /you/ think a work is worth pursuing, it /is/ worth it. If you have a story to tell (and it sounds like you do), you should definitely tell it!
