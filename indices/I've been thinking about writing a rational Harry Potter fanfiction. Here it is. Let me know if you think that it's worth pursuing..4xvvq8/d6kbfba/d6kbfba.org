I'm going to list some things that have jumped out at me.

#+begin_quote
  As soon as he saw Severus's smug face hiding behind Dumbledore
#+end_quote

I'm not sure canon Snape would be enough of a short-sighted arsehole to be openly smug in that situation. Not a fan of this character interpretation.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore's eyes were wide and his jaw was open agape, dumbfounded beyond belief.
#+end_quote

Again, I like to interpret Dumbledore as a bit more of a self-controlled person. Gaping at things doesn't fit that. Not to say that you can't change his character to fit your fancy, just that it doesn't match my preferred image of him.

#+begin_quote
  The first one was my soulmate, the one true love I have ever known in this old mans long and lonely life.”. For a moment Dumbledore seemed broken, but he managed to pull himself together and to continue ... "He was the only one that ever freed me from the solitude of my own mind"
#+end_quote

Now is not the time for that. Seriously, would you start reminiscing about your past lovers in such a situation? Also /soulmates/ are a staple of bad fanfiction. I've never seen them done in a satisfactory fashion and their presence alone constitutes enough evidence for how bad the fic will be that I usually drop them on the spot.

#+begin_quote
  “I must say that our young Lilly gave me quite the run for my money. Sirius, a trained auror, I was expecting, but Lilly? Even my James cannot perform magic at such a level”.
#+end_quote

And he must have somehow missed that while teaching them and then leading the order of phoenix. Maybe in this AU Dumbledore is not supposed to have been closely working with them to combat Voldemort, though. Even then, it still seems like something he should have known beforehand. Exceptional talent doesn't unexpectedly arrive overnight in grown people, as a rule.

#+begin_quote
  Remus pointed over to the fireplace, to James, to Dumbledore's most prized student, the heir to all of Dumbledore's magical discoveries.
#+end_quote

Yes. Because Lilly suddenly becoming a Dumbledore-tier magic user was not enough. Surely the whole universe simply must revolve around this family. I wouldn't be surprised if both of them also were secretly heirs of Hogwarts founders and also Merlin and also trained by an anthropomorphic personification of Hogwarts itself or some such tripe.

#+begin_quote
  He cried in his uncle Remus's arm while his brother, the one with deadly hallows scar on his forehead was rocked back and forth in the arms of his godfather. Sirius sang to Nate but his eyes were on Lilly.
#+end_quote

I can't critique the change itself, since consequences are yet to be seen, but I have acquired a certain degree of dislike for it, since it rarely precedes a good story in my experience.

--------------

If this wasn't posted here on [[/r/rational]], I wouldn't have even read this draft to the end. I'd say it needs work, but the problems are not limited to the technical aspects, the changes made to the universe are problematic as well, at least from my point of view.
