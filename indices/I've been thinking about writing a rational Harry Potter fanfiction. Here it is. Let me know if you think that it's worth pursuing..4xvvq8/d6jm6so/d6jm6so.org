It's a good start. Though the prose needs another pass and the style needs tempering, the story has a good deal of potential. I would like to compliment your use of speech indicators: I actually didn't notice them at all on my first read-through. Normally I get distracted by dialogue because many otherwise excellent writers fall flat when they try to use speech indicators. You have begun to bend yours to the will of the story. Well done.

Taking this to be a prologue, I'd read at least the first chapter or two just to see where you meant to go with it.

Your replies to the feedback you have received so far have been polite and gracious. Being able to accept criticism (and act on it) without expressing resentment is a rare talent. Well done.
