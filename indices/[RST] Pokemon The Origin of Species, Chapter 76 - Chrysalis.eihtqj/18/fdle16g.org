A bit late to the party, but I loved this chapter. It was so good! Probably had my favorite character interactions among our protagonists yet. They're all really growing into compelling characters in their own way. And you did justice to all of their perspectives, reasons and motivations. And that twist at the end was sooo great, can't believe I didn't see it coming!
