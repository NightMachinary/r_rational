The N reveal was fucking cool. And hey now we'll have two characters that are awkwardly named letters!

Speaking of which the little interaction between Leaf and MG made me chuckle.

Other than that like others said it mainly felt like a clean up chapter. Tying up some loose plotlines, connecting some others together while reminding people of earlier chapters.

Not too mention setting new goals for people, Red already has his but giving a more defined role to Blue and a new arc for Leaf. Its looking good!

Happy new years Daystar and may I say the worst part of my day besides the hangover haha is the fact that we won't be getting another chapter til next month :(
