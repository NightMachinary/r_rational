With all this talk of pokeball conditioning and even the potential to use pokeball technology to overwrite the brain of pokemon I have to wonder. Is the real reason why no one has solved the human storage issue (edit: specifically the issue that humans get brain damage when stored in pokeballs) because people in power don't want the technology to exist. The sort of abuse humaballs could lead to is quite astounding after all. You could for instance kidnap people and condition them to be unquestionably loyal cultists. And with Bill's hypothetical copy pasting of brain states you could achieve a sort of memetic immortality, and all you have to do is use a TM to murder the person with a mind overwrite.
