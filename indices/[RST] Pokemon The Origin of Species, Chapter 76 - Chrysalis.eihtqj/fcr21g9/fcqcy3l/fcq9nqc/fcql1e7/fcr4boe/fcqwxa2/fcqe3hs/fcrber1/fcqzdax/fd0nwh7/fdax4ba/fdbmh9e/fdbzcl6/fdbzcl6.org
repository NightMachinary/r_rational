The intelligence declined is what I meant by the human storage issue, though I should have been more clear about it.

Right now the human catching balls would be seen by wider society as really elaborate way to kill someone. (Meanwhile people like Bill see them as an extreme measure to avoid death and hope someone can revive them later) If human catching balls could be made fully functional the danger they would represent would be so much greater, think invasion of the body snatchers. So my comment was to wonder if the previous attempts to solve the human cognitive decline problem were failed intentionally.
