Exactly, it's hard to understand why this is a huge challenge considering how they're already altering brainstates of beings converted into energy. It seems it's just a question of adding, removing and modifying some modules. The bigger issue seems to be what consequences Bill's proposal, if made possible, would have. Copying and modifying brainstates like a piece of code makes it so that you can basically make everything that can be subdued enough to go into a poke ball do your bidding. The parallels with computer programming make me think of the damage viruses and hackers or even untested code could do.
