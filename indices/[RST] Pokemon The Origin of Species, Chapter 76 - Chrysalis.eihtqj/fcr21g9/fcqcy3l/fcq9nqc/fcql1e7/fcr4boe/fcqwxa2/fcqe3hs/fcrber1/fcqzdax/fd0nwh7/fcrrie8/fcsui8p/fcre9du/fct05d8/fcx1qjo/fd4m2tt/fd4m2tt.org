Unrelated, how do you handle the "the pokémon world can't make sense, just domesticating a growlite would skip the fire mastery technological step and kickstart metalurgy". I know in your world pre-pokeball only a few people could handle them, but they still got to the point of having armies. So pokémon influencing technology is a given, but how you handle that influence? Don't you think those are too many factors to actually predict where humanity should be in that regard at present time?
