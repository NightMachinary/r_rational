It took me a bit to realize it was N, but when it hit I got all giddy and super excited to see him introduced. But also sad that he will only be shown through text. Still cant wait to see how his appearance ropes team plasma into leaf's storyline. Interesting that with all the talk throughout the chapter of escalating national threat levels by catching legendaries is contrasted by ending the chapter with the introduction of the person who wants to de-escalate threats by releasing captured pokemon. (P.S. is N gonna be a psychic in this series to explain how he can talk to pokemon? Thatd be an obvious explanation but I cant remember if he's ever shown interacting with dark types.)
