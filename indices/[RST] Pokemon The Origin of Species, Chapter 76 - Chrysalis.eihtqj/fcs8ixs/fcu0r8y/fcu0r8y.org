I'm more confused on why partially conditioning is apparently so difficult. "Conditioning" probably isn't one big code, but a bunch of smaller methods (one to make them not attack humans, one to make them listen to commands, etc). Shouldn't it be pretty easy to just...copy that code, but remove some of the methods and maybe add some of your own?
