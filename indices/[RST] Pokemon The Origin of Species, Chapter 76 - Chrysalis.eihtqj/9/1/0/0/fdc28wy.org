Ah I get it now. That's plausible.

My own experience with the real world is that a lot of things would be pretty easy to implement but haven't been because it takes a lot of work to get the business side of it going well. Like, you could make a cryogenic preservation concept into a pokeball form, but to make it useful to anyone you also need to figure out how to store the balls, which can get expensive, and you have to get the knowledge across to people who would give you money for making the thing, keep on top of legal and social demands, and so on, and if any of that fails the work of development becomes a waste of time because even if someone else takes up the work later they'll have to retread the ground you covered because documentation has a way of evaporating.
