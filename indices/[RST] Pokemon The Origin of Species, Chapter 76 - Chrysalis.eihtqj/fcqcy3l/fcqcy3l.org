"Every region needs its own legendary under a trainer's control. That way no region would want to mess with them. They could just send their trainer over and wreak nearly as much havoc in revenge."

Quite some parallels to nuclear weapons here, but there are some key differences. One is that the number of legendaries are limited - once they're all caught, there won't be anymore. The other is how people assume that, at least at first, a single trainer will be controlling a caught legendary. That's a lot of responsibility to put on a single person, especially since they might even be a teenager at the time. Scary stuff.

It felt as if I should have a strong response to the name Natural, but I just haven't played enough of the games to know who that is. He seems to have a bulbapedia page, maybe I'll read that. Or maybe just play Black/White? Is there a way to do that without a console?
