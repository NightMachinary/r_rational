Red's been tiptoeing around the interlude stuff while with Sabrina, and Blue seems to be totally clueless about the side plots. So I dont think it's the first time, but definitely the most explicit. Maybe we'll get more involvement by the time Blue's story hits Fuchsia City. Pokemon biology seems to be reptilian if anything, with the egg-laying and all.
