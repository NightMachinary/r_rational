Natural (simply "N" in the games) is a central character to the story from Black/White, and his introduction absolutely made me reel. We've seen so many earthshaking* sideplots getting hinted and twisted together (we've already got Mewtwo, the Hoenn disasters, and now Unova's too?) -- I'm honestly kinda afraid that they'll overshadow our protagonists! Intellectually though, I'm also really curious how N will be adapted to this version of the Pok√©mon world.

* I mean, /every/ region's story in the games after gold/silver has dramatically earthshaking consequences, and so far Daystar has made each and every detail even scarier!
