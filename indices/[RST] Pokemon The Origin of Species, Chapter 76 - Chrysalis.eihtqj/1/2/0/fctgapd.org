That was also my exact reaction, with the additional caveat that there are still wars all the time in the Naruto-verse even when the jinchuriki aren't abused enough to abandon their village entirely. It doesn't quite work out like that when you hand WMD's to every country, there are still bad actors who can now cause a lot more damage.
