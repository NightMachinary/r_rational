The pokemon world can still exist if, to use the metallurgy example, the refining process necessary is also different. Maybe something in the ore in pokeworld makes the process take a more precise combination of heat and electricity than pokemon would naturally provide so that the refining process is limited by trainability, or maybe there's another reason.
