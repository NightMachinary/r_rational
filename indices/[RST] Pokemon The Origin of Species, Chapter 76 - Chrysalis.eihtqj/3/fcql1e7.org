Ooh, seeing (I presume) N appear is a neat surprise. I had somewhat resigned myself to this being mostly focused on Kanto (the worldbuilding for the other regions really interests me), but this, alongside the mentions of Archie and Maxie earlier in the story make me excited for some wider scale plots of both the antagonistic and protagonistic varieties.
