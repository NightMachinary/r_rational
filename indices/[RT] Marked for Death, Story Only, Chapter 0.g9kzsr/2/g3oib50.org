Finally getting around to this. Thanks for your work!

Is there a way to read this from the beginning NOT in Story Only and have it make sense?

I enjoy following along with the discussion, voting, rolls, and whatnot but it seems like almost all the context has been removed. I'm not seeing vote tallies or voting instructions and the ruleset laid out in the initial post seems to be different from what was used back then. I've read ten or twelve pages (non consecutive) of the first 35 pages and I'm rather confused.

Edit: looks like I should have read further. Starting to see everything after a couple of chapters
