You are in a Lovecraftian universe and in a human society from the early 1900s. The Necronomicon has drifted into your possession and you desire to learn everything from it without going insane.

The Necronomicon has the special property that the very act of reading it causes malevolent entities to become aware of you and attempt to kill you or drive you insane via supernatural means. The entities will them attempt to erase every trace of the individual's existence from memory, although they are sloppy and will unintentionally let some details remain. Afterwards the entities will quickly ignore the existence of the Necronomicon until another individual reads from it. If no one reads it and simply holds on it, then the book can remain in one's possession for as long as desired.

You have no protection against the supernatural (that's why you want to learn from the Necronomicon), but you believe that the Necronomicon's lethal trait is tied to the book itself and not to the knowledge or words in the book. But you are not certain of this yet and would like to have a way to test this part. How can you make copies of it during the early 1900s?

- Entities will kill any readers within a few days to minutes depending on how hard it is to arrange a seemingly natural death.

- Entities will slowly wipe the memory of the person in question from everyone's mind and any physical evidence of the individual's existence will disappear over time. But anything which is not obviously 'connected' to the person in question will go unnoticed. This is how fragments of writings of the Necronomicon has managed to pass on along with hints of what happened to the previous owners. 'Ownership' will be left vague since you don't know yet how the entities define such things, only that they miss things which would seem obvious to a human.

- After the reader's death/disappearance, if arrangements to move the Necronomicon has not been made or it hasn't been sent away yet, then it will be considered as if it was a book discarded by some stranger and probably sold to someone in a yard sale or given to a library/bookstore.

- Note that casual attempts to read it will be prevented, since people will receive an ominous feeling of unease from the book and stop themselves from reading it. They'll make up some reason to not read it. It requires an determined individual to force themself to read it. However, if one becomes aware of what the book is, it then gives off an feeling of curiosity calling to be read. The feelings are not very strong and can be resisted, but if you are not careful, you can find yourself reading it before you catch yourself.

- Reading the cover and back of the book does not count which is why people have easily managed to pass on the title and appearance of the book without issue.
