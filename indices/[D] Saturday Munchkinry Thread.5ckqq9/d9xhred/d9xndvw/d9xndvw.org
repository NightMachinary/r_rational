I'd use a piece of frosted glass to trace where words occur on each page, and copy those patterns to pieces of cardstock. I would make many copies of the word-pattern for each page. Then, I'd use some reliable way of generating random numbers to punch some small number (say, 10) spaces out of each page, so that I could read ten separated words from each page, somewhat like a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_(cryptography)][Grille cipher]]. I'd shuffle my deck of grilles and proceed in random order, transcribing the words into another notebook.

Hopefully reading random pages, 10 random words at a time, doesn't count as 'reading' for the purposes of the malevolent entites. To check this I would have someone else read through some grille, and then observe them for a period of time afterward. Due to the information decay effect, I'd have to set up some sort of dead-man's switch, like making a chalk mark every day the person was still alive.
