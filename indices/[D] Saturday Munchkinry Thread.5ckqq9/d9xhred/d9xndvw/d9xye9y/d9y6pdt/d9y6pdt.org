I imagine that my trial, getting another person to do it at the individual word level, gave me the information contained in your reply, i.e. my assistant mysteriously dies after reading several words through the grille. I wake up one day and realize that the number of chalk marks I would expect to see is fewer than what are actually there, so I recognize that my experiment was a failure.

So, I painstakingly repeat the process, but at the individual glyph level instead of the word level. I have my assistant's assistant read several individual letters which are randomly spaced across a page. What happens to her?
