Okay that would work to make copies of the Necronomicon and your stoge wouldn't die from looking at the pictures. However for the photographer, since he can see the words of the Necronomicon through the camera that qualifies as 'reading' and will result in death. If the pictures aren't sent away quickly enough, then they would disappear into nothingness along with nearly everything the photographer owned..
