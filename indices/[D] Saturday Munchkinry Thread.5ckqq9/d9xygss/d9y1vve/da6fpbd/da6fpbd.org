You know you can use guns in close combat, right? Twisting your hands/the gun in different directions needs very little time. Just imagine fighting somebody in close combat who has practice estimating the angles their hands need to twist to shoot down your incoming fists. The only restriction would be the time for twisting your wrists and the gun the load the next bullet.
