The [[http://superhotgame.com/][Superhot]] power is basically that, but also limited by the fact that cognition speed decreases as you move.

It sort of depends on whether you expend "mental energy" when you're in that state. For example, I can write code for maybe 4-6 hours at the most before my brain starts to get sluggish and I fall out of the (non-parahuman) flow state. If I could activate this superflow state, would I be able to continue computer programming at a rate determined by processing power, screen refresh rates, and physically being able to move my fingers fast enough over the keyboard? Or would I use up my brain chemicals and basically be burnt for the day?

If I can do productive information work while in that state mostly without limit, then I become a super computer programmer. In the Wormverse, I become a Thinker who mostly serves as an analyst, not capable of making the /best/ analysis, but capable of making the /fastest/ analysis, which is good in crisis situations. Alternately, I can serve as dispatch or information, given that I can look up answers as fast as my browser can load a page from Google (and obviously I pay for ridiculously fast internet). Plus, that allows me to stay out of the way of all the things that want to kill me.

If I /can't/ do that kind of thinking for much longer than a normal person before getting mentally fried, maybe I still do those things but as secondary function, because I'll mostly be in the field. I'd make a good scout, because I can fully analyze any scene after seeing it for only a fraction of a second ... but other parahumans completely outclass me.

For weapons, it's sort of an awkward thing, because the power is amazing at close range but only /good/ with guns. Being able to hit precisely with a knife is much more feasible given combat speeds relative to muscle action. But with guns, the question is much more about how good your aim is and how well you account for variables. I've gone to the gun range and failed to hit targets with all the time in the world, and with sandbags to not require steady hands. Yes, it's harder to hit a moving target, so there's some benefit there, but I think you'd be sitting there in frozen time trying to track how fast your target was moving, how fast the bullets move, space between them ... and it would all be very hard, giving not all that much benefit. Whereas with knives, you can much better take advantage of openings and weaknesses. Except that knives have a lot less practical applicability than guns, as a general rule.
