Maybe a bit late, but a superpower that, when consciously activated, allows your cognition and awareness to accelerate to superhuman levels - if you went into a professional boxing match, then activated this ability as you closed with your opponent, their thrown punch would seem to travel in slow motion, allowing you to react perfectly rather than be surprised by it (and get knocked out).

Your body, however, moves at regular human-possible speeds, despite your super-cognition speeds. Something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology][the flow state]] but /super/flow.

How would you leverage this to be a successful and effective superhero in our world, or perhaps also in the Wormverse?
