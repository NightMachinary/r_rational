What do you mean by less efficient. Again the system appears to no longer be time limited. It's just power limited. Sure you have to put the power on the chip, but still it makes a huge difference. Assuming the time freeze itself doesn't take power, we could probably get a factor of a couple thousand improvement at least by just the time freeze.
