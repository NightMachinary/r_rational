You have exclusive access to a new computing technology. In every way except for its unique properties, it's only about as good as traditional computers circa 1980, but you expect that with further research it could follow a progression similar to Moore's Law.

The thing that makes this computing technology unique is that you may select a physical region of the computer's electronics and freeze time for it, so that it will make a series of calculations instantaneously that would otherwise have taken any finite amount of time. The computing will still likely require power, but you can account for this by including certain types of battery in the instant-calculation zone. Trying to include generic matter, like living things, in the instant-calculation zone will flash-freeze it, most likely destroying it.

What neat tricks can you accomplish with this technology?
