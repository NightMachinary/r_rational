Ah, I forgot to write about the chalk marks and you do end up with more chalk marks than you'd expect like you just correctly guessed.

If you try the process again for individual glyphs, it works. However, I'm going to assume that you had the same assistant do a second session. When the assistant 'reads' a few glyphs from each sessions that can be combined to make a word, the entities kill the assistant.

You do have the words and glyphs from the first assistant. Since there are ~200 words per page and you had the assistant read 10 words per page, that's 5% of the Nerconomicon decoded. I rolled some dice and you got to keep it without it fading away.

I rolled dice again and your second assistant lasted 2 sessions, but you only get the notes from the first session. Using the frosted glass idea to know the positioning of the words, the assistant can retrieve a glyph from nearly every word in the best case scenario. You have 30% more of the Necronomicon, but that's all in individual glyphs and therefore difficult to understand.

What will you do next?

PS You can figure a way out to preserve the notes without relying on luck, but you need a way to fool the entities constantly to keep them from noticing and erasing the notes 'owned' by the assistant. You never need to worry about a setback though. If the entities don't catch it (aka you get lucky on a dice roll), then they won't erase notes from earlier sessions.
