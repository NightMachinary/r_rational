"Trying to include generic matter, like living things, in the instant-calculation zone will flash-freeze it, most likely destroying it."

I'm not sure if this was intended, but it sounds to me like the time stop is actually dropping the temperature of the region. This might be destroying the waste heat, although it might be conserved and dumped in a shell surrounding the frozen region.

Either way, this ability could be used as either a weapon or a power source, as it violates thermodynamics.

If you could nest time-stopped regions you could provide infinite power and infinite time to your computer, allowing you to compute anything instantly.

In the second case however you would be limited by the waste heat being dumped into the environment (where you are) and possibly super-heating it to arbitrary temperatures.
