I finished A Night Without Stars a little bit ago and while enjoyable fiction I couldn't help that think that some of the main characters in this were doing a shockingly bad job of their stated goal.

I don't know how much I should spoil for people, but two bits of information should be fairly safe. First the principle good guys in this have the following resources. Access to most of the information of Tech II verging on Tech III civilization. Personal force fields capable of withstanding everything up to a moderately distant nuclear blast, enhanced mental capacities, medical facilities capable of bring somebody back from anything up to what we would call dead and maybe a bit more (basically as long as the brain is in decent shape), fabrication faculties capable of producing any small object that we could construct today and then some (it isn't quite capable of self duplication though), you also have a group of general sympathetic people with the same mental enhancements you have though which you have perfectly secure communication with.

Your up against two factors, first you are isolated from your main civilization with no hope of contact with your current resources, the local civ is pre-industrialist and there are intelligent aliens able to perfectly disguise themselves as humans trying to slowly take over the planet, but without any extra usable technology, just better coordination and supper human intelligence and physique. They can be detected but with a test that's too expensive to be applied with current technology except when really needed. You can mostly keep infiltration down but nothing more. I actually never understood in the actual book why they didn't apply the test on scale, because according to the book it's just looking at the color of the blood. Red for human green for alien, but regardless it doesn't mater for this purposes. If you can get the humans up to something approaching a type I civilization they win. Tests suitable for mass testing can be developed, but not with current tech and the main Civ can be signaled and come to the rescue, but again not with the current tech and industrial base, the problem in the books is that there is a repressive government trying to cling on to power which rightly feels that this would unseat them and as such is working against both you and the enhanced fraction of the population.

In the books the most that is managed in the order of a thousand years is an elevation to a mid 20th century tech level with an emphasis on a rocket and nuke program taking out the aliens in orbit.

I think that somebody in this situation should be able to do much better. Step one is that you take over the government, sure they don't want it, but do you really care? You make it known to those you have perfect communication with that you will be the one to give out technology and your basically their only hope then you assassinate the high up political apparatus until what's left falls in line, also bribe those who are needed if necessary with advanced technology and medicine. This will cause instability and allow the aliens to accelerate there take over, but because of the exponential nature of their take over doing this early is basically your only choice. At this point you focus on two things, first elevating the technology base of the civilization as quickly as possible including education to give the general population as much of your knowledge base as they would be safe knowing (basically all of it, but if there's something in there that allows for mass destruction without a viable counter at current tech levels you might want to keep it close to the chest), in parallel, relax your control and transition to some form of democracy. At the same time you'll need to devote a huge percent of the GDP to fighting the alien's, but you should have truly astounding growth never the less. You have the blueprints for every step along the way up the tech ladder. Given the technology to signal main civ probably existed by around 2100, I think you should be able to achieve that tech level within about 100 to 200 years and signal for help.

Does anyone see holes in this. Normally the problem with trying to take over a society like this is that you're vulnerable, but in this you're basically indestructible to tech on that level.

The last thing you'd do is give them nukes while the repressive government is still in charge.
