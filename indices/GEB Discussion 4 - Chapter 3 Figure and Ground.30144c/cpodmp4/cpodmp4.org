Now that that's out of the way, I'm mostly interested here in the likely and clear isomorphism between record players and formal systems of proof. If it exists, naturally Omega will fall like the rest.

As for interesting figure and ground in real life, here's a much messier example: if you play Go, you have likely encountered a situation in which a move makes the status of a group wildly different than it previously had been. In some sense this is a sharp exchange between figure and ground. In the same vein would be Necker cubes, and those figure/ground illusions. In some sense this is a rarely spoken-of cognitive skill - being able to turn your mind inside-out.
