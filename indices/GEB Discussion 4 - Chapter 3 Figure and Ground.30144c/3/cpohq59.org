I find this grouping of chapters and dialogues kind of strange. Each dialogue usually introduces concepts that are going to be in the /following/ chapter, so we've been off-cycle with the dialogues from the start.

On the other hand, it seems like it's been working out fine, giving time to discuss the introduced concepts informally before discussing them more formally in the following thread. Is this intentional?
