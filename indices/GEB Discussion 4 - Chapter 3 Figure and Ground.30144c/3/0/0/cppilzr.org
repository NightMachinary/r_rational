I do love how the dialogues give you a break from the formalism. I was just reading about teaching, and how every teacher needs a sense of humor to break up the seriousness. I would also substitute: a sense of fun, a time for a break or a rest, and a 'ground'. The dialogues provide the ground for the formalism of the body of the chapters, otherwise they might feel as crowded as some of Escher's recursively tiled paintings.
