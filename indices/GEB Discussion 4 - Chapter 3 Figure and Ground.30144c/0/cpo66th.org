About the sequence:

The sequence should be co-recursively enumerable because as shown above there is an algorithm to find the next number in the sequence (figure) as well as the next number that is not in the figure (ground).

About the record players:

If the Record Player Omega checks if the sound would break it we can just create a record that it will fail to recognize and therefore play it and consequently break. Due to GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem we know it won't be able to determine for *all* records if the sound will break the record player.\\
Right?

--------------

I found the part about the goblet amusing because it shows that even the tortoise which has fun to destroy the crab's search for the perfect record player fails to apply the same reasoning for his own belief, namely finding the perfect goblet that has no flaw. Does Hofstadter want to show that it is in the human nature to search for perfection even if it is in most cases not possible to find it?

Some notes:

- took me a moment to find the hidden words in the figure-figure on p. 69
- [[/u/rspeer]] has some nice material in the wiki about the music referred to in the dialog (thanks for putting it together!)
