Interesting. So if the human brain can be encoded finitely, then it is both finite and, by GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem, cannot comprehend an infinite reality.

On the other hand, if our intuition is correct that we can think ourselves out of any paradox, i.e., that we could comprehend our (intuitively infinite) reality, given infinite time to do so, then it follows that either the brain itself is infinite, or our thinking/consciousness is not all contained within the brain.
