There's a short story, "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riddle_of_the_Universe_and_Its_Solution][The Riddle of the Universe and its Solution]]" by Christopher Cherniak, based on the premise that there is a Godel sentence for the human brain. The story appears in /The Mind's I/, a compilation of philosophy edited by Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett.

In the story, the human brain's Godel sentence has a similar effect to Tortoise's records -- it's an abstract concept that anyone who thinks about it falls into a permanent coma.

(We haven't defined what a Godel sentence is yet, aside from briefly in the introduction, so I'll summarize that it's a particular statement in a mathematical system that is true but unprovable, or false but provable, thus providing an example of why the system is either incomplete or inconsistent.)

Do you think that Godel's theorem applies to the human brain? So far we believe that we can think our way out of any paradox we encounter, but if the brain can be modeled mathematically, that would suggest there are thoughts that the human brain cannot think. (Or, in Cherniak's more drastic premise, we /can/ think them, but destroy ourselves in doing so.)
