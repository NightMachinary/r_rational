Sure, I can see that analogy.

Still fits pretty well into the p. 71 diagram, I'd say. A group of yours that's dead isn't just ground, it's going to become part of the other player's figure.

Black and white are both spreading out their living groups like the trees of theorems and their negations. The points outside them are uncertain, and may or may not become living -- it's up to black or white to prove that the points are theirs.
