Interesting. I don't think I'd see the black and white territory of a Go board as figure and ground -- I'd see them as a figure and an opposing figure, kind of like the black and white trees on p. 71, and the ground is the contested (or conceded to be neutral) space between them.

But maybe that's what you're saying. If you're playing black, you have to simultaneously consider outcomes where a region is eventually black, and where it's eventually not-black.
