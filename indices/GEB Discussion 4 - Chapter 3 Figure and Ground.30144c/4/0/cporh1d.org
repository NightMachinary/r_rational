There's the one Hofstadter is leading to: the set of theorems of any sufficiently powerful mathematical system.

You can enumerate all theorems by applying all possible rules methodically. (It will take an extremely long time to get to any theorem in particular, but you have forever.) You can't enumerate all non-theorems.
