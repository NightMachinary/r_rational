Yeah, not even my checking each prospective non-theorem against the set of theorems, because when the set of theorems doesn't form a natural hierarchy you can't guarantee that it will take a finite time (for any given prospective non-theorem) to go through all the theorems which might be relevant. Hope that makes sense.
