"Tsundere" indeed has two halves:

"Tsuntsun" -- basically, a "bristled" or "spiny" attitude of feigned anger or uncaring. "Idiot! It's not like I care!" is the characteristic tsuntsun line.

"Deredere" -- almost literally means "sweet", in the personal sense. The underlying attachment to others over which the anger is being feigned. "But... thanks anyway" is the deredere line that comes after the tsuntsun line above.

In combination, think of a tsundere as someone whose attitude towards varies across the warm emotions: sometimes caring and sweet, sometimes enraged, never actually as detached as the character claims to be in affectation. The post indicated that I'm running short on ability to act tsuntsun towards people as I often do.

So yeah.

(Stupid girlfriend, pointing out that I fit a cliched character type! At least I haven't dyed my hair and crossed the line from "bookish" to "pony princess"! </exemplifying one's tropes>)
