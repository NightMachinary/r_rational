Do you mean you're reading the PDF version with the flaws all through it? That's what I'm reading. My mental autocorrect is almost subconscious at this point, in all but the more dramatic cases. I recommend perseverance. But then, I'm also someone who really doesn't mind watching widescreen movies on a regular screen.
