Very interesting article. Several problems I see:

- I would have just solved the problem education issues are solved in real life: With a prestigious academic institution. The buyer (student) would be able to trust in the institution because the institution has a reputation to uphold, and the institution values its reputation because it can charge for giving an education and the reputation determines how much it can charge.
- If that somehow can't be done, the solution would be how financial transactions with a similar problem are handled in real life: with a clearinghouse or escrow acting as middleman. The buyer gives the money to the trusted third party and the spell is also given to the third party, the third party validates it, then allows the trade to go through. Certain 'keys' can be used to prevent the middleman from gaining the spell for free in the process, etc.
- The only way to enforce the patent on Melf's Acid Arrow would be if the world also has a Worldspell of Detecting Use of Melf's Acid Arrow. And your standard D&D setting doesn't have a government that is able to do such a thing. Now it sounds like you're also going the EULA route, which leads to...
- The EULA on Melf's Acid Arrow is more complex than the acid arrow effect itself. Considering wizards have to actually create the effect of the spell, in battle where every second counts, no one is going to want to use a spell that has this intron attached to it. It's either cast Acid Arrow once every round or cast Melf's Acid Arrow once every 2 rounds... the latter will have crappy DPS.
- Also since the wizard using the spell is manifesting each component of Melf's Acid Arrow, he should be able to tell which part of the spell is the EULA, and then just strip that out. It's like if I buy instructions to a recipe and the last step of the recipe says 'pay the creator', I can just go ahead with every step of that recipe except that last step.
- No one is going to use an Open Source Acid Arrow that's only got a 50% chance of working if there's also a Melf's Acid Arrow that works every time. Battles are a life and death kind of thing, who's going to be a miser with 2gp when their life is on the line? It would be like trying out alternative medicine when there are chemotherapy regimens known to work. Only people doing that are either uninformed or are abjectly poor.
