That just means that we can step down to Read Magic, which is a 0^{th} level spell for anyone besides Paladins and Rangers, though admittedly it seems like it gives somewhat less detailed information than Identify. Given that it explicitly calls out to the spells effect text, it still seems likely to me that crafting a spell that is a convincing fake would take enough time and effort as to not be profitable.
