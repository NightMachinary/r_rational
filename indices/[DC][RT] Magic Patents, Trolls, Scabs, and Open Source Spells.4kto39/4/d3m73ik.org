Is this 5e again, or no? Because if it's not, and it is 3.5, then this seems like it's handled pretty easily with the use of scrolls. Namely, that /Identify/ is a 1^{st} level spell which tells you the effect of a magic item, including scrolls. If the party can't find anyone they trust to cast a single first level spell (which should be hard, considering it's pretty likely that the party itself includes a wizard who almost certain knows it), they probably shouldn't be trusted with handling spells in general.
