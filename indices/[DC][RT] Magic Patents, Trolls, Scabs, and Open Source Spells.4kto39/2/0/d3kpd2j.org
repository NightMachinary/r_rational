  If that somehow can't be done, the solution would be how financial transactions with a similar problem are handled in real life: with a clearinghouse or escrow acting as middleman. The buyer gives the money to the trusted third party and the spell is also given to the third party, the third party validates it, then allows the trade to go through. Certain 'keys' can be used to prevent the middleman from gaining the spell for free in the process, etc.

Isn't this basically the patent system?
