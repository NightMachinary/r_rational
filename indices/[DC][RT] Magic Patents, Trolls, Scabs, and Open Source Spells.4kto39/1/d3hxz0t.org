Unsong has an interesting take on copyrighting spells.

For who hasn't read it (and really should) basically in that world people can speak names of God to achieve various effects. A few companies started employing spell-bruteforcing sweat shops in order to discover and then patent a large amount of names, then they created a sort of police body (UNSONG).

UNSONG agents have the name of the spell tatooed over their ear and some other stuff I forgot and basically can track down anyone who speaks a name without buying its scroll. They have effectively a monopoly on spells.

The very first chapter sparked quite a bit of discussion because the protagonist, which works in a name spell sweatshop, accidentally discovers a new name by appending some random words to a name displayed on his terminal just a few seconds after the end of his turn.

People were wondering who actually owned the name in that case.

In another instance the protagonist gets fined because he once used the awakening name without a license because he was sleepy and forgot his scroll home
