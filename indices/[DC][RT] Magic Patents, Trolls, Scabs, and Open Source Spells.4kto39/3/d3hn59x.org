  1. Say, Melf sets a casting price. Every casting of /Melf's Acid Arrow/ costs a mere 2 gp. Pretty cheap.

  2. A 3rd-level wizard, super excited to cast 2nd-level wizard spells from her magic book, purchases a copy of /Melf's/ from the local scroll store for 150 gp and signs the End User License Agreement to exercise the patented spell.

  3. Built into the fabric of the spell is a "magic casting fee processing unit".

  4. Whenever the 3rd-level wizard casts /Melf's Acid Arrow/ in the heat of battle, the EULA activates.

  5. An automatic 2-gp transfer occurs from her gold pouch around her waist to Melf's account managed by the Transmuter Bankers (less transfer, magic, and processing fees to the Transmuter Bankers).

  6. Should the 3rd-level wizard run out of cash, the spell won't activate. She'll need to kill more monsters and roll them for cash to pay the future fee.
