  "I want to learn to make a webpage. Sell me a book on it."

  "Okay. Here's an HTML instruction manual." (presents an XML instruction manual with "HTML" plastered onto the cover)

  "How do I know that that's a webpage instruction manual? Show me some actual webpage coding."

  "Sure." (opens computer, types up a simple webpage in HTML, and opens it in a browser) "Is that fine?"

  "I guess." (hands over money, takes XML instruction manual, walks away)

  "Tee-hee! What a chump."
