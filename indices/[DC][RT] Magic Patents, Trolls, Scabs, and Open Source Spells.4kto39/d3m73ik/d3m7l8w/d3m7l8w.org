I think the items that the author calls "scrolls" in this article are just non-magical instruction manuals for spells ([[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicOverview/arcaneSpells.htm#arcaneMagicalWritings]["arcane magical writings"]]?), not [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/scrolls.htm][magical single-use "scrolls"]].
