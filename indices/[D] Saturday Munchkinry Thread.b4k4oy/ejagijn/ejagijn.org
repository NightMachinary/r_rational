I'm poking at a character-concept, whose eyes and visual processing have been significantly improved; how many further complications come to your mind from adding a pile of channels to the standard human RGB?

Humans only think they can see colours. Sure, I mean, technically, they can. Three channels of colour information, meaning that when they're mixed and matched, they've got three primary and three secondary colours, which can be brighter or darker, plus 'everything' and 'nothing' (that is, 'white' and 'black'), for six shades. (Ignore Newton's alchemical attempt to split off indigo from purple, which has annoyed schoolchildren for centuries.) Put another way, 2^{3} = 8, minus 2 for black and white, equals 6. When I open /my/ eyes, I have /eight/ such channels, giving me 2^{8} -2 = 254 colours, each as distinct to me as orange is from green. When I push, I have 4 more, giving my brain 2^{12} - 2 = 4094 separate and distinct colours, any of which can be brighter or darker, or crossed with another colour into something equivalent to turquoise.

It took me a while to figure out how my visual system worked, in terms of grade-school physics. But for the sake of this story, to avoid confusing any listeners, I'm describing a few things that took me years to figure out. To start with, only six of my primary colours can be seen on a rainbow: yuve (aka UV, aka ultraviolet), blue, green, red, near (aka NIR, aka near infrared), and fir (aka FIR, aka far infrared). The seventh of my passive channels is polarization; the eighth is bizarre enough that for a long time I called it 'ghost', and still think of it that way. It only works if a particular light source, like sunlight or a fire, is shining both on what I'm trying to look at, and on the crystal in my forehead; and if there's something blocking my direct view, like a wall or a cloud; and if whatever it is casts some shadows that aren't completely blocked from my view. It's sort of like being able to see ghosts through solid walls, thus the name.

If I push my mind in certain ways, then I can see up to four more channels. One is sonar - and yes, I know that it's made from sound from my nasal cavities that bounce into my ears, but my brain /interprets/ the results in its visual centres. So I can 'see' with my ears, even if I'm wearing a blindfold. It's handy, in its way, because it takes less effort than the other three, which I am reliably informed are organic forms of lidar, terahertz-range radar, and radio-range radar. My forehead-crystal is heavily involved in emitting the lidar and t-rays, and most of my head in the radar. If I go all out, then I'm told that the effort produces an extra 75 watts of heat, compared to the 80 watts a typical body produces just when lying down. It's a lot less than the thousand watts a sprinting human can produce, but it's all generated in my head, right next to my brain; and even though my neurons don't seem to suffer all the limits that purely evolved organisms have to deal with, it's still a pain - occasionally literally. Part of 'looking hard' triggers my upper heart to beat harder, and a lot of my cranial arteries and veins to expand, pushing a lot more blood through, carrying the heat away; and my fore-lungs to pump independently of my hind-lungs, switching from being bird-like air-sacs to heat-exchangers, as I start panting. Some more of the heat I sweat out, and some is directly radiated by my ears, but most gets dumped in a bladder-like organ in my foretorso, about where a human might expect to find a liver.

In extreme situations, my body squeezes that bladder, shooting some of the over-hot liquid out my mouth, dumping the heat far away from me. Oh, and this is probably the best time to mention that my incisors contain enough piezoelectric crystals to spark when I gnash them together - just enough of a spark to ignite the liquid from my heat-bladder.
