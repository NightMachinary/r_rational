  you can trade places of two subjects a few times/day

This is definitely exploitable as it gives the power of life and death over the subjects. If you can grant patronage without close physical proximity, it would make you one of the most dangerous people in the world due to being able to credibly threaten anyone. And it gets /much/ more dangerous with some abuse of physics.

Swapping a 100KG subject with a 50KG subject surrounded by solid matter would result in 50KG of subject occupying the same space as the solid matter. Solids and liquids are only very slightly compressible, e.g. water at the bottom of the Marianas trench is only a few percent denser than at surface level. Instantaneously increasing pressure to levels closer to that at the center of the earth will result in a furiously hot ball of matter expanding outwards in all directions at supersonic speeds. Undetectable, unpreventable mass murder. The first subject survives and the second subject / human bomb wouldn't need to be a willing participant.

Additionally, the matter of the second subject will be locally positioned at random with respect to the liquid/solid matter surrounding the first subject rather than in a stable minimum energy state. As a result, some fraction of the atoms will overcome the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_barrier][Coulomb Barrier]] and undergo fusion. The hard radiation and additional energy output will not make things better for anyone in the vicinity. It might even be possible to use a pair of subjects as the core of a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_fusion_weapon][pure fusion weapon]], making you a nuclear superpower.
