Just finished watching the Netflix adaptation of /The Umbrella Academy/. It was... decent, though I did feel characters held on to their idiot balls a bit too often, and certain aspects of their powers felt inconsistent. As usual, the abilities of the main cast felt underused. How would you munchkin any of the following? The universe contains any required secondary properties to make these work, but otherwise appears to be very similar to our own.

*MINOR SPOILERS BELOW, BUT NOTHING PAST THE FIRST EPISODE REALLY*

(I'm also going with the show versions, since the comic versions have extra stuff)

#1. Luther Hargreeves -- super strength, capable of casually throwing a grown man dozens of feet through a window

#2. Diego Hargreeves -- capable of throwing objects with excellent precision, curving them around obstacles mid-flight

#3. Allison Hargreeves -- capable of seemingly unbounded mind-control of other humans, so long as the command is heard audibly and takes the form: "I heard a rumor... [command]"

#4. Klaus Hargreeves -- capable of communicating with the dead by summoning a their spirit, with limited control of who is summoned. Only he can see and hear the spirit, and it cannot interact with the physical world except through these two channels

#5. Number Five -- capable of teleportation of self and held/worn items, with an unknown range. No issues with matching the earth's rotational velocity etc. etc. Can also travel through time with limited control.

#6. Ben Hargreeves -- capable of summoning eldritch abominations from his torso in the form of tentacles that slap things around.

--------------

The time travel component of #5 seem the least taken advantage, through that might be attributed to a lack of control. Otherwise, it seems like #3 failed the hardest -- in universe, she's ok with non-consensual use of her power on 'innocents', and uses it to propel herself to movie stardom, rather than, say, political or industrial domination. People seem to know her history as a super-powered crime fighter, and yet don't take any precautions against non-consensual mind control when interacting with her.

Instead, I feel she'd have been able to make a much broader impact on the world through consensual therapy. Her powers don't appear to exhaust her -- at least not beyond the exhaustion brought about by talking -- and their effects are never shown to fade through time, or be limited in complexity (though they do seem psychological in nature -- no /rumors/ can warp reality, afaict). A better use of them imo would be to coordinate with an extensive team of capable psychotherapists to create a conveyor belt of patients desiring behavioral change and explicitly willing to submit to "rumor" treatment (and willing to pay $$). As each one passes, you tell them you'd heard a rumor that they were no longer addicted to X, or their mental diseases were cured, or they'd searched deep within themselves and found the willpower to procrastinate less and with greater dedication pursue their goals, etc. Hell, she could provide explicit commitments between consenting parties as a contract enforcement mechanism! She could serve as a marriage counselor! Sky's the limit, and you'd exhaust your own time before drying the well of prospective clients, even restricting yourself to the wealthy (say, ~$10k per treatment? half of which goes to overhead, your team, etc. and half to you?)? Treating, say, 100 people per hour would net you millions USD per day, far beyond what a mere movie star would make.

#1 and #2 otherwise seen perfect for competitive sports, so long as you can keep the supernatural aspects of the power hidden and unbanned. #4 would be world-changing just as demonstrable evidence for an afterlife, and people would likewise flock for seance services (if not for personal reasons, then for e.g. estate management). #6, I guess, could be used for reverse engineering? idk
