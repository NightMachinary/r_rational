You have the power to become grant patronage to people. You have the ability to always be able to point out where your subjects are by looking at a map, and within a distance proportional to the number of subjects you can view through the senses of your subjects and telepathically communicate with them. Within the same range you can grant minor buffs to your subjects: allow them to move faster, become more resilient, become nimbler, and become mentally quicker, and additionally you can trade places of two subjects a few times/day. Only a certain fraction of your subjects can receive buffs at the same time and it is physically exhausting for you to have buffs running exponentially correlated to the number of active buffs. You have no particular control of your subjects and a subject can at any point reject your patronage.

What are some clever uses of this kind of power?
