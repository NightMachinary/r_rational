10% doesn't seem measurable in everyday life. You might feel good with a physical buff, but you'd have to go to the gym and compare your best effort to see it in effect.

I suppose that's one such exploit you could munchkin: at the top levels of sport, where athletes are using years of training and the best genetics to eke out improvements of milliseconds over others who are also near the peak levels of natural human performance, you could be a kingmaker. Sports betting could make you a lot of money, which is its own superpower.
