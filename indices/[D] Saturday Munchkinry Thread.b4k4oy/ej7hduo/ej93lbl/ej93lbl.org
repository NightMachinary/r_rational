My subjects can reject my patronage, but do they have to accept it or can I just declare them as my subjects? If I can just declare them, then the first thing that I can do is simply declare the entire population of Earth to be my subjects. Now, over a very large distance, I can telepathically communicate with and look through the eyes of anyone I want; this is extremely munchkinable, especially if I see through the eyes of (say) someone looking at secret documents.

If, on the other hand, I need them to accept the idea of being my follower in at least some sense, then the best thing to do is to create a twitter account and work on getting as many twitter followers as possible.

If I count as one of my own subjects for teleportation purposes, then I can also arrange for holidays abroad whenever I want - I just need to find someone in the target country who wants a holiday here without having to pay for transport.
