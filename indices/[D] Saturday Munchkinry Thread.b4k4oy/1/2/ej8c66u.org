How much faster, nimbler, etc. do subjects become? And how many subjects can you buff before your baseline state of exhaustion becomes equivalent to, say, 36h sleep deprivation? My first inclination would be to become a professional (football?) coach, and maybe also attribute the boost to some special (100% legal!) sauce, a weaker version of which can be purchased for the low low price of $99.99, as the other comment suggests. Plus side here is you only need to be boosting targets during games, and maybe during some of the practices. Otherwise if the boost transforms the ordinary into superhuman, get some confidants in on the action and have the cut you some of that sponsorship money.

Swapping subjects could be useful for e.g. relieving astronauts of their shifts, or else selling intercontinental transportation services to busy, wealthy people.
