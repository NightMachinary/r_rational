Ha! I remember this! And looking at that post, I even commented.

Unfortunately, I don't really have my [[/r/DataHoarder][r/DataHoarder]] shit together. So I'm sorry I can't really help with this.

This does highlight how much we need a JJBA ratfic though. That said, there really was barely anything there, that I can remember anyway. So, sad to say it, it wasn't as big of a loss as it could've been, though it was a neat intro. In that I can remember, anyway.
