75% downvoted? Wow. I wonder if the downvoters just hate JoJo's Bizarre Adventure without having watched it, but just from Reddit's obsession with it and osmosis, like me, or if they are prompted by the complex philosophical question of whether the author's apparent desire to delete it should be respected by even those past readers who keep an imperfect copy in their own heads.

Anyway, I wish you luck. I'd forgotten about this ratfic and it reminds me of simpler times when it felt like more of the stories posted here were really, (really) weird things written by community members than otherwise.
