"He's sat down" should be "He'd". "Has runs its course" should be "has run". I'm not sure, but shouldn't "congress" be capitalized? "an oversized scissors" should be "an oversized pair of scissors". "You're too close to the story Clark" should probably have a comma.

Definitely some interesting developments this time. Now that Luthor knows Clark Kent's identity, he has a major advantage. He could have him watched discreetly and figure out almost everything he needs to know about him.
