My flair is based on the title I acquired after posting [[/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13o8ik/quantifying_magical_outputs_using_star_wars_and/][Quantifying Magical Outputs]] and [[/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13okoq/determining_the_mechanisms_behind_apparation/][Determining the Mechanisms Behind Apparation, Time-Travel, and Transfiguration]] in the same day. They were some of my early posts on reddit, just when I was starting out, so I really put my all into each of them but wasn't really sure exactly how they might be received. So when I saw that not only were my postings well received but Yudkowsky [[/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13okoq/determining_the_mechanisms_behind_apparation/c76e83s][commented]] approving on one of them /and/ I had acquired this new title in recognition of my efforts.

I had never looked into "flair" besides choosing to join Dragon Army and hadn't really looked any further than that. Even after I learned how to make custom flair, granting me a near infinite number of possibilities [[[/http://xkcd.com/285/][CITATION NEEDED]]], I could not help but retain it. That title now fundamentally represented my ability to attain things with a skill and quality that distinguished me from the people around me.

And I freaking /loved/ that.

So that is while never really got around to choosing flair all that much, that is the reason I have seen fit to retain and reiterate it and plan on doing so now and into the future.
