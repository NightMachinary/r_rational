Similarly, the Procians are a school of thought in the Anathem universe. The prime ideological conflict in the book is the Procian vs Halikaarnian split, which basically boils down to whether you believe that platonic objects/concepts "exist" or not (for an underspecified definition of the word "exist").

The Procians get rather (unfairly, in my mind) vilified in the book, and portrayed as less interested in truth and more interested in the appearance of truth (which, pretty funnily, makes them better ambassadors to the world outside the concents :P).

So if I had to pick my position here, I'd probably have to /lean/ towards not seeing the necessity of platonic forms to exist - they're collections of structure that we stumble upon when trying to make predictions about the world, but the map is not the territory - but this isn't a super strong belief or anything. I pretty much picked my flair pretty just to be contrary :P

/uh I mean/ - I picked my flair to impress upon everyone the importance of /not/ vilifying ideological opponents. Yea. That's totally it.
