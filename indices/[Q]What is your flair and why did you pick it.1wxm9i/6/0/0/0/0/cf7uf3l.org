Addresses, but then you get wanderers whose names only reflect where they were born. I think there's such a character in /Surface Detail/, on a weird hourglass-shaped space habitat that's controlled by a crazed Mind. The Culture archaeological drones on that habitat used wheels and mechanical arms, because the habitat didn't like fields.
