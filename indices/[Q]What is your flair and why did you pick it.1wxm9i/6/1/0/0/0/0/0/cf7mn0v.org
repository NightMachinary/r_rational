  Uncontrolled self-modification leads to nasty, horrid places very, very quickly.

I may be falling to an anthropomorphic bias, but this argument, while reasonable, does not consider controlled modification. This may be because finding subtle mistakes requires the equivalence to murder by most means we can think up.

I definitely hope we do keep the powerful trans-humanists friendly, but that's usually nothing more than an adequate set of ethics.
