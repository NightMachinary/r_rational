Basically, I think the clear answer there is, NO, and for a /very/ good reason. Uncontrolled self-modification leads to nasty, horrid places /very, very quickly/. I can't imagine an FAI that allows some individual to expand to "power-levels" where they can start overriding everyone else in their light-cone, at which point why the bloody hell did you bother not having an artilect war and half a dozen paper-clippers in the first place?

On the other hand, the neat little solution there is simply to ensure that some constraints are placed on transhumans who intend to become /that/ powerful to ensure they remain Friendly with respect to everyone else. Power at the price of responsibility, then.
