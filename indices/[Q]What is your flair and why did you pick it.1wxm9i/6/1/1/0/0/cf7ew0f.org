Ever been running on that nice peak where you can or are multitasking well at a challenging problem or problems, finish them and have that nice sense of satisfied accomplishment? I think you can be up-close with an issue and still do a lot of things.

Really interesting part to me, aside from the increased scope would be to have a brain that can multiply and not need adjunct processing aka a calculator, for the tricky calculations.
