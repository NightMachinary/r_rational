My flair is based on Anathem, by Neal Stephenson (which probably barely misses the mark for being rationalist fiction). In the universe of Anathem, the people who do science live secluded in buildings resembling monasteries (called concents). The important monk-scientists are called Saunts (similar to religious Saints) and the really important ones have concents named after them. I picked this particular concent because I didn't feel like picking the one the main character is from or the one that studies combat and warfare.

I chose to represent Anathem because Neil Stephenson is probably my favorite author and Anathem is one of those books where you want to live inside its universe. The idea of being grouped together with a bunch of people who are really interested in knowing more things and being intelligent was really appealing when I read it. (It still is, but things got better after reading HPMOR.)
