Even though I don't have much to show for it, I write similar to Sam Hughes due in large part that I am a huge fan. His latest work Ra does splendid academibabble. The magic is not so much the most rewarding, as is the portrayal of academia handling this magic. It is very believable.

I have tried my hand at rationalizing a framework in which MLP:FiM makes sense (because it doesn't at all), and I am working through a massive hump of worldbuilding to make the universe actually interesting under inspection.
