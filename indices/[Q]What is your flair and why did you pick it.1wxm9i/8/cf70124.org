I made the Discworld post for this subreddit, and am currently marathoning through the series again. I have read more than 30 books in the series more than once, mostly four or more times. The few I haven't are the most recent few (Unseen Academicals onwards).

Even then, it was a tossup between this and a Culture ship name. Iain Banks has the best names for anything in the Culture's ships - see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series][the wikipedia list]] for the complete list. I almost tried to make a 'best of' list of names, but stopped and deleted it when it hit more than 10 entries - seriously, those names are amazing.
