That's unfortunate. Hoping to avoid a protracted argument about the series' proper category, I'll refer to the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9rn8ra/-/e8i53oc/][thoughts]] I posted alongside the previous chapter.

Besides that, I will say the anime is widely considered a mediocre to terrible adaption.

I suppose I'll stop posting this if complaints of this kind become commonplace, but for now I'll wait and see.
