A problem - I believe this series is relevant content for this subreddit, and I want to bring attention to the series where possible. On the other hand, I don't want to be percieved as spamming content nobody else likes. The solution, of course, is to post it on a monthly basis instead - nobody can accuse me of posting too much that way, and there's practical benefits too, like making it easier for new readers to get some idea of how the series is written.

As luck would have it, the series itself is also moving onto a monthly schedule, starting with the next chapter. ([[/r/worldtrigger]] is praying that this marks the end of the intermittent hiatuses.) Thus, this is the only batch of four chapters (~80 pages total) I'll post, and future posts will likely be monthly chapters of about 40 pages.
