  didn't feel that I needed information the author had yet to provide

This is the main thing I don't get about your line of argument. Why do you keep talking about this information like it's something you /must/ have ASAP? It's not like you have, I don't know, life decisions or work responsibilities riding on it. Presumably any reader who's invested in the story is excited to learn this information, maybe even impatient to learn it, but we don't /urgently need/ it--certainly not to the extent of feeling wronged by the author taking a few weeks' break between raising these questions and answering them.

I also honestly, just in general, don't understand any level of impatience with the author's output. Regardless of /when/ he takes his breaks, this is a web serial--we're getting new chapters at a ridiculous pace. Considering that the break took place between books, if PGTE were a traditional book series, you'd have had to wait at least a year to have your end-of-book-4 questions answered.
