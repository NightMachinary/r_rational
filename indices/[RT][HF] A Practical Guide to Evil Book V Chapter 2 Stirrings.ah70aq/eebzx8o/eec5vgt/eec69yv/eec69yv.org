I'm more referring to the "how dares the author take a break and leave a cliffhanger at the point that was originally supposed to be the /middle/ of the book" position.

Also, it's not actually a personal attack since you're far from the only person that holds this point of view - just the one arguing longest and most reasonably. Besides, I don't think we should make a measuring contest of who is the biggest fan: the story having its own sub shouldn't stop people from, say, calling me an annoyance or calling out the protagonist/villain circlejerk.
