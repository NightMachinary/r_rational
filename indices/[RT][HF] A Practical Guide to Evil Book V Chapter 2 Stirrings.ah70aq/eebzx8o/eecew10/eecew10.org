I had some fairly strong reservations about the Drow arc but i'm really liking the direction this Book is heading. The author of the Malazan series has a term he uses to describe the showdowns at the ends of his novels where his 20 odd POV characters end up together in one huge conflict - 'Convergence'.

"/Convergence. Power ever draws other power/"

That's what it feels like we're heading towards. It's going to be great seeing all these disparate characters we've slowly become invested in all interact with each other. The Tyrant is one of my very favourite characters and seeing Cat (hopefully) interact with him should be hilarious, seeing how the Heroes react to !reformed Akua should be interesting and you just know the Bard will be involved in a conflict of this scale. I think we're going to get a lot of payoff in the not too distant future.
