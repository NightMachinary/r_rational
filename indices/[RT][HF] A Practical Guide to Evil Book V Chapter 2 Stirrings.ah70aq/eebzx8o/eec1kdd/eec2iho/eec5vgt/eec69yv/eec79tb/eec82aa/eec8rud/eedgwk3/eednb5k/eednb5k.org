  If it seriously affects you that much, then it might be better for your health if you stop being so heavily invested.

It......doesn't? Why do people seem to think I am frothing at the mouth or tearing my hair out or something?

  Plus, if you have such a lack of patience that you can't wait then you have bigger problems than investment.

  Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that investment is bad, no. What I am saying is that if you're so invested that you can't control your patience and get into hateful spats with the community then maybe, just maybe, you're entering unhealthy obsession territory.

/What/? How /on earth/ is any of this hateful?

People are taking me criticizing a story really really seriously. "Unhealthy obsession"? Fucking /what/?
