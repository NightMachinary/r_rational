  I'm more referring to the "how dares the author take a break and leave a cliffhanger at the point that was originally supposed to be the middle of the book" position.

Frankly the author should probably take /more/ breaks. At least they take better care of themself then Wildbow and pirateaba, I suppose.

For a serial, the question of where to take breaks is an incredibly important one. So much so that /the/ most successful serial author (Wildbow) elects not to do so at all. The Wandering Inn did a much better job of placing the break within the story this year than the Guide did. I was looking forward to the resumption, but not impatiently and didn't feel that I needed information the author had yet to provide.

As with basically every other serial, The Guide still overuses and misuses cliffhangers. Just look at the most recent chapters of Ward for a perfect example.

  Also, it's not actually a personal attack since you're far from the only person that holds this point of view - just the one arguing longest and most reasonably.

It doesn't need to be a personal attack to be unproductive shit-stirring.

  Besides, I don't think we should make a measuring contest of who is the biggest fan: the story having its own sub shouldn't stop people from, say, calling me an annoyance or calling out the protagonist/villain circlejerk.

Of course not, but being able to point at myself championing the work makes it impossible to simply label me a hater and ignore me.
