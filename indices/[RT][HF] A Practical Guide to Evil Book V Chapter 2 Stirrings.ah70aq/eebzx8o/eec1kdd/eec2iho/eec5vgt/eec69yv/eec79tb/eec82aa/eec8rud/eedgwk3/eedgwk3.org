Okay, so just don't be invested. If it seriously affects you *that* much, then it might be better for your health if you stop being so heavily invested.

Plus, if you have such a lack of patience that you can't wait then you have bigger problems than investment.

Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that investment is bad, no. What I am saying is that if you're so invested that you can't control your patience and get into hateful spats with the community then maybe, /just maybe,/ you're entering unhealthy obsession territory.
