  This is the main thing I don't get about your line of argument. Why do you keep talking about this information like it's something you must have ASAP? It's not like you have, I don't know, life decisions or work responsibilities riding on it. Presumably any reader who's invested in the story is excited to learn this information, maybe even impatient to learn this information,

Nothing in my /actual/ life depends on it but *my investment in the story does*. The more time that goes past without an explanation the more my investment suffers. If it goes too long it will wither entirely.

  but we don't urgently need this information--certainly not to the extent of feeling wronged by the author taking a few weeks' break between raising these questions and answering them.
#+end_quote

This is your biggest misconception. I /don't/ feel wronged, ultimately it is just a story. I do, however, feel that it weakened the story. That's all I have been saying. Not that EE has some....deranged obligation to write until they pass out.

  I also honestly just in general don't understand any level of impatience with the author's output. Regardless of when he takes his breaks, this is a web serial--we're getting new chapters at a ridiculous pace. If it were a traditional book series, you'd have had to wait at least a year to have your questions answered.
#+end_quote

Were this a traditional book series, the editor would have insisted on a more conclusive ending.

It isn't the authors output I was objecting to. As i complained last thread

#+begin_quote
  We have had: One interlude, one epilogue, one prologue, one bonus chapter and one regular chapter. That is a hell of a lot of content spent dancing around the issue.
#+end_quote

The issue is very clearly not output, it is about focus.
