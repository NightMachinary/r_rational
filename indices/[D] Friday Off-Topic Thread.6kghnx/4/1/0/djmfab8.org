There will have to be a bit of nuance to it. For instance, some species being obviously more aggressive than others, so that if you really do try and go through a high level area at the very beginning, eventually your luck will run out and you'll find one that won't leave you alone, even if it's just playing cat and mouse.

On top of that, I'm hoping for a good mix of creature levels, so even if half of the creatures are God tier in a high level area, there's still a good number of creatures that are only /twice/ as strong as you, who might view you more as a cockroach to be squashed.

I'm also hoping to be able to train players at the beginning to take it slow, take things seriously, and don't treat this like a JRPG. I just want there to be wiggle room in the event that they ignore me, but not /too/ much.

There's a lot of levers to pull to make this feasible, is I guess what I'm trying to say.
