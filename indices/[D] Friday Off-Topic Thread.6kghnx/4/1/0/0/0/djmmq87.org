  That sounds fine. Presumably, these areas will be demarcated by signs laid out by helpful people who want to inform passers-by about the danger.

Right. Signs and also indications on the pokedex map giving a danger rating as decided by the Rangers.

As for Neo Scavenger, it sounds vaguely familiar, but I've been really bad lately about trying recommendations. I don't know that there will be the standard "every goon has some kind of usable loot" trope, but where it makes sense it makes sense. Dead or incapacitated trainers? Sure. Dead or incapacitated Pok√©mon? I imagine those will need to be taken (via pokeball) to skilled pokebutchers, unless you learn that skill yourself. But outside of those situations, I don't think you can loot a lump on the screen and get $200, a broken pokeball, and a pelt.

I definitely am 100% behind NPC interaction. A huge amount of effort will go into making those sorts of things systematic, so that in reality the player will (hopefully) just be one of the NPCs in a standard NPC-NPC interaction, if that makes sense.
