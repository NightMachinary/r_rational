  But outside of those situations, I don't think you can loot a lump on the screen and get $200, a broken pokeball, and a pelt.

Oh sure. That wasn't what I was interested in. I was just using it as the first example that came to mind of a game with NPC/NPC interactions that you could take advantage of.

(If you like post-apoc/survival sims then you'll probably like NEO Scavenger. It's the first game where I've killed somebody literally just to get his shoes or his shirt and where the packs of dogs were sometimes less of a threat than dying of hypothermia)
