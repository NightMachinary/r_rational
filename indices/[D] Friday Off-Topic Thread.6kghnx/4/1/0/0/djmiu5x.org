  For instance, some species being obviously more aggressive than others, so that if you really do try and go through a high level area at the very beginning, eventually your luck will run out and you'll find one that won't leave you alone, even if it's just playing cat and mouse.

That sounds fine. Presumably, these areas will be demarcated by signs laid out by helpful people who want to inform passers-by about the danger.

Also, have you heard of NEO Scavenger? I can't remember if you've already mentioned something like this, but one of the things that I like about the game is that the NPCs will interact with each other. More than once, I have watched somebody duke it out with a pack of feral dogs or something so that I could go in afterwards and loot their corpse.

I'm not sure how much corpse-looting will be a thing in this game, but I'm sure that there'd be some other way to take advantage of NPC-on-NPC interactions (the one that comes to mind is waiting until a battle in order to ambush the winner, whose pogheys will have been weakened by the previous fight).
