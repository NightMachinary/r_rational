I know nothing about pokemon but I'm a big fan of Morrowind. I really like the idea of monsters too strong for you not bothering to attack you unless you provoke them (which you might not even be strong enough to do if you're really an ant to them). It does raise the issue of letting people wander around high level areas at low levels because the high level creatures ignore them, but that could be fine as long as it's designed for it.
