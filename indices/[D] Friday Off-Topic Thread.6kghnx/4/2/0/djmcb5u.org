Just for you I've made sure that the discussion document is up to date. I had let it lapse a bit.

There are also logs of the #pokengineering discord channel which have topic headers, but I got lazy after about December of last year and stopped keeping up. Feel free to jump on Discord and access the entire backlog, or just ask questions and we'll gush.

Let me know what you think!
