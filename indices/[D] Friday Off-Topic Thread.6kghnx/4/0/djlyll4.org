To go a bit more in-depth about Legendaries (since we talked a /lot/ about them), we've decided on a few important details.

First, the Legendaries that you are familiar with belong to species of the same name. Moltres is a member of the Moltres species, and theoretically there are baby Moltres out there. A legendary species isn't inherently more powerful than other, normal Pokemon (though they will tend to have high base stats), they simply have a much easier time of extending their age by being strong, so many more of them proportionally become effectively biologically immortal.

Second, being captial-L Legendary is /only/ a matter of how strong you are. The aforementioned legendary species are uniquely predisposed towards reaching this level, because they can become effectively biologically immortal and as long as they don't get murdered then given enough time they'll become strong enough to develop special powers. The Stormbirds of Kanto, for instance, have massive AoE storms that make even approaching them difficult for all but the most powerful trainers. A baby Moltres won't have any form of Storm at all, even a weak one, but as Moltres (or a Pokemon like Moltres) grows strong enough to become captial-L Legendary, they start to develop a Storm. This /also/ means that any ordinary Pokemon can, under the right circumstances, become Legendary. A Machamp that trains ruthlessly for a thousand years might not only throw off the shackles of age entirely but also develop some special, incredibly powerful talent like the Stormbirds, becoming a Legendary in its own right.

Lastly, for each (or maybe most, we're undecided) legendary species, there is one member of the species Arceus personally created at the start of the world as capital-L Legendaries. These are the Originals of their kinds, inherently the oldest and strongest. The Stormbirds of Kanto, for example, are the Original birds and have lived since the beginning of the world. Chances are any other Zapdos you find won't come close to as strong as the Original Zapdos, even if they're capital-L Legendary and have their own Storms. In some cases, though, the Original might not have survived all this time. Shaymin, for instance, is a legendary species noted in canon to have many members, so we might represent that by saying that long ago the Original Shaymin was defeated and killed, and now all that's left is the Shaymin species (which may hold specimens that became biologically immortal and capital-L Legendary over the centuries anyways).
