I'm caught up at chapter 138 and while the story's slow going it certainly seems to be that way. This story isn't the most subtle when you focus on the tone of the narration (for instance, at your point in the story Li Yao's choosing his university to aim for, and you can clearly see the author describe the /sensible/ option and then go on to describe the /right/ option), and all I've seen about Ding screams 'Li Yao's perfect love interest'. It's /possible/ that they'll dramatically kill her off to traumatize Li Yao a few hundred chapters in, but I'll doubt it (or at least that she'd stay dead)
