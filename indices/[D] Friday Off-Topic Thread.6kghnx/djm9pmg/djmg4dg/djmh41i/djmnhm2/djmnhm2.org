I have VERY limited training in this area (done, like, one and a half semesters of a 3 year nutrition degree), but what you describe sounds like food aversion, which is a psychological problem and should ideally be changed by fixing your aversion than by planning your diet around it. In an ideal world, I would recommend you see a psychologist to help you deal with it.

In a quick and dirty world where psychologists are expensive, here's some ways you can try and deal with your food aversions:

- Eat the unfamiliar food in familiar settings: so, don't get hummus at a restaurant, but perhaps put a little bit on a peanut butter cracker that you might have at dinner, keeping the rest of the meal identical.

- Use anxiety-reduction techniques to deal with the anxiety you have about your "problem" foods. For example, you say you can't even look at fetta. Exposure and response prevention: start with looking at a picture of fetta, then looking at fetta, then touching it with the tip of your finger, then holding it, then touching it with your tongue (like you're licking a popsicle), then put it in your mouth but don't chew or swallow, etc. Work your way up.

If you want to see how many vitamins/etc you're getting, this site is very good for analysing food logs: [[https://cronometer.com/]]
