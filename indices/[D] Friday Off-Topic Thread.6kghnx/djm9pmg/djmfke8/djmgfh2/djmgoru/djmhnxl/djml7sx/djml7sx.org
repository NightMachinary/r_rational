While it might be nice to have absolute escape sequences in human languages, humans are agents, not machines.

What I mean is that they can choose to violate the rules of the language - there is nothing in their code that prevents them from doing so - and that, in most cases, they actually have incentives to do so, both for deception and for emphasis.

For an example of the former, Alice may wish to cause Bob to (falsely) believe a statement, and so preferences her sentence with the "the following is the truth" sequence: "I swear on my honor that I didn't do it." As the generic "I swear" sequence is corrupted, new sequences come into use; "I swear on the grave of my father", etc.

For the latter, see the history of "literally", "awesome", "terrible", etc.
