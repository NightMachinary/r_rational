I agree it needs rules for spelling and pronunciation, and {in,}flammable meaning the same is weird, and some other word should be found for "literally".

However, aren't we good enough at disambiguating whether "a million" is literal or figurative? Metaphors are essential communication tools too.

Also, I don't understand how you would use escape sequences. Where would you put them in that long phrase?
