  I have a perspective that I have never found anyone else endorsing.[...] I am (technically) a prescriptivist with the above caveat. My "prescription" is simple. The purpose of language is to communicate.

I'm fairly certain that I've expresssed this exact sentiment in various places, though [[http://np.reddit.com/r/xkcd/comments/53hvsl/xkcd_1735fashion_police_and_grammar_police/d7t6j5l/][this]] is the only example that I can find at the moment.

  It is not the job of map-makers to decide what roads should be where. They only observe where they are and present it in a convenient way.[...] Similarly, linguistics is the study of language. It is not the purpose of linguistics to evaluate which languages are better, or the utility of changes in languages.

Purely-descriptive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography][cartography]] (or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying][surveying]]) and purely-prescriptive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning][urban planning]] (or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_planning][transportation planning]]) are totally-separate areas. Does the purely-descriptive "linguistics" that you describe have a purely-prescriptive counterpart? Or are you proposing that such a counterpart should be separated from the current umbrella term of "linguistics", and should receive its own, new name?
