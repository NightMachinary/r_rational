Yes, but I don't think prescriptive linguistics should be limited to that. It should also include resisting or promoting changes in "natural" languages.

I'm not sure how it should be implemented. There might not be a practical way to do it. It would certainly be silly to punish people with jail or large fines for breaking grammatical / spelling rules in print, and it would be financially impractical to charge them trivial fines because the necessary bureaucracy would cost more than the amount the fines bring in.

I guess I'm saying that it would be a good thing if everyone just agreed to not always be indifferent to all changes in language and to decide based on reasonable criteria whether to support new changes with their own usage.
