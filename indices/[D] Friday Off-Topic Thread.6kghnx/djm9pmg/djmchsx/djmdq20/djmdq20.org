  Does the purely-descriptive "linguistics" that you describe have a purely-prescriptive counterpart? Or are you proposing that such a counterpart should be separated from the current umbrella term of "linguistics", and should receive its own, new name?
#+end_quote

I am proposing a purely-prescriptive counterpart, which does not seem to exist and I do not have a name for. It should probably have its own name. I think there's an agency in France which makes decisions about the language but I don't know how that's put into effect and it's my understanding that they're historical prescriptivists. It should be separate in the same way that cartography and urban planning are separate.

edit: All else being equal. I don't think it's at all a high priority.
