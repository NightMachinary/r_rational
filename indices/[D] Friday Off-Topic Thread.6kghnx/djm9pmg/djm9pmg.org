I have a perspective that I have never found anyone else endorsing. I don't think I'm wrong but I am suspicious that I seem to be the only one.

Both linguistic descriptivists and linguistic prescriptivists are fundamentally wrong.

Consider maps. It is not the job of map-makers to decide what roads should be where. They only observe where they are and present it in a convenient way. This does not mean that all cities have equally good road layout. No sane person who has had to navigate Boston without a GPS would say that Boston and NYC are equally good when it comes to the efficiency of where roads are. Naturally that doesn't mean we should bulldoze Boston and start over. It just means that if Boston had a grid layout from the start, that would have been better.

Similarly, linguistics is the study of language. It is not the purpose of linguistics to evaluate which languages are better, or the utility of changes in languages. In the same way, that does not mean that all languages are equal and that all changes are fine.

I only differ from (most) prescriptivists in that I don't care about historical usage, except in the same sense that I don't think we should bulldoze Boston and start over. There's nothing magic about historical usage that makes languages better or worse.

I am (technically) a prescriptivist with the above caveat. My "prescription" is simple. The purpose of language is to communicate. Communication is any method of making someone else understand one of your thoughts / ideas / emotional states / etc better. Therefore, languages that facilitate communication more effectively are better languages. Changes in languages that make communication easier are good, and changes in languages that make communication harder are bad. Different languages can, of course, be better for different contexts or for different people. Sign language is better for the deaf. Languages without certain consonants are better for people with speech impediments.

The thing that annoys me about (most) descriptivists is the subtle prescriptivist attitude they take toward any intentional attempt to change language in any way. If a change happens because a mistake becomes common enough that it isn't considered incorrect usage any more then prescriptivists will accept it, but if people intentionally try to make any change for any reason it violates the prescription of descriptivists. A true descriptivist should be indifferent to "artificial" changes, because they also occur naturally and trying to promote or suppress them would require a prescriptivist attitude in order to have any metric by which the attempted change is bad.

I would list examples of english being suboptimal but I don't want to get bogged down in irrelevant details. To take an extreme example of a bad language, consider marklar from South Park, which is english except all nouns are replaced with "marklar". It is virtually impossible to communicate complicated ideas in marklar, so it's a bad language.

Can someone help me munchkin my diet? The main thing is I hate eating anything mushy. It's easier to describe with examples. The limit around the consistency of ice cream: frozen hard-serve is good, but liquid or soft-serve is bad. Peanut butter is fine. Scrambled eggs are fine. Cheese is fine except feta cheese which I don't even want to look at. I don't mind chewy / crispy / hard / crunchy. I don't like sauces.

The other main thing is I'd almost always rather eat the ingredients of something than eat them together. Texture is much more important than flavor but I usually don't like strong flavors except for salty and sweet. I do eat meat but after a recent Rationally Speaking I've cut back because of ethical doubt of the morality of it. I have less objections to humanely raised/slaughtered animals but I don't know where to go to find it and it might be expensive. Also less objection to fish but fish also tends to be more expensive. The only hard requirement I made for myself is that I won't eat anything at least as intelligent as a dog, so no pork.

My food preferences are different enough from the general population that I can't easily find balanced healthy stuff because it's all geared toward the general population. Currently I'm not eating healthily at all and I'm bored with eating the same old stuff.

Related...ly, I'm also trying to lose weight so any strats on effective dieting would be appreciated, especially if scientifically supported. In particular I'm finding calorie logging mildly inconvenient and although it's a small obstacle it's apparently enough that I haven't done it enough for it to accomplish anything.

PS: If there's a word for people like me I'd love to know it. My cousin is the only person I've met with my food preferences.
