And the point I made in response was, /would people really notice?/

I mean, to give a bit of a silly example, if you go to a bar, you are going to notice the other people in the bar. But you aren't going to notice the people who are not in the bar. You're not going to go "Oh person X who has never visited a bar before isn't in this bar, how odd!" You wouldn't even know that person X exists.

If asexual aromantic people act in ways that are staggeringly different from sexual romantic people, the two groups may not even hang out in the same locations. And if you don't meet with people from the other group, how would you notice them acting differently?
