I'm going to go with "Lust". Most people are productive for the sole purpose of having sex. Exercise = getting a hotter body. Work = getting more money/power/fame to be more popular and get more sex.

(I mean, yes, they will dress it up and say it's for love and romance, but that's just sex with gift wrapping.)
