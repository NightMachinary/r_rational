  I'm aware that evolution has coded a lot of other desires and motivations into us, but most of these are satisfied plenty by TV/Internet/etc. And at the end of the day, sex is going to be the major contributor for most people. Why? Simple natural selection: people who have sex reproduce more than people who don't have sex. So you end up with more people with sex-related behaviors encoded into them by evolution.

Humans are K-selective. We don't put our effort into breeding a lot, we put it into raising a few very expensive children. Having lots of sex doesn't help any if your children are going to die during the next long winter, and human kids take a huge amount of time and effort in comparison with other species.

So there's a whole component of "take care of your kids and make sure that they survive" that you're missing, even if you want to reduce things like greed, pride, etc. down to their evolutionary "purpose", because there's this whole other half of human reproductive strategy (and, I would argue, the more important half in humans given the profile of our species).
