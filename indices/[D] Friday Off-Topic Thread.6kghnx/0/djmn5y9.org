Guys, seriously, LANGUAGE IS WEIRD. It is a SUPER POWER TECHNOLOGY. I didn't realise it until I had a moment the other day.

OK, I'm trying to learn French, right? So one of the things I do is listen to a couple of french language news podcasts. Because I'm a language learner, I usually find myself struggling to understand, I feel like my comprehension is a few words behind the actual content of the podcast.

Then the other day I was listening to podcasts while cooking and all of a sudden THIS KNOWLEDGE TELEPORTED INTO MY BRAIN. Instead of concentrating on deriving meaning from this podcast, I was just standing there making noodles and information about an [[https://www.thelocal.it/20170626/mini-pompeii-found-in-rome-while-digging-metro-line][archaelogical find during a Roman metro construction]] was just INSIDE MY HEAD. I KNEW it, magically.

And then I realised... this is what language DOES. It's what it's FOR. That matrix scene where he goes "I know kung-fu"? THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT LANGUAGE DOES.

I know it's not a huge revelation but I had such a visceral response to it, and I feel like people DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW AMAZING LANGUAGE IS NOW.

Also it means that my passive French practise isn't going to waste, which is pretty cool, eh.
