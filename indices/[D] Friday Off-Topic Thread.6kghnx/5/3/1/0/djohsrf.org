You're right, I was speaking from a sort of sarcastic/derisive headspace. Problem is, I find it hard to describe in more accurate words the gross simplifications some people resort to in their thought process to handle the world (I in my own suffer this, right?).

Separately, dehumanization isn't a necessary part of being less sentient, in a meta-ethical sense. I'm not sure what the current sense in the rational community is on the humanity of those who are less mentally capable or those lacking in capacities to experience sentience. I didn't think that I was dehumanizing people just by judging them to be lacking in some capacities.
