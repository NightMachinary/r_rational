  And the root cause of most bigotry is ignorance and thus we need to work to counteract ignorance as best we can
#+end_quote

I often hear this opinion, and I disagree. It's not that simple. My father works in construction, so he spends most of his time working with immigrants, legal or not. He knows more about the history and culture of Maghreb and Middle-Eastern people than anyone I know. He actually knows the differences between Sunni and Shia Islam (while I usually have to look them up on wikipedia).

He's also one of the most prejudiced people I personally know. Some of his prejudice can be attributed to irrational emotion (the whole "the economy is wrong, someone must be to blame" dynamic); some of it to what I see as legitimate causes, like the fact that he personally sees and is complicit in the abusing by immigrants of the French social system (most of his employees will only work undeclared, because doing so allows them to get both a tax-free salary and unemployment subsidies).

My point is, there isn't a single information I or anyone I know has that my father doesn't, and yet he strongly dislikes arabs. Maybe most of bigotry is caused by ignorance, and he's an exception. But I suspect for most people, the pattern is the same: it's not as simple as a lack of information, it's a different outlook. People can have the same information, but different priors; we're more likely to see the things we already believe, to discard the medias that disagree as biased, etc.
