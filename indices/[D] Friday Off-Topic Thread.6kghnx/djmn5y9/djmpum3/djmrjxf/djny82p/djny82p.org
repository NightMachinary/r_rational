Not OP but as someone who spent seven years in chorus throughout schooling (voluntarily) and sang in various languages (german, french, latin, and chinese, primarily), we were taught the meaning of the words and it didn't seem to negatively affect my enjoyment -- though, this may well be because the background in choir gave me the means to see the voice as another instrument /anyway/.
