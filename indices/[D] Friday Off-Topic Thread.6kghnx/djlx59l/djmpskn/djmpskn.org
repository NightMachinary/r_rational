So this will be an open world roguelike? I really like the entire concept of this game, I'm a sucker for complex systems that treat the player and NPCs equally. The hardest thing to pull off will be level generation, did you flesh that out at some point? I've never played a roguelike that completely pulls off compelling area design, though I'm sure some games exist that come close-ish.
