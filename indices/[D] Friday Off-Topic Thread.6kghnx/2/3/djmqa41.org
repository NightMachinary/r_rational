  So I was thinking about how an intelligent alien species might succumb to worse versions of that in different ways, essentially getting to a certain stage of scientific/industrial development and then filtering themselves out because they hijack their own drives. This wouldn't necessarily be to the level of extinction, just to the level of not making it very far into space.

One of the interesting questions here is: what do we mean by "making it very far into space"? Von Neumann probes? Because of necessity, those actually have to be kinda smallish while moving through interstellar space, so as to take up less energy on acceleration and reduce chances of colliding with space debris en route.

But then, if you're using Von Neumann Probes, /whom/ can you somehow carry, and how (and how safely)?

Going further on this would spoil /Existence/ for you, though ;-).
