I've lately been thinking about the intersection of diet/exercise and [[https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/fermi-paradox][the Fermi paradox]].

To my way of thinking, the obesity epidemic is mostly caused by market forces finding the chinks in the dietary reward systems of the human body. Part of it is calorie/satiation mismatching, part of it is hedonism, part of it is things being made less healthy in order to get them cheaper, but the end result is a lot of people having to devote considerable effort and willpower to staying healthy.

So I was thinking about how an intelligent alien species might succumb to worse versions of that in different ways, essentially getting to a certain stage of scientific/industrial development and then filtering themselves out because they hijack their own drives. This wouldn't necessarily be to the level of extinction, just to the level of not making it very far into space.

(This domain overlaps a bit with wireheading and drug addiction, but the latter isn't a threat to civilization and the former doesn't seem like it would be either - but then again, humans aren't much of a space-faring race.)
