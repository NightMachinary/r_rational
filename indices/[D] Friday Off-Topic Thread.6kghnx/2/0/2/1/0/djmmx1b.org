Well, sole purpose is a bit of an exaggeration, but I believe it is true for most people. I would like to see the loads of scientific research that contradicts it.

I'm aware that evolution has coded a lot of other desires and motivations into us, but most of these are satisfied plenty by TV/Internet/etc. And at the end of the day, sex is going to be the major contributor for most people. Why? Simple natural selection: people who have sex reproduce more than people who don't have sex. So you end up with more people with sex-related behaviors encoded into them by evolution.

Now, you may not directly think about sex. For example, you could be fueled by greed or pride. But notice how being rich and successful helps you get more sex? That's evolution pulling your strings again, making you perform behaviors that increase the chances of you having sex.
