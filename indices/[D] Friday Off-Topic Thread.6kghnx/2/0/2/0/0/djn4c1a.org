  but I think people would have took serious notice were that the case.

Would it be that noticeable though? Asexual aromantic people could easily choose to stay away from other people, shutting themselves in their homes and just living out their lives with barely any human interaction. That would be staggeringly different from the sexual romantic people who keep hanging out with friends and going out on dates, but since the two groups of people would barely ever interact, how would the latter notice the former?
