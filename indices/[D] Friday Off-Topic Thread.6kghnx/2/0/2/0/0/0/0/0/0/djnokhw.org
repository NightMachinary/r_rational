How well would these work though? Are you just going to survey people? Get volunteers to talk about their lives? Read case studies on people? Because all of these methods have the same kind of major flaw: they are not going to notice the lack of asexual/aromantic people in their sample.

Because unless your large scale studies include major ethics violations, the people studied must all be doing so voluntarily. Since the asexual aromantic people are missing some of the major motivations for human interaction, it is entirely possible that they have staggeringly different behaviors that include not volunteering for scientific studies. So when the scientists look at their results, they won't notice this missing group of people with staggeringly different behaviors.
