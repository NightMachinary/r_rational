  Err... yes it would. That's literally what it means to have disproportionately small samples, they affect results. You can arrive at all kinds of erroneous conclusions when your sample is disproportionately small. And with a disproportionately small sample no proper scientific committee would even accept your study (because of the risk of said erroneous conclusions), so it would remain in obscurity and no one would notice.\\
  It does? Where can I find these large scale scientific studies on asexual aromantic subjects? I'm genuinely curious how they accomplished this. I can't imagine this being an easy task.

I wasn't talking about studies specifically on researching asexual aromantics just one's that happened to have them as subjects. People would notice the trends between sexuality and various other things because people will look for nearly any trends that exist in data.\\
You also said relationships were mainly about sex (though you seem to have somewhat weakened your statements since then) however that's just patently absurd because there are many romantic relationships which lack that. I mean there's a reason we're specifying asexual /and/ aromantic, however if the ultimate end goal was sex then there would be no reason to draw that distinction.

Similarly we aren't just looking for trends which would only be obvious in studies, if sex is the primary motivator for nearly everything then to see any asexual people acting normally ought to be utterly bizarre.

  I don't deny the existence of such people, I just find it unlikely that they form the majority. Sure plenty of people are career-focused, but when you ask them about their dreams, wouldn't they say things like rich, powerful, famous, and popular with women/men or have a beautiful wife/husband?

You're own statement contradicts the point you originally made. After all if being rich, powerful, etc are ultimately about sex then why the hell would anyone have dreams that aren't just being sexually successful? People seem to treat these goals way more seriously than you ought to expect if they were just a means to the end goal of sex. In fact I'm willing to bet if you hypothetically offered people the things they desire most (other than sex) with the caveat that they would have to be celibate, at least like a fourth of people would take the deal.\\
If sex is the end goal it really doesn't make sense how many people put more effort into their job or other non-sex things than they do into getting laid.

  Simple thought experiment: grab a random person, ask them why they do the things that they do. Keep asking why. (E.g. "Why do you work hard?" "Why do you want a promotion?" "Why do you want more money?" ...) Wouldn't they, at some point, say something along the lines of sex/romantic activities? Or something along the lines of having/raising children? I would be very surprised if the majority didn't.

The issue with this is that of course people have sex related goals involved but that doesn't imply that is the only thing they want, other things will certainly come up as well which they really shouldn't if the sex/reproduction is the end goal.

Another counterpoint is the birth rate in developed countries, if people really care so greatly about reproduction you shouldn't expect people to prioritise careers over it. Hell given how apparent it is that even when it comes to sex in general wealthier people are not more sexually successful, the idea that people's careers are primarily towards the goal of sex becomes even more questionable. People just aren't acting anything like you ought to expect if sex/reproduction was the primary goal, you really ought to expect the average number of sexual partners to be higher and/or for people to be having more kids.
