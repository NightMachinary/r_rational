  Even if they got a disproportionately small sample that wouldn't really affect my point about noticing these trends.

Err... yes it would. That's literally what it means to have disproportionately small samples, they affect results. You can arrive at all kinds of erroneous conclusions when your sample is disproportionately small. And with a disproportionately small sample no proper scientific committee would even accept your study (because of the risk of said erroneous conclusions), so it would remain in obscurity and no one would notice.

Not to mention a small sample could easily be flooded with false positives/negatives, since there are all kinds of incentives for people to lie about their sexuality.

  Since research containing asexual aromantic subjects already exists

It does? Where can I find these large scale scientific studies on asexual aromantic subjects? I'm genuinely curious how they accomplished this. I can't imagine this being an easy task.

  An obvious example would be those who pursue their careers to the exclusion of any personal relationships, or just anyone who continues to do things you predict they shouldn't when they are already in a relationship (that they're faithful to) and those actions aren't helping them maintain the relationship in some way.

I don't deny the existence of such people, I just find it unlikely that they form the majority. Sure plenty of people are career-focused, but when you ask them about their dreams, wouldn't they say things like rich, powerful, famous, and *popular with women/men* or have a *beautiful wife/husband*?

Simple thought experiment: grab a random person, ask them why they do the things that they do. Keep asking why. (E.g. "Why do you work hard?" "Why do you want a promotion?" "Why do you want more money?" ...) Wouldn't they, at some point, say something along the lines of sex/romantic activities? Or something along the lines of having/raising children? I would be very surprised if the majority didn't.
