Even if they got a disproportionately small sample that wouldn't really affect my point about noticing these trends. Because provided they still get some (which we know they do) they would still notice these things. Since research containing asexual aromantic subjects already exists it just strains credulity to try to make this sort of massive claim about easily observable behaviors (well in the context of studies at least).\\
Moreso however the idea that most people's behavior is directly motivated by desires for romance/sex seems extremely suspect because people frequently seem to care far more about these "instrumental goals" than they do about the sex which you think is the real end goal here. An obvious example would be those who pursue their careers to the exclusion of any personal relationships, or just anyone who continues to do things you predict they shouldn't when they are already in a relationship (that they're faithful to) and those actions aren't helping them maintain the relationship in some way.
