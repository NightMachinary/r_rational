I see what you're saying and that's definitely true. But I'm not really attempting to assert (though I may have come off that way, I'm not totally certain) that knowledge is a surefire cure or that it will always work. There's always going to be people who feel a certain way even when they have legitimate textbook's worth of information on an issue.

I'm moreso asserting that, on average, it's much easier to be racist or discriminatory in general when you are ignorant. Being ignorant means you can't properly filter out information and are even more vulnerable to things like widespread media and stereotypes. By taking away ignorance, I believe we'll have a significant decrease in the amount of prejudice in the world because so much of it is founded on plain misinformation/lack of information/lack of understanding.

EDIT: Bad as it may sound, I don't personally feel that the sort of racism your Dad expresses is unjustified as long as he keeps it in a /specific context/. Which is generally hard to do with something as emotionally embedded as prejudice.
