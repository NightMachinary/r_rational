I'm sorry, I'm not trying to play with words here, but I'm pretty sure "less human" and "dehumanizing" have different connotations.

I /do/ mean that this kind of interaction from this type of people /does/ make them less human (communication and reasoning make humans people and sentient, respectively, right?), but that doesn't disenfranchise from the ethical and legal treatment granted to a human (so this statement isn't meant to be totally dehumanizing in a sense). According to the international consensus on human rights, one cannot agree to give away one's human rights, so I adventure that mostly civil behavior should not do that either: I'm not advocating dehumanization, only a more invasive, less placating approach to the dumbness people are allowed to approach public discourse and the expression of faulty opinions.
