Had a discussion with one of my friends; he tried to convince me that people only change when exposed to things so they can see and learn for themselves that their current beliefs are incorrect. For example, a racist would only change his beliefs by being exposed to and interacting with a black person. I pointed out that there are plenty of people that interact with black/asian/gay/trans/liberal/conservative people all of the time and still discriminate against them to some degree. We didn't stick on that topic long; the main thrust of the conversation was him arguing that discussion is pointless; he won't talk with someone who's "set in their ways" about said ways because he feel discussion won't change their mind. I told him this rationalization was bullshit; even supposing that most people are that ignorant and pig headed (which they could be, I don't exactly have the numbers), there will still be a nonzero amount of people whose minds are open to being changed by discussion. And the root cause of most bigotry is ignorance and thus we need to work to counteract ignorance as best we can, i.e through discussion. Even if someone's mind isn't changed by one discussion (which it usually won't be, particularly for long held beliefs/values), your discussion can be a part of their evolution as a person.

The argument went back and forth in circles of varying size. He eventually settled on agreeing that some people can probably be changed by discussion but he's still going to hedge his bets and avoid discussing those topics with those "set in their ways" types of people because the probabilty of him changing their minds is really low. I conceded that it was his choice and our discussion went on in a similar, though less confrontational, vein.

I'm honestly not too sure why I posted this; I supposed just to sort of mini-vent. I guess, for the sake of it, I'll also ask you guys: how important do you think discussion is, particularly to helping to cure bigotry and discrimination and general ignorance? I think it's vital. And that it should be immediately obvious that it's vital.
