Ok, that's some good information. I guess another important variable is how much you're willing to cook for yourself, which helps a lot with this sort of thing. One strat that I have found well (though it seems not to work for you) is counting calories. If you can bring yourself to do it, it makes you much more aware of how much you eat in a day, and causes some calorie-optimization even if you don't set goals for yourself.

One strategy is to identify times when you eat high-calorie-count food that doesn't satiate very well. Examples of this are things like potato chips or soda. These items don't satisfy or fill you up significantly (though they are quite fun to eat) which means they make bad snacks if you're hungry. There are a lot of healthy snacks you can use to replace these. In terms of stuff that is not soft and homogenous, snack items that I eat in place of these tend to be things like:

- Bags of shaved carrots / baby carrots [[http://i.imgur.com/DNxvJrz.png][(image)]]. Advantages: no prep time, crunchy, low calories. Disadvantages: refrigeration needed if you want to store long term, not salty, not very sweet
- Pacific Gold snack pack beef jerky [[http://i.imgur.com/0h6EAUj.png][(image)]]. Advantages: no prep time, salty, low(ish) calories, filling. Disadvantages: is meat, not sweet, quite chewy
- Pure Protein brand protein bars [[http://i.imgur.com/ShUIPk2.png][(image)]]. Advantages: very dense/filling, sweet, kinda sorta like a chocolate bar or something if you squint. Disadvantages: not as homogenous, very very dense so it needs water, not actually like a chocolate bar, even if you do squint.

In general, the best strat for healthy eating is to have planned or ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals. Some ingredients that are useful to keep around: chicken breasts (frozen or refrigerated), rice or instant rice, and a variety of veggies edible cooked (such as broccoli, carrots, asparagus, etc). An example meal that is relatively easy to make, would be a chicken breast (baked, pan-seared, or cooked sous vide) accompanied by some veggies browned in a pan, like handful or two of broccoli or something, and rice.

The real next-level strat is to cook your weekday chicken on Sunday, then put it into tupperware containers. Each weekday for dinner, you put some rice in the rice cooker (though you can also cook it on Sunday if you want), heat up your vegetable choice in a pan, and microwave the chicken to reheat it. If you also pre-cooked your rice, you can have dinner ready to go in like 5-10 minutes by microwaving the rice and chicken to reheat them, while sauteeing the broccoli. We call this the "meal prep Sunday" strat and it is widely used by people who are trying to gain muscle or lose fat or both. By measuring out your dinners you can get exactly what you want calorically while still having filling foot.

If you don't eat breakfast, you should eat breakfast. Being overhungry at lunch and overeating is a problem that can be avoided this way. Also, some say that your metabolism only gets started buring calories after your first meal or exercise in a day. What I do for breakfast is have some boiled eggs ready to go, and have two of those with a piece of toast and either some cherry tomatoes or a baby cucumber. All this food can be eaten with hands if you have a napkin and is quick and filling. Two boiled eggs, a piece of toast, and a couple vegetables will be filling and good.

I personally also pack all my lunches and choose all my snacks carefully. I make sure the items available to me are filling for their calorie content, even if they're not necessary healthy, like the protein bars. This way, if I get hungry around 4 pm or something, I can have one of those. Lastly, I typically have a shake after my workout, made with protein powder, milk, yogurt, and banana. These things are smaller calorie consumptions but worht mentioning.

So in general, I'd say your main goal should be to make it so that your food at hand is highly satiating for its calorie level. Things like preparing meals ahead of time will make it so that the easy choice is the healthy choice, too. In terms of separating food types, your best bet is the "seperately cooked chicken breast, rice, and broccoli" strat. You can sub in carrots or zucchini (though that's a little watery) asparagus or something for the broccs too. This way, the three items on your plate are cooked separately and are distinct.

An ideal day in meals for me, then, that you would also be able to use:

- Breakfast: 2 boiled eggs, a piece of toasted bread, and a handful of cherry tomatoes - 300 kcal

- Lunch: 1 chicken breast, a half-cup of rice, and broccoli - 700 kcal

- Snack: 1 protein bar - 200 kcal

- Dinner: 1 chicken breast, a half-cup of rice, and sauteed vetables - 700 kcal

- Post-workout: Shake containing 1 banana (frozen), 0.5 cups of greek yogurt, 30g of protein powder, 10z of fat free milk - 400 kcal

- 

  - I use AMP Wheybolic extreme protein powder, but any protein powder that's like, just the powder without a bunch of sugar and crap is good. GNC is good. Avoid Muscle Milk, it has sugar and stuff in it. You're looking for a powder where a 30 gram scoop gives you 1-2 grams each of carbs and fat, and 22-25 grams of protein.

This comes out to about 2300 kcal/day, pretty close to recommended daily value for calore intake. Things I vary on a day-to-day basis so that I don't get too bored of the food include the protein source (sometimes I use fish like tilapia, for example), the vetgetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, asian broccoli, bok choi, etc all make apearances) and the rice (sometimes I use brown rice, sometimes potatoes, sometimes quinoa.

The toughest part is having all this stuff on hand and being displined about planning out my week on Sunday. Assuming I actually do so and put everything in the tupperware, it's relatively easy to follow through.
