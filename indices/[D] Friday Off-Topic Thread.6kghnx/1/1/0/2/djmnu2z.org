  I don't currently object to milk or eggs but I'm not aware of the conditions of cows raised for milk or chickens raised for eggs so maybe I shouldn't be as optimistic about how humane their conditions are as I am.

Yeah, it's pretty awful. I don't want to go on a vegan rant but if you have questions I can find you the appropriate vegan propaganda.

This website looks like a good starting point for information: [[http://considerveganism.com/]]

Impactful quote:

  if everyone simply removed seafood, chicken, and eggs from their diet, 99.7% of the total number of animals killed for food each year would be spared. Of course, this would also mean that the remaining 0.3%---403 million animals---would still be killed each year for food. However, the point remains: when looking purely at the number of animals killed, the most impactful single change that omnivores could make would be to remove seafood from their diet, followed by removing chicken meat, followed by removing eggs.
