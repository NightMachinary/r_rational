I'd rather eat the ingredients of a salad than mix them up first. I like most fruit and some vegetables. It's mostly the heterogeneous property that I dislike. I don't mind things like cookies or goldfish which are mixed up enough that they seem homogeneous to the human tongue even though botanically / chemically they aren't.

I've never really tried milkshakes. I did try Soylent once but I didn't like the taste. They might have worked on the flavor since then. I haven't kept track. I like the idea of Soylent, eating/drinking it to ensure I have enough of everything and eating other foods only for pleasure (within dietary reason).

I don't currently object to milk or eggs but I'm not aware of the conditions of cows raised for milk or chickens raised for eggs so maybe I shouldn't be as optimistic about how humane their conditions are as I am.
