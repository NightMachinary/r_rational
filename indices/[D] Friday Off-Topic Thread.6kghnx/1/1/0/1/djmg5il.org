  I did try Soylent once but I didn't like the taste. They might have worked on the flavor since then.

I recently started eating Soylent (v1.8 powder), and adding things makes a /huge/ difference.

My original strategy (of mixing it then drinking some) tasted about like grainy pancake batter. My current strategy (mix 3 tbsp cocoa and 6 tbsp strawberry margarita syrup into a 2 l batch, and let it sit in the fridge for two hours first) is much better, and tastes like an okay milkshake.
