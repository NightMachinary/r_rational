As I understand it, you think the state of affairs is roughly: "we (society) have ownership of the language - we are responsible for it's maintenance, and with effort can make it better (or worse)."

This is probably the most common American understanding of language... I think the quote is "Stop trying to make 'fetch' happen. [we don't want it, and this works a bit like a democracy] It is not going to happen.".
