Another example is the rules for punctuation in quoting.

Alice: What did Joe say, Bob?

Bob: He said "I am here?"

Two possibilities: Joe declared "I am here." and Bob asked whether that was what he said, or Joe asked the question "I am here?" and Bob declared that that was what Joe said.

Also there should just be a clearly separate open quote and close quote symbol so you don't have to have silly alternation of single and double quotes for increasingly nested quotations.
