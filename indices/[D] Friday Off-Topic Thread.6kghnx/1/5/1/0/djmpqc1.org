Don't we? I know straight quotes (" ') tend to be more common on the internet and simple text editors, but every feature complete word processor I've ever used has had curly quotes (“ ” ‘ ') inserted automatically. Alternating open and close symbols help make things more clear, but isn't technically necessary, in the same way that there's the sometimes-used convention of alternating parentheses () and brackets [] for very long mathematical equations.
