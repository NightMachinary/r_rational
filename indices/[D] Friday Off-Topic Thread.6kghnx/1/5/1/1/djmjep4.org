#+begin_quote
  clearly separate open quote and close quote symbol Agreed.

  Alice: What did Joe say, Bob?

  Bob: He said "I am here?"

  Two possibilities: Joe declared "I am here." and Bob asked whether that was what he said, or Joe asked the question "I am here?" and Bob declared that that was what Joe said
#+end_quote

It took me a while to understand how the first possibility could come to be. You should phrase that better, something like, `Joe declared `I am here.' and Bob asked Alice (I was putting `Joe' here) whether that was what he said'.

However in this case I thought the punctuation rules were already clear. That is,

#+begin_quote
  Bob: He said "I am here?"
#+end_quote

Vs

#+begin_quote
  Bob: He said "I am here" ?
#+end_quote

Ah but to be totally consistent, the first one should be:

#+begin_quote
  Bob: He said "I am here?".
#+end_quote
