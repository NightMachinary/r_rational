A simple example is consistent rules for spelling and pronunciation.

Inflammable and flammable mean the same thing.

Ambiguity between inclusive and exclusive or.

The whole "literally" argument. I accept that it has been used figuratively for centuries but it annoys me that I might have to use the phrase "literally literally" someday to avoid ambiguity and that the phrase "literally literally" can still technically be taken figuratively if figurative usage of the word literally is also one of its definitions. Similarly, the phrase "a million" is also often used figuratively but that doesn't mean that "a large amount" is a definition. The definition is 10^{6} (or if you like Peano axioms, the successor to 999,999), and that definition can be applied either literally or figuratively.

It occasionally comes up that there are no [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence][escape sequences]] in english. You can't verbally say the following sentence without it meaning that you intend it seriously: "I am 100% serious that I am not joking and that I intend to murder the king of france regardless of my tone of voice or the context in which I say this sentence or what I have said or done before speaking this sentence or what I intend to say or do after it or what I actually say or do after it and regardless of whether I am quoting someone else who said this sentence before me."

That's a silly example but there are examples of where escape sequences would make a sentence more clear without making it overly convoluted. I just don't remember them right now.

This is nitpicky, but last time I checked, the dictionary still defines a paradox as (roughly) "something inherently self-contradictory or something that seems like a paradox" which means by recursion that anything that has any nonzero similarity to a paradox is a paradox, which is silly.
