I am indifferent whether we keep the word literally without the figurative definition or come up with an alternative.

Most of the time we are good enough at disambiguating, whether it's about the word literally being used figuratively or otherwise. Additional context cues for what someone means are a good thing. They can help when someone has an accent or is talking over a bad phone connection or is talking while the listener is distracted, etc.

The burden of proof is sometimes unfairly put on claims that something is ambiguous. Consider the "bag of words" model of grammar. Most simple sentences in english are unambiguous regardless of word order. It's not trivial to come up with an example of a bag-of-words sentence being unclear even in context and with tone of voice.

Escape sequences: "[Word-indicating-this-sentence-is-not-serious] I intend to murder the king of france blah blah blah." Or some other word order. Maybe as an adverb before the word "intend". I haven't thought about it in detail. Most of the time it's not necessary.
