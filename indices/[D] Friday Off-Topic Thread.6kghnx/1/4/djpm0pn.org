  A true descriptivist should be indifferent to "artificial" changes, because they also occur naturally and trying to promote or suppress them would require a prescriptivist attitude in order to have any metric by which the attempted change is bad.

It's interesting that I have a completely different perspective to you. I've never seen the "(most) descriptivists" that you describe. Instead, all the people I know that have a position on the issue are either complete historical prescriptivists or are in my opinion true descriptivists (ie. "I don't care about how the language changes, I just want dictionaries to say how people actually use the words instead of historical definitions").

I think the issue comes in when the method - usually dictionaries - that prescriptivists want to use to control the language is the tool that descriptivists want to use to describe the language. So what you perceive as caring about "artificial" changes, I see as wanting to accurately describe what the language is.
