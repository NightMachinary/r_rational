In Spain, the RAE (Real Academia Espa√±ola) is the state authority that defines language. They currently take only a descriptivist role, although with some time lag from when new usages enter the language.

People mock/laugh about changes that make the language easier. There is a culture of disdaining people who break official "Language rules". There is also a relatively recent history of imprisoning people for speaking regional languages. But now that those regional languages are institutionalized, they have their own correctness zealots.

My point is that teaching new rules in schools and instilling a culture of "speaking properly" is probably enough.
