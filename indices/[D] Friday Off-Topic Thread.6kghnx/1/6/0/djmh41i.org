I don't distinguish much between different meals. I could be wrong but I think that it's more a problem of too many calories overall and possibly some missing nutrients (out of ignorance of nutrition) than too much of a particular thing.

I'm not very mindful of quantitative data on what I eat so I'll just give a vague overview of what's common.

I eat way too much candy but I already know that's bad. I eat frozen apple cider sometimes (I highly recommend it in moderation). A chicken breast is a common most-of-a-meal. Three peanut butter crackers are a common substitute for meat. For some reason I always eat them in threes. Waffles are not uncommon for breakfast. I've been eating a lot of grapes and strawberries over the past few months. I probably average about three apples a day and a small potato a day. A couple times a week I'll get McDonalds fries. I've been trying to get myself to eat more vegetables but in any given moment that I want something crunchy I'd rather have dry-crunchy crackers than wet-crunchy vegetables so I end up eating more crackers, goldfish or premium. Now and then I'll have salmon, which I like a lot but it's a bit expensive.

That's about as accurate an overview as I can give right now.
