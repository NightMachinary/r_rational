*Synopsis*

All across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

This story has died a few times under the weight of perfectionism and uncertainty, so consider this the beginning of an extended test run: I have a couple of months' worth of updates written already (with updates twice weekly) and I plan to finish another 26,000-30,000 words over the next two or three weeks. At that point, I'll take a step back, keep releasing material, and see how you like it.

I'm doing some things that I haven't done before and taking some risks, but left to my own devices I will eventually convince myself that what's gold is lead and that I should stop spinning my straw at all, so I'm going to stop that bad train in its tracks and let you be the judges. I am a font of ideas, so ultimately I don't just want to write, but to write something that people enjoy.

Let me know what you think, and thank you all for your part in making this subreddit what it is.
