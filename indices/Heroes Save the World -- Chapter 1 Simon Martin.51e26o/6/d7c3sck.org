I really enjoyed this, and I'm looking forward to reading. Let me know if you need a beta reader :).

One very minor thing that stuck out to me was the following:

#+begin_quote
  He can already imagine some evil, corrupt, sixty-year-old Simon playing games with his current self, somehow stacking things up so that he, in the present, never saw any hint of it, or maybe even leaving hints in visions that led him to do things that ended up turning him into that evil Simon. Nor is he immune to foolishness.
#+end_quote

The final sentence there seems out of place to me, as a short alternative following a pretty involved description. Even just making it a full sentence rather than a fragment (so, not starting with "nor") would improve things I think.
