Good start.

A couple of thoughts:

#+begin_quote
  He isn't doing a particularly good job.
#+end_quote

I would remove or shorten this sentence. Show don't tell as the saying goes. You have the setup, we can tell Simon isn't paying attention by the very next action.

#+begin_quote
  At first he thought that he was still dreaming, but then he realized that he'd never...
#+end_quote

You don't need "and then he realized". This is easily inferred, and the shorter sentence is stronger. You can also remove the repetition of the word "dreaming/dreamed": "At first he thought he was still asleep, but he'd never dreamed lucidly before.

#+begin_quote
  He's smart, yes, but smart enough to realize...
#+end_quote

This may be a stylistic choice, but I don't like the "yes" here. Sounds a little strange, like the narrative is in need of affirming itself. "He's smart, but is he smart enough to realize..." Reads much better to me.

#+begin_quote
  but in the back of his mind a stray thought goes, But they're kind of turning out that way.
#+end_quote

Starting with the second "But", the thought should probably be italicized.

I swear I saw a word missing a letter somewhere, but on a re-read I can't find it.

Watch your tenses. Sometimes we are in present, sometimes in past.
