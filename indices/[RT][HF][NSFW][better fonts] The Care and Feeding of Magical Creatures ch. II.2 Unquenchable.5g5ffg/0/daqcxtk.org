  With the softness of her breasts to distract me, it takes a second for the weirdness to register, and even then I have to shift my hand around *a bit to be sure, to make sure* I'm not just missing something.
#+end_quote

The bolded part is a bit redundant, with the two 'sure' phrases. I would suggest either dropping 'a bit to be sure' and the comma or just the 'to be sure'. The sentence flows better that way, in my opinion.

#+begin_quote
  “I'm not human. Not built like you. Don't need anything to pump my ichor around. I do have a heart, it's not a human heart, but it's yours.”
#+end_quote

D'aww!

...though that does raise the question of what ichor is even /for/, if not for carrying nutrients around.

#+begin_quote
  She's a monster and she sought me out *in what was compared to this place this heart of hell* because she was looking for another monster.
#+end_quote

This one's a bit hard to parse. The bold part especially seems unfinished. Is 'this place' supposed to be 'compared' to the 'heart of hell'?

#+begin_quote
  She tries to move an arm out of my grip to comply, but I hold them fast and she looks at me, lusty but confused. “You have a tail.”
#+end_quote

Ah, the advantages of having extra prehensile appendages...

#+begin_quote
  One of the worst parts about being a succubus is that masturbation is just seriously underwhelming. Fuckin' ironic, right? But think about it - I can't exactly eat my own lust, can I?
#+end_quote

I don't see why not. You (the author) have already established that emotions can be produced without functional limit, and consuming them must give significantly more energy than creating them, or it wouldn't be over unity, especially considering what nectar can do.

Unless the emotions of succubi work differently from humans? That /would/ explain why succubi bother bonding with them instead of just feeding off each other.

#+begin_quote
  lovesick Hollow Hearts always do have a tough time eating but damn if I didn't work out some misplaced masochism there
#+end_quote

Are Hollow Hearts a subset of succubi or is it just another name for the species?

#+begin_quote
  Aren't I supposed to have some kind of upper limit on how horny I can get?
#+end_quote

Well, you /are/ a succubus.

#+begin_quote
  Later I'll look back at all this and understand what I'm doing now, all the lonely nights built up on one another, all the longing, wishing for someone in my bed with me, all the long years of desperation built up and weighing on this moment, the inevitable emotional necessity of making her desperate for me the way I've been desperate for her these many years before we can fuck, the need to see her need break her the way mine's broken me so many times, but right now all I know is that I need this like I'm dying of thirst and have never tasted water until now.
#+end_quote

Between this and the suicidal thoughts, I think I can guess the direction his character development is going to go.

#+begin_quote
  I'm gonna drool all over the raft with how much nectar my mouth is making. Swallow some, that helps, but now I have to get it together enough to form words...
#+end_quote

I wonder how nectar compares to saliva as a lubricant...

#+begin_quote
  I want to touch everything, grow a thousand hands and run them over every curve, grab her by the hips while I run my fingers through the folds of her desperate, dripping pussy, trace the lines of her wings, probe the adorable belly-button that heaves with her breath, just above the ground. Is this what tentacle porn is actually about? I could make use of a few hundred tentacles at the moment.
#+end_quote

Seeing as how magic, shapeshifting, and souls are a thing, it wouldn't surprise me if there was a way to accomplish this.

#+begin_quote
  I don't understand how, but I can feel it: to her, this is love.
#+end_quote

Hmm. Is this a trait of succubi, or because she's bonded to a guy who's into BDSM? I would think it'd be the latter; it would limit their food supply rather severely otherwise. Unless succubi breed slowly enough that they can afford to be picky?

Or, wait--

#+begin_quote
  God dammit yes I'm Hench yes not being allowed to cum makes me hot but I can still be fucking frustrated by it now, can't I. Sort of the point but ARGH!
#+end_quote

--hmm. This suggests a correlation. Is she into BDSM because she's in Hench, or in Hench because she's into BDSM? If the former, is it a learned behavior, genetic predisposition, or magic influence? Is there a House for every kink? Surely not, there'd need to be thousands.

#+begin_quote
  can I even get this to your mouth right now with how drunk your energy is making me? Soo-oh dark, yum... There is a dark river inside me, deep and black as night, bottomless and terrifying.
#+end_quote

The question here is whether BDSM makes the emotions 'taste' dark or if it's the human protagonist's self-loathing slipping through.

#+begin_quote
  Deep. So deep. Just too long. Just hurts, just a little, you're just a little too much for me.
#+end_quote

Barely fits, does he? Not too surprising, seeing as the story's suggested that both Lyra's body and personality were molded throughout her growth to be sexually and romantically appealing to the human protagonist.

#+begin_quote
  ...so hard...wheee!
#+end_quote

Lyra is /adorable/.

#+begin_quote
  tail wound crushingly tight around my thigh
#+end_quote

Huh. I'm surprised it can exert that much force.

Lyra's anatomy is /fascinating/ (no, not in that way; well, yes that way but also the other one). I'm looking forward to succubi biology class!

Also their culture and history and limbo and seraphim and Pandemonium and all the other worlds it's connected to and--

--by which I mean more worldbuilding, please!

#+begin_quote
  she's so wet it actually helps me last longer, keeping the feeling from being too intense
#+end_quote

...apparently, it works pretty well!

#+begin_quote
  after a moment we're both just gasping, shuddering with aftershocks.
#+end_quote

Excellent erotica. A+ gold star.

Focusing on the characters and their thoughts and feelings during instead of just the physical aspect was a good choice, in my opinion, since it gives the sex scenes narrative weight, and even someone who isn't into what the characters are doing can still appreciate the insights into their thoughts and personalities.

#+begin_quote
  “I love you too, Master.”
#+end_quote

About that. Not to kill the mood, but I recall Lyra mentioning earlier that she was only able to 'watch' the human protagonist when he was having sexual fantasies or doing things closely related. I don't know about you, but someone basing their entire opinion of me on just that wouldn't get a very accurate picture at all.

Not that the human protagonist is much better, really. For all that Lyra seems pretty great, he's known her less than a day. I guess in his case it can be partly blamed on how American culture treats the word 'love'. And that he went through like a dozen hair's-width-from-death experiences with her over the course of a few hours. And that his social support network had recently been obliterated.

Or did the same process that molded Lyra's body and personality also make her fall in love with him? I kinda hope not. That sort of mental manipulation is rather horrifying, and it would probably do terrible things to the human protagonist's self-esteem.

Also, it doesn't really make sense for anyone else to call him 'Master', so if that was your plan to get around giving him a name, you're gonna need a different one.

Speaking of names, now that they're not being chased by murderfuck spambots or WMDs in the form of angels and have sated their sex drives (temporarily, I'm sure), Lyra can tell the human protagonist her original name!

(You thought I'd forgotten about that, didn't you? Thought I was bested so easily? Never! Mwahahaha!)

I could probably fill a couple more pages with questions about and comments on the previous chapters, but I'll give you the chance to kick off the world building proper before I bury you in my curiosity =P

Looking forward to the next chapter!
