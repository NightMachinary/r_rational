Hrm. Let's see. What other entities were mentioned in this chapter...

Well, succubi and humans, obviously, but unless Lyra actually /is/ as evil as the human protagonist's (fuck it, that's too long; he's Jack now) as Jack's former religion would have him believe, it's not either of them.

There's the 'devil' and 'the Christian god'. Lyra doesn't seem to think the former exists, but the latter...

  I think the Christian God's kind of a bastard if he's anything like people describe

So she hasn't /met/ him, but that would mean he exists to meet in the first place. A 'maybe', then. What else is there...

There're the stars, which are apparently sapient enough to have language. Unless 'language of the stars' means the language of the interstellar community or something. The former /could/ technically count, I guess, though stars can't really use anything heavier than iron for fuel so I'm not sure they'd be much of a threat.

Lyra mentions Sade again, but I can't imagine succubi having any sort of positive relationship with a paperclipper based on what Lyra has told us about them.

Perfekti? No, they feed on zealotry, and zealot-capable life needs too many resources for them to count. They didn't seem to have the capability to be paperclippers anyway.

Lyra mentions a 'seed-ghost', though from the context it sounds more like a possibly-somewhat-sentient equivalent to DNA

I'm not seeing anything else that looks like it could be the name of an entity.

Or, wait, you didn't use invisitext, did you? That'd be /incredibly/ annoying.
