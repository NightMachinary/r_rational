Nope, no invsitext. It's one of the options you mentioned, I'm realizing just /how/ oblique the reference was, and it's not necessarily an /evil[1]/ paperclipper. Just, you know, single-minded.

Also it doesn't make /paperclips/, obviously.

However, my /real/ reason for replying here is to thank you for alerting me to the following very important orthographic error:

#+begin_quote
  I think the Christian God's kind of a bastard if he's anything like people describe
#+end_quote

Fixed version (to be seen in the text after tonight's deploy):

#+begin_quote
  I think the Christian God was kind of a bastard if he was anything like people describe
#+end_quote

[1] inimical to the short- and long-range utility functions of the protagonists.

EDIT: Well, holy fuck. Reread your comment and realized I've actually in this tale got /two/ god-level paperclippers and both are number-indefinite due to being semi-swarm intelligences. One's kind of incompetent and has only really been met in fully-grown form the one time so far, though.
