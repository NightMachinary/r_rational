  General comment: You've missed an explicit-but-passing mention of a god-level paperclipper whose existence may update your understanding of certain plot, worldbuilding, and character developments.

Did I? Huh. What chapter was it in?

  I'm still waiting for a document on this rigorous delineation between genetic/environmental/developmental factors and mental manipulation everyone seems to be using.

Er... I think there's been a miscommunication here. I wasn't talking about 'normal' 'human' development. The way I understand the maturation of succubi based on what's in the story so far, once Lyra 'chose' the human protagonist and 'bonded' with him, her body and personality were shaped /by that/ through what I assume to be magical means to be more appealing to him.

Put another way, I'm worried that being bonded to him forced/forces her to fall in love with him.

Put a third way, would she have fallen in love with him if she had still watched all his fantasies and stuff but hadn't bonded with him?

  OR something really insane is going on and we don't have the whole story because one character considers it what-the-hell-is-water obvious while the other has no clue this could even be a factor...but that'd be weird.

Yes, I /do/ realize that there's a rather large gap in assumed knowledge between them and that there's lots of information the story hasn't revealed yet. I've tried to account for that as much as possible, but I make no claims as to my success.

  Oh it is so much worse than this. Stay tuned.
#+end_quote

Well, that's not ominous or anything.

  At the risk of sounding arrogant and/or obsessed I'll say that I've put a positively abnormal amount of worldbuilding into this work. So far, you haven't posed a question I haven't already considered...so, bring it. :)
