  Did I? Huh. What chapter was it in?

Romance language. In your defense, there were much more interesting things happening and it was very sneaky.

Apologies, one of my pet peeves seems to have escaped and run wild in an irrelevant circumstance. Although I'm acceptable with knots IRL I don't always do well binding things that don't on some level want to be tied up. It's been dealt with now.

I see also what I misconstrued in your speculation. Suffice to say we're hung up on the delta between what's been revealed, her maybe-maybe-not romanticised understanding thereof, and what I know of how succubi work. Let's see how this plays out after tomorrow's chapter, which is titled 'Wham Line' and pays off some of the worldbuilding striptease I've been doing.

There is a scene in [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765458/][Hogfather]] which has unaccountably not been youtubed yet, in which Death cracks his knuckles to the sound of what is apparently an entire forest being snapped in half. In lieu of a clever youtube reply, please imagine me doing this now.

Also I wanted to say seriously, thank you for the feedback and pondering. As an author replies like this make my life.
