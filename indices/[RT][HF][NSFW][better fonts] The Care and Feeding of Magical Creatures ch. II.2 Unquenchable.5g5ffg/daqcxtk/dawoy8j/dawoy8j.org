AAaaaaahahaha you've fallen into all of my traps!

I mean, ahem, thank you for this excellent and valuable feedback.

General comment: You've missed an explicit-but-passing mention of a god-level paperclipper whose existence may update your understanding of certain plot, worldbuilding, and character developments.

Specific comments:

  Huh. I'm surprised it can exert that much force.

Fun game: calculate grip and thrust forces necessary for a satisfying tail-job. Multiply by ~1.5m of tail between tip and portion that would wrap one's thigh.

  Or did the same process that molded Lyra's body and personality also make her fall in love with him? I kinda hope not. That sort of mental manipulation is rather horrifying, and it would probably do terrible things to the human protagonist's self-esteem.

I'm still waiting for a document on this rigorous delineation between genetic/environmental/developmental factors and mental manipulation everyone seems to be using. But yes, American treatment of the word 'love' is problematic at best, they've both experienced severed social ties leaving them alone with only each other, and near-death and/or shared traumatic experiences are shown to create strong emotional attachments.

/OR/ something /really/ insane is going on and we don't have the whole story because one character considers it [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/20/fiction][what-the-hell-is-water]] obvious while the other has no clue this could even be a factor...but that'd be weird.

  Speaking of names, now that they're not being chased by murderfuck spambots or WMDs in the form of angels and have sated their sex drives (temporarily, I'm sure), Lyra can tell the human protagonist her original name!

Oh it is so much worse than this. Stay tuned.

NB I have read a lot of Ursula K. LeGuin, why do you ask?

  I could probably fill a couple more pages with questions about and comments on the previous chapters, but I'll give you the chance to kick off the world building proper before I bury you in my curiosity =P
#+end_quote

At the risk of sounding arrogant and/or obsessed I'll say that I've put a positively abnormal amount of worldbuilding into this work. So far, you haven't posed a question I haven't already considered...so, bring it. :)
