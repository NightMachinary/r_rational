There are several reasons from that.

First, on an emotional level, Catherine and Hakram both view sacrifices as "that thing Praesi do to us sometimes when they feel like it", so it makes sense they'd be extremely against it on a gut level, for the same reasons people who frequently fought Orcs are extremely against necrophagia.

Second, human sacrifice has perverse incentives that war doesn't have. While Cat does sacrifice her soldiers, she's not happy to do it; all else being equal, she's always more likely to choose the path that leads to the least amount of her soldiers dying. As long as Cat cares about her soldiers, her incentive is to choose peace, or at least to choose the actions most likely to lead to peace on the long term.

On the other hand, human sacrifice and treating people as commodities has the opposite incentive curve. Praesi nobles have no incentive to reduce crime, poverty and corruption, since they all produce the death row inmates their sacrifices need. Praesi even have strong incentives to engineer civil wars, since those lead to the massive amounts of prisoners and sacrifices that they need to keep their crops going.

EDIT: Although, now that I think about it, Catherine does have perverse incentives herself, and the story hasn't talked about it yet. She started the civil war to get in a position of power. Every single time Heiress released demons, she won more power and loyalty from her followers. The Gallowborne wouldn't be nearly so loyal to her if she hadn't had Heiress to point them at.
