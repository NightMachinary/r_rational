  Cloak streaming behind me, I guided Zombie to the bottom of the marble steps and stared at the massive bronze gates.

  “Break,” I said.

  My Name flared even as the metal crumpled like parchment under my eyes, falling apart with a sound like a gong being struck. In the hall behind, two dozen soldiers stood shaking and pale.

  --------------

  A globe of air, the same magic he'd used early in the fight, formed around me. A heartbeat away from my feet touching the ground the air solidified, trapping me like a fly in amber.

  . . .

  “Break,” I croaked.

  For an instant all I felt was my will pushing against something infinitely larger. If the Duke had fought me, I grasped,  I would have been swept away by the tide effortlessly. But he wasn't fighting me. Magic was will, and his will was in the spears. The globe shattered, the Beast howling in approval. I'd been caught with my sword raised to strike and though the momentum had been blunted that was again how I began descending.
