There's a very half-hearted attempt by Cat to respond to this in text where she acknowledges that she's done awful things, will continue to do even worse things but she is drawing this arbitrary line anyway.

Gaining benefits from the deaths of those already condemned to death by the state seems far and away a morally superior action to starting a war in order to gain power in the process. In any context human sacrifice is one of those things you feel the need to flinch away from and label in the BAD column without any real consideration but I expected a little more from this story which has shown its willingness to explore the utility of actions normally considered Evil.
