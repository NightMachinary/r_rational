Something just feels wrong about her drawing the line at a specific kind of human sacrifice. She sacrificed thousands starting a war to move up the ranks. She personally sacrifices enemy soldiers to win a battle. She sacrifices her own soldiers to win. I feel like when she draws a line like that, it's a way of pretending that killing people in other circumstances isn't bad. That she doesn't have to worry about all the choices she makes as long as they don't cross the line.
