Let's take a look at most likely the only page where we see the actual [[http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/007/3682/19][demon cousine]]. It's a /soup/. Of course, it was also considered low-quality food, but it shows how they can eat processed food. Could humans be processed, fixing their "presentation"? Possibly.

On the other hand, demons /are/ interested in [[http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/001/3577/42][human meat]], not just the brain. So I see how it would be a problem for them.

Still. It's a feast of highest quality, and the [[http://mangastream.com/r/neverland/003/3625/9][best part of the child is their brain]]. However, considering that it's a feast for some eldritch horror, they might not accept anything below perfection...

In the end, we know too little of the demons to say for sure what, if any, damage to their meals they can accept.
