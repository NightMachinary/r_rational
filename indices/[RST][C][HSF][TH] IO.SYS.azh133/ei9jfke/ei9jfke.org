([deadpan] Yes, this has all been VR, and the simulation wetware is an author's brain. We'd normally be happy to learn from you, but resource limitations compelled us to skip some steps--you don't know anywhere near as much technological knowledge as your memories tell you you do. [/deadpan])

I'm contemplating the 'each bit' concept, and whether feasible; at the very least, I feel that the bits would have to pass a threshold of meaningful comprehension, before--for instance--incomprehensible 0s and 1s are interpretable as 'SOS' and drastically collapse the future decision tree all at once.

Or to put it another way, if 75% of your decision branches have you choosing to drink water, and 20% milk, is there going to be a timing when a single 1-versus-0 prunes away half the branches to leave a 40% milk distribution? That said, I like the information-limitation line of thought about the absolute requirements for an entity to choose between --that is, specify--one of many possible outcomes. By the time you're choosing the timing and the different reactions, though, isn't every moment a 1/0/[nothing] three-way interaction? Even if not waited for, opportune silence can also influence... but I'm overcomplicating things, easier to just think of the bits as [signal]/[silence]. But still, when you can choose your timing then all moments of silence are bits too, plus the influence/threshold needed to accomplish meaningful branch-distribution pruning, so I feel that the actual number of bits to halve something's outcome likeliness would always be far greater than 1..?

About the overall outlook, the 'Dark Forest' line of thought comes to mind--scarier in some ways in that all information transfer is suspect.

...hmm, maybe if you don't treat as involcing 'bits' any options which wouldn't end up having any behavioural changes, as though the brain's own limitations were collapsing inputs into the same output... well, there's still the butterfly effect brainwashing approach, granted... Hrm.
