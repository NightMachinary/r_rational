  Any universe containing a superintelligence that left Earth wouldn't be a universe containing the narrator.

I'm not certain that follows; it seems to presuppose that any superintelligence that left Earth would be of the consume-the-universe kind (which is not a bad estimate given the effort needed to leave Earth and what kinds of motivations are needed to expend that effort, but it doesn't cover the behavior space).

OTOH I might be misreading this, corrections are welcome.
