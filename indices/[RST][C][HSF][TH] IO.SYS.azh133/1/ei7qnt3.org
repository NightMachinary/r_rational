This was a great read! What a punchline, wow. Wouldn't a sim-runner who sees the AI advocate for destroying Earth be pretty unlikely to let him into reality, or is the hope that they see the logic and applaud the use of the Y-S Security Protocols? Also, if there really is an AGI on Earth, why would .2 think it's still confined there after all this time? Seems to me that destroying the planet either kills all/the vast majority of biohumans, or angers a hugely more powerful AI.
