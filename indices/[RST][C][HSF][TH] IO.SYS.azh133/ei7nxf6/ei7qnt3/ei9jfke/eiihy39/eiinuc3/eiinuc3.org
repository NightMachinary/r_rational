One of the writing tricks that's stuck in my memory is to think of some aspect of the setting that underlies an important part of the story - and then never actually mention it. If you do it right, then the hints that do get left can be reconstructed by the reader to support any of several theories, most of which you won't have thought up yourself. :)
