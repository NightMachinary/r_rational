I like how it's subtly possible that the main character is a simulation being run by the theoretical AI on Earth, who's trying to figure out what happened to the unhackable craft that was in orbit.

The setup is pretty unlikely (there's randomly an airgapped tablet left on the ship with a human level intelligence on it? That sounds like /someone's/ worst case scenario), and things keep on happening in a way that's both plausible but could also be the governing AI making sure the simulation matches observed reality - up to and including the main character's odd certainty that there's something to hide *from* in the first place.
