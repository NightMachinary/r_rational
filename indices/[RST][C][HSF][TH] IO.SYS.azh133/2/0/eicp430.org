I was surprised when I learned about Rowhammer attacks on RAM. And when I learned about Spectre attacks on predictive-branch CPUs. I figure that when dealing with a superintelligence, it's never the attacks you can think of that are the ones you have to worry about.

Put another way, a sufficiently advanced superintelligence could be indistinguishable from Worm's Simurgh, who could manipulate atmospheric conditions to flip a single, vital bit in a message in-transit.
