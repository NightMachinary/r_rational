Given that the whole protagonist spends the whole story in fear of Unfriendly AI, I had trouble thinking of any other notable name to drop alongside Schneier's, who is as noted for involvement with AI safety as Schneier is with general computer security.

For the other mention, the closest replacement quote I thought of was the classic "Listen, and understand. That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."; which while certainly emphasizing an AI's relentlessness, doesn't quite match the one I used for emphasizing the AI's lack of caring.

I only have so many writing tricks that I know well enough to use; one of them is to try to link different parts of a story together by repeating some element. It's not exactly Chekov's gun (which, when introduced in the first act, has to go off by the third), but like repeating the expressed desire to wake to reality at the start and end, or having a picture of each new moon show up as it's introduced, I think that in this case using Yudkowsky's name twice helps to strengthen the story rather than weaken it, even if only on a structural level. (Of course, my thinking that may only be a post-hoc rationalization which my subconscious created to defend what little social status I might have acquired against a perceived social threat, but the only reason I have this particular insight into my own potential motivations is because I've read some blog-posts by... well, you know. :) So feel free to ignore this particular parenthetical, as it risks adding enough levels of meta to boggle any sane mind (or my own). ;) )
