Hmmm... How about wishing for a talisman that returns to me every day/week/whatever, punching a hole through everything in its path. If someone steals it or forces me to relinquish it, it returns to me soon enough, and they better not be holding it when it returns unless they wish to lose a hand. I'd probably be hired (or coerced at the end of blade to enter into service of a noble) to be an assassin: a partner holds the talisman very carefully and aligns the talisman, the target, and myself.
