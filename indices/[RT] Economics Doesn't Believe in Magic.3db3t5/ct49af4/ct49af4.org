The argument is correct in that the nobles would desire total control over the amulets. However, it makes a mistake in assuming the nobles could gain total control.

Once the masses had amulets they would be hard-pressed to give them up. Any demand to give over the amulets or to only wish for what the nobles wanted would be met with rebellion.

Sure, the nobles would be able to buy many amulets, but they wouldn't be able to buy them all. And they couldn't force everyone to give up amulets - magic is a force equalizer that can make anyone dangerous. It doesn't matter how many protection amulets you have, all it takes is one unique spell to kill you.

One more thing: kingdom's don't exist in a vacuum. They are surrounded by other, potentially hostile, kingdoms. If a kingdom makes a unpopular policy it's a great excuse for another kingdom to invade and look like a savior to the people.
