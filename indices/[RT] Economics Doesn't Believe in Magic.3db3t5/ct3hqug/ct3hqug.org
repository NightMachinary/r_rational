Hey, neat! a dedicated response to something I posted :) It's pretty similar to the responses posted by him in the original thread, but still worth reading. I did intend to discourage excessive munchkinry through societal mores, like religion, and foreign polities (read: a crapsack world wouldn't be fun to play in, so I'd make a plausible-sounding explanation for "DM Fiat") but it's an interesting view of what could have happened, were I not setting up the world specifically for people to play in.
