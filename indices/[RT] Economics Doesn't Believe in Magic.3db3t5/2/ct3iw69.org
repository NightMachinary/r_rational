  This makes talismans into commodities, subject to all the usual rules of economics. This applies to all kinds of settings where magical is at all reliable (though sometimes it looks like labor rather than magical items).

  The common individual will never own a talisman, and the nobility will own millions. Individuals will be given very specific direction, on pain of death, as to what talisman they will be requesting and giving to the nobility. The age of granting is not 16, it is the youngest someone can reliably repeat their noble's order for a talisman. It's even younger in a failing state when the nobles get desperate.
