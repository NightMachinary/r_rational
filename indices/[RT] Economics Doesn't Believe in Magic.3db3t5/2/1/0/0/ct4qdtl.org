Not really. It's the natural strategy. If we start with everyone having a talisman, then the way for a group to gain power is to consolidate that power - give their talismans to one person or a small group, and let that person or group extort individuals and weaker groups for their talismans, making them stronger and allowing the armed group to grow larger/the members of the armed group to acquire more talismans. Once that begins, others will need to consolidate their power as well, whether through talismans or by setting up administrative structures, immediately ceding over their talismans, and continuing on life, now with a militaristic state demanding taxes.
