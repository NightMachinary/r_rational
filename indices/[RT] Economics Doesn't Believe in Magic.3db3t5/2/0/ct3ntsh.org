Because me having a gun and you having $100, without a police force on your side, is indistinguishable from me having both a gun and $100 in most cases. Edge cases include the loss of various numbers of bullets on my part. Extreme edge cases include you gaining a gun, minus various numbers of bullets, which you may also have gained in the process.

Say one person has a talisman that defends them and a talisman that can be used for offence, preferably non-lethal offence. They watch you carefully as you claim your talisman. If you try any funny business, there's a flash of octarine and you wake up in the local dungeon for some forcible re-education.

That's assuming your talisman was valuable enough. Otherwise, you might not wake up at all.
