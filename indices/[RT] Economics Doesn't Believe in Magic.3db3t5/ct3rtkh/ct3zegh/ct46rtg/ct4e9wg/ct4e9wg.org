That might only be because we happen to be in a particularly peaceful and pro-democracy time at the moment. You'd struggle to make that argument in the Soviet Union, for example. But let me suggest a different way your scenario would work out:

Phil notes the signs of revolution brewing, and decides to redirect the popular frustrations with a war. And wouldn't you know, there's a nearby "ally" with a growing stockpile of resources and a dwindling army. Attacking another militarised nation is a fool's errand, you'll spend huge amounts on the war and even victory will gain you very little, but attacking an economic nation can often leave you richer than before (as any /Civilisation/ player can tell you). Remember your Prisoner's Dilemma: while cooperate-cooperate is good and noble, the /best/ outcome is still defect-cooperate.

Thanks to the war, the people are now angry at Bob, not Phil. The military is on his side, because he can now afford to pay them properly. And the autocracy continues for a few more decades. Besides, Bob probably has a few manicure talismans of his own; if we're comparing grow-crops magic to kill-people magic then the small percentage of talismans that make luxuries won't have much impact on anything.

And ultimately, even in an enlightened capitalist democracy, people still won't exactly be free to choose whatever talisman they want - their choices will just be guided by the Invisible Hand of the Market instead of by letters from the king.
