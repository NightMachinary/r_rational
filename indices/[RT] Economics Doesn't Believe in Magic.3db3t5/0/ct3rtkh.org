The problem with this argument is that greater access to resources hasn't led to a trend of more autocracy in reality- wealthier economies tend to be more free, in fact.

While Phil's theocracy is perfectly plausible, consider what happens when his ally Bob decides to take advantage of a period of military hegemony to use the talismans to increase his nation's wealth. With agricultural and medical talismans, his population is going to start increasing exponentially- in a century or so, Bob's nation is going to be several times the size of Phil's, and it's going to be producing significantly more per capita in taxes. Phil's nation is eventually going to become a band of potentially dangerous, but ultimately irrelevant barbarians if he keeps ordering manicure talismans instead of "bless crops" talismans.

The most successful nations focus as much on economic development as military development, and more advanced economies require better educated, more mobile, and better connected citizens, who tend to demand more rights- among which, the right to purchase talismans from the state would probably be one of the first granted at the end of feudalism, right alongside the right to own land. Eventually, I could even see parents being given the right to choose and own their child's talismans to some degree- in that case, you'd have market forces acting on the talismans, with most families having their children choose talismans that would produce or sell for the most money. The entire talisman economy would become more efficient, and the nation's economic power would increase.

Also, no matter how theocratic, autocracies are unstable. Look at the Roman Empire- for a while, the Augustus was a god, but every few decades you'd still have some general take his legions and declare himself Emperor. Sometimes, you'd have five or six competing emperors. Phil may have god-like powers, but so does anyone who's better liked by his military and priesthood. As an autocrat, he'd be lucky to survive fifty years, let alone centuries.

Finally, more advanced weapons in the hands of soldiers makes successful popular revolution more likely, not less so, since successful revolutions tend to involve the soldiers and weaponry of the nation, and powerful weapons can equalize irregular and professional troops.
