I do like how you portrayed Red's newfound heightened sensitivity to psychic minds. I especially look forward to when he progresses to the point where he can sense non-psychic minds as well, even if it will probably start with basic empathy instead of telepathy.

It will be incredibly interesting to read a rational story where the main character can actually sense what is going wrong in peoples heads when they behave irrationally :)

Also, a question; would it be a good idea for Red to bring the Abra he keeps to one of his sessions with the psychic lady whose name I forgot, so that she could actually see how his mind looks/feels when the partition is down? I feel like that could give her, or any kind of clinical psychic, relevant information when it comes to fixing the problem.
