  The pokedex is full of crazy and ridiculously impossible stuff, so I pretty much chuck a lot of it out the window.
#+end_quote

That's fair enough, and it is your world, after all. Stuff like Slugma being 18,000 degrees F, multiple pokemon running faster than the speed of sound, Alakazam having an IQ of 5,000 - these are just ridiculous and prime sources for the "Pokedex entries are written by children" meme.

If it were up to me, I'd probably have the baseline wild Pokemon intelligence be around the level of a border collie, less so for first or second evolutionary stages, but their intellect could increase greatly with training. Special attackers in general would be a little more intelligent across the board, and psychic pokemon would have the highest average intelligence of all.

The way I look at it, in most Pokemon games the wild creatures cap out around level 55, yet the actual cap is level 100. Even a fully evolved creature caught on the Victory Road is just at 50% of its ultimate potential. Many pokemon undergo huge physical changes over their "evolutionary" development and even afterwards as they "level up", and I see no reason why increased mental prowess can't accompany these processes. An average fully-trained pokemon might be at the level of a typical ten-year-old child, similar to the anime - able to understand human speech, possess a typical range of complex emotions and perform a variety of different strategies - but basic algebra would probably be beyond all the non-psychic types.

In my headcanon, many of the ethical issues surrounding Pokemon also stem from this quality. Sure, a wild Fearow may seem like a normal game animal to be hunted and eaten, but if almost every Pokemon has the /potential/ to become far more intelligent, shouldn't eating Pokemon be outlawed entirely?

Do Pokemon have a right to be trained, and thus become smarter and stronger? Should deliberately keeping your companion "underleveled" by coddling it (I just want a pond full of beautiful Magikarp - I don't want to be responsible for multiple Gyarados! / A Liepard is big enough to harm me if it wanted! I'll keep my Purrloin just the way it is) be considered morally wrong, as it stunts the creature's capacity to develop?

  I'm not sure what you mean by animals outperforming 10-year-olds comes from... do you have any research papers you can point me to?
#+end_quote

I think overall, a ten-year-old human is objectively more intelligent than any of the animals I mentioned. In addition, it's very difficult to get a true metric of comparison to humans by age. Still, there are several papers with points like "this animal mastered a concept that most 8-year-olds struggle with", though they may not be of sufficient scope or sample size to convince you. Here are the best examples I could find, if not all direct comparisons to humans, than of situations where the animals demonstrated capability beyond what was expected.

  If I want to reference research done by someone, I don't want to make up some scientist who did the Skinner Box experiments: I'd rather just have Skinner exist in the pokemon world and do them.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. It's definitely less obtrusive for me if I just imagine the Pokemon world as an alternative to our own, that still has many of the same scientists and discoveries, rather than something completely separate. I really like what you do with the more modern quotes, as you tend to attribute these to unnamed or entirely original characters even if the quotes are recognizable. So you could have something like:

/"Arceus exists, if only in the form of a meme with high survival value, or infective power, in the environment provided by human culture."/

  I liked the idea of Red (being a psychic) to actually be afraid of Bugs even before he found out he was Psychic.

D'oh! I should have made this connection. I figured it mostly stemmed from the whole Scyther incident but overlooked this whole aspect.

  how did you come across the story? Are you a regular on [[/r/rational]], or did you find it through fanfiction?
#+end_quote

I was reading a comment thread on [[/r/pokemon]] where someone mentioned how there's so much of the Pokemon universe that Game Freak hasn't really shown in the games - politics, day-to-day life, dealing with non-legendary pokemon as threats, etc. Someone recommended your fanfiction, quoting your introductory paragraph to the series, and I was hooked.
