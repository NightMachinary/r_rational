  If it were up to me, I'd probably have the baseline wild Pokemon intelligence be around the level of a border collie

This is actually about what I imagine, yeah :) Most pokemon are about as smart as smart dogs, to be capable of being trained they way they are.

The question of pokemon intelligence if it approaches sapience is definitely an interesting one, especially since in the anime it absolutely does show pokemon to be fully sapient and even capable of communicating with humans. The ethical ramifications of pokemon training is the least of it, honestly: with that level of intellect, the idea that humans were able to survive and flourish at all is honestly rather hard to believe. But I'd definitely be interested in reading a fanfic that goes into all those questions... I'm just not particularly interested in writing it, since it would massively derail the story toward addressing those questions, rather than the ones I'm more interested in.

Overall the reason I decided to base it on the games rather than the anime is because that level of intelligence just seems more realistic given the pokemon world as we know it. It also allows for exploring issues of animal wellbeing more akin to our world, where animals aren't sapient.

  I think overall, a ten-year-old human is objectively more intelligent than any of the animals I mentioned. In addition, it's very difficult to get a true metric of comparison to humans by age. Still, there are several papers with points like "this animal mastered a concept that most 8-year-olds struggle with", though they may not be of sufficient scope or sample size to convince you. Here are the best examples I could find, if not all direct comparisons to humans, than of situations where the animals demonstrated capability beyond what was expected.

Oh, yes, in very specialized circumstances and particular aspects of problem solving, many animals exceed children's capabilities. Similarly, pokemon are able to remember and interpret battle commands to a far better degree than human children can, and many possess unique intelligence properties that far exceed children's. But as an overall metric of "general intelligence," not just logical thinking but also learning capability and broad problem solving. What makes human intelligence so unique is the ability to learn a wide range of techniques and applications of intelligence, from visual-spacial to pattern recognition to mathematic to memorization. Some animals are much better than kids, or even adults, at one or two of those things, but in general I think the smartest pokemon wouldn't go much further than the smartest animal in general intelligence.

I should probably edit the story to clarify that point a bit better and be more precise with it though, instead of just a single line about Alakazam and 3 year olds :) Thanks for the feedback!
