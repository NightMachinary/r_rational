Hey there, thanks for commenting! Glad you've enjoyed it so much. I post once a month, at the start of each month.

  I'm a little surprised and intrigued by your decision to make all Pokemon only as intelligent as a typical animal. Making Alakazam, the creature that "has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world" and whose brain "can outperform a super-computer" able to... "solve puzzles with the capability of a three-year-old" just seems insulting! There are already non-fantastical animals in real life, like apes, dolphins, some corvids, and arguably octopuses as well that can outperform ten-year-olds in complex tasks. Keeping pokemon a little more intelligent would, in my opinion, only make the moral implications of using these creatures as tools and storing them in stasis even more interesting in a fleshed-out world like yours.

The pokedex is full of crazy and ridiculously impossible stuff, so I pretty much chuck a lot of it out the window. If Alakazam were as smart as they're said to be, I think the pokemon world would look very different.

But as for why the 3 years old comparison... that's actually as smart as chimps are, in terms of complex tasks and problem solving. I'm not sure what you mean by animals outperforming 10-year-olds... do you have any research papers you can point me to?

  My biggest petty gripe is with the occasional non-subtle real-world references, especially to characters or people that are still living. Nothing takes me faster out of my suspension of disbelief in a fictional world than seeing "Professor Dawkins" or "Renekton". The entire Bill and the AI sideplot was unique, but not really my cup of tea when I'd like to learn more about this fictional world and its characters rather than contemporary issues that seem sort of wedged into the plot.

References like Renekton mostly just come from me being /really/ bad at coming up with names in my stories, so I do apologize for that, but as for the references to the real world, a lot of it has to do with the idea of teaching "real world science." If I want to reference research done by someone, I don't want to make up some scientist who did the Skinner Box experiments: I'd rather just have Skinner exist in the pokemon world and do them. I get that this can be immersion-breaking for people who live in our present time and react to seeing modern day, living people referenced in a fanfiction, but in the future, when people like Dawkins and others are dead, there's really no reason to distinguish between real-world scientists who are referenced.

  Do you, the writer, dislike bug pokemon (or real-life insects), or is it only a characteristic of Red? I ask because there seem to be many hints here.
#+end_quote

It's a characteristic of Red :) I'm pretty neutral on insects, but I liked the idea of Red (being a psychic) to actually be afraid of Bugs even before he found out he was Psychic. I didn't really consider the idea that in Japanese culture insects are considered brave heroes though, so thanks for pointing that out: I may go back and swap that Plate. But in general a lot of Bug pokemon tend to be very sinister looking, so I figured it worked that way.

  Are Blue, Red, and Leaf in some way meant to evoke Peter, Ender, and Valentine?
#+end_quote

I was heavily influenced by the Ender saga ever since I read it at the age of 14ish, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was some subtle or subconscious connection.

I'm always happy to chat about the story, though responses might sometimes be slow if I've got other stuff going on. I normally don't plug my patreon, but since you're new to the story I thought I'd mention that the $5 reward is a monthly skype chat, so if you do decide to contribute that's one of the best ways to regularly discuss any thoughts on the story you might have.

And finally if you don't mind my asking, how did you come across the story? Are you a regular on [[/r/rational]], or did you find it through fanfiction?

In any case, thanks for reading, and looking forward to more questions/feedback for future chapters!
