Hey there, welcome!

  when in need of a surname for a canon character, typically uses the Japanese name of said character. E.g., Jasmine Mikan, Misty Kasumi, etc.

Yeah, I use that trick a few times, like for Bill and Giovanni :)

  Also, looong after the fact now, but you mentioned on that same thread how Bulbasaur was your favourite Kanto starter? Same! Personally, I always interpreted Bulbasaur as the most 'canonical' choice for Red out of the three, not only because of the Pok√©mon Adventures manga, but because it's the starter Red has in much of the early promotional artwork for Red and Green.

I've always been a fan of Grass types and personally think Bulbasaur is the cutest of the three starters :) But since I started playing the games when Red and Blue hit the USA, the game canon for me has always been that Red starts with Charmander (since that's the mascot starter for Red) while Blue the rival obviously chooses Squirtle to counter him. I broke what I considered canon because I was disappointed by the lack of Green version and I wasn't going to let that stop me from getting a badass plant dinosaur, but I really should read the Adventures manga one of these days!
