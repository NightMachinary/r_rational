Maybe I should have said that Bulbasaur has /become/ my favourite; pretty sure when I first played the games I choose Charmander like most people xD

I loved the Red & Blue, and Yellow Sagas of the Adventures manga, but haven't read further than that. Lots of the ideas were really fun, like different breeds of Arbok having unique traits (e.g. healing factors) and "psychics"(?) able to heal and understand Pokemon via touch. Not much in the way of explanations, though.... I could probably go on about every cool thing that happened in those parts of the manga, but maybe here isn't the time and place.

Paleontologically speaking, I favour the description of Bulbasaur as a dicynodont -- warm-blooded reptile-like animal related to the ancestors of mammals. But there is a lot of room for interpretation there.
