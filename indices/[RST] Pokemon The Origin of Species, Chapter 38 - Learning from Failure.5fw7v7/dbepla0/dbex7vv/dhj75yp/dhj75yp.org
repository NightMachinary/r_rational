There's something I wanted to mention when I was reading the thread for the first chapter, where you mentioned having limited ideas for character surnames. The author of another Pokémon fanfic I follow (Olivine Romance by Snowden; not /that/ Snowden), when in need of a surname for a canon character, typically uses the Japanese name of said character. E.g., Jasmine Mikan, Misty Kasumi, etc. Thought it was worth mentioning, at least.

Also, looong after the fact now, but you mentioned on that same thread how Bulbasaur was your favourite Kanto starter? Same! Personally, I always interpreted Bulbasaur as the most 'canonical' choice for Red out of the three, not only because of the Pokémon Adventures manga, but because it's the starter Red has in much of the early promotional artwork for Red and Green.
