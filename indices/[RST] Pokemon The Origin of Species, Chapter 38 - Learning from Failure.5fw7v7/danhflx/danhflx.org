Hey everyone, welcome back! No major news this month: I'm still working on adding stuff to the blog on my site, and those of you listening to my podcast should be aware that the next episode might not be up this weekend, thanks to a sudden change of plans for the remainder of the week. Sorry about that, but hopefully I'll be able to get it uploaded anyway.

Hope you're all enjoying Sun and Moon, and as usual, all feedback welcome!
