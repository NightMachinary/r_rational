Just discovered your series last night and I'm completely blown away by the concept and quality. Realism, consistency, and the scientific method in the Pokemon world?

Sign me the /fuck/ up.

How often do you usually upload chapters - around every 2 months or so? I couldn't see the submission dates on each individual chapter.

A few general thoughts, questions and critiques:

1. I'm a little surprised and intrigued by your decision to make all Pokemon only as intelligent as a typical animal. Making Alakazam, the creature that /"has a thorough memory of everything that has occurred in the world"/ and whose brain /"can outperform a super-computer"/ able to... "solve puzzles with the capability of a three-year-old" just seems insulting! There are already non-fantastical animals in real life, like apes, dolphins, some corvids, and arguably octopuses as well that can outperform ten-year-olds in complex tasks. Keeping pokemon a little more intelligent would, in my opinion, only make the moral implications of using these creatures as tools and storing them in stasis even more interesting in a fleshed-out world like yours.

2. My biggest petty gripe is with the occasional non-subtle real-world references, especially to characters or people that are still living. Nothing takes me faster out of my suspension of disbelief in a fictional world than seeing "Professor Dawkins" or "Renekton". The entire Bill and the AI sideplot was unique, but not really my cup of tea when I'd like to learn more about this fictional world and its characters rather than contemporary issues that seem sort of wedged into the plot.

3. Do you, the writer, dislike bug pokemon (or real-life insects), or is it only a characteristic of Red? I ask because there seem to be many hints here.

   - Wild Scyther killed Red's father and all his pokemon
   - Red is unnerved by his spinarak beyond the Night Shade incident
   - The "Insect Plate" in the Arceus cartoon is one of the evil forces, despite insects generally being depicted as courageous superheroes in Japanese culture
   - Red refuses to use a captured Beedrill
   - Red seems to have a general aversion to bug-like pokemon or creatures with chitinous bodies
   - Red blames the "stupid insects" Paras for killing his Rattata, but no similar insult was directed towards the Pikachu that fried his Noctowl

4. Are Blue, Red, and Leaf in some way meant to evoke Peter, Ender, and Valentine?

That's all I have off the top of my head but I'd love to discuss the series more if you're not busy with real life issues or writing.
