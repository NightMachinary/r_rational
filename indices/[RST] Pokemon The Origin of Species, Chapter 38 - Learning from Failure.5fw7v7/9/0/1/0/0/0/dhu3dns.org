  Paleontologically speaking, I favour the description of Bulbasaur as a dicynodont -- warm-blooded reptile-like animal related to the ancestors of mammals. But I there is a lot of room for interpretation there.

Makes sense. I always saw bulbasaur as more of a frog, or just some amphibian/lizard, with a plant growing in its back, the higher evolutions, certainly.
