Should be "penetrates".

  Red scowled. "You can't just emphasize a word and repeat the question as if that changes the answer."
#+end_quote

Same as above.

Actually, on looking more carefully it seems to be intentional. A lot of Red's actions in that flashback section are unitalicised. Since they're also in past tense, it creates a confusing effect (flashback tense but present lack-of-italics).

I'd suggest moving them all into the present tense and italicising the hallucinated/remembered dialogue and actions.

  If only Ayane had *use* her power
#+end_quote

Should be "used".
