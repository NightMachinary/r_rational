D'aw shucks, thanks! In my view HPMOR does a better job with a lot of the concepts, but hopefully I've branched out enough to contribute my own share to the sanity-waterline-raising effort :)

And I've been thinking "What Would Andrew Wiggin Do?" since I was in middle school, if I could inspire anyone else to have a similar thought about one of my characters, that would be both humbling and awesome ^ _^
