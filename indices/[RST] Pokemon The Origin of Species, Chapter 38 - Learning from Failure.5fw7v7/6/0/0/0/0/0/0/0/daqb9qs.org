You could probably train a pokemon to take an action toward another pokemon in response to particular stimuli, but it would have to be something really simple and straightforward. Something as complicated as a words wouldn't really work, and even stuff as simple as images and sounds wouldn't survive the relay.

Binary communication could probably occur, however. Not much use now with things like cellphones, but in the old days it would be neat if there was some kind of Morse Code system that psychics set up :)
