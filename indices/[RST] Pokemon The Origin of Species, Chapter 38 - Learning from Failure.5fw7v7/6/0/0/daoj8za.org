OK. So they can't function as a hive mind. The limitation, then, is How many minds can you transmit to at more or less the same time?

Also I didn't think the Exeggcute actually joined together into any kind of hive mind, they just /attacked/ each other mentally and all went crazy.

EDIT: More importantly, how many subordinate psychics could /Mewtwo/ simultaneously control? Force multiplier!
