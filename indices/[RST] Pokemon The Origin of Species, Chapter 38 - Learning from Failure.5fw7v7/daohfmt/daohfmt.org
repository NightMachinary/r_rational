Well, I guess accumulating way more money than they need /would/ be pretty much in line with what happens in the games :D.

Say, with all of these Pokemon being psychic, would it be possible in theory for all of them to link minds and be directable more or less as one unit? If so, forget keeping /one/ Abra, keep half a dozen of them and train them into a squad. Couldn't use it in trainer battles, of course, but they could really go to town on anything you want to catch.

In theory I suppose any group of Pokemon could be given a single verbal command, but I'd think psychics would have notable advantages in that kind of thing. You can more easily communicate an /intent/ to all of them at once; they won't get in each other's way as physical attackers might; they might even be able to reinforce each other.
