Here's a thought.

In the first chapter, it was said that the longest Names were the most powerful and the HaMephorash would be the longest of them all.

What's the longest word in the English dictionary? "Smiles", because it has a mile between its first and last letters.

The process of incanting the HaMephorash was described as "A fearsome joy. A fervent wish."

And when you're joyful, you smile.

That's why "fervent joy" was an essential part of the True Explicit Name of God, because it was all a pun all along.
