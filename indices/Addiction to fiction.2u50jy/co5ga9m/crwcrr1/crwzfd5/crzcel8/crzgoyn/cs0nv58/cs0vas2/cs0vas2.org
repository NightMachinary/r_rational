  Well I mean I dunno how their kitchen works but if they've already started putting stuff away it sounds like coming in a restaurant 10 minutes before closing and asking for a seat, it's not really fair to the cooks.

First, it was a buffet. They simply took it down early.

Second, having a customer come in right before the bell is a hazard of the restaurant business -- if you're a cook, you signed up for it. That's why some places do things like "we're open until 10pm, but we stop taking orders after 9:30"

Regardless, if the buffet has just shut down then the correct answer to "may I get some dinner?" is not "no, dinner is over." The correct answer is "we just took down the buffet, but let me show you the a la carte menu."
