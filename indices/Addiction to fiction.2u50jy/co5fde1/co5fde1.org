Yep, done that before. It's a reasonable symptom of depression; at least two of my friends have done it besides me. Escaping from reality is easy and effective when you know how to find good fiction.

That said, I don't know if I can offer any advice without knowing more about the underlying problem. I was burned out, and meeting my girlfriend and switching to a new project in a new research lab helped a lot. Someone else I think just went in to the university counseling center and they helped think through it all. Another person found a job that was much nicer all around and managed to reclaim three hours a day from commuting, which incidentally fixed his sleep schedule. The problem is different for everyone, so the solution is probably different too. So I don't think I can offer anything directly. Sorry. :/

That said, I hope you find something. Good luck. :)
