I experience this as well, maybe not as strongly, and I tend to think of it as an addiction to /narrative/, vs fiction, and it is worse the less has happened to me in a given day.

Note that there's some modern thinking that addiction is a surrogate bonding activity - instead of bonding with people, you bond with the thing. If you then try to actively bond with people, you can un-bond with the thing.

That said - First, maybe you just need a recharge! That happens. I refer to it as "incubating".

Second - I think a friend of mine bonded with the world, with tremendous success, as a way to un-bond with chemicals. Amazing things always happen to them, they find everything wondrous, and the never get bored of good things (aka, eat the same great meal over and over).
