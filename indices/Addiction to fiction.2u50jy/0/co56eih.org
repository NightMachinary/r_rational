I suggest when you sit down to read a book, write the title and current time down on a piece of paper. For every chapter you finish, write down the current time.

Noticing time every time you finish a chapter should make you more aware of time going by and create a slight feeling of unease telling you to stop and do something else.

If you are like me and have trouble remembering to stop yourself in between chapters long enough to write something down, set an alarm for every five minutes. It's important to write /something/ down at regular intervals so you can sense time being wasted. Just looking at a clock is not enough, you need to do something to break immersion for more than a handful of seconds.

This should help you to spend less time reading when you sit down to read. It helped me when I had a similar problem with an addiction to books. I went from spending half the day reading to only a few hours. Of course it wasn't any sort of escape mechanism, just too much love for books.
