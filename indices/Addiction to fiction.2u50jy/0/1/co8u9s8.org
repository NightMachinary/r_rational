Glad that you managed a grip on it but as you said and I want to concede, such pragmatism might not be useful when accompanied by bouts of depression (escapism being merely a relieving mechanism). Sure my opportunity cost of time is way higher, I have many interesting projects to complete, arcane knowledge to muster, a world to optimize and so on but when I am down in that abyss I initially don't care about wasted time because I am such a wrecked failure anyway and then aggravate it by feeling bad about the whole thing.

Reading through OP's predicaments I suspect he is going through one such depressed spell and so long as such condition persists I don't think this habit is the worst thing. I suppose he can try diverting this addiction to productive directions like interesting technical books, this typically either distracts me or successfully disgusts me away from reading :)
