I have had exactly the same situation lately.

The past few years have been unpleasant for me as well -- I spent three of them as the co-founder / CTO of a startup; that was really bad. I spent another year dealing with political issues as a line programmer at a consulting shop.

Since I got out I've been consuming a lot of fiction, just like you. There have been many occasions on which the words "I have other things I need to do, I should really stop reading this" have passed through my head...and then I just keep reading, for several more hours.

I haven't entirely dug out from under this but, as [[/u/FarmerBob1]] says, the thing that is helping the most is creating. As one example, I'm writing -- 2YE has been a great thing. More importantly, however, I'm trying to create new memories: I went on a roadtrip to visit old friends, I started learning the harp, I took some time to travel around Australia, and on February 18 I will be moving to Malaysia for a while...I haven't bought a return ticket but it will probably be measured in months, not years.

My suggestion would be to shake things up: start exercising if you don't. If you do, change the kind of exercises you do. Produce some kind of art (learn an instrument, write something, paint...). And if you can, definitely go travel. Take your spouse with you -- maybe a change of setting will be good for the marriage.

Good luck. I hope things improve for you.
