Landed in Malaysia on February 18, relocated to Thailand around April 25, came home June 1 with a ~24 hour layover in China. I rented my apartment out before I left, and the rentor moved out April 20 or I'd still be in SEA; I spent a month-ish trying to find someone I trusted to rent the place, wasn't able to. Now that I'm back in the States I can AirBnB the place.

Important takeaways for anyone who wants to do the same:

- You can drink the water in Malaysia and most people speak enough English that you can get by fairly easily.
- You can/not/ drink the water in Thailand and very few people speak English.
- I had a very unpleasant time in China and do not want to ever go back, even for a layover if I can avoid it.
