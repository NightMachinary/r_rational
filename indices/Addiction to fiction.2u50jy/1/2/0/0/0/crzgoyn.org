I saw nothing attractive, basically no one spoke English at all, I got charged $60 for a $6 cab ride (I discovered later) and the socio-dynamics were disturbing. For example, this quote from a blog post I wrote elsewhere:

  The hotel was nice, but they advised me that dinner closed at 9pm and after that I could only get noodles and dumplings. Okay, no problem, it was only 7:30. I dropped my stuff off in my room, then went downstairs for dinner. I walked in and they told me that, no, dinner was over. I looked at my phone; it was 7:50. Oops, no, my phone hadn't had connectivity since landing so it was actually 8:50, as one of the staff showed me on her phone. Well, okay, but surely even in China 8:50pm is still not yet 9pm? No? It is? Oh, okay, well, then I guess dinner is over and I'll have some noodles. They had to think for a while before deciding that yes, it was okay for me to buy noodles even after dinner was over.

  Same thing happened at breakfast. I walked in, they said "oh no, your breakfast wasn't included in your room, you can't eat here." To which I said "that's fine, I'll just pay for it like the desk said I could." It required some discussion amongst themselves before they decided that yes, it was fine for the foreigner to do this bizarre thing of "exchanging /money/ for food?! Like, actual bills on the spot instead of a prearranged permission? Madness!"

The plane was similar -- airplane mode isn't good enough, you actually need to power your phone completely off. And you can't turn on a phone or anything with a transmitter during the flight. And it's okay to use your laptop as long as you keep the wifi switched off.

I'm sure there are many lovely people and beautiful sights in China. I feel no need to put up with the culture and huge language barrier (or force myself to learn a tonal language) when I could just see lovely people and beautiful sights anywhere else in the world.
