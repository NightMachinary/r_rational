  but surely even in China 8:50pm is still not yet 9pm? No? It is? Oh, okay, well, then I guess dinner is over and I'll have some noodles. They had to think for a while before deciding that yes, it was okay for me to buy noodles even after dinner was over.

Well I mean I dunno how their kitchen works but if they've already started putting stuff away it sounds like coming in a restaurant 10 minutes before closing and asking for a seat, it's not really fair to the cooks.

  Same thing happened at breakfast. I walked in, they said "oh no, your breakfast wasn't included in your room, you can't eat here." To which I said "that's fine, I'll just pay for it like the desk said I could." It required some discussion amongst themselves before they decided that yes, it was fine for the foreigner to do this bizarre thing of "exchanging money for food?! Like, actual bills on the spot instead of a prearranged permission? Madness!"

Again, depending on how unnecessarily convoluted their bureaucratic procedures are they may need to go through extra steps to keep track of/process the cash.

But yeah, fair enough, thanks for sharing.
