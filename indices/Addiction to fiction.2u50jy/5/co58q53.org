I think I'm familiar with something like that dissociative "dazed" feeling - if I've been on a lengthy reading binge I know I sometimes spend the immediate aftermath feeling strangely detached from reality, I guess still mentally having one foot in the fictional universe I've just spent a long while thinking about.

As escapist/addictive habits go, it does have the advantage of being cheap, and won't do terrible things to your health. I suspect the key thing is to try and improve the aspects of life that aren't going well (which, now I put it to words, seems over-obvious, but I guess it's a refocussing on where the real problem is)
