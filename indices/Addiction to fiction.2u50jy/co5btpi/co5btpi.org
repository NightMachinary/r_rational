The only thing I've found that keeps me from doing with my free time exactly what you describe with your free time is creating.

I have an addiction to newness. I cannot begin to count the number of MMO's I've played, or the books I've read. The real world rarely interests me, though there are exceptions.

I have tried to start my own business, and failed, partly because it got old, and partly because starting your own business is /hard./

Then I discovered serial webfiction. Now, in my free time I create newness. I do not consume newness. It is an acceptable tradeoff for whatever part of my brain that controls my addiction to newness. I still play a couple MMO's, but MMO's are not an addiction. I don't have to play MMO's 10 hours a day, work 8, drive 2, and sleep 4, which was my typical pattern for about fifteen years.

If your writing skills are terrible, maybe try photography, or something else. MAYBE try to shift your work towards generating newness a bit more, if that would be acceptable in your field. Challenge yourself to find a way to create.
