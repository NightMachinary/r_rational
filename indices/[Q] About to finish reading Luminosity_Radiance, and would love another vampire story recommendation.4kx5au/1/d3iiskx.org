Terry Pratchett's most vampiric novel, Carpe Jugulum, is pretty decent but not in the top 20 of Pratchett novels - but his most werewolfy novel, The Fifth Elephant, is actually very good and would definitely make that list, and has a bonus vampire in it. In both cases, more fantasy/humor than horror stuff.

Steven Brust's Agyar is an interesting literary experiment - an entire vampire novel that's pretty well written and interesting that also manages to not use the word vampire even once.

I really like Gaiman's Vampire Sestina (a ~1 page poem) but it's not worth buying an entire short story anthology just for it - though of course Gaiman's short fiction is in general pretty excellent. You can find the poem online with google.
