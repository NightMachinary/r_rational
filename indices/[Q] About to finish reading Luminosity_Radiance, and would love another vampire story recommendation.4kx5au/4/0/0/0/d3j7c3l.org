I think that the problem is that you want the story to be something it isn't. Honestly, I want it to be that as well. But sadly for us, glowfic isn't about "see characters solve problems in clever ways."

Glowfic is about "see these character dynamics play out in a bunch of subtly different but recognizable ways." Seeing how two or three people interact in a bunch of different universes is the appeal. What happens in a world where, comparatively, there are no problems and things are smooth and good? What about the Hunger Games? What about earth? What about Sailor Moon verse? It's a metafictional appeal.
