I would be onboard with a world where there are no problems, where things are smooth and good. Utopias can be interesting to read about too - I really enjoy e.g. the Culture novels, primarily for their interesting utopian society. I mean, if the glowfic had taken the first Empress of the Stars thing and run with it some more there could be a great story there - a drama where the principal characters have already won and are the most powerful in the setting, and have to decide how to use that power sounds really cool to me. I mean, that sounds like a slightly less politics-based and more magical/sci-fi version of The West Wing, and I'd be totally 100% onboard with that; The West Wing was pretty awesome and a similar drama of ideas and personalities in the Empire of the Stars or whatever has the potential to be far more awesome. Instead, they jump to another setting constantly as soon as magic solves all the problems that can be overcome by brute force.

It feels like a bait-and-switch is pulled over and over, where the authors spend a huge amount of time building an interesting world for the characters to be in, full of major problems, and setting the characters up to have dramatically resonant and difficult problems to deal with... and then instead of exploring any solutions to these problems that might be fun to read about, at that instant magic happens to destroy the plot, and shortly thereafter another setting is introduced.
