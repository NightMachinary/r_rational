I strongly de-rec the glowfic Effulgence.

The writing is fine but the plot has serious issues - mostly, the authors' steadfast refusal to allow any problem to be difficult or interesting to sort out. They build up like 30+ different plots which sound interesting and have really cool world building set up... then demolish those plots easily without interesting struggle or effort via the same overpowered magic. After the cop-out, they then start another setup in a different setting. They set up two cool conflicts with people who might be able to contest against the overpowered magic... then in both cases the person's decide to be friends/subordinates and not fight instead.

A lot of the setups are really cool, too, if occasionally on crack - I *want* a fic where Bella Swan with fire control powers, Tony Stark, and Sherlock Holmes take on the dystopian government from The Hunger Games, that sounds like an amazing premise for a fic! - but the overpowered magic comes in and of course trivializes that entire plot immediately.

I found it really really disappointing compared to Luminosity, which I loved.
