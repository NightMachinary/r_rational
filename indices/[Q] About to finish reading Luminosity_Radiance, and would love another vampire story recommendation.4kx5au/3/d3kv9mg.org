I'm in a similar boat, though I finished both those stories ages ago, liked them, and never really found a story that contains excactly what I liked about them since...

I just want a xenofictional fish out of water coming of age story. That is to say, stories about a character becoming a vampire, learning what it is to be a vampire, and immersing themselves in the culture of vampires are great. Stories where vampires are written merely as a metaphor for an aspect of human experience? Or where the character clasps onto their humanity and refuses to undergo character development into their new being? Meh.

Doesn't really have to be vampires either of course. Actually, the webcomic Zebra Girl is another instance of what I'm referring to.
