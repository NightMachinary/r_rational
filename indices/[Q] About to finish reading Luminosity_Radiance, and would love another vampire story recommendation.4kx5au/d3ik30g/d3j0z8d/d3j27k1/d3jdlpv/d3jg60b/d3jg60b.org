Ah. I'll have to re-read it, then.

The appearance of The Duchess fits established Discworld rules about belief translating to power. This book mentions it. Small Gods, Reaper Man, and anything involving the goddess of things stuck in drawers. If Vetinari wanted to become a god, it would not be ineffectual for him to start a whisper campaign to that effect.

And the revelation of the identities of the council fits established patterns of promotion in the army.

Sure, these have the appearances of Deus Ex Machinas, but they're not: they fit the established rules of the stories and are foreshadowed. It's not like Death appears out of nowhere and kills half the council, or Carrot Ironfoundersson is suddenly made King of Borogravia.
