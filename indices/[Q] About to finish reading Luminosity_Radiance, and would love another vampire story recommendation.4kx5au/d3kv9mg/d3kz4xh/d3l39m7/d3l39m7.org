Artistically? Page 457 The Dawn of The Night arc. Plotwise? Well it slowly sheds more and more of it's joke of the day nature over time. Hmm. I can't give a specific point. It's fully matured by The Dawn of The Night but you could also argue for Jacks character development arc in The Magi-Net (183) or when it starts getting dark in Angels With the Dirty Fir (95). Also the Moon Games (264) arc is worth a mention. Just because its in a moderately developed place in the story and has werewolves.

TLDR. Probably you should just skip to page 457. All the great epics were started in medias res, you can always go back for the backstories later. :P
