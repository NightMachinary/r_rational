You should read The Historian. It's probably one of the best vampire novels I've read. The author is very good at building up this sort of dreary spooky atmosphere, it's almost like a horror novel.

Also you should check out the Ann Rice novels. I know they have a reputation... they practically introduced the angsty moody vampire trope. However that doesn't mean they aren't good. The books are more about what it means to be a vampire; it embraces the monstrosity of vampires without making them unsympathetic. It's full of pseudo philosophical babble but it's still pretty interesting.
