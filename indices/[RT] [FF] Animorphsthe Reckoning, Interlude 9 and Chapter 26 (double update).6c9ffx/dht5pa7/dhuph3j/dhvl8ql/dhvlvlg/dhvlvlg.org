I mean, they'll probably find out almost immediately /after/ (e.g. by having a piece of tech on the rock that's constantly broadcasting a signal, and if it fails to /stop/ sending that signal, they know the thing didn't detonate). But if you're pressed on a dozen fronts, and you can't really convince yourself to spare a single ship, and you've got a bomb that costs $5 that has "get 'em /really/ dead" written in the reviews ...

Given that they're pretty much literally just sticking a hyperdrive onto a rock, it's cheap to just throw it and check up later.
