Yay, Animorphs is back! Well TK, I considered messaging you during the hiatus to ask what was up, but I figured that everyone would be doing the same thing, and I didn't want to bother you in your busy life. However, it would be /really/ nice if there were a way for you post notes during a long hiatus without adding a chapter, just to say "Hey, I'm busy and can't update for a while, but here's what's going on with me." Otherwise I'm left wondering if today could be the day for a new update, or if you've abandoned the fic altogether. It messes with my emotions, man!

As for the chapter, I enjoyed it a lot, though the dominos that have been set up still haven't fallen yet. Ax's perspective is much easier to read now that he has a yeerk to help him communicate. I did have many of the same reactions as in CouteauBleu's detailed review. Namely, Visser 3 is not a god, and not everything that happens is all part of his plan. Sure, the Animorphs need to guard against the possibility, but it seems likely that he is just preoccupied right now. Probably with winning the Chee over to his side via dog appreciation and cloning the Pemalites or something.

Also, how on earth do the Andalites intend to bypass the Z-space barrier to implement their threat? Do they not know about it? Does this have something to do with that Z-space bridge V3 discovered? Is there an automated Andalite ship hiding in the solar system that can carry out instructions?

Another thing I noticed:

  “Can you do it, Ax?” Jake asked, leaning toward us and fixing us with a steady look. “Can you actually convince your people?” “Forget that,” Tom bit out. “Can you actually build a transmitter at all?”

Once Tom says this, they actually /do/ forget about Jake's very important question. A lesson in mindfulness.
