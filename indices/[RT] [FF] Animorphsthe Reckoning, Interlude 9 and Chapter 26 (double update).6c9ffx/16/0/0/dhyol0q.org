Right, I figured he wouldn't have much first-hand experience with it, just envisioned it more as a baseline way of thinking due to the culture he grew up in. I don't know what andelite court systems or media looks like, but I'm kind of imagining a version of A Few Good Men where someone with military authority is using their influence in the /eib/ among their subordinates to get each of them to hold onto secrets about some coverup, with an andelite Tom Cruise trying to interrogate not just an individual who he's trying to get to break their code of silence or convince it's the wrong thing to do, but the whole base they're part of that's reinforcing it.

Man, now I'm /really/ curious about andelite media, and how it incorporates thought-speak/the /eib./

Anyway, this situation makes enough sense that he's disoriented or too used to being among humans that it would slip his memory, so it works either way :) Might be worth emphasizing it a bit if you ever do an edit though.
