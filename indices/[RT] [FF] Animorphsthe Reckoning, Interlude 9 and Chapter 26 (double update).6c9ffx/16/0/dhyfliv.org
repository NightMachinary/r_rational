Re: minor point of confusion ... Ax has never /tried/ to sway someone before. Like, the whole concept of "I know something you don't, now let me try to cause you to update" is alien to him, as a young cadet who's never really had unique knowledge all his own, and is something he's only really picked up since coming to Earth. Prior to that, his growth and change and updating (and that of those around him) always took place /within/ the harmony of the /eib,/ as elaborations on extant themes. So he would've first had to recognize, from the inside, that he was trying something new, and since /everything/ feels new and strange to him right now, he didn't register that this was unusually unusual. He was so focused on going home again for Thanksgiving in his first year of college that he didn't realize how different and discordant everything would feel.

At least, that was my take.
