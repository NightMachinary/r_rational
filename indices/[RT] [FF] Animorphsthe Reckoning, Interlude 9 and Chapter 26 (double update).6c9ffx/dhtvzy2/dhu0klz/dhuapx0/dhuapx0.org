I think there's probably a bit of balance between "leave everything offscreen" as you're doing now (a touch too much IMO), and "explain everything in excruciating detail and have 16000 word chapters".

Most of the solutions are inelegant, but they work. Have a character describe everything that happened off-screen, or allude to it in a very obvious way. For example, you could have chucked two lines in the "Ax fixes the fighter" scene with the human saying "was it weird to see her morph you", you could have people give "reports" about missions they ran, or heck, you could even somehow do a "yadda yadda" though it. You know, "and so, after Tyagi morphed Ax, he was escorted into the room to work on the bug fighter".

Like, I think you'd definitely be able to strike a balance between showing us everything and showing us not /quite/ enough. I love the story and part of it is because I feel like I need to re-read a few chapters whenever a chapter gets released because there's /so much/, but that's also one of the problems in a way, you know?
