This chapter's release is the best thing that's happened in the past 24 hours!

- Man, President Tiyagi is competent. Also Ax is being hella hypocritical right now. He's maybe ended up with a bit too much of Tom's human deception understanding.
- The flyover thing seems like a /terrible/ idea, for most of the reasons they mention in the chapter. Like what the hell are they even trying to convince people of that they don't already have evidence for. Seeing something that looks kind of like an alien spaceship fly above your city for a while proves... what, exactly? Is it really worth the massive risk? Highly suspecting that something is up with Tyagi, which makes it scarier that Ax just gave her his morph and a ton of information. Especially with her asking them to bring back David, she definitely has worrisome motives.
- Speaking of which, Jake said Tyagi wanted to do an acquire-check, but after acquiring him it doesn't look like she ever actually morphed him or anything before Ax started working on the fighter?
- Why would a news story about donations to animal shelters at all be given attention by the general public amidst the sea of other world-breaking news? Most people on reddit don't know anything about the Chee or their caniphilia, right? ("Victor Chee" is really funny, though.)
- This fic has so many things going on at once now that it's very overwhelming, for the readers and the characters. I've read fiction before with the meme "don't let yourself get distracted by this petty problem, keep your eyes on the real enemy" but this fic has like 5 layers of that. I feel like they're constantly disregarding really important things because there are so many things to pay attention to.
- [[/u/TK17Studios]], do you have a little black box in the rest of life outside writing? One of my favorite things about this fic is how well the different internal experiences are represented.
