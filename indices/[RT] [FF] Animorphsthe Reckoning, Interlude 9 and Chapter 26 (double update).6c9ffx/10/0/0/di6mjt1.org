re the andalite psychology. How much indeoendence do they actually have? In this chapter it seemed ive the hive mind totally overrode the individual decision of the chancellor. Which seems to imply individual andalites are more like ants than humans.

Though in previous chapters it seemed more like Ax was suffering in a similar way to humans who are socially isolated. But not that he had never worked as an individual before.
