I definitely like how this chapter, and all of the Ax chapters leading up to it, delved deeper into Andalite psychology. Before I felt a bit like Andalites were basically humans, but telepathic, and with better brains, and that kind of 'completely superior alien race' thing is something I learned to hate back when I was readung about the elves in Eragon. And it was also something I especially hated in science fiction; we know that our own evolution left 'holes' in our psychology, places where the human brain has quite caught up to the modern era, where base tribalism and irrational prejudice flourish. Why would an alien species, bar any genetic engineering, be any different?

But the Reckoning, especially after this last update, has gone out of its way to give it's aliens psychologies that are unique, different, and contrasting Superior to humans in some ways, yet inferior in others.

I have yet to find this done well in other fiction (recommmendations) anyone, and for, in my opinion, actually attempting to write not just alien minds, but make the society around such minds make sense considering their psychologies, I salute you.
