Great chapter. Love how well it shows a character being wise, but still making internally consistent mistakes through arrogance.

To that end, a minor point of confusion: is what Ax forgot about the way his argument would get shouted down by those around Lirem /really/ something he would forget? Wouldn't he be so used to the way his society works that he'd instinctively know that you're never just trying to convince one person, but rather everyone connected to them? It seems like that would be a basic part of their culture's dramas and media, an essential aspect of communication that would utterly change the ways stories form and conflicts are resolved. Has he just been spending too much time with humans?

If so, maybe mention that, or maybe Ax has a reason to assume that he is speaking to Lirem alone. Even something as simple as "I must speak with you about this urgent matter alone," causing more grumbling and browbeating by the Chancellor, who pretends to acquiesce and has an even better reason to act so demeaning to Ax's presumption above his station.

Loved the updates, back to waiting for more :)
