Waheu! Grateful as always.

Interlude 9 is intended to be factory guy, yeah, as well as a template for several-hundred-if-not-a-couple-thousand similar cases they intend to pull (and have already been pulling). It is certainly a Questionable Strategy.

Eight billion is high, I maybe should've gone with two billion, but I think definitely /not/ just millions, at this point. Also I guess I can pretend the article was hyperbolic, even though that's lame.

Part of the arrogance is meant to be bleedover from Andalite and Yeerk arrogance, and part of it is this bold new sort of hivemind actually taking itself seriously and realizing that it might /genuinely/ know better, at least in some cases. Clearly not /all/ cases, as we saw.

My headcanon (hah) ((but no really it's just headcanon until it shows up in the text, even if it's me)) re: Presidents is that Paul Evans vetted the Secret Service immediately, and then looped all of them in, putting them in touch with both him and Tyagi and keeping very tight safety protocols on all of them.

Re: the communicator, my thought is that it either a) naturally gives off some energy the whole time, or b) as part of his subterfuge, Ax has it giving off energy some times and not others, even while it's being built ("tuning it," maybe).
