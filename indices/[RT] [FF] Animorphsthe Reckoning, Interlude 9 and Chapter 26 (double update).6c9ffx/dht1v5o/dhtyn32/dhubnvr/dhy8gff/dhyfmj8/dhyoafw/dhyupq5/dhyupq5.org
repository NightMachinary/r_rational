I think the issue is that this spoiler format relies on the subreddit's CSS, so viewing it with CSS disabled (or from a different page on reddit, e.g. inbox) will cause it to fail.

The nice thing there is that it fails by not showing. If it appeared in plain text it would spoil people unintentionally.
