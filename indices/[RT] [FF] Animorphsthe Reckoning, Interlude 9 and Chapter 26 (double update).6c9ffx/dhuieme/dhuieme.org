Hmm, I'm really torn on David's inclusion in the story. On the one hand, he's a fantastic villain - plausible backstory and personality, well-written, and creates tension on the meta-level (as someone else mentioned above, he scares me more than Z-space asteroid bombs).

On the other hand, the way he was included just feels so /incredibly/ unfair. It's a deus ex machina invoked to contrive a kind of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActMisunderstanding][third-act misunderstanding]]. Except that after David inevitably produces all manner of discord and mayhem, the only way I can see for Marco to be properly exonerated is for the culprit deity to show up and confess. Anyone else have thoughts on this?

I want to temper this comment by saying that this is my favourite fanfic. I'm cautiously optimistic about TK17Studios' ability to use the abovementioned plot point effectively. I do wonder, though, if David could have been introduced in a plausible way given how effective the Animorphs are.
