I am interested in how r!David will behave, though.

He's coming in a lot "later" in the story than in canon, a lot of the things I remember that he wanted (being left to his own devices, betraying their human identities to the yeerks, killing animals, etc) are mostly irrelevant at this stage --- the animorphs can let him get away without too much obvious danger, or at least, less danger than would exist by having him be around as an unhappy, unwilling participant.

Also: I don't recall whether anyone acquired Cassie prior to Ventura, but it might behoove the group to loop her into their mind-meld at some point, especially w/regards to dealing with David. On that note, I'm not sure who is more dangerous: David, or David morphing into the Jake and having access to their memories and intuitions in a confrontation. (A believable handicap would be that it's not possible for the animorphs to handle morphing David, even once his nature is discovered due to his aggressive mental state (as suggested in an earlier thread))

Regardless it's a strange gambit with the intervention, since it seems like something that will have to come up soon, barring constant meddling.
