Great to see this updating again! And with such delightfully long chapters

How long is a cycle? Calling an hour and a half a seventh of a cycle seems to imply it's 10.5 hours, so Ax has 3 days to do anything?

I'm a bit confused by what the end goal of the approach in interlude is. Leaving people with morph capabilities seems most likely to end up with them getting captured by the Yeerks, which is a bad outcome. But by giving no clear direction to them, it seems unlikely that they'd achieve anything of us. Or get much experience actually fighting effectively for when the "time comes", whatever they're supposed to interpret that as meaning. A hostile Yeerk takeover?

Meanwhile, Ax you absolute idiot. If I've interpreted events correctly, his plan was to convince the Andalites that cooperation was the best path, in stark violation of their current doctrine. Of which the main evidence is his success in becoming a symbiote with Temrash, evidence he can't in any way say during the communication without them writing him off as compromise. And he informed no ally of this, and gave the Andalites the co-ordinates of the Earth.

Though from the Andalites perspective, I can't say they acted incorrectly. A planet with vast resources, a vast empowerment to the Yeerks, which the Yeerks are far better placed to acquire than the Andalites (and frankly seem well on course to do so) is far more a threat than anything else, if their main value is the survival and prospering of the Andalite species.

I was unclear on what the mistake was when he said details of Earth and convinced the Andalites that this was a communication worth listening to though? Apart from the general misguidedness of opening communications at all. Was his original plan to encourage co-operation without giving any details of the threat at Earth?
