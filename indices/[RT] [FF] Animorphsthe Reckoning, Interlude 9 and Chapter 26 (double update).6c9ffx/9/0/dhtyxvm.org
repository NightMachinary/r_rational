A cycle is ~3.4 days, so seven cycles is a little over three weeks. Tick tock. (A subcycle is a seventh of a cycle, and a seventh of a subcycle is around 100 minutes.)

The morphing upgrades they're giving out at random are sort of an insurance policy. Remember, they were assuming that humans could /absolutely/ beat back the Yeerks' current invasion force, if they actually bothered to coordinate/try. They're adding some chaos to the mix, and making sure there are others out there to take up the mantle +when+ if there's a total party kill.

The "mistake," as I saw it, was going straight to "No, really, they're a fucking /threat,/" when the goal was to try to convince the council to go for peace negotiations. As a smaller mistake, they used "we" quite suspiciously a few times during their appeal, but Lirem seemed not to notice or care.
