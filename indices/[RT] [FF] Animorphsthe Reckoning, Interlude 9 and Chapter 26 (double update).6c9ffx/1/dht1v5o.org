Alright, obsessively detailed review time!

- I'm choosing to believe that Interlude 9 is Marco talking to the factory guy. Which confirms it: he really is a one night stand kind of guy!

- I'm... not quite sure I agree with the general strategy of releasing superpowered people in the nature Cauldron-style and hope for the best, at least from a strategic standpoint. But it's pretty damn cool anyway.

- "U.S. leadership clearly compromised". You bet. Did they find out the Secreatry of State yet?

- Eight billion views? That sounds like /a lot/, even for such a world-breaking broadcast. Is that supposed to be millions?

- The looting starts at last. You can't have a world-wide invasion of body-snatchers compromising every authority figure in the world without /some/ civil unrest. Honestly, I'd be almost more worried about the possible breakdown of society than any physical threat the Yeerks pose.

- I just realized that this is a universe where everyone on Reddit talks about Animorphs non stop, debates about Animorphs, theorize about what the Animorphs will do, etc. Shit, now I want to be there.

- I'm not sure if this is a deliberate theme of the story, or just something that pops up now and again, but the Animorphs are lapsing into "religious" thinking again. They're spending a lot of time assuming everything that ever goes wrong is V3's fault, and trying to predict him. Especially since there's probably not much overlap between what V3 is plotting and what they can observe or affect right now.

- By the way, what can V3 even do by now? He's basically lost his chance to control/recruit the human population long term. His invasion is no longer a secret, methods to detect controllers are spreading, and his own troops are increasingly wary of him.

- As a guy who is currently trying to impart some of the same concepts Ax talks about to my team (anticipating failure, not jumping to conclusions), I can empathize with his frustration. This shit is hard.

- Ax is being pretty arrogant and rude in this chapter, overall. "Humans, this is how you need to think. Do not interrupt each other." Ten minutes later: "Never mind, I figured it out, you can drop whatever you were talking about."

- Mhh... So Visser deliberately cut the information flow with the Andalites? Makes sense with his overall strategy. This makes me think of the way V3 spontaneously sent (what he claims to be) all of Telor's acquired humans. Does Telor have any humans left, or did they just start abducting new ones somewhere else? If they have no more humans, this is probably a deliberate move on V3's part, both to dumb Telor down and to make communications between Telor and Earth governments dependent on him.

- "we can peace treaty this bitch right out from under him" That made me chuckle.

- Did... did Tobias pat Ax's head? oO

- I like how Ax sounds less like an wise old master and more like a teenager as his melding progresses.

- I like the explanation that "Prince" is more than just a rank, it also describes a thought process. It's a bit less goofy than the idea than Ax just started calling Jake "General" after being isolated.

- The bit with the Chee reminds me of the ongoing "Charlie [tries to] recruits Wanda" in Erfworld. Bit of a "Aw craaaap" moment when you realize that your enemy can make the super-powerful ally you rely on a better offer than you. (though I'm not sure it'd really matter; on the long term, Humans as a group have way more resources than V3, and are more likely to care for dogs than him)

- So what's the status with the "real President, fake President" thing? I'm kind of wondering how they'd even keep it a secret, given that the entire world is looking for some assurance that the President /isn't/ being mind-controlled right now. Did they just tell journalists "Relax, we have it under control, but please don't point a camera at the President for more than two hours in a row"?

- Interesting that the Essak and Temrash are pretending that the yeerks V3 killed were individuals. Makes sense; even if they want to cooperat, the existence of the coalescions is most definitely not their secret to let out in the open.

- There's that one xkcd where the guy says "To think the light of this star was emitted back when there still dinosaurs here" - "Actually, this one is six light-years away." - "Oh - well, to think the light of this star was emitted back during the previous presidential administration... yeah, that doesn't quite pack the same punch." One thing Animorphs (completely screwed up at first then) did great was avoiding the "We have been at was for thousands of years" clich√©; the start of the Yeerks war in canon was after the Vietnam war. Somehow that seems much more realistic and grounded. I really like the idea that Humanity is threatened by a people that was still stuck in Stone Age during the previous Olympic Games.

- I like those bits of worldbuilding about how Yeerks don't invent tech, they just repurpose it. Yeerks are the badass cyberpunk junkers of the universe.

- Did you... what are you... NO. BAD AX. BAD. We went through this already! You /don't/ lie to your allies to improvise your own little agenda that will inevitably blow up in your face five minutes later! Were you even listening?

- Minor nitpick: even if the Nasa techs examining the spaceship don't understand how it works, shouldn't they be capable of detecting that energy is being sent to the transmitters? Unless it doesn't produce heat or emit any detectable signal.

- "Oh yeah, the humans are too limited to understand the genius of my plan. They would not accept the infinite wisdom of sending the coordinates of their people to the guys with infinite nukes and itchy trigger fingers. I better hide this from them."

- Temrash is awfully casual about using the memory of an irresistible drug to batter Ax's mind into submission. I'm sure that won't cause any problems later. Also, it seems that the power dynamic is not as equal as Ax thought.

- Overall, I like Ax's internal conflicts. It's not as simple as him second-guessing himself, but it's not different people arguing either.

- Look, I've totally figured it out, Chancellor! You just need to stop whatever it is you're doing, and open peace negotiations with the Yeerks, in defiance of all previously established doctrine! I know it'll work because we've spent two days talking about it with a bunch of humans and also I'm a Controller.

- 49 minutes after the call is over, an aide comes talk to the Chancellor. "Sir, about that 'Slaughter 9 billion people to save our asses' plan you had... We can't actually do it. The whole sector is located in an impenetrable Z-space quicksand thing. We have no idea how Visser 3 and Elfangor could go through it. The next ship we send will arrive in... roughly five months. So... yeah."
