We're back!

Ax's chapters seem much easier to read now that he isn't slowly going insane.

And the world is going absolutely crazy, as might be expected. The more I think about it, the scarier it becomes that humanity's survival depends on cooperation. Just getting all of the factions within a country to start pulling in the same direction would be an accomplishment of note, and that's /easy/ compared to getting dozens and dozens of countries across the globe to agree on a single issue. Hooray for a unifying threat?

Along a similar-ish vein, Andalites seem really bad at updating. I'm wondering what the rules are here - when they accept new evidence/arguments and when they reject, given that each individual has the weight of an entire society pressing down on them. Clearly it's not impossible for the Path to redirect, or they would never have made it out of the stone age.

I enjoyed the "this is how to anticipate failure" lesson in there. If I didn't come into this story knowing the context of it as a rationalist story, I don't think I would have picked it as explicitly teaching (preaching?). Ether way, I'll have to remember to use that one.

When I started this story, I didn't think I'd end up rooting for the yeerks to infest every human on earth, but there you go. Thanks Essak-and-Peter.

And there's the obvious bombshell at the end. Namely, the threatened /bombshell/. I have no idea how As should play this one. There's not really any good options. Telling the governments risks information leaking to V3 and him going to ground immediately (plus potentiallyâ€‹ sparking a brand new war, but that's actually small fry by comparison). Keeping the information private means having a week to kill V3 (or tricking the Andalites into thinking it happened?) which is soemthing of a tall order. Maybe just tell V3 and let him cut off whatever ship is sent to destroy Earth?

But things are looking pretty dark, even compared to how idyllic the story has been so far. And our newest sociopathic animorph has yet to have his turn to ruin everything forever, so there's still that to look forward to!
