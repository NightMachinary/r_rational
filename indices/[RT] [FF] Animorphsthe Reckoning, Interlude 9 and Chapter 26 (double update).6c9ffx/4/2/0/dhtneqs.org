A seventh of a subcycle is 1.5 hours, so a subcycle is 10.5 hours. If (best guess) a cycle is 7 subcycles, then a cycle is just over 3 days and 7 cycles is three weeks. If (next guess) a cycle is 49 subcycles, then 7 cycles is 150 days which is five months, which feels too long for narrative purposes (but would mean the Chancellor knows about the Z-space quicksand thing already).
