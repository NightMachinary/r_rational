I'm not /wholly/ motivating myself through external praise---the real reason to write r!Animorphs is because I want to be able to read it, and it looked like no one else was going to do it.

But! External praise motivates me to write /now/ as opposed to letting it languish in the queue of "Duncan projects to-be-finished-someday" (of which there are a bunch of super cool ones).
