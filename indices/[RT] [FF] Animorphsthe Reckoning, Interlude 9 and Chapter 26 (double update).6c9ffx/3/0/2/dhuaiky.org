  I think literal million-dollar donations to animal charities will catch the eye ... it's a feelgood heartwarming story, and in the middle of a chaotic, scary month, there are going to be stories like that that float to the top just because people want /something/ positive to cling to.

Also, the Chee presumably keep a close eye on things like that. Even if it wasn't mentioned in the news at all, they could quite plausibly find out from the three charities' monthly newsletters or something (though that specifically would be a little too slow for current purposes).
