Imma vote for "it's okay if things are offscreen". I mean, I'm obviously more invested in this fic than the average reader, so it might be easier for me to follow the going ons, but I like that the fic is not spending too much time justifying itself or explaining non-important details.

Given that by its nature as a rational fic, it already has a very high reflexion-to-decision ratio, the way it goes straight for the important parts feels like it maintains the pace.

Re - the flyover idea: I think it's a clever idea. Even if it's booby trapped, there's not much the ship can do that V3's cloaked ships can't (and it's not like he needs deception to perform orbital bombings). Random civilians taking potshots wouldn't be much of a concern, since they'd be more likely to hurt themselves than actually damage it. I'd be more worried about rogue military officers pulling an artillery barrage or sending a fighter jet at it.
