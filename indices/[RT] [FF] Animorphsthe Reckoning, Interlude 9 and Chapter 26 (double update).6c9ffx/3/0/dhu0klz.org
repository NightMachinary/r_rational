I'm mixed on the flyover idea; I see flaws, but I also see it as the sort of thing real leaders actually do, and they don't always turn out terribly. Of course, I could be saying this just to throw you off the trail, so ... *shrug*.

I'm assuming Tyagi did a morph-check offscreen. I've gotten feedback that I maybe leave /too/ much offscreen, but for small stuff like that I've got to drop it or each chapter will start topping 16000 words.

I think literal million-dollar donations to animal charities will catch the eye ... it's a feelgood heartwarming story, and in the middle of a chaotic, scary month, there are going to be stories like that that float to the top just because people want /something/ positive to cling to.

Thanks for the ... compliment? ... about complexity/layers. A part of what I want to show is that the Animorphs aren't and can't possibly be the only players, that other things are swirling around the edges. They're central, they're important, but they're /not/ the be-all-and-end-all.

I have absolutely zero little black box. Jake is everything I'm not---I'm actually really bad at modeling other people and quite slow/low-resolution when it comes to empathy. At least in part, r!Animorphs is practice. Thanks for the kudos, though. <3
