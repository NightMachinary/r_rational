I am going to put a vote for leaving too much offscreen. The mentions about the factory thing made me wonder if I had missed a chapter or something. It would've been cool to see how Ax perceived the joining of Temrash and Essak in his head as well.

Might I suggest splitting things into multiple shorter chapters that are from the same Animorph's POV?
