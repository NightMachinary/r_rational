  Why would a news story about donations to animal shelters at all be given attention by the general public amidst the sea of other world-breaking news?

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/6d3aye/staff_at_small_animal_shelter_blown_away_by/][Staff at small animal shelter 'blown away' by $275,000 gift]] is currently at 1730 karma and rising. And I expect that [[/r/UpliftingNews]] would be more popular under the circumstances than it is in reality, and the multiple $1M donations would be more attention-grabbing.
