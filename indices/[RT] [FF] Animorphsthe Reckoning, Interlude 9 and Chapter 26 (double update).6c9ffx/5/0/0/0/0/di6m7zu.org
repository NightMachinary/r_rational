Surely it would need to be a pretty large rock to be effective? which means that zpace engines can cover far more than has previously been indicated.

Or do they have some way of accelerating the rock a lot? (I'm assuming for this that z-space works like a wormhole type thing, where the momentum of teh object is unchanged afterwards.)
