Thanks for the long feedback! I've had fun playing around with the Animorphs being spooked about Visser Three.

If I haven't screwed things up in previous chapters, the Andalite chain of command is completely oblivious to the fact that there's a Z-space rift around the system. They'll set a rock up with a hyperdrive, wait 6.9 cycles, launch it, and not actually know that it got "stuck in the quicksand."

And yeah, mindfulness all around. :)
