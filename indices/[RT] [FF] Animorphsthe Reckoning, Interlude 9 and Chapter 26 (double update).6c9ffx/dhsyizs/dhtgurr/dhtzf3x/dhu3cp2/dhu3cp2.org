That would be embarrassing RE: ConteauBleu.

Yeah, not trying to lecture. The story is important enough to me that your insistence that keeps me from enjoying via lurking.

One thing that potentially concerns me is how much explanation and back/forth we're getting from the story in these threads. The story is very dense in details, and it's easy to forget what people know and what they don't. It's easy to miss a sentence or two of necessary explanation/exposition, especially if it's stated in a thread.

I haven't done a reread yet, so please don't take it as a direct accusation, it's just an easy pitfall to fall into. I want very much to be able to show this to people and have them be able to follow it. This is honestly one of the most ambitious pieces of fiction I have read, and you're handling all of it extraordinarily well. I'm just nervous watching the guy walk on the tightrope, you know?
