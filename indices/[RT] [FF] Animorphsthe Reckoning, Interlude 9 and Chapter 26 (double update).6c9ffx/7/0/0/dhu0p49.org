So when you say hivemind Ax, do you mean the entity that comprises Temrash, Aximili, Tom-/dain/ and Elfangor-/dain/? Or do you mean the entirety of the Andalite society's /eib/ harmony? Because I gotta say, Andalite society from what I've seen so far ironically reminds me a lot of the Yeerk coalescions...

The hivemind part is cool, don't get me wrong. But so far it feels like a constant string of 1 step forward by the Animorphs, and 5 steps back thanks to the Andalites/Esplin/EC. I hope something good happens soon. Realistically, I realize that sometimes that's just the way life is - a stream of nonstop shit flying your way. But if I as a reader am starting to feel pretty darn depressed by how bleak this is, these characters who are in the thick of it must be feeling even worse.

Finally, what's really hitting me hard is not only Lirem's ultimatum, it's Aximili betraying his team right after he realizes at the start of the chapter that they trust him, even with Temrash in his head. Fuck's sake, Ax.
