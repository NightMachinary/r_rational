I agree with your point about reddit karma, but I think I want to leave it alone anyway---it's not /entirely/ transparent, but I think it scans reasonably well, and it sounds better than "upvotes" to me.

We can bend our spines; Ax bends a bit at the waist and curves a bit higher.

7 cycles = ~23 days (a cycle is ~3.4 days).

[[#s][The real question is]]

I wasn't going for /total/ bleakness---I was hoping some people would be excited about the potential of hivemind Ax, as well as the idea that they can maybe pull the rug out from under the whole war effort. But yeah, the end is a bit harsh. Thanks for the compliment? =P

(I was also hoping that maybe some readers of canon might start FREAKING OUT about hivemind Ax, but so far everyone seems down with it.)

Next chapter should be interesting. For the record, I have a long string of relatively-set plot points starting like three or four chapters /from now,/ and I'm now trying to figure out what kind of chaos gets us from here to there.
