I'd say tweak this to 'reddit karma' for those who might not be familiar with the site.

How on earth does Ax nod? At the waist?

Oh shit. how long is 7 cycles?

So many things going on in this chapter...every faction doing their own thing right now, and Esplin is tweaking the strings of each one. I guess we'll see soon whether he can actually keep track of every one, or whether he's going to micromanage himself into a corner.

Now that I think about it, the Tom-/dain/ from Temrash possibly explains what's going on with Esplin, with his shadow of Alloran...

Could Seerow's /dain/ in Lirem be moved to perform yet another kindness?

Edit: Now that I've had the time to think over this for an hour...my overall feeling about this chapter is a sense of bleakness/hopelessness. It's the combination of a small group of humans facing 3 different forces all much greater than they are, combined with 'Ax, are you ever going to stop screwing up?' and 'are they ever going to catch a break?' If that was your intention to invoke that in the reader, nicely done. It's pretty darn encompassing.
