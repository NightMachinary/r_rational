I'd say, looking at the long term, I sympathize with the yeerk dilemma in general and the dilemma of these yeerks in Aximili's and Peter's heads in particular, but medium to short term, I am highly suspicious when yeerks give andalites cinnamon buns or remind them about the existence of cinnamon buns.

I basically read this chapter as Aximili's part of the hive mind being the narrator, insofar as that is possible. i.e. it seems to me that we still have more direct insight into Aximili's mind than we have into Temrash's mind. That may influence how I interpret things.
