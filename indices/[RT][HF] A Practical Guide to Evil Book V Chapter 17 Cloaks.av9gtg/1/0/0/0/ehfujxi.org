in story, yeah but we do know that she has a story-based artifact (the sword) that she's been slowly feeding night to, a sword that'll be unsheathed for killing one particular foe.

That's the awesome part, we know this only because we're seeing her headspace as the canvas of the story. In-story, nothing has been mentioned and the mechanics of how she's going to do this aren't clear either, so we have something to look forward to.
