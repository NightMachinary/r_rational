I really appreciated the part where Cat recognizes her bond with Indrani as something deeper and more precious than the bonds she's had of romantic love or sex. In fiction, it's not often that a platonic relationship (or in this case, a platonic aspect /of/ a relationship) is treated as equally important as romantic ones, much as less as /more/ important.
