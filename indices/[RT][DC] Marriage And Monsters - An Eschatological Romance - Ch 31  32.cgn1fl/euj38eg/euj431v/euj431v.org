Oh, the shittiest of fanfics: Harry x Snape AND Draco x Rando! It's going to be fantastic while it lasts, which I don't think will be long.

I think it's because Haley's story right now is dealing with the fallout from the last arc while also trying to set up the next arc, but Sean is having to deal with none of that and just sorta jumped right in to his arc without any baggage from the story prior; his story feels fresh and new.
