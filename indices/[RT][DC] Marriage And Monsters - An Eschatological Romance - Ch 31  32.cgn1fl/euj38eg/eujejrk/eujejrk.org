Hmm. I think I feel you, and I want to dive into that a bit but first I want to reinforce massively how much I'm loving this work. Srsly FormerlySarsaparilla, I'm really looking forward to every new chapter :)

I feel like ashinator's right, tho. There's something... missing, from the Hailey chapters. There's something to Sean's chapters that just brings them /alive/. A depth to his narrative voice that none of the other characters quite have - although, I'd include, well, everyone else in that, not just Haley.

I feel like... Hmm. I feel like the author is just invested in Sean's story more than anyone else's - Sean's story is proactive in a way that I don't think the other character's stories are. Everyone else is beholden either to circumstance or character, but I feel like Sean gets choices. Not always - the chase, for example, or the overall arc of "getting back to Haley", but enough.

I want to harken to "Plus-Minus-Interesting" analysis. Haley's recent bought with the ring is a good example: this was a false choice for the character; there's no way she could have chosen any differently and remained true to herself. When the pluses and minuses were weighed, the choice was obvious.

Contrast with Sean's apparent lack of choice in fanfiction: there's many other magical school stories to choose from, why that one? The pluses and minuses don't add up to an obvious conclusion (at least, not from here), and that makes it interesting, I'm thinking?

I think... as someone definitely not in the arena, so definitely feel free to ignore the shit out me, just keep doing what you're doing and throwing the characters into situations to see what happens?

I want to reiterate: I'm absolutely loving this story and can't wait for more. In this chapter, the internal view of Haley gradually justifying her actions to herself was pretty fantastic :D
