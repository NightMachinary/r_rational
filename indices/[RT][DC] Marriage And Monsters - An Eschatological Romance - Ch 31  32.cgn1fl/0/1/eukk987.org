It's because her point of view, as explained in this chapter, is diametrically opposed to that of most people who frequent this subreddit. Most people here are more like Sean, they want to find out what ticks and they would want a good person to seize power and force everyone to cooperate.

I know I would fall to the Ring. Not even a question.

Because of that, and because the writer is good at showing her POV, it is less satisfying to the readers because they can't identify with it in the way they normally would.

The position she espouses here is probably a good one for a real life rationalist in her position in the real world, but it is anathema to that of a rational fiction protagonist. And that's what people are here to read.
