It all started when a reader suggested KR (this reviewer) to the author, who is kind of notorious for arguing with reviewers who don't like his book, and said (truthfully) that KR reviews lesser-known works and is fair in his reviews. The author responded scathingly, and when KR heard about that exchange, that's when the pettiness came in.

The scary part is that the six-hour review is actually truncated from his notes. KR has a gimmick of adding coloured note tabs to the books he reviews - one colour for spelling/grammar errors, one for plot points to discuss, whatever. This book, when he held it in shot, looked like a rainbow porcupine. The guy is thorough.
