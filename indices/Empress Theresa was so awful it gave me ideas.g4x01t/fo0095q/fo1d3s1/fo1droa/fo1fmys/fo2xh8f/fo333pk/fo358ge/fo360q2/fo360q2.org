I suppose if that's true then it's true right now yet, and would be true for anyone and any action you take. If it's not true and saying the best utility works then there's no problem.

So you might as well optimise utility to whatever you think it is. You can simulate every possible mind having a conference where they decide on a utility function, and simulate AIs with infinite computer power and then choose one of those.

But yes if someone who thought life and happiness and existence was evil took over then their utility function would be the annihilation of everything. Though it seems like the exact same would be satisfied if they shot themselves in the head. Well someone who's utility function values non p zombies suffering they'd still fill the universe with stuff
