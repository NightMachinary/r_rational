What could be an interesting variation: every time someone from one of the bickering factions enters the disputed zone, a new copy of the zone is generated (and it vanishes when they leave). They get to have their very own holy region all to themselves, meaning it 100% belongs to whatever that one person wants it to belong to, for as long as they're prepared to stay there.

Anyone not in the bickering factions gets to enter the original version. Which is probably now significantly calmer.
