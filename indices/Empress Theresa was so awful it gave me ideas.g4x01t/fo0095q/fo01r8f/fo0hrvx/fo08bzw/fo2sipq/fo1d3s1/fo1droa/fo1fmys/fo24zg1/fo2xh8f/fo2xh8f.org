We might be disagreeing on a fundamental thing, though - in particular, i strongly suspect that even if there is some universal metric by which different universal utility functions (that is to say, functions that take the state of the universe as input and give a utility value as an output) can be measured and ranked, and there is such an function that has a maximal value by that metric, that that function is the only such one.

Besides that, smallest consciousnesses in a state of eternal bliss is boring even if it maximizes a sufficiently naive utility function.
