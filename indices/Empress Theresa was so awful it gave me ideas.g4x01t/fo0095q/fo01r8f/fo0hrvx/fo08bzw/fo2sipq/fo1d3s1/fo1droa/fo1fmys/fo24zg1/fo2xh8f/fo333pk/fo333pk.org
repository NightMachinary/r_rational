I see your point but there won't be "different universal utility functions" there will just the one of whoever gets the omnipotent powers. I can't imagine that most people have that many variables for a utility function, and you have to expect that most people have happiness weighted as the most. But whatever utility function is it certainly won't result in earth or planets or vacuums or all the other wasted inanimate matter and lack of matter. No reason to have entropy or laws of conservation or any of those physical rules.

Definitely boring but I'm not sure boring is the standard we set for how god should operate, or how on [[/r/rational]] rather than [[/r/coolthoughtexperiments]] should answer. I'm not sure that it's a naive function either, there is wisdom in simplicity.
