  That would instantly kill everyone everywhere. Entropy is the reason why, among other things, osmosis works, and you kind of need that for life.
#+end_quote

I don't know why anyone would enable anything other than willing considered death. Why would you need osmosis? You're omnipotent having things stuck to physical laws is a design flaw.

#+begin_quote
  I never said it was (I said "killing isn't unjust" is absurd), but you didn't describe utilitarianism. You described killing one person to bring about a billion happy people in the future (unless I misread that, but the way it was phrased implied creating more people), which could be justified with utilitarianism, but whether that's a good thing to do within utilitarianism is an open issue. It's one of the outcomes that people who try to make utilitarian theories try to avoid, since it gives weird prescriptions when it comes to policy. But it's hard to formulate an argument against it given the nature of utilitarianism (human happiness has diminishing returns, human number doesn't).
#+end_quote

The most ethical outcome for the most number of people. That's utilitarianism. Just because some people aren't happy with what that means and then decide to add in things so you don't kill people and steal their organs (which is really a practical flaw in how humans behave, as if humans were all rational it would not be an issue, it's only an issue because it changes how people/society behaves) doesn't apply at all to being omnipotent. You don't need to worry about practicality, long term social consequences, or anything else.

  Changing that wouldn't mean changing the waveform, it would mean changing the laws of physics themselves, with the end result not being a waveform (wavelike properties are what gives rise to uncertainty, and also electrons not being pulled into the center of atoms).
#+end_quote

Oh fair enough then, I thought a universe completely empty of any matter would still have a waveform and be deterministic but I guess I misunderstood that. In that case change off a waveform yeah.

#+begin_quote
  The idea is that all else being the same people would generally prefer to live vs not to, so whatever hypothetical reality you're talking about would be full of people who would rather you made the choices that lead to them existing.

  On average, this is true- the average person wouldn't take the choice to retroactively erase themselves from existence. For the most part unhappy people would still like to exist, so if you're worried about helping the most amount of people then you should work to make a larger number of people, regardless of their quality of life, since they'd still want to exist. Looking at utility you also get better results making a lot of unhappy people than a few happy ones since happiness runs into diminishing returns.
#+end_quote

I mean this is absurd. If you're God why would you care at all about what people want? If there's a world where people get really blissful about torturing people, and only when the people are not p zombies and really actually get tortured and the net gain is insane compared to the other gains then we should follow it because that's what they want?

If I really cared that people "want" to exist I'd simply make them all suicidal a microsecond before I changed the universe to be a bliss continuum.

I simply do not agree with this. Unhappy people are a net negative on utility that values happiness, unless they will produce enough offspring or cause to others enough happiness to outweigh them. But regardless if you are god why would you allow unhappiness anyway

There is no issue with diminishing returns when you are god because you can turn off diminishing returns.
