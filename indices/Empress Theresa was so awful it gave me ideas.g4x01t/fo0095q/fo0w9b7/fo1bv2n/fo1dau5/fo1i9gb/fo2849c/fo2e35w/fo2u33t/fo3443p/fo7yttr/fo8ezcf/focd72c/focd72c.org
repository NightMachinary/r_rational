  Yes but if you're turning off entropy I would think it would be obvious that you would also be keeping the universe functional for your goals
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure it's mathematically impossible to turn off entropy and keep the universe functioning in any sense of the word. Entropy is the observation that things tend to spread out over time, and an extension of a property of information besides.

You forgot some > btw.

  I already discussed this with another person. If there's no scenario in which you can use omnipotence to derive any moral philosophy, that is even having every potential mind meet up and derive a utility function, or simulating people talking about it for 10 trillion year or making 10 quadrillion AIs whose only job is to find the best moral function.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure you can prove it (proving a negative and all that), but it seems very likely from observation that there's no objective morality and the is/ought problem is one of those unsolvable things, making the scenario you lay out here doomed to fail. If you're not having them reach an objective ethical system, but rather one that ties together existing intuitions, then that's /what I'm arguing for/, and it certainly wouldn't look like a "happiness above all else" system. If you can solve it the whole discussion is moot, since it relies on information we can't know anyway, and if you can't we're back at me saying "wow that's pretty fucked up".

  You can define it however you like. Whatever you define as ethical as and you do it to the most people is utilitarianism.
#+end_quote

That's not really the definition of utilitarianism. If you define an /action/ as ethical as opposed to an outcome, you're doing deontology. If you define a person as ethical you're doing virtue ethics. The issue is that the lack of an objective utility function puts you on the same level as the rest of us, so if the rest of us thing your utility function leads to immoral outcomes you don't really have anything to appeal to.

#+begin_quote
  All outcomes are moral if my axiom is that utilitarianism is moral.
#+end_quote

And if the rest of us disagree? Modern ethics focuses around taking things that we all agree seem ethical and trying to make a theory about them so that we can solve the more controversial problems. If A => B, and B => C, then A =>C; where A and B are things we agree on, C is one choice in a controversy, and what we're trying to find is =>. In a subjective situation the best we can do is try to all agree, there's nothing noble about choosing a reductive => and ignoring that most others would disagree.

  Why on earth would you say unhappy and mean low happiness? That seems like you're being deliberately misleading for no benefit...
#+end_quote

Unhappy is low happiness. We have no way to define happiness such that there is anything below 0, because as far as we can tell there really isn't an objective measure of happiness. What we do is try to fit people on a scale from what we've observed as least happy to most happy, in that case we have no place to actually put an objective 0.

  Egoism is one of the least shaky moral philosophies. In fact it's almost impossible to have "shaky" foundations if you're consistent since everyone has arbitrary axioms. Generally acknowledged that black people were inferior, general acknowledgement means nothing. And if you do value that then you can get a solution for what you should do as a God by consensus of every possible mind as I mentioned earlier.
#+end_quote

Racism was contradicted by other morals, it certainly wasn't an appreciation of the science that's lead to it reducing over time. The foundations of an ethical philosophy shouldn't /just/ be internal consistency, though that's important, they should also align with existing intuitions about what is moral. Ethics is hard, reading a LessWrong post won't solve it for you. As an aside LW generally takes a very... sophomoric approach to fields, the whole problem of someone who's self-taught not being told they're wrong or knowing where the current research is, so I wouldn't try to learn much from it directly.

#+begin_quote
  The reason people say unhappy people shouldn't be murdered is because we live in a society and humans psychologically react to that. If you're omnipotent you do not have worry about the impacts of that.
#+end_quote

This is where you differ from nearly everyone else, since the rest of us would say death is inherently bad even aside from whatever consequences you'd face from killing.

#+begin_quote
  A lot of moral philosophy is people having certain outcomes they like and then just working backwards until they can justify it
#+end_quote

Well, /yeah/. Where else are you going to start? Any axioms are just as subjective, being based on the same sort of thinking of arbitrarily choosing one thing as good. The difference is that working back from what seems moral gives a theory that actually leads to outcomes that seem moral, whereas starting from a reductive axiom leads to things that seem awful. This is why the people who spend their lives thinking about these things (and have covered the same territory you are) focus more on trying to fit intuitions together than on ignoring them and choosing an entirely other set of subjective goals. Another thing to consider is practical application- humans are very bad at predicting the future, even with math, and we can't measure happiness very well. Trying to maximize happiness is nearly impossible in most situations, so you have to fall back on heuristics which probably look almost identical to what we think of as normal moral behavior. You just argue yourself back into square one.
