From a position of omnipotence you have the infinite time of the universe presuming that you can disable entropy. And potentially the multiverse too.

If we imagine the perfect universe with maximum utility then I don't think we see flawed humans who experience unhappiness.

Regardless if its a real problem for you taking all living creatures including bacteria and put their brain into a vat then simulate a universe or just make them happy.

I definitely don't think to say utilitarianism is absurd is true. Whatever decision you make or don't will butterfly effect quadrillions of possible lives. To minimise potential death if that's what you care about changing the waveform of the universe to be deterministic and removing the possibility of future life is the easiest and most moral solution

Also definitely don't agree that existence is better than not, I don't think bacteria have an opinion and sapient creatures can suffer and do kill themselves or increase their risk of death anyway. No one behaves like living is the most important thing
