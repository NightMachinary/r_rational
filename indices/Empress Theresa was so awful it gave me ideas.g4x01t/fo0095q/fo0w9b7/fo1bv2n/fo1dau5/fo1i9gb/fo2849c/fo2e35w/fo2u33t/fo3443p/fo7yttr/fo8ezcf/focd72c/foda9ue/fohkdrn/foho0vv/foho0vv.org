  Are you going to make the universe an infinite expanse of people on a morphine high? You're missing out on a lot of other goods by reducing the human experience to seratonin.
#+end_quote

Yes I linked the SMBC comic I thought it was quite clear.

#+begin_quote
  WDYM? I said internal consistency is important, but you also need your theory to contain the existing intuitions. That's the whole point. The moralizing to justify racism conflicted with other moral beliefs, which eventually lead to it becoming less popular over time.
#+end_quote

People didn't give up racism because it conflicted with their moral beliefs. Racism ended because it wasn't economic. Meat eating will end when it's not economic.

And tons of people had sound moral frameworks in which slavery was justified, just like people have sound moral frameworks to justify their consumption of meat, or going on holiday, or not giving their entire income up to save 20 people from starvation or w/e.

#+begin_quote
  You're basically ignoring all that in the pursuit of a simple and internally consistent system, but that system you've come up with doesn't actually match up with the rest of our intuitions about what is ethical, so it's no more justifiable than any other hypothetically consistent system.
#+end_quote

Yes as I said the only thing that makes it more justifiable is that my system never has to argue with someone about why happiness is arbitrarily worth 5.425 and not 5.421.

#+begin_quote
  Is it? Is it the only good? Make an argument besides "it is". Or rather, argue why anything else isn't good.
#+end_quote

Anything else is good because it causes happiness.

#+begin_quote
  Someone just murdered 10 people. Instead of remorse they feel joy. Our intuitions about morality say this is worse. It's only better if you've already accepted and internalized the proposition that happiness is the ultimate good- it's begging the question to argue this is better than someone being unhappy about committing murder.
#+end_quote

Which universe is superior?

11 people spawn. 1 person kills 10 people. They feel sad. The universe ends.

11 people spawn. 1 person kills 10 people. They feel happy. The universe ends.

Quite clear to me.

#+begin_quote
  Virtue ethics says that some people are good and whatever they do is good regardless of what it is. It's protagonist centered morality applied to real life and hasn't been in vogue in centuries (unless you count the Nazis).
#+end_quote

??? Virtue ethics is more popular than deontology and consequentialism among philosophers, the more this conversation goes on the more I feel like you're just wasting my time

  aligned with existing intuitions

  Slavery violated other moral axioms
#+end_quote

I'm done with this conversation. I've repeated a hundred times that people intuitively were okay with slavery and meat eating and yet you seem determined to pretend that there was no historical philosophers who supported slavery within all of their moral axioms. I refuse to engage with someone who believes that people who supported slavery were all just being inconsistent, or weren't following their intuitions
