  I'm pretty sure it's mathematically impossible to turn off entropy and keep the universe functioning in any sense of the word. Entropy is the observation that things tend to spread out over time, and an extension of a property of information besides.
#+end_quote

I think you're being obtuse here and it makes me not to want to continue the discussion. Can't you steelman me here rather than make me go through a define what I mean exactly what I would do as omnipotent when I just short hand say get rid of entropy? If you can't "mathematically" undo the trend to disorder you can just pump energy in from a magic omnipotent source. Whether that means spawning suns in or whatever you want.

  You forgot some > btw.

my bad

  I'm not sure you can prove it (proving a negative and all that), but it seems very likely from observation that there's no objective morality and the is/ought problem is one of those unsolvable things, making the scenario you lay out here doomed to fail. If you're not having them reach an objective ethical system, but rather one that ties together existing intuitions, then that's what I'm arguing for, and it certainly wouldn't look like a "happiness above all else" system. If you can solve it the whole discussion is moot, since it relies on information we can't know anyway, and if you can't we're back at me saying "wow that's pretty fucked up".
#+end_quote

i would not argue for tying together other systems, i said: i would make the universe maximum utility, someone said: what is maximum utility, i said: the happiness molecules

i think mathematically you'd be hard pressed to find something with higher maximum utility than the simplest possible beings that feel constantly amazing as tightly packed as possible. any compromise solution like you are suggesting would be inferior to that as it seems like you won't genocide the whole universe so you're going to be stuck with badly designed (evolved) people who are not optimised for the maximization of anything

anything you do to maximise utility i could do and also change the mind of the person to enjoy it more, and also split the consciousness of that person into a billion so there are more people experiencing that positive utility

  Unhappy is low happiness. We have no way to define happiness such that there is anything below 0, because as far as we can tell there really isn't an objective measure of happiness. What we do is try to fit people on a scale from what we've observed as least happy to most happy, in that case we have no place to actually put an objective 0.
#+end_quote

Unhappiness is sadness.

Least happy is not the same as being sad. You know what the least happy thing is? A rock. Is a rock unhappy? No. The least excited thing is a rock. Is it bored? No

#+begin_quote
  That's not really the definition of utilitarianism. If you define an action as ethical as opposed to an outcome, you're doing deontology. If you define a person as ethical you're doing virtue ethics. The issue is that the lack of an objective utility function puts you on the same level as the rest of us, so if the rest of us thing your utility function leads to immoral outcomes you don't really have anything to appeal to.
#+end_quote

I quoted the definition of utilitarianism, I did not write the definition. Yes, I agree if it leads to immoral outcomes there is nothing to appeal to. Except there will be no immoral outcome because everything is justified if it increases utility. Torturing that person increases utility? It's not an immoral outcome then.

#+begin_quote
  And if the rest of us disagree? Modern ethics focuses around taking things that we all agree seem ethical and trying to make a theory about them so that we can solve the more controversial problems. If A => B, and B => C, then A =>C; where A and B are things we agree on, C is one choice in a controversy, and what we're trying to find is =>. In a subjective situation the best we can do is try to all agree, there's nothing noble about choosing a reductive => and ignoring that most others would disagree.
#+end_quote

Fine by me disagree as you like I am not interested in this motive as this would lead to the justification of racism or meat eating.

#+begin_quote
  Racism was contradicted by other morals, it certainly wasn't an appreciation of the science that's lead to it reducing over time. The foundations of an ethical philosophy shouldn't just be internal consistency, though that's important, they should also *align with existing intuitions* about what is moral. Ethics is hard, reading a LessWrong post won't solve it for you. As an aside LW generally takes a very... sophomoric approach to fields, the whole problem of someone who's self-taught not being told they're wrong or knowing where the current research is, so I wouldn't try to learn much from it directly.
#+end_quote

There was tons of moralizing to do with justifying racism, just as there is with meat eating. I disagree that internal consistency is less important than anything else. If your moral philosophy is not consistent then it is not sound. This is classic washing technique people try to do where they act like no philosophers ever thought about the bad parts of the past and only we're so lucky now that everyone is thinking about things and we know what's good and bad correctly this time!

I VEHEMENTLY disagree with the bolded statement. Clearly we are approaching morality in a different way, anyone who suggests this would have been an advocate for slavery, probably supports meat eating and more.

#+begin_quote
  This is where you differ from nearly everyone else, since the rest of us would say death is inherently bad even aside from whatever consequences you'd face from killing.
#+end_quote

Sure I don't have an issue disagreeing with people as I said. I can look at poll results for any sort of thing that I would not like and see that "nearly everyone else" certainly has swung all over the place throughout history, even in the last 100 years that we even have records. Regardless I am hardly unique I've spoken with dozens of utilitarians who accept that conclusion.

#+begin_quote
  Well, yeah. Where else are you going to start? Any axioms are just as subjective, being based on the same sort of thinking of arbitrarily choosing one thing as good. The difference is that working back from what seems moral gives a theory that actually leads to outcomes that seem moral, whereas starting from a reductive axiom leads to things that seem awful. This is why the people who spend their lives thinking about these things (and have covered the same territory you are) focus more on trying to fit intuitions together than on ignoring them and choosing an entirely other set of subjective goals. Another thing to consider is practical application- humans are very bad at predicting the future, even with math, and we can't measure happiness very well. Trying to maximize happiness is nearly impossible in most situations, so you have to fall back on heuristics which probably look almost identical to what we think of as normal moral behavior. You just argue yourself back into square one.
#+end_quote

Start from the axiom?

What would good axioms be, well happiness is literally good. If you have a scenario and you add happiness to it it literally cannot be worse. I can't think of a single other trait that this is true to.

I'm not going to be someone who goes "oh wow that outcome makes me feel bad so let's go back and randomly change my axioms until they are completely arbitrary until there's absolutely no way I could convince anyone else that they should assign a weight of 3.35 to happiness and 4124.56345 to liberty and -1234904 to unwanted death or whatever other stupid numbers would come as a result of trying to actually institute these moral philosophies.

Because that's what you're doing when you add more than one axiom. If you say unwanted death is good, and happiness is good then you have to tell me how much happiness is worth an unwanted death. 100 billion? etc

Virtue ethics side steps this problem iirc
