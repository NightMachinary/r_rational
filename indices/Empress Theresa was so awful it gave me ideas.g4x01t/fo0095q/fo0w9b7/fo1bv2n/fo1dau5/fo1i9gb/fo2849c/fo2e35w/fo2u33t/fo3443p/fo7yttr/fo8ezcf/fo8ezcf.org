  Because... biology. You never said anything other than turning off entropy and my brain went to "well I guess time is physically meaningless now".
#+end_quote

Yes but if you're turning off entropy I would think it would be obvious that you would also be keeping the universe functional for your goals

  K, define ethical. It's not easy, it's not solved. The issue I mentioned earlier- where you make a lot of very unhappy people (or very low happiness people if you want to say that happiness can be negative) instead of a few happy people- is an outcome of utilitarianism unless you try to build things in a way to avoid that. Most utilitarians seem to dislike this outcome, as it seems unethical.

Among other things it prescribes no abortion in the case of rape, no attempts to deal with climate change unless it threatens mass extinction of humanity, etc.

Utilitarianism isn't objective, no moral philosophy is. In order to construct a utilitarian theory you first need a theory of what outcomes are ethical, and so pointing out that a utilitarian theory leads to an immoral outcome is a valid criticism. Arguably the most valid criticism. If your ethical theory focuses on the method rather than the outcome it's not utilitarian, it's deontological. Any working utilitarian theory has to lead to ethical outcomes exclusively.

I already discussed this with another person. If there's no scenario in which you can use omnipotence to derive any moral philosophy, that is even having every potential mind meet up and derive a utility function, or simulating people talking about it for 10 trillion year or making 10 quadrillion AIs whose only job is to find the best moral function.

Then you can't do it without omnipotence and you shouldn't take any action at all because you can't know if it's actually good or not.

You can define it however you like. Whatever you define as ethical as and you do it to the most people is utilitarianism.

I agree morality isn't objective. I don't agree that if I say that my morality is aligned with utilitarian that you can then say that outcomes are immoral. All outcomes are moral if my axiom is that utilitarianism is moral.

Oh, yes. Absolutely low happiness and unhappiness are completely different. So yes I absolutely agree that billions of slightly or bored people are better than one really happy person.

Why on earth would you say unhappy and mean low happiness? That seems like you're being deliberately misleading for no benefit...

  If you see no problem with ignoring the desires of others when making decisions, your morality has shaky foundations. It's generally acknowledged that self-determination is a right.
#+end_quote

Egoism is one of the least shaky moral philosophies. In fact it's almost impossible to have "shaky" foundations if you're consistent since everyone has arbitrary axioms. Generally acknowledged that black people were inferior, general acknowledgement means nothing. And if you do value that then you can get a solution for what you should do as a God by consensus of every possible mind as I mentioned earlier.

#+begin_quote
  Well, you're wrong, happiness shows diminishing returns to the best of our ability to measure it. Our methods of measuring happiness don't go below 0, so you can't really argue that someone is a net negative on happiness without postulating a measurement that doesn't even exist. Setting any level at 0 is arbitrary and leads to mass murder of unhappy people- an outcome to be avoided.
#+end_quote

I was clearly and obviously treating unhappiness as meaning negative happiness like everyone in the world does. It is better to kill slightly unhappy people than let them exist (assuming every man is an island) if your utility function is maximising happiness.

The reason people say unhappy people shouldn't be murdered is because we live in a society and humans psychologically react to that. If you're omnipotent you do not have worry about the impacts of that. A lot of moral philosophy is people having certain outcomes they like and then just working backwards until they can justify it, if you approach it by deciding on an axiom first (ie I value happiness) you would never get these outcomes. It's most obvious in statements like those.

  Sticking everyone in a pleasure coma is also a bad end for humanity, unless you've completely lost sight of morality in an attempt to make something objective by being stubbornly reductive.
#+end_quote

Disagree, the only reason you say that is personal taste. I obviously think a pleasure coma is boring but I don't make rational decisions based on stuff being exciting.

If we compare two universes, one with the happy having finished the universe and any other one, that universe will win in terms of bliss, happiness, outcomes, equality, any ethical measurement you want.
