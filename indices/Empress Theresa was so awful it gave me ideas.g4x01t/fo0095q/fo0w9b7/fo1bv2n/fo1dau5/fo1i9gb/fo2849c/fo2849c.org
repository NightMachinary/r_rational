I think the argument that existing is inherently better than not existing is pretty deeply flawed, even in the context of moral philosophy.

You don't need magic to create a fate worse than death. People are perfectly sufficient.

Assuming a perfectly moral world might change that answer, but it also makes the question irrelevant as anything but an educational concept model, much like Newtonian physics or electron orbital shells. They're decent models for learning fundamentals and building the right thought patterns for the work you're doing, but they break down rapidly when applied to reality.
