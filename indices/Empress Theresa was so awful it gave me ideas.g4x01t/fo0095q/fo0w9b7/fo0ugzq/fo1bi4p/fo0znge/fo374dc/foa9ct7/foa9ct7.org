Yes - an unopposed omnipotent protag would make a boring book, as it did with Empress Theresa. This is why I didn't think there was much potential in the original concept, but once the omnipotent 'villain' was established and basically in control of the world, and the story briefly introduced the prospect of new omnipotents arising to oppose her, /that/ felt like it had more potential.

Big powers need to come with equally big setbacks in order to make a happy ending feel earned.
