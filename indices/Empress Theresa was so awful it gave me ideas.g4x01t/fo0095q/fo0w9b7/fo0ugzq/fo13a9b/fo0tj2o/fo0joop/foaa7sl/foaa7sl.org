(Loved that episode and the short story it's based on.) If only the author were more self-aware, it would've been a wonderful horror book. As it is, it's only unintentionally horrifying. Though [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror][Fridge Horror]] (TV Tropes warning) does have a special charm of its own.
