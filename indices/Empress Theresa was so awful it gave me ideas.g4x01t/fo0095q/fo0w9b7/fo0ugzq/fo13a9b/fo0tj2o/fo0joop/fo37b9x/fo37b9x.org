Wildbow was apparently considering writing a story like that before he started Worm. In [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/prey-14-8/#comment-4589][a comment]] he says that one of the possible protagonists for his Parahumans story was a new Parahuman on the world of Earth Supreme, where a cape named Goddess rules over the entire world, as she has many really strong powers, among those is one that makes other capes "aligned" to her by changing their priorities to always think of her interests before anything else.

That setting (or more like, its remnants after Gold Morning) is explored somewhat in Ward. The people who were oppressed by capes during Goddess' rule violently overthrew their rulers, and forged a factious world government. They are /extremely/ cape-phobic, while simultaneously having some of the most advanced research on powers.
