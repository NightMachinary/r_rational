I do absolutely adore the aesthetic of this. Floating islands, sky oceans...

And I felt that "I'm probably a terrible person to become the space wizard" so hard because yeah. I have very human, i.e. skewed, priorities. "Make all dogs immortal" would be my training-wheels project. "Raise red pandas to sapience" would be my next, slightly further-reaching project. Humanity would be put on pause for these, so I could work out most of the bugs before risking harm to already-existing people. Basically Earth would be my learner world, and after /that/ was a safe, bio-diverse, stable garden planet, I'd start branching out and growing bolder...
