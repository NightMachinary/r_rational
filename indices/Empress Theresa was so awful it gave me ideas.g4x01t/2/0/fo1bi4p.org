You could write a nearly omnipotent protagonist who was /trying/ to be rational.

The first step would have them be deathly afraid of modifying their own mind.

Even if you do have them be smart enough to try intelligence enhancement, you could have them be concerned about what the optimal state even is. What /do/ they do about the Middle East? Do they just sort of hope people stop caring about it once all their needs are taken care of? When they try to duplicate the space, what do they do with the people who aren't satisfied with that solution?

How do they handle religious people who think they are tampering in gods domain? How do they handle religious people who think the protagonist is god?

Do they start a super powered CPS? Does anyone have a right to privacy from the demi-urge? Does anyone get to vote on measures?

At this point, it is basically a discourse on ethics with a super powered being acting as the viewpoint character.
