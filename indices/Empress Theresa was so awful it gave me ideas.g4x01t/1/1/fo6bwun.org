No because that's heresy. From the authors website:

#+begin_quote
  Theresa's faith is the source of her triumphï»¿. Take a large group of people.  Impose the same difficult situation on them.  Gradually increase the difficulty and watch what happens.  One by one people will drop out of the challenge.

  Theresa is challenged with difficulties she calls 'impossible', but she doesn't give up.  To much is at stake to give her the luxury of walking away. 

  What keeps her going?  She trusts that God will get her through it somehow.  Later in the story President Stinson expressed this idea:  "I can't believe a God who brought her this far without making mistakes will let her make one now."
