  presuming that you can disable entropy.
#+end_quote

That would instantly kill everyone everywhere. Entropy is the reason why, among other things, osmosis works, and you kind of need that for life.

  I definitely don't think to say utilitarianism is absurd is true.
#+end_quote

I never said it was (I said "killing isn't unjust" is absurd), but you didn't describe utilitarianism. You described killing one person to bring about a billion happy people in the future (unless I misread that, but the way it was phrased implied creating more people), which could be justified with utilitarianism, but whether that's a good thing to do within utilitarianism is an open issue. It's one of the outcomes that people who try to make utilitarian theories try to avoid, since it gives weird prescriptions when it comes to policy. But it's hard to formulate an argument against it given the nature of utilitarianism (human happiness has diminishing returns, human number doesn't).

Making a billion happy people in the future in exchange for one person dying now is a slightly less discomforting version of the non-identity problem than the standard version of choosing a future with more unhappy people over one with fewer happy people, but it runs directly into the problem the NID illustrates- how do we value people who don't yet exist?

  To minimise potential death if that's what you care about changing the waveform of the universe to be deterministic and removing the possibility of future life is the easiest and most moral solution
#+end_quote

That's mathematically impossible. If the universe is deterministic (within our timeline, many worlds gets around it by having everything happen) either some time travel/acausality is going on or we couldn't make the observations we have. That's just how the math works out in quantum physics, see Bell's Theorem (Bell preferred the acausality approach, actually). Changing that wouldn't mean changing the waveform, it would mean changing the laws of physics themselves, with the end result not being a waveform (wavelike properties are what gives rise to uncertainty, and also electrons not being pulled into the center of atoms).

  Also definitely don't agree that existence is better than not
#+end_quote

The idea is that all else being the same people would generally prefer to live vs not to, so whatever hypothetical reality you're talking about would be full of people who would rather you made the choices that lead to them existing. On average, this is true- the average person wouldn't take the choice to retroactively erase themselves from existence. For the most part unhappy people would still like to exist, so if you're worried about helping the most amount of people then you should work to make a larger number of people, regardless of their quality of life, since they'd still want to exist. Looking at utility you also get better results making a lot of unhappy people than a few happy ones since happiness runs into diminishing returns.
