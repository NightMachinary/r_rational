  Why would you need osmosis?

Because... biology. You never said anything other than turning off entropy and my brain went to "well I guess time is physically meaningless now".

  The most ethical outcome for the most number of people.

K, define ethical. It's not easy, it's not solved. The issue I mentioned earlier- where you make a lot of very unhappy people (or very low happiness people if you want to say that happiness can be negative) instead of a few happy people- is an outcome of utilitarianism unless you try to build things in a way to avoid that. Most utilitarians seem to dislike this outcome, as it seems unethical.

Among other things it prescribes no abortion in the case of rape, no attempts to deal with climate change unless it threatens mass extinction of humanity, etc.

Utilitarianism isn't objective, no moral philosophy is. In order to construct a utilitarian theory you first need a theory of what outcomes are ethical, and *so pointing out that a utilitarian theory leads to an immoral outcome is a valid criticism*. Arguably the /most/ valid criticism. If your ethical theory focuses on the method rather than the outcome it's not utilitarian, it's deontological. Any working utilitarian theory has to lead to ethical outcomes exclusively.

  If you're God why would you care at all about what people want?
#+end_quote

If you see no problem with ignoring the desires of others when making decisions, your morality has shaky foundations. It's generally acknowledged that self-determination is a right.

  I simply do not agree with this.

[[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010080228107][Well, you're wrong,]] happiness shows diminishing returns to the best of our ability to measure it. Our methods of measuring happiness don't go below 0, so you can't really argue that someone is a net negative on happiness without postulating a measurement that doesn't even exist. Setting any level at 0 is arbitrary and leads to mass murder of unhappy people- an outcome to be avoided.

#+begin_quote
  There is no issue with diminishing returns when you are god because you can turn off diminishing returns.

Sticking everyone in a pleasure coma is also a bad end for humanity, unless you've completely lost sight of morality in an attempt to make something objective by being stubbornly reductive.
