The author has a page on their website dedicated to explaining how the book is genius, and it's goddamn hilarious

[[http://empresstheresa.com/genius]]

Some highlights:

#+begin_quote
  Empress Theresa raises the bar of modern day writing in many ways.

  Point 1: The story is about a teenage girl just setting out to finding her place in the world. The flexibility and potential of youth define the future. This is illustrated in Theresa who changes the world with her firm moral compass and bravery.

  Point 4: Empress Theresa has an outstanding role model. Theresa is a wonderful girl. Amazon five star reviewer Non mess writes, ‘'Give empress theresq a try if you're seeking a good role model.'' A mother who read the book with her nine yo daughter wrote. ‘' My daughter's words.....I like Theresa. She is a nice girl and there are not many of those these days. I hope I am a good girl. I want to be good too.''﻿

  Point 5: Empress Theresa has simplicity. The recent bestseller "The Girl With A Dragon Tattoo" according to the wikipedia article about the book has twenty-nine characters. Empress Theresa has only ten major speaking roles: Theresa and Steve Hartley, Jan Struthers, Father Donuoughty, Prime Minister Blair, Prime Minister Scherzer, President Stinson, and in the Parker mansion, Edmund and Helen Parker, and Arthur Bemming. Their relationships with each other and with Theresa are simple because they have no conflicting interests. They all want Theresa to succeed.

  Besides few characters Empress Theresa is simple in not requiring the reader to have knowledge of any career. Theresa never has a job. She is a student, and then she is technically speaking unemployed

  Point 8: Empress Theresa dares to mention God and his involvement in human events﻿. Some people don't like to be reminded of that.

  A novel is supposed to illutrate reality. There is no reality more important than our total dependence on God. There is not a single atome in the center of the largest star in the most distant galaxy that would remain in existence one nanosecord if God didn't keep it in existence. Similarly, we would collapse back into the nothingness from which we came if God didn't sustain us. Theresa is conscious of this and puts her trust in Him.

  15 As symbolized by the above list, Theresa shows genius in bringing together volumes of information from many sources although there is nothing in her background to prepare her

  In the history of the human intellect, untrained, inexperienced, and using only its birthright equipment of untried capacities, there is nothing which approaches this. Joan of Arc stands alone, and must continue to stand alone, by reason of the unfellowed fact that in the things wherein she was great she was so without shade or suggestion of help from preparatory teaching, practice, environment, or experience. There is no one to compare her with, none to measure her by.﻿

  I have a list of 34 'spectacular and riveting' events in Empress Theresa. That's an average of one event every 13.64 pages. How many stories have you read that can keep up that frantic pace? ﻿

That's a whole 0.07 events per page! have you ever heard of such a fast paced and riveting story?
