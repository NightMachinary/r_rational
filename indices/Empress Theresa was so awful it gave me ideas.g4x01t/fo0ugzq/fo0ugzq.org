I feel like a omnipotent rational protagonist wouldn't be a very interesting story and might not be possible to write at all. The first thing they should do is make themselves superintellegent and omniscient, so they have perfect information and can make the absolute best decisions. Then solving every problem wouldn't be much different than playing a perfect game of tic tac toe. The problem with writing this is I don't think it's possible to show the perspective of someone so far beyond human level intelligence. You could write it from another perspective, but finding satisfying solutions to every problem that everyone realistically agrees with is going to be impossibly hard as well.
