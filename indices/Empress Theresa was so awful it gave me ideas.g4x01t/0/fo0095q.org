... wow, that's insane. I mean, the solution I'd go for creating a number of pocket-dimension copies of the regions, overwriting the original one, and glue them together with each other and the rest of the planet along the edges (or perhaps something less topologically troublesome). Then every side gets their own equally real copy of the entire region.
