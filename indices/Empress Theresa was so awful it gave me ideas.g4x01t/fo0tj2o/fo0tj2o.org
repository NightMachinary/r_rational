Honestly I'm probably a terrible person to become the omnicisacent space wizard because I wouldn't just tinker. I'd go wild and split the world up into something the size of Jupiter covered with floating islands each big enough for a nice house with a large garden.

Each person is given one island and a copy of my powers that only works within the bounds of their island. All islands are also encased in an indestructible shell to prevent you conjuring up a bunch of nuclear missiles and firing them. The only way to visit another island is to be invited, and everyone has an unblockable teleport home power to prevent someone using their power to keep them prisoner. nd of course, there's

That's the core concept, but there's lots of little details and improvements. Keep the internet for socialisation, neutral islands that can serve as places to socialise physically, and of course a set up for childcare. Probably they get their own no-powers island with parents having auto-permission to visit.

I'm sure there's thousands of ways it could go wrong, which is why I shouldn't be given infinite power.
