This is a very good analysis. I read all the things that you have NOT recommended and I agree. By all things I mean i read half of the Magicians, and half of Dresden before deciding it is not worth finishing. So I'm really interest in you " highly recommended ". Which series of Jim Hines do you suggest?

  But if you can do things at scale, or there isn't a masquerade and magic is publicly known / widely available, it's not our world and people connect to it less.

Another issue it is that world-building is MUCH harder to do. You need to think of all the implications and consequences. In medieval fantasy it works better as the reader is not aware of how the medieval world functioned and can the suspension of disbelief is easier. I played TTRPGs and in modern ones players tend to overthink their action much more then fantasy ones. The fantasy stories that are praised have few and sparse magical elements in the current social structures (LotR GoT).

centuries-old conspiracy with some innate anti-memetic propriety of magic is my favorite approach but I never have seen it done well.

At a certain point a series have to go big scale to be interesting, escalation is the only way to survive, but you can also Mind Wipe entire cities Man in Black Style.
