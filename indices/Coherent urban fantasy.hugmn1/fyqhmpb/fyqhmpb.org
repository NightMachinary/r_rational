The reason why this is rare is that the constraints make for unsatisfying stories. The inability to do things at scale (because doing anything at scale necessarily means no masquerade) saps agency from the protagonist and strongly opposes the wish-fulfillment of the reader, and working through why is... shitty. But if you can do things at scale, or there isn't a masquerade and magic is publicly known / widely available, it's not our world and people connect to it less.

The solutions all suck. You can be:

- totally uninterested in coherence or sense (Rowling),
- your characters can just all be selfish, petty-minded pricks (Grossman),
- there could be a centuries-old conspiracy to hide everything (Jim Hines, highly recommended),
- the supernatural could be hiding for its own safety from the mundanes (Harry Connolly's "A Key, An Egg, An Unfortunate Remark", highly recommended),
- there could be a weak masquerade that lets people in but makes the civic/secular systems not take them seriously (Dresden Files),
- there could be a strong masquerade that no-sells your attempts to change the world by erasing or imploding you (the Mage setting).

But pretty much never are these things the point of the story (even Mage isn't about the masquerade so much as it is about being a super-badass up against the Evil Empire), so you don't get a better story by being realistic or coherent about it at the expense of other things.

It's interesting that you mention the Laundry Files, because it's about as ratfic as urban fantasy gets.
