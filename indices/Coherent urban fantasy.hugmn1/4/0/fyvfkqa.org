Ok read it. I liked the monster the protagonist was. Novel yet similar to old archetypes. Very good. Disliked that you could clearly the political stance of the author. It is fucking annoying when the author pushes her political opinions down your throat. Also it is basically a rape revenge female fantasy across the whole book.
