I think World of Darkness handles it best. Each and every type and level of the masquerade is handled professionally by a very, very dedicated cabal of supernaturals, atop of which there is a powerful memetic/reality-bending principle at play, and atop of that, sheer human cynicism, mental complacency, and sheep mentality makes sure that even when the supernatural is exposes, people dismiss it as a hoax.
