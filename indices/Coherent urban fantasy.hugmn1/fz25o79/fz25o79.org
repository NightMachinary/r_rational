In /Lord of the Mysteries/, the reason where knowledge of the supernatural are not widespread or well-known is because of a finite yet indestructible supply of a substance for mortals to consume from which all supernatural powers, items and creatures are born.

As such, demand is artificially limited by Church & State withholding all knowledge from the common public, reducing the amount of people competing over the substance, as well as limiting the severity of the existing competition between state-backed parties and criminal elements such as battle royale between empowered individuals, abrupt "battlefield promotions", and cannibalism to gain more of the substance. The restriction is enforced in major urban centres by empowered individuals in Church & State organisations, most of which are led by actual Gods. The Gods have another motive in limiting demand, as individuals who consume enough substance without going mad or turning into a monster can become Gods themselves. Gods also rely on belief from their followers as an anchor to maintain sanity and mastery over the ultimately foreign substance in their bodies.

As all Lovecraftian settings, the more one knows the easier to die or go mad. Mortals who accidentally get involved in supernatural incidents mostly die, and the few who survive well enough gets attractive offers to work for the organisations to maintain the masquerade and potentially become an empowered individual themselves.

I find the whole background setting about economics shaping the world as it is and interest groups creating pressures on supply and demand quite interesting.
