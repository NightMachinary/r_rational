There's the Unseen Hunt, a RWBY AU fanfic that has the effect of the supernatural elements limited by one's understanding of them and one can only become aware of them if something happens that you cannot possibly rationalize away, there's more to it but how it's set up there doesn't really seem to be any reason for any character to try and expose things and it's unlikely for people to become aware independently given how ghostlike the Grimm usually are in this setting. Though I'm not sure if I'd call it rational.
