I had toyed with ideas for an urban fantasy setting a few years back, and this was very close to my answer for a meaningful Masquerade. In an act of final desperation, the Chefzauberers of the Thule Society had repurposed an experimental antimemetic weapon into a global Pyrrhic bomb. The bomb indirectly killed virtually all magical creatures and magically active humans (magical equivalent of pilots suddenly forgetting, not just how to fly, but what flight was, en masse), and contaminated their works, remains, and ruins with a mighty antimemetic effect. In this setting, the mundane world was just what was /left/, and the magical world would have been a devastated post-apocalyptic wasteland, set in and alongside the muggle world, only a twist in perspective away... Abandoned wizard towers dotting the skylines of the bad parts of Chicago and Detroit, the carcasses of dragons rotting in unused fields. And a small number of survivors fighting for control over the few relics that permit selectivity of the antimemetic effect.
