I kind of like how the Dresden Files handles this. The masquerade is pretty porus, people aren't aware of the supernatural but the supernatural only really put in a lazy effort to keep things under wraps. Supernatural entities do run much of the world. The upside is that Dresden can go around doing whatever without worrying too much about the masquerade, though he's likely more cavalier than most.
