Mage: The Ascension has the concept of "consensus reality". When a Mage does magic, they are imposing their own view of how the world works, and the more witnesses there are who /disagree/ with that view (i.e. normal people) the harder it is for the magic to happen.

Then there's also the Technocracy, who work in exactly the same way as Tradition Mages, but /their/ view of the world is called "science" and they've spent a lot of time cultivating that view in the general public - so theirs works great out in the open, and we don't even consider it to /be/ magic.
