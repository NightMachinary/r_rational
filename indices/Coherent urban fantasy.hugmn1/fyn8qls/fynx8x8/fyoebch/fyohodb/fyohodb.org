I think a coherent urban fantasy could be made true if a long time ago a group of people botched a "hide me" ritual that became a "hide all else" blood curse.\\
that way we have the "normal" that are made incapable to comprehend the abnormal (the crazy cultist are the "normal" that are trying to fight the curse by cheer will).\\
and we have an actual functionning "abnormal" society wich is surimposed.\\
this way we could incorporate the metal panda anime as an actual place where were-beast compete with the "normal" for office space.
