I'm enjoying it and find that it avoids many of the pacing issues that Pact encountered - the new protagonists get into the thick of things right away in a way that reminds me of the opening parts of Twig, and there's enough lighthearted interactions that it doesn't feel like an eternal doom and gloom conga like like late-story Pact did.
