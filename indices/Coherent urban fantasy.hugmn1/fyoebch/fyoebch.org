I'll mention Seanan McGuire's October Daye series. Modern day meets fairy magic, in a nutshell - the fae are mostly hypertraditional, but use glamour to hide their presence from the modern world, the protagonist is a halfbreed "knight" who gets sent for when the human world is involved. The worldbuilding is vibrant and beautiful, the stories themselves are more noire style though, with Toby being a fairy private eye - more like Jessica Jones than Sherlock Holmes though, its not a rational story in the sense that the character's intelligence is key to the plot. It does feature a cyber-dryad living in a decision tree though, who is basically the best side character ever.
