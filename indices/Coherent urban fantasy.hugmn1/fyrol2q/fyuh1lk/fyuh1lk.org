*Pact* has it. Mundanes have natural protection against magic. Anyone who notice magic become vulnerable to it and most of them quickly die and/or disappear. Magic is mostly metaphorical and it's effects on mundane world are seen as natural phenomena. Victims of magic often disappear with all their causal connections to mundane world, without any trace.
