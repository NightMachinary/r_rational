I don't think there are tens of thousands of paranetters, and they're the only ones who would really benefit; and they've been actively hunted by both the Fomor and all the Vampire courts, so they're definitely trying to fly under the radar as much as possible.

There's also a clear weak-masquerade which would result in them not being taken seriously.
