The hardest part of a rational masqurade is that human nature opposes it. We probably would be ok with having wizards around rather than "scared of what we don't understand". How many cultures have given prestige and respect to the local magic user?

Or the idea that we don't want to know, check a poll for how many people believe ghosts exist. Even if ghosts actually do exist, they never ride a zombie dinosaur through Chicago. So the percentage of people who believe in wizards in urban fantasy should be higher than the percentage of real people who believe in ghosts.

I think you'd pretty much have to come up with a supernatural reason. Anyone who sees magic always forgets about it. Anyone with magic is cursed to have to hide or else. Or a powerful group with a motive (ideological or practical) enforces the masqurade lethally.
