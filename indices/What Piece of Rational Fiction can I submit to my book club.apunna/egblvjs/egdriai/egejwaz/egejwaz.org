The ending makes the earlier parts of the book a giant plot hole. It severely breaks tone. However, it's also kind of neat IMO on a thematic level. It's like an irrational rejoinder to overconfidence in rationality, sort of.

Everything before that is fine in terms of plot holes. Its other big limitation is that the main character is too competent to be entirely interesting as a person, so the main joy is watching what he does, not observing who he is.
