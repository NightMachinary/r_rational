You can try reading some of the short stories by Scott Alexander:

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/09/ars-longa-vita-brevis/][Ars Longa, Vita Brevis]]

[[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/][...And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes]]

Or maybe try the second half of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/39/Harry-Potter-and-the-Methods-of-Rationality][Chapter 39]] of HPMOR. It a discussion between Harry and Dumbledore about death and immortality. It's one of my favorite parts in the book; it can be read as a standalone and it doesn't spoil anything in the story though you do need to have read the canon books.
