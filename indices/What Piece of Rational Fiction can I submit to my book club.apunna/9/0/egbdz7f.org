I've read Worm and have no intention to inflict that on my group :p

More seriously the audiobook project is very hard to understand sometimes and I don't think it's good enough to offer up as a real audiobook for the story. I also think Worm is best around the middle, and, again, it's not the first choice for an example of rational fiction. I might bring it up at some point down the line though.
