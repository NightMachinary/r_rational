Worth The Candle would get my vote if it wasn't for the desire to have an audiobook version. Also it's unfinished, so I don't know if that would be an issue for your group or not (though I'm assuming it wouldn't be since you yourself brought it up).

If you require an audiobook to exist of it, then you could read Worm. ([[http://audioworm.rein-online.org/][Audiobook project here]]). Though if you haven't read it, it's not rationalist fiction so much as just a rational setting where almost nothing feels contrived or out of place. The main characters are for the most part just regular smart people, not uber-rationalists. They're still very clever though, and even when you don't agree with their decisions you never feel like they're holding the idiot ball.
