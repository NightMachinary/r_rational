Surprised /The Martian/ hasn't been recommended, since it's pretty commonly considered to be a very mainstream but rational story. It's also an easy read, which I value personally.

If violent sex stuff is OK, /The Metamorphisis of Prime Intellect/ is interesting, and about AI safety (but very much a fantasy). But there's no audiobook, though there's a paperback as well as kindle.

It depends on your crowd though: it seems you're getting a lot of recommendations for fanfic. Do you think fanfic would go down well with your crowd? Based on the demographic, it seems... probably?
