Unsong is definitely a niche read. I would never recommend it to a group, but it's a FANTASTIC piece of literature for certain individuals. It's very well-written and gets very deep in terms of being able to piece together what's going on. Lots and lots and lots of references to Jewish Kaballah and computer programming, so if you like both of those topics you will probably enjoy the story itself. If one or both of those topics goes unappreciated, the story will probably get a "meh".
