Book 1 of /Methods/, [[https://cdn.rawgit.com/rjl20/hpmor/0c10d2e8b6bd68e88fd2fc6e6b233140917e7314/out/hpmor-1.pdf][/Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and the Methods of Rationality/]] is made up of chapters 1-21 (with the non-canonical chapter 11 optionally excluded). It is not quite as self-contained as /Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone/, but it at least reaches an emotional stopping point (Book 1 ends with a wistful scene of Harry writing a letter home after his eventful first week at Hogwarts). If your group likes it, you can add Book 2, [[https://cdn.rawgit.com/rjl20/hpmor/0c10d2e8b6bd68e88fd2fc6e6b233140917e7314/out/hpmor-2.pdf][/Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres and the Professor's Games/]], next month, and so on until you do all six.

Alternatively, you could try Book I of /Worth the Candle/ (chapters 1-14, covering the "tutorial"). As you mention, it doesn't have an audiobook version, but TTS programs have gotten really good at making decent audiobooks on demand, and it would be a great fit for a tabletop RPG group. Again, if your group likes it, can add the other books later.

My recommendation: Do all of /Methods/ first, to give /Worth the Candle/ as much time to progress as possible.

RE: The print book readers, are they also opposed to reading on an e-ink reader? Because epub, mobi, and PDF versions of both works exist.
