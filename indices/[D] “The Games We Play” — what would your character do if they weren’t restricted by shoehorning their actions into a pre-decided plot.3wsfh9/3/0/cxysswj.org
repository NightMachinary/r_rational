Those are both a natural result of it being written fast. If you prioritize speed, quality is naturally going to suffer, and it's likely to suffer in a few specific ways:

- Spelling and grammar errors are going to crop up because you don't spend time on editing.
- Things are going to get brought up once and then never again because plans change in the middle of writing (or there was never a plan to begin with).
- To a lesser extent, you'll get outright continuity errors.
- There will be lots of text that's extraneous and would be better off removed.

Ryuugi has pushed /hard/ in the direction of speed, for reasons that I could speculate on, but the result has been that there are some glaring flaws which could be fixed with editing. Unfortunately, editing is more boring and less rewarding than writing, which is why it doesn't happen too much with web fiction (and especially not with things posted serially to a forum like spacebattles).
