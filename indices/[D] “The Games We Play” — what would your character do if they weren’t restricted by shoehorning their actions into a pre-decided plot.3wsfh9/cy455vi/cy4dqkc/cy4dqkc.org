Now this is the type of response I had in mind when creating the thread.

  I'm about half-way through

  Even just a subset of those is ridiculous, but all of them?

Hahaha, please come back and update your review when\if you reach the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Asspull][ass pulls]] during the JF fight.

Good reasoning on prioritising evacuation. When there's an unknown quantity of both chemical and biological WMDs ready to go off, you've pretty much already lost and can only try salvaging the situation. And I agree that lack of data corruption with time, in regards to both memories /and/ skills, should be considered a superpower all of its own.

  Let's go have you weaken as high a level thing as I can finish off, and then I'll point up Wis/Int and solve the goddamn world.

In games this is usually prevented by restricting gained exp by percentage of damage done (it was also somewhat demonstrated when Jaune was levelling up Adam). However, it might work if Jaune managed to find a high-level Hunter who can restrict monsters /without/ killing them (e.g. if Jaune brought the Large Nevermore to the ground without causing them to lose 1\3 of HP from losing wings and hitting ground, Adam may have received much more exp per kill). If he asked Ozpin for help, he would even get an additional chance of learning how Ozpin's skills work.

  And then you add the rest of the core abilities:

There's also the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying][power copying]] --- Jaune could essentially learn /any/ person's Semblance, being restricted only by the few stats defined by his game mechanics (e.g. WIS, INT). So, for instance, if the clairvoyant girl had stats lower than him, there's nothing revealed through the story that says that Jaune would be unable to learn that flavour of clairvoyance himself.
