He could definitely have raised his stats higher than what he did through normal means. I'm just saying that for stats that he has to dedicate time to (ie cant multitask it) at a certain point it becomes much more efficient to rank up abilities/make new ones than to spend time trying to rank up stats. It took him a long time while training with his mom to get his intelligence and strength up even a modest amount, and the time it takes to increase stats after that would take even longer. Training strength or other physical stats while putting points into int and wis would be a good way to get the most benefit from the diminishing returns of training while also getting the combat capabilities Jaun gets in the story. After about 100 or 130 though, it would take too much time for not enough gain compared to other things he could do.

There's no real reason to use civilians as a lure to normal Grimm if Jaun is the one killing everything. He can just slaughter every moderately powerful Grimm and have normal Hunters deal with the scraps. He might learn something from using a lure, but it really isn't probable that he'll get anything useful.
