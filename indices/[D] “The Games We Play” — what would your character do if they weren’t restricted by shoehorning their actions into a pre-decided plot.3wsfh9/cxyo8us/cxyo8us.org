** Things to do:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: things-to-do
   :END:

- 1) keep looking for more skill books --- on Semblances, Natural Sciences and Humanities, etc;
- 2) keep deciphering the Bable language, history and capabilities of Grimm and Babel technology;
- 3) NOT spend any skill points until the Attribute is over 150 or 200 through natural training --- this would eventually yield some additions 750 to 1000 skill points at least;
- 4) deplete the Dust mines that are outside of human territory;

  - 4.2) optionally use these huge reserves to spam-kill higher level Grimm and gain some quick level-ups.

- 5) choose a person as my familiar (an orphan, maybe, for higher likelihood of loyalty) instead of a dog because in their default condition they would be more intelligent and agile. Fall back to a gorilla if it doesn't work.
- 6) develop riot control tools against civilian panic --- it is mentioned on multiple occasions that evacuating a town or village is often not an option because if Hunters /do/ start an evacuation procedure, the implications of this would cause a panic among civilians and worsen the severity of the Grimm attack. So I'd look for skills that can quickly render a large group of civilians unconcious. If there were no such skills, I'd try researching a chemical alternative (spread through air, water, etc). This can be used on the capital cities as well.

  - 6.2) additionally instruct civilians themselves on why panicking is bad and how to better control their emotions;
  - 6.3) additionally use frightened civilians, who will agree to help, to lure and concentrate large groups of Grimm into smaller areas for easier killing.

- 7) start profiling regular citizens and awakening auras --- the fanfic handwaves the lack of enthusiasm about awakening larger groups of Hunters by saying that they would be a risk to the rest of population. But this problem should be solvable by periodically reading the minds of all the subordinate Hunters and neutralising those that either have too dangerous Semblances or are planning a “terrotist” attack. Defending them against Riders would be difficult, but not impossible or unreliable.
- 8) investigate how are the artefacts that the Grimm drop able to function. They don't seem to be based on dust usage, and their effects seem to not weaken with time;
- 9) occasionally use the weapon memory-reading skill on Ozpin's mug;
- 10) level up Luck to at least 100;

** Skills to find or develop:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: skills-to-find-or-develop
   :END:

- 1) for surviving in space;
- 2) for transporting large amounts of mass --- high-level Grimm could be instakilled by first launching them into space and them jettisoned them into a sun;
- 3) long range transportation and movement (teleportation and portals) --- get to other planets without FTL time dilation shenanigans, use these planets as experimentation grounds to reduce damage done to Earth;
- 4) large area transportation and movement --- if Grimm can't defend against aura-based attacks because they lack aura, it should be possible to disintegrate them by opening large-area portals inside their body. This would work even on enemies like Hydras: simply locating the cores inside their body and teleporting them all into a prepared destructive environment would instakill them.

** Things to try:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: things-to-try
   :END:

- 1) creating a new skill book by paying a Hunter to write a book about how their Semlance works --- many of the books that the Game System recognised as skill books were written by people with awakened auras (Adamant Skin, Strong Arm, White Tiger, Area Buffs, Healing, etc), so it is very likely that if a living Hunter were to write down about their Semblance, it would work as a skill book too;
- 2) putting a person into an inventory slot --- I am guessing that if Jaune tried buying a flower and storing it in his inventory, it would work despite the flower having a soul. So I'd try storing a person in the similar manner. If it worked, I'd have an option to store /all/ of the humanity in my inventory and stop worrying about Grimms using them as hostages. This would obviously work only if my character was developed enough to either safely kill or to run away from any Grimm or Grimm General.

  - 2.2) Storing people in inventory could also be used to quickly start a human colony on another planet (and see if Malkuth is able to spawn Grimm there).

- 3) carpet bombing areas that are inhabited only by Grimm using meteors: you'd only have to ensure that there are no monster types that benefit from attacks on them (e.g. Hydras).
