1) To me, at least, the time constraint factor seems too forced by the author and too artificial. It wouldn't be such an issue if Jaune avoided poking his nose in one beehive after another. He, as Malkuth's arch-nemesis, was what catalysed the situation and triggered Malkuth into action on several different occasions. If he was to quietly train and study for several years (you know, which is what people his age are /supposed/ to be doing to avoid stupid mistakes later on the battlefield), he'd be much more prepared both as a fighter and as a general (he'd be better informed about Grimm, Malkuth, the nature of Malkuth's traps, Babel, etc). I guess /[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]/ spoilt me to a degree, but Jaune's haphazard actions and choices seemed idiotic, not awesome or interesting. 2) /Doing/ science takes time. Familiarising yourself with results of others for someone with broken INT levels --- not as much.

Yes, I meant after the point where he gets the psychokinesis skill. Levelling up then through crystals should've been very helpful to him.

  1.5. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_in_Buddhism][Tiryagyoni]] is animal-specific; on the scales that Jaune works at, the difference between a dog and a gorilla isn't really meaningful - I'd be surprised if it represented more than five or ten points of intelligence.
#+end_quote

I think that the quality of the base material should affect the end product, so if a dog managed to get that smart, an ape should've benefited from the same ascension at an order of magnitude more. But even if they'd ended up the same in terms of raw power\intelligence, a bipedal creature with a prehensile hand would've had much more options to choose from in all sorts of situations.

  1.6. If this was doable, it'd be done already. As a setting conceit it's rather unpleasant, so for Doylist reasons I'd expect there to be reasons why this would fail
#+end_quote

I don't think that a very good argument. Hunter headquarters could keep around people with semblances that can shut people down before they realise what's happening. The teams could drug the water supplies at the evening and time it to take effect around 2-3A.M.; go from house to house during the night, etc.

  1.7
#+end_quote

It's not meant for defeating the Grimm (which could kill humans even before the story began, if they wanted to) but for surviving without dust. And I don't see any ethical problems (unless you meant the mind-reading part, which is a non-issue, given Jaune's approaching omniscience) with empowering people to defend themselves (to a certain degree) while simultaneously ensuring that nobody would abuse that gifted power.

He had first used the weapon-reading when Ozpin was literally in the same room with him. Afterwords, he had met with the man at least once, maybe more.

#+begin_quote
  2.2.
#+end_quote

You seem to be prioritizing the defeat of Grimm above everything else. Easily killing larger Grimm would not solve the biggest issue, but would help Jaune in levelling up and improving his stat multipliers. Given the genre of the story, I'd expect the protag to be interested in these things. Buy why should he when he has the cheatlist lying on his desktop?

#+begin_quote
  3.3 He does this once he can.
#+end_quote

Do you mean he literally bombs them with meteorites, or the nuclear attack skill he uses at JF? What I meant was that he'd be able to use the carpet bombing /before/ he became so powerful. Like with 2.2, it would help him in quickly levelling up.
