Regarding Gou:

Gou is powerful enough that weapons are practically nothing to him.

His function in the team is to soak up damage with his absurd durabiliy, size, and regeneration, and stomp on Grimm with absurd physical stats.

Weapons wouldn't help him with that. His skin is probably orders of magnitude stronger than any sword, his teeth and claws are probably the sharpest/hardest thing short of Jaune's Kavacha skill or Gilgamesh's bone sword.

So Gou doesn't need weapons or armor.

And having hands to manipulate stuff is a non-issue-- he has Psychokineses if he needs something and Jaune isn't there to help.

Regarding mass awakening:

At the scale Jaune is working on, civilians having Aura or not doesn't make a real difference. You have to be a high-tier badass to not get smeared by the huge amounts of Grimm that populate the Dark continent-- someone on the level of Jaune's sisters a minimum.

And those sisters had: powerful semblances, probably were genetically near optimum for being hunters considering their long linage of illustrious Hunters, and tons of training.

Jaune and humanity exis at Malkuth's discretion. That is made abundantly clear. Awakening everyone won't change that. If everyone was suddenly at his Sister's level-- that might come close, but even then Malkuth has a continent of Grimm that are serious threats to even that tier Hunter (the Hydras, Nemeans Humbaba's, etc.)

Regarding: moving off planet

I think you have a point here, though remember that there's nothing (so far in story) preventing the higher-level Grimm from following. They can survive with no food and in most environments and some of them can obviously fly with little regard for physics, so moving of planet would have to mean moving very far so none could follow.

Unless Jaune gets strong enough to wipe out the Riders, the Knights, and somehow cull the Grimm population enough to ensure humanity can survive, then he still needs to deal with trapped Malkuth.
