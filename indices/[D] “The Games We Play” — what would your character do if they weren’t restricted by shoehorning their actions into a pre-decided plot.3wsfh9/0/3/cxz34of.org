- 1) Valid.

- 2) Somewhat valid, but this is a major decades-long project until he meets Keter and reaches Arcana, at which point it's moot - it's played down in text but by that point Jaune actually understands how a lot of his skills work by then, you can see bits of that in the way he decomposes /Et in Arcadia Ego/ and explains bits of /Tiferet/

- 3) Somewhat valid. However, note that the nature of Jaune's high-stress life is that he doesn't always have a choice about spending his stat points - even if he's giving up major chunks of long-term power, it's better than dying.

- 4) For most of the fic, this was somewhat suicidal due to the existence of partially powerful Grimm; after he moves to Sanctum, however, this is valid.

- 5) Familiar is synthesized into Tiryagyoni, which is animal-specific. Also, on the scales that Jaune works at, the difference between a dog and a gorilla isn't really meaningful - I'd be surprised if it represented more than five or ten points of intelligence.

- 6) If this was doable, it'd be done already. As a setting conceit it's rather unpleasant, so for Doylist reasons I'd expect there to be reasons why this would fail - with the nature of the soul in this universe, perhaps people can still be panicking even while their brains are nonfunctional? Civilians already know that panicking is bad, they just don't have perfect emotional control. Using panicking civilians as bait is already a thing Hunters do - see the battle with Crom Cruach.

- 7) This turns Jaune into another Archangel. Ethics aside, it's also totally pointless because in an actual battle against the Grimm, the Grimm win, do-not-pass-go - this has been made exceedingly clear across the book. For that matter, the original /Keter/, with thousands of years more to grow and prepare, still lost to the army of Grimm. Beating the Grimm is very much a matter of learning to beat Malkuth himself.

- 8) See 2. Science takes /time/, lots of it. By the time he has that time, he has access to information from Babel anyway.

- 9) Jaune has yet to get in physical contact with Ozpin since gaining several important suites of perception abilities. This is particularly critical because it means he cannot vet Ozpin for being Death.

- 10) Mostly agreed. 50 should be enough, the skills will tell him what the game's definition of Luck is and what Luck does.

- 1) Gamer's Body does this already. Space will apply a damage-over-time affect and Jaune has HP regen out of his ears.

- 2) Killing large Grimm is pointless, there's too many of them. See above.

- 3) Valid, but he has Raven (and later Flux). Still worth checking out later - right now he doesn't have time.

- 4) Somewhat valid, but the more powerful Grimm, as appropriate for Qlippothic creatures, do end up with defenses against Aura powers, I believe. Raven does hit Malkuth with a portal cut at one point, though.

- 1) Good idea. Unfortunately, writing a book takes time and the Grimm are everywhere. Well, I suppose Jaune could just take over their Grimm duties, but this is still a long-term plan and Jaune has only recently gained any breathing room. (Start to finish, TGWP is probably less than a year long.)

- 2) Rather than "have a soul," since this is a world where even rocks have souls, the limit is likely to be one of soul-density and magnitude, if so. Also, Jaune is not going to be capable of killing arbitrary Grimm for a while, because the higher-level ones spawn Malkuth when they die.

- 3) He does this once he can.
