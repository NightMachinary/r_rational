  [..] developing methods of dealing with the Grimm in various ways that don't require his personal attention should be a priority

That's a very good point that I have missed.

  on inefficiency of raising stats naturally
#+end_quote

On several occasions, Jaune'd wasted stat points even when his stats where below 100 (e.g. during the stupid White Whale quest). Besides, at least some of the stats could more or less easily be upgraded to over 100 (if not 150), I think:

- STR by weight-carrying --- if he switched to heavier metals/elements, and/or managed to incorporate gravitational magic into the exercise, his armour being too bulky would stop being a problem --- he'd only have to additionally support the ground under himself with psychokinesis and maybe shield people around him from radiation;
- INT by expanding his knowledge in one scientific field after another --- if he did it right, I think he'd be able to bring his INT even above 150, because [[http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/][the complexity the universe has to offer is endless]] (I could actually emphasize more with Makluth in this regard than with Jaune), at least from our perspective. I get that even if Jaune himself is portrayed as super-intelligent, the author still has his limits. But at least something could've been done about that instead of doing nothing at all;
- LUK --- Jaune didn't even properly test what are the minimal requirements for his Game Mechanics to register an action as luck-grinding. The only thing he ever did was outright going to the casino and starting the gambling. For all we know, his luck would've slowly increased even if all he did was toss a coin and wager his word on the outcome. And when you consider how much time he had spent either on meaningless things or on stupid missions, (not) prioritising luck because of time limitations stops being that much of a problem.
- VIT, DEX, WIS --- again, almost no research to find out the definition in the Game Mechanics, so there could be easy options for these as well.

  [..] The higher level Grimm can spawn hordes of lesser Grimm on demand
#+end_quote

1) So far only the Goliath and Leviathan have demonstrated this ability, and they either have their specific spawning locations or are rather rare overall. 2) It could be used to test whether they can spawn lesser Grimm endlessly or if they have their own limitations. 3) They could be used as generators of weaker Grimm to create a more controlled environment for a Hunter training program (it might not work due to their intelligence, or it might if they were somehow made unaware about their surroundings).

#+begin_quote
  [..] it is a very real possibility that the Grimm could break in and slaughter civilians en masse. Also, more Hunters would almost certainly die compared to their normal methods of killing Grimm.
#+end_quote

1) No need for more Hunters, I had on mind Jaune going against them on his own --- for exp grinding or clearing an area from Grimm. 2) If only a few civilians were taken to build the trap, it would've been easier to rescue them in case of an emergency. When Jaune was going to visit the White Fang base, it was shown that even a single person's reactions can control the (movements of) Grimm. 3) Even if something did go wrong, if would still provide some data on why it happened, how to prevent it in the future, and the capabilities of Grimm.

#+begin_quote
  Also, the Hunters really aren't that much more powerful than the Grimm that actually matter.
#+end_quote

Still would be better to have a hunter population than a civilian one when dust runs out.
