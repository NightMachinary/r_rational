On average, yeah a brand new skill will be weaker than a prestiged or upgraded existing one. But he largely doesn't need more powerful skills, he needs new angles and options of attack and defense. The ability synthesis definitely nullifies my argument to some extent, but gaining new skills through skill books or through power testing (like how he made magic missile) should be more of a priority than leveling, say, dust weaving. (Crafting should have been leveled more when it was still relevant, but it's largely inconsequential now.) Acceleration, IIRC, was made through attempted time manipulation, and it is almost certainly his most valuable skill. So attempting to do stuff like that, manipulating time, space, gravity, electricity, anything else, could potentially give fantastic results while there is relatively little cost to simple testing. He has workarounds for controlling some of the things I mentioned, but not nearly on the level of his acceleration ability.
