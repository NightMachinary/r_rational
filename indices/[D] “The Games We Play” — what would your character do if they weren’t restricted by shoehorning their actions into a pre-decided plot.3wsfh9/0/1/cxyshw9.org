A few notes in no particular order:

While spending ages to level up his various attributes naturally would be a good way to gain the most total stats, after a certain point it becomes inefficient compared to leveling up skills. In the early chapters Jaun would work out and study to gain levels in his various stats, and this makes sense because he gained levels relatively quickly. But the amount of time needed to achieve the next level increases exponentially, while the time it takes to level up abilities remains relatively constant of even decreases with the passives he receives from leveling intelligence or wisdom. This can partially be circumvented by doing passive strength/endurance/agility training by always carrying heavy weights/hitting yourself/being agile and then spending points solely in wisdom or intelligence, the method shown in story isn't really that inefficient.

Luck is a very hot topic on the spacebattles thread. Part of the controversy is that it is a poorly defined stat. While I do agree that he should have gotten it to level 50 just to see what it does, it makes sense that he doesn't prioritize the stat. All of Jaun's other abilities can be increased more quickly by doing increasingly more challenging tasks, like weight training for strength or studying for intelligence, there isn't really anything comparable for luck. In addition, luck seems to need to be leveled up by gambling with humans, something that he can't increase the speed of through abilities. Also, in order to level up luck Jaun needs to risk something that he actually values, and he gets so much money from Grimm that he doesn't value money at all. In fact, there are very few physical things that he does value, so gambling would be difficult. Needless to say, gambling with his friends would be a bad idea in the world they live in.

Using frightened civilians as a lure actually isn't a good idea. The higher level Grimm can spawn hordes of lesser Grimm on demand, and there is certainly a way for the higher leveled ones to reproduce as well considering that the Grimm don't seem to be dying out. Also, the Hunters really aren't that much more powerful than the Grimm that actually matter. It was mentioned that it normally takes a team of Hunters to safely kill a Goliath, and they normally travel in packs. Luring large amounts of Grimm towards one location certainly could reduce local Grimm concentrations, but it is a very real possibility that the Grimm could break in and slaughter civilians en masse. Also, more Hunters would almost certainly die compared to their normal methods of killing Grimm.

Other than this and a few minor nitpicks too minor to mention, I largely agree with this post. Jaun doesn't spend nearly enough time trying to acquire new skills compared to powering up existing ones, when new skills are almost universally more useful in fights compared to more powerful skills. New angles of attack are just so much better for his skill set when other people can do the brunt force approach well. Having a contingency for if he can't kill the leader of the Grimm is a /great/ idea, and he completely fails to do so. With his intelligence, developing methods of dealing with the Grimm in various ways that don't require his personal attention should be a priority, but again he just fails to do so. While literarily I can understand that power testing can be boring, it is dumb that Jaun does not understand or strive to understand many of the things around him.
