I'm about half-way through, and while there's a great deal on the mid and top-level tiers (libraries, vagapunk), two things hugely stand out to me:

- Not leveling Psychometry ASAP as madly as possible. In /every/ fictional universe with An Interesting Past, the most valuable things are history books you can read, hands down. And this is definitely one of those cases.

- The mere existence of Pandora Shells means the universe is actually Grim Dark, not Anime Grim Dark, and their civilizational procedures, setups and responses to the entire world no longer make sense. Proper procedure is evac ASAP and nuke it from orbit, twice. You do not try to save anyone except maybe through amputation. You do not try to contain. You do not try to anything but bug out and nuke because /holy fuck/, someone read Worm.

Edit:

The other sets of things amount to... not so much a poorly defined, but, a poorly... Yeah, I guess it's poorly defined, when it could be so damn interesting.

You could almost re-arrange it so that you have the following, much more balanced powers, that are still OP as fuck, if well applied:

- Gamer's Mind: Just like the player of the game, effects upon your avatar have no effect on /you/
- Grind: All practice is effective, and you get to know /how/ effective

Even with those two... Damn. And then you add the rest of the core abilities:

- Gamer's Mind, Addendum: This includes mental fatigue. "Sleep" is instant, just like pausing the game...
- Gamer's Mind, Addendum 2: You don't get bored
- Gamer's Skills: "Use it or lose it" does not apply
- Gamer's Body: Periodic character reset
- Skillbooks: Instant Learning
- Skillbooks, Addendum: You don't even need to understand
- Skillbooks, Addendum 2: You don't even need to be able to read the language
- Observe: Secret Info!
- Observer, Addendum: Absolute Power Level
- Status Screen: You know what is going on to yourself, quantitatively.
- Points: You can improve core capabilities /by doing something else/.

Like, what? Even just a subset of those is ridiculous, but all of them?

"Hey, Dad. I'm OP as fuck, and can get better at something other than what I'm practicing. Let's go have you weaken as high a level thing as I can finish off, and then I'll point up Wis/Int and /solve the goddamn world/."
