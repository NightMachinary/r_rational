Another two things that annoyed me a lot in TGWP: the spelling/grammar. It is seriously atrocious. Nearly every chapter had multiple mistakes that were very obvious and often times changed the meaning of the sentence. The story legitimately had the worst grammar and spelling of any story I've read that's longer than about 1000 words.

Similar to the 'mention these things a few times then never again' in the main post: the various alliances Jaun makes seem completely pointless. No meaningful spoilers, but he spends multiple chapters working out alliances with students like Pyrrha and the children of the Families. While individually many of them are quite powerful and skilled compared to their peers, at this point Jaun can destroy mountains easily in addition to gaining skill and power much quicker than anyone else. I outright skipped chapters because he would brood about all this diplomacy he was doing, get some minor ally that has some minor skill he didn't have, and then is never mentioned again. If he spent the time to level up the various people with useful powers, or worked on some way to make them meaningfully powerful compared to anything he fights, sure, it would make sense. But that never happens, so a large part of the story is spent making alliances with people that he utterly dwarfs in terms of power.
