Let me quote him:

  Several people have asked why I insist on putting out snippets every night, even when I don't have a lot of time--and the answer is that it's really more for me than anything.

  I went into TGWP with the intention of writing it from start to finish, without wandering off to something else like I had in the past, and I asked Wildbow for advice. He recommended to keep to a schedule like he does, which seemed like a good idea...but I've let schedules slip in the past. An update every Tuesday and Thursday became...well, my ff.net version of TGWP. I knew I'd need to keep it tight and stick to it, because stopping or letting my schedule slip would make it easy to take breaks and skip over things and then TGWP is just another of my nine thousand and one stories.
