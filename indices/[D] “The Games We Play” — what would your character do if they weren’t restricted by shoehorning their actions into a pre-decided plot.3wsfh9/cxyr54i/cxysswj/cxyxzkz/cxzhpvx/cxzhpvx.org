  Zoat favours unusual written forms for certain onomatopoeias and a written form for pauses between full stops and ellipses as '..').

His 'double-period' typography sign is a new punctuation mark he's invented. According to him it represents a conversational pause that is not as long as that expressed by an ellipsis.

And yeah, despite knowing that it still looks weird to me.

  It also feels to me that WTR has more of a planned structure ahead of it, with the author having a plan and a destination in mind for his fic, which has resulted in less extraneous stuff and plot holes, comparatively.

He's working fairly closely off the canon episodes from Young Justice, which gives him his story arcs pre-made.

Personally, the part that bothers me is the whole Renegade thing. For those who don't read it: WTR is a self-insert fanfic of the Young Justice version of the DC superhero universe. It follows the hero, Paul, as he makes friends and saves the world. Paul is considered the "Paragon" plotline; there's also a "Renegade" plotline, in which Paul decided to grab for personal power instead of being a team player. He's become a giant gray ogre with all the toys who has turned himself into Grayven, the son of Darkseid. Like, literally turned himself into -- he got hold of a Father Box (alien hypercomputer) and had it give him the soul of Grayven, New God of Conquest.

The current Renegade arc is being handled better than usual, but normally I can't stand his smugness, contempt for those around him, and the fact that he repeatedly breaks his vows, disobeys orders, kills people...yet never suffers any consequences.
