I really enjoy WTR. The power creep really isn't very bad, and he also tries to bring other people up with him, the spelling and grammar are /really/ consistent aside from the very occasional typo (the 'wow spelled as whaw' is still funny though), everything is fairly well thought out far ahead of time, and generally there is just very little to complain about. I disagree about the 'one typo per page', but do agree with the spirit of what you said. Extremely few errors overall, and he will correct any you point out.
