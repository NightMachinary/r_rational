The other big "Daily Updated Spacebattles Thread", Mr. Zoat's With This Ring, has managed to consistently incorporate his readers' spelling/grammar fixes (at least on those occasions where the differences from orthography are accidental rather than intentional - Zoat favours unusual written forms for certain onomatopoeias and a written form for pauses between full stops and ellipses as '..'). With This Ring has probably spoiled me - while Zoat also makes multiple errors per post from speed of writing, at the point the story-only thread is probably down to less than one unintentional error per page of Story Only thread because he fixes every unintentional error that readers point out to him.

It also feels to me that WTR has more of a planned structure ahead of it, with the author having a plan and a destination in mind for his fic, which has resulted in less extraneous stuff and plot holes, comparatively.
