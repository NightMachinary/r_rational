I enjoyed the beginning very much but got bored once Jaune's power curve went too high and nothing could threaten him.

One thing about the story that became really clear was the power of synergy. Most of Jaune's effectiveness is not that he has a "Massive Technique of Doomiest Doom", it's that he has a bunch of moderately powerful elements to his build that work together really well. It's a good reminder that balance can be very non-obvious.
