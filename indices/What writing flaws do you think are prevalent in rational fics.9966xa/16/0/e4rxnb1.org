  That whole "which level are you playing at" nonsense is an example of what I'm talking about

Definitely this. It's clear that anyone who goes on about this rarely has to convince people of things IRL. You hardly ever see someone try that sort of reverse psychology because it's so complex it rarely works. Either you can lie well enough to get away with it in which case why bother with more levels, or you need some other strategy because you wouldn't be able to do this anyway.
