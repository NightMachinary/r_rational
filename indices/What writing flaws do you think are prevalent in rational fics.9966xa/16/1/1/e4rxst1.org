  A lot of people don't have fast-response social intuition.

No one uses nested lies in real life, unless they're trying to show off how smart they are or something. Fast-response intuition has nothing to do with it, it's just unnecessary. If you're having to work out in your head how many levels of deception the person you're talking to is on you're probably completely misreading the situation.
