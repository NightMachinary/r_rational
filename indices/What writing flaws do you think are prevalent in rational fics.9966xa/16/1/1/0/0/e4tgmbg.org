It's paranoia when no one is out to get you. Most of the time, no one is out to get you. Part of optimizing thought is knowing what not to waste mental energy on.

If someone is trying to deceive you they won't go deeper than a lie, because lying about the lie has a risk of the other person thinking you're telling the truth and not doing what you want. Every level you add is another failure case, if you can pull off a lie there's no reason to make it more complicated and if you can't, you probably can't pull off a fake lie anyway. Because it rarely works, no one is going to do it, so you're better off trying to pick up on body language than trying to figure out what "level" someone is on. I'm going to tell you right now, as someone who has average social intuition, this multi-level deception stuff isn't how people work so if you have trouble understanding others it's not the way to go.

TLDR: If a deeper level deception will work, just plain lying probably will too and has a better chance of working, so no one goes deeper.
