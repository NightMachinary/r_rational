Do you mean that the fact that there is a game system is obnoxious; or do you mean that there are fics with intentionally-obnoxious game systems?

Because, if it's the latter: “people dealing with obnoxious, user-hostile game mechanics” has been my favourite story trope since I first saw it in /Problem Sleuth/ (and the early parts of /Homestuck/) and I would love to read a ratfic that is entirely that.
