Having read WtC, I'm not remembering any game-mechanical conceit that caused as much pain as the simple act of attempting to bake a cake with a bad Sylladex Modus would cause.

WtC /does/ have moments where it's clear the rules were designed to either tease the PC or elicit a groan from them.

But by "obnoxious" game-mechanics, I was referring more to the type of story where it's clear that the /entire problem the player is being asked to solve/ in playing this game / escaping this room / bootstrapping themselves to competency in this Isekai / cultivating themselves in this Xianxia / etc. is that "the controls" for doing so, suck. Like, QWOP-level suckery. /Twitch Plays Pokemon/-level suckery.

Can that be combined with rationality? I'm not sure.
