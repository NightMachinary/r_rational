As someone who just caught up to 'The Legend of Randidly Ghosthound' on the author's patreon, I understand what you mean, and while I would hesitate strongly to call that a rational work I believe it addresses the concierge you are looking for here, the world is forced to adapt to an /Obviously Hostile/ game like system that arbitrarily imposes it's will on everyone and actively works to prevent it's users from understanding it.

It has stats and progression systems that are both ridiculously complex and deceptively simple at the same time and the only way to work anything out is to acquiesce to its demands unless you are a special kind of stubborn, which is where the MC comes in. So yeah, I recommend you give it a shot though I feel like you likely already have if you enjoy Litrpgs.

Only warning is that the Author doesn't really inspire confidence, he is either arrogant or humble to a flaw though I'm still not sure which, he posts in the description of his series that he doesn't take it seriously (though clearly does), sets post schedules only to immediately break them, and /still/ demands a $10+ per month patronage to stay up to date with his novel
