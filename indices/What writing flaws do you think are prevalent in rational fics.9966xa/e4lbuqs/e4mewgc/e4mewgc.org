It seems like a common fallacy of poorly-written rational fiction to think of impulse or emotion as this thing that can be thwarted simply by realizing it exists.

For example, imagine a common phobia, like a fear of elevators. A badly-written rationalist with a fear of elevators would say, "I am unlikely to experience pain or injury while in an elevator. It's irrational for me to be afraid of elevators. Therefore, I will no longer have panic attacks when I enter an elevator. And if I ever start to have a panic attack, I just need to remind myself that the panic is irrational and I'm actually safe and then I'll stop having a panic attack. Wow, I just cured my fear of elevators! That was easy!"

A better approach would be, "Okay, I start panicking every time I enter an elevator. Why? I don't know exactly, maybe some childhood trauma, but whatever the case, the point is that my breathing quickens any time I even /see/ an elevator open up, so over the next month I'm going to get a trusted friend to help me slowly chip away at this fear through controlled exposure therapy, and I'm going to develop practices like breathing exercises to help myself through those moments of panic. Or, you know, maybe I'll seek out a therapist or someone who specializes in this sort of thing and benefit from their expertise."

You know, the kind of thing an actual person with a phobia would do to try and overcome their fear of elevators. (I wonder how many people writing this kind of scene would actually go up to a real person with a mental disorder and say, "Uh, have you tried not being depressed?" Obviously there are strategies for coping with different mental disorders, but rationally identifying the ideal coping mechanism is a far cry from actually implementing it, and the definition of "the ideal coping mechanism" can vary depending on the individual and in many cases has to be discovered through experimentation. It's actually for this reason that I find myself somewhat partial to fics about characters with certain mental disorders, because the authors of these fics usually do a much better job of acknowledging that emotions exist and affect the way that people operate and behave.)

Another adjacent example of the is a character whose "rationalism" has given them the super-power of being immune to hedonic motivation. For example, a person opens up the fridge, and sees a piece of cake. "I have appraised this piece of cake as an unhealthy eating choice," says the poorly-written rationalist. "I will instead eat this bag of carrot sticks and can of sardines instead, for they will provide for my nutritional needs. Yum, the sweet, sweet taste of utility."

On some level, I get why people do this. I imagine there are a lot of people who went to see Avengers 3 and came out of the theater thinking, "Gah, why did Starlord punch Thanos. So irrational!" They walk out of the theater frustrated, and understandably so. Then, their response is, "I'm going to write my own Avengers fic, one where Starlord isn't an idiot who punches Thanos." And then they start running in the complete opposite direction and barrel headlong into "my rational version of Starlord doesn't ever feel emotions! The temptation to punch someone for reasons other than strategic utility doesn't even enter his mind!" And then you get these weird characters that are completely devoid of emotion, and if strip a character like Starlord of his emotions you don't have much of a character left.
