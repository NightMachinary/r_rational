There's nothing irrational about /having/ emotions. /Expressing/ emotions, however, can often be irrational (i.e. consequentially sub-optimal; the opposite of "practicing mental techniques that help you win.")

Say you and a friend are in a burning building, attempting to escape, and some burning rubble falls on your friend and kills them. Do you stop to grieve? No! You might be /experiencing/ grief, but /expressing/ that grief---even /acknowledging/ that grief---will get in the way of, well, not being crushed to death by burning rubble. Get out of the building. Then grieve, if you want.

Even this doesn't cause the problem you're talking about on its own, though. The reason so many rationalist characters /seem/ sociopathic, is that the story they're in never gives them room to breathe. It's always one thing after another, so they never get to express their emotions.

Good example of this "problem", ratfic or not: Taylor in /Worm/.
