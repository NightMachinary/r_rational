I didn't say she was being rational in any other way, just in this one specific way. An irrational person can have cultivated a particular rational mental habit, while being lacking in most others.

My point was that, since she has this particular mental habit, people (usually, specifically, her enemies) see her as a sociopath. Rationality /in general/ doesn't make a character seem like a sociopath; but this /particular/ mental habit /does/.

  The word you're looking to describe her is "smart".

There's no definition of "smart" that implies that you actually /do/ things that help you win. People can /be/ smart, but people can't /do/ smart. (/Being/ smart is a description of how well it seems like a person /could/ do, given all the stuff they know and all the mental skills they've cultivated, but this is just a maximum, and implies nothing about whether they'll live up to it.)

When a person is actually "doing smart"---using their mental skills in practice to help them achieve their goals---we describe that as /being/ (instrumentally) rational.
