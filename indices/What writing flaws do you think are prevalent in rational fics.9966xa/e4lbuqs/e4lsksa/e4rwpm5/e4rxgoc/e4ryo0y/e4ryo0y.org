Taylor is emotionally driven. It's a core part of her character. The reason other people don't see her like that is because her power lets her express body language through her swarm so they never see her react. From what we can see, it's clear she has a terrible handle on her emotions. She is absolutely expressing emotion, it's a driving force in the story, but Wildbow is subtle about it since we're never outright told it.
