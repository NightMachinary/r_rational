Super good post.

Worm spoiler:\\
I don't know that it makes any difference, but I think it's important to understand/realize that Taylor isn't delaying her processing of trauma or emotion, but simply offloading it into her swarm. She's shunting those emotions away from herself so she doesn't process them at all. This is super unhealthy, because she doesn't realize just how much she's using this to cope, and because she's only shunting the emotions she doesn't want to feel at any time (so she's left with the righteous anger/rage that you identified)
