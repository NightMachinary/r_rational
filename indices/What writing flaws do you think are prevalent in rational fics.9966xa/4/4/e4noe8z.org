There's the implicit version of this where the character is written by a very unemotional person so they don't really know how to write a character getting realistically emotional in the sorts of extreme circumstances that fictional characters generally get into. This is less because the author thinks emotions are irrational than it is because rationality tends to attract unemotional people.
