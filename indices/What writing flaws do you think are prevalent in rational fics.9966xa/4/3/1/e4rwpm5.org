  Good example of this "problem", ratfic or not: Taylor in Worm.
#+end_quote

The person who consistently makes terrible decisions because of her distrust of authority? Taylor isn't rational, in the sense we're using, she doesn't attempt to improve her thought processes or act "rationally" at all (this doesn't mean being an unfeeling robot who never reacts emotionally, it means being aware of biases and strategies to think better and employing them). The word you're looking to describe her is "smart".
