Taylor constantly reacts throughout Worm in extremely emotional ways, frequently doing the wrong thing because of it. I don't understand how you can read Worm and come to the conclusion that Taylor is a stoic who always reacts to situations in the optimal, rational way.

I also disagree that it is rational to have a character react in rational ways while under emotional duress. That represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how people respond to stress. Your thoughts are not separate from your emotions. You do not have a compartment in your head for your emotions and a compartment in your head for your thoughts. The two are intimately related, with both motivating the other. It is severely irrational for a character to 'feel' an emotion, but then have that not actually affect the decisions they are making.
