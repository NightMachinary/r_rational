Spot on, I usually complain about casual inconsistencies in movies, character actions (unless extremely outside their own norm) do not trigger my "plot hole" antenna, because people do act inconsistently fairly often.

Another thing that bothers me is the "selfish-self interest" side of the rationality equation (you may notice my flair), while yes you could reduce everything except outright self-harm to it, the most cooperative behavior could be seen as "selfish-self interest" played by the most trusting Prisoner's Dilemma (which wouldn't bee to rational to do), but it's a fact that we as a species are intuitively cooperative (which gets harder when the scale gets bigger since our meaty brains can process only so many social relations).

Having the rationalist Ãœbermensch be only worried about his own utility functions make them jarring to read, some people seem to write about an utility-maximizer agent without a grip on his own humanity.

That's the main reason why I often see those protagonists as sociopathic.
