I still remember the start of a StarTrek movie where Bones (who has medical training) spends a flight talking with the guy sitting next to him (a MC) about how unsafe the vehicle which they're in is. It's never made clear which came first - the fear of flight, or the knowledge about how they rockets work and what can go wrong, but either way it's clear that Bones isn't entirely comfortable with that means of transportation, and hasn't overcome that fear, especially when everything is shaking. Additionally, his way of coping - talking about the danger - is at odds with that of everyone else - pretending that everything is fine, and nothing could go wrong. The guy responds, and they start talking, and this is all the information we have about how they become friends, and the only insight into why the MC is considered a potential future leader - maybe he's good with people?
