This isn't inherent to rational fics, none of the greats like HPMOR suffer from it, but often the MC makes all the right decisions then the plot gets really boring. They play it fairly safe, don't make any dumb decisions, then it's the MC just gliding through life getting stronger while preparing to face the Big Bad. A lot of rational fics I feel need to have some more significant threats outside of the MCs control appear to keep things exciting.
