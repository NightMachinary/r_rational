I don't think there's enough such work which is explicitly intended to be in the genre to make generalizations, and there's a bit of unfair selection effect where the admittance criteria are close enough to "general principles of good writing" that among literature which is retroactively admitted, only good works meet the criteria.

In general though when people are trying to sound smart in fiction, they use too much jargon for things that could be said more simply, make unrealistically stupid characters to show off the intelligence of the smart ones, conflate "rational" with cold detached spock archetypes, and overwrought pseudo-reductionist explanations for the story's magical elements which ultimately devolve into something much like sci-fi babble. I imagine people trying to write "rational" fiction would fall into the same traps.
