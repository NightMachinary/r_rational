My partner's chief complaint on the unreadability of some of the fiction I've suggested to her from here focused on its longwindedness, especially in contexts where including extra information is not only unnecessary but breaks the appropriate mood. Like, a monster will be mere feet away, charging the protagonist! Oh no! Whatever will he do?! and he'll think: wait, this reminds me of the time I fought all those other monsters, except actually calling them monsters is inappropriate because /Monstra/ is paraphyletic, and we prefer monophyly in our systematics, and what are the ethical implications of a speciest epithet, to be monstrous and despicable because of it? Should we not instead prefer greater inclusion, and are we not the most despicable monsters of all? And the charging monster will have hardly budged an inch in this time, the dramatic tension ruined.

I think skimming helps. Usually that's how I read most webfiction, and so hardly notice the longwindedness. Though I'll slow down if there's something I want to pay particular attention to.
