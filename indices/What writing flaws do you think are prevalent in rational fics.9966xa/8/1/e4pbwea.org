I dunno. I feel like you are kind of not embracing the medium? Like, when a novelist fucks off for a chapter or so on some random tangent that is bad. Because, ultimately, it is stealing words away from the main story. There is only so much book between the covers.

But it isn't like we are gonna run out of internet, yeah? I'll consume tangential materials from web serial authors, knowing it isn't costing me any main content.
