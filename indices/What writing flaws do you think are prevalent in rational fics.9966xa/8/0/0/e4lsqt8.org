  Like, a monster will be mere feet away, charging the protagonist! Oh no! Whatever will he do?! and he'll think: wait, this reminds me of the time I fought all those other monsters, except actually calling them monsters is inappropriate because Monstra is paraphyletic, and we prefer monophyly in our systematics, and what are the ethical implications of a speciest epithet, to be monstrous and despicable because of it? Should we not instead prefer greater inclusion, and are we not the most despicable monsters of all? And the charging monster will have hardly budged an inch in this time, the dramatic tension ruined.

That's actually a part of what made me write about the characters in the first place. I noticed in a fix fic that not only did a prodigious genius react in the way you described, but a regular girl who had no prior rational leanings reacted in precisely the same way. I realized that, everyone in the story would react the same way, because, at heart, everyone was the same character with different stats and goals.
