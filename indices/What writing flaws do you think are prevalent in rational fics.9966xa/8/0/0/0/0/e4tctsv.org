I don't know. For me, characters, who they are and how they collide with the others, should influence the plot, but I can reluctantly accept the plot being an external thing that just marches our characters along with no choice whatsoever. But what you're suggesting seems like a step beyond that, bordering on mind control. Plot actively controlling who the characters are on the inside and how they react.
