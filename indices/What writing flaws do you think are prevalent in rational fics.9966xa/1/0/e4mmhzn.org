  making Naruto â€˜smart' .. changes the dynamic of his team. Without the central tension between Naruto and Sasuke, the driving force of the plot is gone

This is only a problem if they try [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][still using the old plot and tension devices]] after the changes they've made. If they adjust the genre and spirit of the story accordingly, this doesn't have to be a problem.

Using the same example, all these canon's inefficient bickering and conflict resolutions were there, because content like that was interesting to the readerbase. And since with a rational story the audience itself has different preferences, putting all these [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall][conflicts balls]] back in wouldn't work.

Is it unrealistic for a 12-13 year old to make seemingly too optimised decisions for his age and have high emotional control? Maybe it is in real world (haven't looked up any potentially existing research on this), but this is the author's world --- if he says chakra (or HP's magic, etc) enhances the mind, then it does. The problem that remains is to keep the story self-consistent with this introduced rule (e.g. with all other things being equal, all chakra-wielding children of the same talent will be getting the same intelligence boost, not just the MC).
