Right, there's nothing intrinsically *wrong* with deviating from the canon, but it's a problem if you don't realize the consequences to the overall story. Specifically, it's worth remembering that when you write rational fanfiction, you're still mainly writing for readers who enjoyed the original.

So for example, in HPMOR Harry is completely different from canon, but it still *feels* like you're reading a Harry Potter book because all of the wonder and the magic is still there. Imagine if instead Harry was completely uncaring about magic because he just saw it as a tool to be used. It wouldn't be appealing at all.

And that's the big advantage of writing an author tract: Sure, the fact that Harry is basically Eliezer can make it feel a bit preachy, but at least you get to feel like there's a real human being experiencing these things. And that's also why the SPHEW arc feels weakest: Aside from being tacked on, it doesn't feel *real* because they're just a bunch of events that happen for the sake of plot.

The contrast with the Azkeban arc could not be starker: There, you have the constant sense that anything could happen at any moment. As a reader you know that Harry is not going to die, but it *feels* like he might because the whole thing is written from the perspective of a real human being who has placed himself in that situation. You can tell that Eliezer felt the visceral horror of the dementors while he was writing. And for rational fiction, that sense of realness is essential. After all, if you're not going to connect your writing to the real world, then you might as well just write regular fiction.
