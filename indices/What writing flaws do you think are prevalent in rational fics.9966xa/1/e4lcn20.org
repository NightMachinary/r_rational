A lack of realism. Or rather, a failure to make the world and challenges feel *real*.

Eliezer Yudkowsky once remarked that first-person stories like Dreaming of Sunshine feel more rational because it forces the author to view everything from the MCs eyes: What would /they/ do in that situation? What biases might they experience? What real-life challenges might they face? It makes the obstacles feel more real, and that makes the payoff from a clever solution that much more rewarding.

Instead, many authors treat their stories as text book problems. They look at the problem from god's POV, ask themselves what the optimal solution is, and then simply have the MC do that and let it work.

A related problem is a failure to appreciate what made the canon attractive to read in the first place. For example, authors will make Naruto â€˜smart' by having him read a ton of books, without realizing that this completely changes the dynamic of his team. Without the central tension between Naruto and Sasuke, the driving force of the plot is gone and the whole thing starts to feel like wish fulfillment.
