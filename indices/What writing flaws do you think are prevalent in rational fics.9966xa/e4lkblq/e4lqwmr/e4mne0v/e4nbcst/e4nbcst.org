Unfortunately, since we're all in the same place, I think I'll be naming some things that have been brought up before. Also, I spend most of my time reading fanfiction that appeal to me specifically, which means that I'm not sure if they'd suit your tastes, and they're usually popular, which means that even if they do suit your tastes you've probably heard of them already. I also like female protags (I used to solely read published fiction, so I think I got sick of the umpteenth dude protagonist in my fantasy stories and did a full 180), so lots of these have female MCs.

With that out of the way, there are a few stories I really enjoyed:

Worm, obviously, by Wildbow. Lots of people have criticisms and lots of people are right, but in the end it's great and I don't know how many hours I've sunk into Worm fanfiction.

A Practical Guide to Evil for obvious reasons

Worth the Candle, once again for obvious reasons

Puella Magi Adfligo Systema: this is a PMMM fanfiction that is actually (I would say) extremely rational, due to the nature of it being a popular quest that people discuss and put a lot of time into and also because the main character is extremely smart and considerate.

To the Stars: a really good basically hard sci-fi PMMM fanfiction that doesn't require prior knowledge of PMMM but will be better with it, it's about humanity in like the 2400's and the tech advancement is realistic and some scenes are really epic.

Puella Magi Imperatrix Mundi: also a PMMM fanfic, also rational due to it being a quest and the MC attempting to make good decisions because life or death is often on the line, it's really cute and the story is fun but the author is sporadic, last updated this February.

Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest: BAHHSCQ is not a fanfic quest, but more of a parody of anime tropes, but it's done "parody" so well that it has an extremely well-done and believable fleshed-out universe and a very sympathetic and extremely intelligent main character. Updates are sporadic, but the author has told me he isn't dead, so I have hope. This story is probably one of the more heartstring-tugging stories I've read in a while, and yet it's also extremely satisfying and fun to read. I highly recommend it if you haven't read it before, it's sooooo good.

Now You Feel Like Number None: Great bleach quest, I'd say it's rational because it's a quest and because the MC is once again the kind of person to do their best to achieve the best outcome.

A Path Stained Red: I can't link this, it's on QQ and also not safe for work, but it's about a reincarnated pokemon trainer who is innately psychic and does crazy shit. I'd say it's somewhat rational in how they approach the world. The writing is kind of rough around the edges but this story sucked me in despite me being a stickler for well-constructed stories and it's one of the few that I actively follow. Shenanigans all around and an MC who does pretty morally questionable things in her pursuit of power.

Golden Empire: I can't link to this because it's on fiction.live and that site is very, very NSFW, but it's also an epic-length quest that has amazing worldbuilding and a smart main character.

Dreaming of Sunshine: Naruto fanfiction, you've probably heard of it, pretty good.

So yeah, that's 10 fics that I'd say are relatively or are rational. I've got more recs but they aren't really rational and I'd say that currently, I don't really read those kind of fics anymore. I'm working on my own rational fic currently but it's only 41k words in, needs to be edited and uploaded somewhere, and I don't want to shill for myself, but in any case that's also why I'm reading a little less now and working on my own stuff.

Hope some of these helped!

EDIT: Also, I'm sure I have more stuff, but I've read too many things and I've probably forgotten some of them by now. Which is to say, I'm not sure if these are the ones I've MOST enjoyed, ever ever ever, but they stand out to me in recent memory.
