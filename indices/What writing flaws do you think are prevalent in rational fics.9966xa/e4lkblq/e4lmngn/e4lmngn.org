I don't mind if a work is long if it regularly feeds me additional plot. I need something like a (dramatic) climax on a regular basis or I'm constantly asking myself why I'm still reading. Nothing wears me out like the idea that a fundamental crisis is simply never going to come to a head.

I have questions. The author has established those questions. Giving me small answers from time to time, introducing new questions, works a lot better than extended side plots dealing with some side character's loyalty mission or some aspect of the backstory that nobody but the author cares about.

I'd like to see episodic fiction written like episodic TV: Each episode with its own self-contained and satisfying plot, even as it's spiced liberally with hints and challenges related to the ongoing arc.
