This reminds me of a passage from Dreaming of Sunshine:

#+begin_quote
  It made no sense. Why speak to us, then hide? Why set us on our guard? It was terrifying, but it would have been so much worse if he hadn't introduced himself.

  /Hello, my name is Zabuza Momochi and I'll be your assassin for this evening./
#+end_quote

This illustrates the problem: monologuing (and his uglier friend "repeat the broken logic until it sounds true"). Its a sub section of the "show, don't tell" problem and plagues quite a bit of rational works. There are others, but for me this is a big no-no as far as rational stories go.

But even before the rational aspect, a lot of authors have trouble with the more "classic" pitfalls of writing: Fleshing out characters, pacing, avoiding tunnel vision, grounded romance, personality variety for a group yet consistent for a character, grammar, and so on.

The first step (IMO) for a great rational story is not a rational protagonist, but a believable world.

[edit] And just because you are using an established franchise, doesn't mean you get to skip those.
