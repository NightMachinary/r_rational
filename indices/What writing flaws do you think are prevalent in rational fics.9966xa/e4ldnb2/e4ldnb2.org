Some stories try too hard to make their 'rationalist' character be the smartest in the room, much smarter than all those stupid scientists who dedicate their lives to the study of a subject. By applying absolutely basic logic, the main character determines a glaring flaw in the core of their practice and is praised as a genius.

It only shows the weakness of the author, and how huge their ego is.
