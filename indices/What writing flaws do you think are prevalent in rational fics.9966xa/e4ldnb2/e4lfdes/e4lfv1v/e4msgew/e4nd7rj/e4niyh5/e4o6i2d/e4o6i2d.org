Nightlord series is great for this. The main character is often, by far, the smartest man in the room. His crippling inferiority complex and lack of social awareness often form the root of his issues. The trope of the absentminded scientist plays out...but it doesn't /feel/ like a trope since the character is so obviously enjoying playing with ideas that he just honestly did build a potentially world destroying device without thinking about the consequences....oops. But even when he misses the small, normal, person to person interactions, the reasons why people like/respect/love him, he catches the larger social interactions. Why a group of people would do x or y under certain situations.

The character feels /real/ in other words. More, /every/ character has this type of thing going on. Each has a personality and history, drives, wants, and wishes. Each acts accordingly, no one feels like a cookie cut out.

His evil bad guys are a bit less nuanced, but even that has improved in later books.
