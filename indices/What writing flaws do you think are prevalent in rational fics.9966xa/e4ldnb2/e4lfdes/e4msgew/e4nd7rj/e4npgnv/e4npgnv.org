You can have almost any amount of unrealistic luck /as long as it happens before the start of the story/. Think of the story's world as a thing that exists before the story is written - and then the author picks which character to follow. It's natural for them to pick the most interesting character, and the most interesting character probably has a non-standard background and isn't average. (Think of it as a form of the anthropic principle)
