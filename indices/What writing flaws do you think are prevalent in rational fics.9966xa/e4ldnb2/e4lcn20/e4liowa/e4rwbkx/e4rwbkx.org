I blame HPMOR for that. The founding example of rational fiction has a character who rarely questions his prior knowledge or, say, do an actual experiment that isn't just applying his super special knowledge he has from being so much more enlightened than everyone else. I was expecting a story where Harry shot spells through slits to see if they're a particle or wave (or neither), that is definitely not what happened.

An example of where HPJEV should have questioned his assumptions but didn't: McGonagall turned into a cat with a cat brain, but kept a human mind. This implies the mind may not exist within the brain like he thought, but he keeps on assuming something like a soul has to be impossible and doesn't even consider the possibility he might be wrong (because EY has correctly deduced this is the case IRL doesn't mean it has to be that in the story, or that the protagonist should somehow know without testing it).
