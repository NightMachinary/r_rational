the game systems tend to be REALLY obnoxious and i'm glad to see that only in amateur web novels.

also, the pace of how are written actions scene tend to be too slow and descriptive. the reader can imagine details on his own, i find more interesting to see crazy fast thinking or cut sentences to describe the [[https://scene.It][scene. It]] turn up the heat.
