Lack of concision. I think there's an incentive to just neutrally describe what is happening without cutting anything out in rationalfic, because if you only describe the important parts, then the reader has a perverse incentive to read into little things in a special fantastical way- to reason as though the world runs on drama- and it fails at being rationalfic. No idea how to solve this.
