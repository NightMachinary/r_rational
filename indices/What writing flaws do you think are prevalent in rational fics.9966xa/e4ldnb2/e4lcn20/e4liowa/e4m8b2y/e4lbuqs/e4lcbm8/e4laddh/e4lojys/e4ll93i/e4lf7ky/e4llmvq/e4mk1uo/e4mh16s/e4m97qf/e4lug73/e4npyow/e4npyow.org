A lot of times the Big Bad also doesn't get to make any new plans/otherwise respond to what the main character does to thwart him. He just sits on his throne as his plot is dismantled. I love stories where the antagonist feels like a horrific threat, who adapts and responds and counters the main character's every move. HPMOR is a good example, in Worm there are several villains like that, the only fic that gets a pass is MoL and that's because of the time loop.
