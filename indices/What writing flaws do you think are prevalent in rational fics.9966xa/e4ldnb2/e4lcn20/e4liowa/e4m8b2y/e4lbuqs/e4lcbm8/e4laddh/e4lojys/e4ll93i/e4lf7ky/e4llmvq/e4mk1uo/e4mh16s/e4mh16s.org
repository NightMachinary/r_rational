I frequently see characters who are right too often. They're reasoning rationally, and not making any leaps, but they have a gift for intuition that comes from sharing the author's brain, and from conservation of detail.

If they notice something, it's probably important; if they form a hypothesis, it's more likely to be correct than they themselves have reason to believe.
