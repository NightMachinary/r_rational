I think that lots of rational fictions have a problem where their characters don't feel like actual people. They don't talk like people, they don't think like people, and they respond to situations in ways that aren't particularly reminiscent of how people react to situations. They might be similar to people, but because the author wants to demonstrate rationality they end up having a main character who is absurdly rational. This isn't to say that they lack emotions, although they might sometimes lack emotions, but the problem is more along the lines of them never reacting in a wrong way. They might do the wrong thing, or they might be wrong about something, but they very rarely react in split section situations with anything but perfect rationality. There are also other issues where secondary characters tend to be very weak and usually there is just one main character; this might be just a natural result of having a first person perspective in many rational fics, but I don't find that to be a very convincing argument. Those are, I think, the two biggest flaws in rational fic that I have observed.
