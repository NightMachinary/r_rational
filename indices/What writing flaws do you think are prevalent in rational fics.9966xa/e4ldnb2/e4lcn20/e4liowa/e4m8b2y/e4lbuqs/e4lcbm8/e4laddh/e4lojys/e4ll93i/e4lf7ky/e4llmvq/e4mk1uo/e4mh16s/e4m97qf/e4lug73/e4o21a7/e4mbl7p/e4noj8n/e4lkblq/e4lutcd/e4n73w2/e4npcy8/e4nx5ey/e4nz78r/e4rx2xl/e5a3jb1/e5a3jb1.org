I don't know that it's a writing flaw, or that it's specific to rational fics, but I really dislike when characters don't have a solid flavor. Like, preferring certain things or courses of action. Something as simple as a favorite meal, or past-time makes the characters far more identifiable. When we get a solid feeling for how the character thinks, what they value, those are things I look for and often characters in rational fics kinda don't seem to have those. Their actions are dictated by whatever contrivance is currently in-scene rather than a overriding principle of the character.

Related to that is the short-game vs long-game planning. Characters often make choices which are optimized in the moment, but don't reflect a consistent strategy which would make them more relatable/predicable. Being relatable/predicable makes is easier for others to side with and ally with you. When someone understands what you stand for, they can either side with you, or choose not to. By focusing purely on what's in their best interest in the moment, they often overlook longer-term strategies, though authors rarely have these matter in their stories.

I'm not certain if it's on the rational fiction spectrum, but a story which does a fantastic job at creating consistent characters is Beanstalk by E. Jade Lomax (available free ([[https://ejadelomax.com/leaguesandlegends/beanstalk/][here]])) [It's super good]
