For a contrasting viewpoint, I actually prefer (obviously well-written) epic-length stories. I read pretty fast and even the longest ones don't take me that long to read, so I constantly hunger for more stories to read. I've been getting really picky about what I like, too, which means my story selection is getting slimmer, which means that I really appreciate the longer, well-written stories instead of having to sift through dozens of shorter ones that don't align with my interests.

This gets to the point where I currently actively refuse to read anything below 100-200k words, unless there's something really good in there and/or it's been recommended to me by multiple people. I get really sad when I read something good and I want /more/, except it's too short so now I either have to wait or I'm left unsatisfied because I want to see more of the story/world.

Er, actually, I also have an aversion to endings, because I'm not usually satisfied with the vast majority of them, so I really like finding ongoing, super-long fics that are in excess of 600k words.
