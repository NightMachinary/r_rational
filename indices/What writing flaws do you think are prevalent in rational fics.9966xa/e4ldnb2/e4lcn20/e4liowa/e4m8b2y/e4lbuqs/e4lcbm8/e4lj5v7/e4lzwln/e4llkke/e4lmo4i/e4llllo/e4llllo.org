[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(novel)][Aurora]] by Kim Stanley Robinson would probably qualify. It's handled very well and it was honestly kind of heart-wrenching reading about someone who knew they were dumb but couldn't change it. I recommend giving it a read as the book itself is excellent.
