Taking emotions as /universally/ irrational, emotion can lead to irrational thoughts/action but feeling emotions isn't irrational.\\
The majority of humanity isn't sociopathic, at least I would hope so.

The "rational" character being immune to emotional moments caused by happenings in the story really turns me off.
