  I don't understand how you can read Worm and come to the conclusion that Taylor is a stoic who always reacts to situations in the optimal, rational way.

I didn't say that Taylor reacts optimally/rationally. I'm saying that Taylor seems like a sociopath /to other characters in the story/, because she delays processing trauma to deal with the latest thing that's going on. She has plenty of other emotional reactions, but people read her as "a sociopath" anyway because she specifically doesn't externalize emotions of fear, guilt, or shame. She internalizes them, which causes other emotions (like rage) to come to the fore in their place. (Same is true of plenty of other characters in /Worm/. Same is true of Harry in HPMoR, for that matter.)

  I also disagree that it is rational to have a character react in rational ways while under emotional duress. That represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how people respond to stress. Your thoughts are not separate from your emotions. You do not have a compartment in your head for your emotions and a compartment in your head for your thoughts. The two are intimately related, with both motivating the other. It is severely irrational for a character to 'feel' an emotion, but then have that not actually affect the decisions they are making.

Are you using "rational" here in some uncommon sense? I'm pretty sure it would be irrational to die in the burning building. It would be rational to do whatever it takes to /stop/ yourself from dying in the burning building. One thing such rationality can require is "controlling and suppressing your own emotions."

Note that I'm not saying that this is a /realistic/ response for your average human being. Not succumbing to grief in such a situation would require a Zen master. What I'm saying is that /that Zen mastery/ is "a rationality skill" that you should seek to attain, for the same reason you seek to attain any other rationality skill: to help you win.

And so, if you're writing a ratfic where your protagonist character is explicitly "rational"---then them being able to avoid succumbing to their emotions under stress, is a sensible character trait for them to have. (As long as you, as the author, have a good justification for why they're like that---since humans aren't normally like that.)
