Bujold has some great works here. I damn near cried for Miles when his grandfather dies, the shear shame and self loathing he experiences when he feels /he/ is the cause...all while in, what? the second or third chapter? That's barely enough time to introduce basic motivations for the cast and all ready I'm almost in tears here? sheesh!

Miles is a seriously twisted and tortured genius who is strait jacketed not just by culture and circumstance but his unwillingness to unbind himself from his own social circumstance, so when he finally does let loose? it feels like someone just let loose a starved weasel in a hen house...only a /cunning/ and /controlled/ one. A feeling of 'oh shit, it's going to happen now!'

I loved that series so much, I /blatantly/ stole Miles' solution to the rescue of the emperor for how my mc outwits a ambush political plot. /blatant/ rip off. what is that fancy french word that means to imitate in celebration of someone else's work? that thing...only not so fancy, or well done. =-P

Seriously though, all her work is awesome and should be read.
