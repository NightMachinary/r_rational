  In fanfic: Failing to revise the universe enough to avoid the Stations of the Canon, produce coherence and re-interest the reader who has otherwise seen this universe before.

That's a very fine and difficult line to thread, for my own experience I can say that I have felt turned down from a story because it went too much outside what's reasonable to expect from that setting as many times as they went into canon rehashes.

And in some sense the former is worse, because I do agree that revising parts of the known universe makes the fanfic more interesting, it's a careful game of balance I have seen only the very best succeeding in a satisfactory way (in my limited subjective experience).
