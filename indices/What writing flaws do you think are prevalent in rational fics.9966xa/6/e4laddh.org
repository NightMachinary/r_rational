Exposition and characters that are contesters for [[/r/iamverysmart][r/iamverysmart]]. Instead of telling people how they are smarter, more intelligent or better than everyone else they should react believably to whatever the scenario or challenge is. Some of this can be addressed as a part of character development. Punch to the face or isolation can fix a few personality flaws.

The problem a lot of authors face is knowledge of what's going on, and unable to prevent that meta knowledge from affecting the MC. Or again, exposition dumps.

To me rational is mostly a case of keeping a cool head, or knowing when you need to cool down. Taking time to think.

Smarter the character is the the more switched on and quicker on they uptake they are.
