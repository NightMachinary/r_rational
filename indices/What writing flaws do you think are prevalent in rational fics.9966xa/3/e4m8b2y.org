Lack of strong feelings. To be fair, successfully embedding powerful sympathetic emotions in writing is not an easy writing challenge in general. Failing at strong feelings is true of almost all other fiction everywhere, with shining exceptions hither and yon like Lois McMaster Bujold or Orson Scott Card; but it feels like a lot of rationalfic isn't even /trying/ to make the reader feel strong things.

Only having one intelligent character. Only having intelligent characters who are all intelligent in the same way. Failing at Level 1 character intelligence, or failing to make it past Level 1 character intelligence while clearly having tried to do so.

In fanfic: Failing to revise the universe enough to avoid the Stations of the Canon, produce coherence and re-interest the reader who has otherwise seen this universe before.
