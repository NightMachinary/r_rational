It's about one specific ratfic, but it bothered me how in HPMoR, Harry (and, by extension, everybody else important in the universe) seem to fetishize being analytically clever, to the extent that it stunted what should have been normal social skills. As one reviewer pointed out, conversations between Quirrel/Malfoy/Potter tended to take the following form:

#+begin_quote
  “Here is an awesome manipulation I'm using against you”

  “My, that is an effective manipulation. You are a dangerous man”

  “I know, but I also know that you are only flattering me as an attempt to manipulate me.”

  “My, what an effective use of Bayesian evidence that is!”
#+end_quote

That whole "which level are you playing at" nonsense is an example of what I'm talking about. Normal people don't worry about stuff like that, generally trusting their fast-response social intuition instead of using their slow-response intellect to try to rationally figure out if another person is telling the truth (which isn't any more likely to be correct, and may even be worse, due to fast-response working so well with subconscious indicators).
