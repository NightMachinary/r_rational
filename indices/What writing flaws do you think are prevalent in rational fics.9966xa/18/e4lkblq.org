Length. Jesus wept the /length/. It's like nobody knows how to write anything that isn't longer than the bible. I'm not even talking short stories: even novel-length completed works are rare. I get the impression that this might be more of a problem with fanfic in general, though (although I read essentially no non-rational fanfic, so that impression might well be entirely wrong).
