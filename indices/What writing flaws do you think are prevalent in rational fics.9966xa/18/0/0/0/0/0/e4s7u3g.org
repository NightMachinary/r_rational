Oh my god that's a good description. Unfortunately, I'm well beyond that point and everything is basically mixed in my head aside from a few stand-outs.

And yeah, Bad Writing tropes are unfortunately really common in fanfics because---I think, at least---many people write a story in the way that they feel like a story should be written, with the protagonist having to, for example, have some kind of setback even if it doesn't make sense in-story. Which is why I like Practical Guide to Evil so much, it's literally the trope reversal of that haha.
