I remember an essay by Andrzej Sapkowski where he pointed problems of serialized fantasy novels and insulted them. And then finished with "I'm doing a serialized novel too (Witcher) and I'm part of the problem, but an author gonna eat"

P.S. Here you can find some parts of that essay [[https://www.reddit.com/r/wiedzmin/comments/8jn8hm/andrzej_sapkowski_about_the_roots_of_fantasy/]]
