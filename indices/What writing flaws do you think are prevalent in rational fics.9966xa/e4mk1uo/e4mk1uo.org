Every explicitly rational protagonist seems to be the same personality profile.

- Male, early adulthood.
- Middling agreeableness, openeness, and extraversion, low-to-middle neuroticism, and high conscientiousness.
- Systematizing knowledge over organizing people, explicit communication over implicit.
- Epistemological rationality over instrumental rationality.
- Anger/grief/rage against the system as the chief negative emotion/source of emotion.
- Low politeness, high love of humanity.
- Introvert, but willing to adventure. More of a discoverer of new stuff, than one who experiences wonders.
- Liberal ideology (freedom and equality for all, power to the individual, etc.)

All of these point towards a particular archetype. The best stories on this sub seems to be the ones that break this profile:

- Practical Guide (MC: woman, barely agreeeable, high neuroticism, organizing-type, patriot socialist)
- Luminosity (woman, instrumental rationality, high agreeableness/politeness, low neuroticism, organizer)
- Scar's Samsara (MC: male but older, polite, implicit communication focus, low openness?)
