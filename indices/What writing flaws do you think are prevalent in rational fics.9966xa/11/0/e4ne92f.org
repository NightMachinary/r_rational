you forgot Mother of Learning. by far the best story of the sub (not fully objective but i stand by that) and the mc: man, young, obnoxious to others, think of himself as intelligent when he actually make a LOT of mistakes in everything, don't really care about others, not prone to adventure but is bored as everyone would etc...

One of the many interesting things in that novel is to follow the change in his personality as he experience many new things (even there, he still will not change in a souless mc full of correctness and love).
