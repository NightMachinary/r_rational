Fenskept beat me to Flowers for Algernon. It's a great example of scaling up and down intelligence. As the character grows more complex, the emotions he's capable of change. My wife says Gimpel the Fool is a good one. To Kill a Mockingbird is a great example of what average intelligence looks like. Tortilla Flat by Steinbeck is a loving look at a group of bums that aren't that bright; Cannery Row by Steinbeck does something similar.

A lot of rational writers don't like short sentences or simple dialogue, but brevity can lead to great characterization. Also, in my experience, the range of emotions ignorant and unintelligent people feel is less complex if just as intense. The sentences they think and write in are either simple sentences or run-ons, because there's a lack of experience and perhaps a lack of capacity for multiple thoughts at once.
