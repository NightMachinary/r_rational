Hmm...lack of strong feelings. I would say that ties into the need for narrative conflict, or making the challenges feel real.

The character has to want something, and then fail to get it. If a problem arises, and the first thing the characters do is tackle it logically and with minimal feeling, and then the character /wins/, then I think the author is missing a valuable opportunity to make the story more relatable.

I think Avatar the Last Airbender did this really well. We have Aang and his crew about to fight the Fire Nation, and at the end of the second season they lose. Badly. It was bold for a kids' cartoon, but very compelling and used to propel the narrative arcs of every character. We see not only the heroes struggling from the effects of that loss in the 3rd season, but some of the villains as well.

We care when the characters we like get hurt. Then we root for them to come back and win.
