Fix-fic masquerading as rational-fic. Too much fanfiction that's described as 'rational' doesn't involve actual rationality,just the characters using 'rationality' to get meta-knoweldge, because the author knows all the twists already. Also, there has to be conflict. You'd think this is obvious, but too many writers seem to think their rational protagonists should win at everything always forever.
