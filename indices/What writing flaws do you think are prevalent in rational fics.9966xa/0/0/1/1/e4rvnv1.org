There are also other smart people in the world besides the hero. If your smart protagonist does something there has to be a reason no one else has; either it relies on some unique advantage, something that has recently changed (like a new invention), or the situation is so specific no one else has had to solve the problem before.

That's why IMO something like, say, Mind Tailed Fox is far better than HPMOR.
