I agree it really would be hilarious, but it's a little further than I want to go, though. As to things that might contradict it...hm. Possibly the bombing in chapter 6 ("Niven's Foot Falls"), or the Robert-using-telescope in chapter 46 ("Not Run'n'Gun"). Not sure. Those could be painted either way, probably.
