Though I sincerely doubt you can use it, I think it would be absolutely hilarious to have Jake come to the realization that everyone around him can't see anything past a hundred yards, and that this has been the case the entire time - they think that it's normal. (I cannot recall whether this is contradicted by anything in the text, but I imagine that it is.)

Edit: Also, Mt. Everst gets a -16 on the Spot DC for being Colossal, so it wouldn't be /that/ hard to see. :)
