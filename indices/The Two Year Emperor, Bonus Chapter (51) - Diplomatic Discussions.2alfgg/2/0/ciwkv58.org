  Reference to the V Vs Epic Dragon scene of OOTS?
#+end_quote

Yep. :) That scene was half written before I realized that Rich had beaten me to it. I decided to keep it as it was; V/Dragon is so epic that I thought the nod wouldn't go amiss.

And yes, things are about to get very hairy for our heroes.

Arannias (the continent where Flobovia resides) is not known in the Union. The GrÇ«fhamrites were motivated to do research looking for a safe haven, and they found a passing reference deep in one of their archives to Arannias. Afi and the other Lich Kings have not found out about it...yet.
