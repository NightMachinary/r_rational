Reference to the V Vs Epic Dragon scene of OOTS?

Awesome as that scene was, this suggests extremely worrying things are about to happen. Afi knows where they are, has access to functionally limitless resources and presumably has more of a plan that to waltz in and kill/kidnap/subvert their leadership.

Incidentally, why haven't the lich kings ever invaded Flobovia or places on that continent? And since they do not appear to have done so, why not move Grofhamr there?
