I am curious whether you have rough character stats for everyone - at least a list of what levels they all have. Detect Thoughts could come from cleric (with knowledge domain), sorcerer, wizard, or bard levels. I don't really know what I would imagine as Thomas's extra levels, but he's got to be at least a little bit of fighter.
