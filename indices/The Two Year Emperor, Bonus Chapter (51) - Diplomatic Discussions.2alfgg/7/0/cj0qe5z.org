I was not! I just read through it; interesting scenario. I'm not going to do a straight expy of it, but it does give me some ideas. I've always intended for Afi to end up as a relatable character -- after all "he's the villain because he's evil" is boring and not rational. This is a different direction than what I'd been thinking of, but there is some good stuff here.

Thanks for the pointer.
