Hmm. Afi does say he has multiple classes, and if he's 20th level in wizard and 20th level in sorcerer and say 10th level in cleric, wouldn't he be close to a physical match in terms of HP, BAB, etc for a 20th level paladin? Also, as an undead he's immune to critical hits, and has a variety of other advantages that the Anti-Magic Field shouldn't affect much. Am I missing something?
