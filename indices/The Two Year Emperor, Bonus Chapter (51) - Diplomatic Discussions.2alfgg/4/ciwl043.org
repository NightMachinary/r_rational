I'm a little sad how short that encounter was.

I was really hoping for a great "No mister bond, I expect you to dine" scene.

With the obviously fake Afi, an antimagic field, and GrÇ«fhamr sealed, there was the chance there for some real communication.

From what little we've seen, Afi seems like a pretty swell guy, and a potential dark rationalist to rival MOR!Quirrel.
