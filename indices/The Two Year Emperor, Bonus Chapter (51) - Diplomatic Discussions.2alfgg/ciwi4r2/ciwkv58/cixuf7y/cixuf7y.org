I feel stupid now - even having reread the chapter, I don't get this reference, though it's been a while since I read that part of OOTS. Can anybody banish my dimwitted ignorance?

Edit: It occurs to me also that, honestly, being a lich, being smart (it seems) and undoubtedly having access to Greater Teleport, how come Afi didn't just pop into space quickly (a bit of Cold Resistance should do it to protect against space; vacuum doesn't do much to bones, does it? - not that a person like Afi couldn't protect himself against space regardless, I think) and sketch out a map of the entire planet ages ago?
