Spot is a poorly phrased skill. It says:

"The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. [...] Every time you have a chance to spot some*thing* [emphasis added] in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an action."

So, it's not clear that Spot is actually used for seeing things that aren't creatures, but it probably is. Let's go with that. In that case, the "Spot Check Penalties" table comes into effect, specifically the "-1 per 10' of distance" penalty.

Low Earth Orbit varies 100-1200 miles. Let's say 100. That's 5280*100 / 10 = 52,800 increments of 10', for a -52800 penalty on your spot checks. At that point, you couldn't see Mt Everest.

Of course, this gets even worse when we're looking up. D&D characters can't see the moon, let alone the sun...stars are *right out*.

So, no. If we were going by strict RAW then you probably couldn't do orbital mapping. Or astronomy. Or see people down the street. Or...well, basically anything that isn't within about a hundred feet of you. Archers would be firing blind at anything less than short range.

Of course, Spot may not apply to any of that. Like I said, it's poorly written.
