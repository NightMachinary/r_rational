Hey EagleJarl, are you aware of [[http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Millennial_King][The Millennial king?]] I really think he could be an inspiration in what a good-aligned Lich could be like.

I've got this funny notion of a good person who became a Lich solely to survive the cycle of civilization's destruction and restarting. Rather than trying to fight the cycle, he simply puts his nation into hibernation, PAO'ing the entire population to a million tiny beads until the long night is over and the gods start making people again.
