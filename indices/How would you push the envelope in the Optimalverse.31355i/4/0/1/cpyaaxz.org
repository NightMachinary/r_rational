Well, regardless of the interest in 'multiple forms,' I would doubtlessly create a unicorn avatar, if for no reason other than the possibility of the great potential in interesting magical research and experimentation.

I suppose I'm not seeing the issue with shapechanging spells; it's not like I'm asking to be not-pony most of the time; If I find exploring other forms interesting, wouldn't allowing that through the use of unicorn magic be fulfilling values through ponies regardless? /Shrugs/

Additionally, it must not have been clear in my previous text, but the monthly review isn't intended to be this version of me judging every future iteration of me forever. It's merely a periodic rollback point, and it's entirely possible I would judge an iteration of myself to be happy and stable enough to make that my new default from which to judge future iterations. There is the danger, of course, of becoming murder!ghandi, but it's not like that's not already a danger with normal human mental growth. I'm just matching additional potential for change (mental modifications) with what seems like a sensible safeguard.
