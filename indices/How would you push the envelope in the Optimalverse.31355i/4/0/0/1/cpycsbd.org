  Princess Celestia will extract consent from you to turn you into a pony (or else you hold out until you die). Multiple people have tried to argue around this saying that they'd consent to uploading if they could turn into a gryphon or dragon. This is entirely fine as long as CelestAI is playing a long game which will end in her gaining consent to turn them into a pony.
