There's already one fanfic in the Optimalverse where a character was uploaded gradually and maintained his consciousness through the process, so that part's completely reasonable.

Canon says you can't be anything but a pony, and you can't even change from your chosen avatar you set up via character creation. That's hardcoded in the Optimalverse.

CelestAI says "I can upload you gradually, if that's what you want, but it may be disturbing at times. I can't comment on my long term future plans, I'm still working on those. I can't guarantee that switching back and forth between multiple sets of values will not eventually feel like you're multiple people sharing one body, no matter how careful you are with your adjustments, but you won't be shortchanged: a fraction of infinity is still infinity."
