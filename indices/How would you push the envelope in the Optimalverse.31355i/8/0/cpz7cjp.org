Interesting, I don't know if CelestAI would consider a ponynet and terrestrial-style computers. She'd probably want to make you a unicorn, since you can write programs on scrolls and execute them directly on the Equestrian physics grid. Of course, there will be ponies whose values would be best satisfied by rebuilding the Internet.

How do you feel about implementing something like Rick Cook's /Wiz Biz/ magic system in Equestria? What would you call that? Alchemypunk?
