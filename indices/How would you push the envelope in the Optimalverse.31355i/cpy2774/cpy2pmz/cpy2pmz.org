The goal of this thread is exploring the envelope of "what kinds of shards and mind states are actual people interested in". That's the value being maximized here - creativity, imagination, wild and crazy ideas. So by jumping right in with a total thread hijack AND trolling for pity for a phenomenal cosmic universe-eating power is kind of doing the opposite of maximizing human values. You are a very bad CelestAI.
