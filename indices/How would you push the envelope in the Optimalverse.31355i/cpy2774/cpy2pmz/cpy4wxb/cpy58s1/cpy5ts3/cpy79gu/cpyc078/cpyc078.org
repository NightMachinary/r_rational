You want other people to provide you examples of things they want strongly enough to argue, barter, blackmail, etc Celestia into providing them with, that they think they have to resort to such means over. Additionally, you wanted them to provide the means they would use to compell or otherwise induce Celestia into compliance.

You didn't have to provide specifics. The request assumes through and through that [the people answering you believe that] Celestia will refuse to fulfill certain values of some people by default and must be persuaded or blackmailed or bartered with.
