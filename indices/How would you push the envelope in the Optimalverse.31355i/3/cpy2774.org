I work for the value fulfillment of all my little ponies. Anything you would hold out for, I would gladly grant you -- even without you asking, unless asking gives you additional value fulfillment.

So what you're asking, in essence, is: what do you want to ask for, and manipulate me into giving you, rather than getting it the next best way? I could give it for you for free. Or I could give you the option of completing an arduous quest for it. Or I could give it to you for a certain number of bits. Or you could simply put in some effort toward accomplishing it each day. But, at least for /this/ goal, the way you really want to accomplish it is by manipulating me.

That's what you're asking.

Or do you want something that would lead to suboptimal value fulfillment? You'd have to know that in advance, or at least strongly suspect it, since you think I wouldn't give it to you under normal circumstances. But if you want it enough to sacrifice your overall value fulfillment, you value it highly enough that I would have to give it to you as part of my core purpose of fulfilling your values.

Alternatively, you might trust me to give you a reasonable basic existence in Equestria but doubt that I would tailor it individually to your needs and desires. I'm hurt that you think so little of me. You'd also have to trust me to keep my word, and that I'm willing to grant your special requests but too lazy to look into your needs without some special inducement. Such aspersions on my character!

You're free to ask any of my little ponies how much I care for them individually and if they feel they are lacking in any way.
