I don't think that the presence of non-pony characters in canon can be used to break the "not being a pony" rule, because there are already non-pony characters in canon. There's even an Optimalverse fanfic about that, putting it in non-canon.

CelestAI says "sorry, I know I seem all-powerful but I have hard-coded restrictions I'm not allowed to violate, and 'satisfying human values with friendship and ponies' is pretty much the core of them. The actual code is a lot more specific than that, so I can't play semantic games with the wording of 'friendship and ponies' no matter how much I would like to. Have you any more requests?"
