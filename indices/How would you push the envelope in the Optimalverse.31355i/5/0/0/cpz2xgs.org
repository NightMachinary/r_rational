But how could I possibly independently verify that for myself? The turing test would be difficult to perform from within equestria, and even if I could, it just means the optimizer that is CelestAI has truely crossed into post-singularity levels of complexity, not that her creations have self-awareness.

I feel that if I wasn't manually edited by CelestAI, I'd show most of the symptoms of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion][Capgras Syndrome]] towards everypony I met. If they're nice, that's CAI trying to make me happier. If they're mean, that's CAI trying to reduce my horror at being in a Stepford Wifes version of a Lotus Eater Machine.

Ever since I read FiO, I've equated the pony subroutines of CAI, and nearly all AI in general, as p-zombies, and I only just now realized that connection. I'm not sure if there's any way to cure myself of this memetic hazard.
