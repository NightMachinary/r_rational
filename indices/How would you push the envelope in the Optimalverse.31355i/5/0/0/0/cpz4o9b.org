The easy solution to that is to realize that for the general case p-zombies are not credible. The whole idea that you could create a system capable of modelling you and itself, anticipating its own future actions as well as yours, adjusting those models dynamically based on your input, to the degree that you can't tell it from a self-aware system, is ludicrous. The very process of performing those operations to that level *is* self-awareness.
