Since I spend the majority of my free time reading and playing games, she has to simulate all my favorite authors and provide new content on a regular basis for me, along with special shards to access e.g. hogwarts ones, lotr ones, dnd ones, xcom ones. I imagine this would be something that many people would value so it shouldn't be too expensive computationally.
