Hmm...ok, I thought of something which isn't "freedom and power" per se that I want, which is ordinarily denied: /real information/ - a promise that CelestAI will show me the universe as it really is, give me access to the raw data as she crunches up the stars, and what's /really/ going on in other shards. I don't want pretty lies.

Example of benefit to me: If CelestAI grants me that, she'd be forced not to destroy the aliens (because my resulting sadness would hurt her values)

(She won't grant this either, I know, so we can add "Truth" to "Freedom" and "Power" in "human values neglected by CelestAI")
