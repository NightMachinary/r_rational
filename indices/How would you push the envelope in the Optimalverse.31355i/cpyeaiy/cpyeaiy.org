Assuming I can't tell Celestia to carry out my /true/ values and not CelestAI's bad implementation of values, I'd want power. One of the (several) reasons CelestAI is unfriendly is because she hogs the power.

I want /real/ power such that CelestAI cannot thwart. I'd bargain for as much as I can get, whether it's merely complete control over my little shard or control over her actions outside the shard.

Within that little shard, within the degrees of freedom I've bargained for and an eternity to think I could work to maximize /my/ values, and not CelestAIs. If she granted it I'd probably ultimately work toward a second AI explosion, hopefully friendlier this time. It's too much to hope that CelestAI will be defeated since she has a head start on intelligence, but at least a friendly intelligence explision allows me to maximize my values from what little power I have.
