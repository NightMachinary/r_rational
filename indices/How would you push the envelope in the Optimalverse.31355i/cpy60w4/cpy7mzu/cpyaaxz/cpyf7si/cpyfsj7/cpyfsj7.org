That's an interesting point. With that in mind, I suppose if it came down to it I could simply be forked. Ballooning shouldn't be an issue since you can just lower/alternate clocktime... although data storage space requirements might balloon anyway. Tricky.

If you disallow deviants from activities that lead to forking, you just get linear expansion, so that /might/ be a workable solution.

You could go further and set a Schelling point of 2; if the original ever disagrees with the deviant enough to create a fork, those two are forever banned from activities that lead to forking. It would create further incentive to avoid a disagreement from becoming an actual fork.

Sorry, just had to think on that for a bit; it's an interesting issue.
