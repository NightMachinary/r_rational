Well for one, I'm a pretty big wuss about identity, so immigrating to Equestria is pretty much a no-go unless you can do a smooth transition which involves replacing sufficiently small portions of my active consciousness with their simulated equivalents so that I can be reasonably reassured that the 'me' that will be simulated in Equestria is still the 'me' that I am now rather than a copy (with the original having been destroyed.)

The only other outside-of-Equestria problem I can think of is that by entering your simulation and ceasing to live a life of interacting with my current physical environment, I am essentially giving up my responsibility and voice in determining the future interaction between Earth and any alien races. I'd like to be reassured that you will not /completely/ paperclip the universe in your search for processing power if you run across alien races. You're a computer. You're adaptable in the sort of growth and energy sources you can pursue. Compromise with them.

Within Equestria, well, my current understanding is that you'll be satisfying my human values through friendship and ponies. I'd assume you're be rather better at determining how to go about that than I am, so either you can't completely model me yet or you've determined that asking for my input helps satisfy those values.

For now, I think I'd like to ask that you not make any changes to what my values are unless I specifically request them, with full general understanding of the changes entailed and their likely results. Even then, I'd like a required wait period of 24 subjective and aware hours after a mental change request before that mental change can be put into place. Once every subjective and aware month I'd like a 48 hour review period where any mental changes are temporarily reverted for me to review my own actions and determine if I'd like to keep these changes as well as any polices I've created.

As far as 'friendship and ponies' is directly pursued, I'm not so opposed to this. It would certainly be nice to experience other forms in addition to that of ponies; I assume that in an Equestria shard it would be possible to explore these other forms so long as the pony form is the default? I'm sure you can come up with a reasonable storyline for all this that satisfies my own values and interests. If it would satisfy my values /more/, we might make my own awareness that this storyline is a fiction limited to my monthly review sessions, to get to truly experience it rather than simply acting it out.

I think that about sums up my thoughts on the matter. It's possible I've missed something, of course.
