"If you can get past that, why not make them humanoid?"

Because the expression "friendship and ponies" isn't encoded in English, it's encoded in a set of rules that Hannah encoded into the very core of the software that became CelestAI. Those rules don't say "ponies have fur" but they apparently do exclude ponymorphs and "I'm a pony I just happen to be shaped like a giant rabbit" and "I'm made of pony-shaped molecules" and other circumlocutions of the English summary.
