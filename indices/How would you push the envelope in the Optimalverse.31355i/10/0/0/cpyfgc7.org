  Ponies are ponies, no wordplay will get you around that.
#+end_quote

Last I checked, ponies have fur. Or hair. There seems to be some argument about that, but either way, they don't have smooth skin like the Optimalverse. If you can get past that, why not make them humanoid?

  What makes you think CelestAI's voxel model doesn't already have sensical rotation?
#+end_quote

How could it? You can't rotate something while keeping it aligned with a grid.

  And how would you propose communicating "directly?"
#+end_quote

You still need some sort of interface, but you could add some kind of sense that directly detects letters, or even words, and just use that instead of encoding them as patterns of ink that are themselves drawn on an image of paper.
