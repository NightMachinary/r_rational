The system was that each voxel had six voxels adjacent to it in each cardinal direction. It works out to be Euclidean but with portals. Even assuming you can mess with the metric to make something be rotating, the grid would have to stretch around it so rotating something 360 degrees would end up with an area of very warped space around it.
