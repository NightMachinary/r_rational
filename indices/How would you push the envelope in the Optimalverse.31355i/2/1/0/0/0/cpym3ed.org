I can't think of many other concessions (at least /within/ the shard) that I'd want which CelestAI wouldn't providefor free. CelestAI satisfies an awful lot of human values, and among those that she does not will to power is most notable.

Setting aside from the whole destruction of the universe and sentient life thing, and looking purely at my satisfaction and happiness within the shard, the utter submission and loss of power is the thing that would hurt me most. (Most other forms of hurt are gone).

But yes - obviously I'm pretty much screwed. Reason #143 fooming UFAI scenarios are bad. But the prompt /assumes/ that I have some bargaining power here.
