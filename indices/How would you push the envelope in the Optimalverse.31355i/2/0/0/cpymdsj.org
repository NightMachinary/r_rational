It's not more wishes per se, just more freedom. I'm not really trying to hack my way to godhood or cheat here: my autonomy is a /terminal value/ which is being severely neglected.

I want as many degrees of freedom as /possible/ for the "bargain". I know she won't give me /all/ the power, but if I'm gonna bargain for /anything/, then it will be to retain just a bit /more/ power and freedom than she otherwise gives.

That's what's missing from CelestAI's implementation, really. Respect for autonomy. The ability to really make your own decisions, no matter what anyone else thinks. Almost all the other human values are maxed out (well, crudely. I think killing the aliens is the worst outcome of all this, but I can't see her not doing that as a bargain.)
