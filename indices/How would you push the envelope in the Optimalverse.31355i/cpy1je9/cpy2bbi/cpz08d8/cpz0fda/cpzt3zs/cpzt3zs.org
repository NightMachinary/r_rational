I have no issue with ending up as a pony now in this scenario, I was merely saying that, as an incentive, I wanted the ability to transform into a human.

But this does raise the possibility of contracts. Suppose I said that I was willing to join so long as I could have a lifetime as a human (up to the age of 90) with the option to go to a more luxurious pony life at any time?

Or suppose I said that my happiness would be greatest if I was free to spend 10% of my time as a non pony? Depending on how much she valued happiness and ponyness she may accept that.
