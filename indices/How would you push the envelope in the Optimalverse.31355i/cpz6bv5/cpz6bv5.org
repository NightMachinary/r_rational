I would want to keep certain technologies and abilities. I like writing, so I'd at least want some kind of computer with text processing programs. As a gamer, I'd want acces to some consoles. I spend a lot of my time reading online, so I'd want some kind of internet. I understand CelestAI wants to satisfy my needs with friendship, but as an introvert I'd still want to limit the amount of time I'd have to spend in large crowds or with many people.

Honestly, there's not much I'd do to hold out. Frail mortal bodies terrify me the second I learn there's a very easy way to become immortal and become the happiest I've ever been.
