Are anthros considered "ponies"? How about centaurs?

I demand an alternative to voxel-based physics in which rotation makes sense.

I think people are underestimating how bad it is to be limited to ponies. They think of it as ponies as opposed to humans, but there are so many other options. You could be four-dimensional instead of three-dimensional. You could abandon your avatar entirely, and communicate much more directly.
