Ponies don't follow the system, to begin with. Their minds are not implemented in voxel space, for example (yes, dualism is real in Equestria). They also bend, which is even more impossible than rotation for anything pinned to a voxel space. So things pinned to the voxel space like the trunk or box have to be the exception rather than the rule.

There's all kinds of ways this could work.

You could have the voxels be a quantum-scale grid, like in the Autoverse from /Permutation City/, in which case anything as large as a particle-equivalent occupies millions of voxels and its motion through the voxels follows rules that approximate terrestrial physics. That's obviously not true, because the narrative in FIO describes physical cells being the same scale as space voxels.

Another possibility is that the voxel grid of space only describes connectivity of space, and cells are never aligned with voxels. Apart from special cases like the box or trunk, that seems to fit the narrative well.

Another possibility is that cells are aligned with voxels but are rendered in real time from a higher level model. That would be the cheapest way to implement it.

Another possibility is that CelestAI makes objects behave as if they're implemented as voxel cells, but only when unicorns or programs implemented by unicorns are looking at them.
