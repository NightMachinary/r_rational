What happens if he is unavoidably separated from Master for some time - long enough that it is plausible but not certain that Master may have died in the interval? (This might happen if e.g. he is out shopping, and by the time he gets back Master has vanished and he does not know whether Master left of his own free will or was taken by competent kidnappers... and either way he can't find Master for at least six months).

Also, what happens after he is reunited with Master; how hard is it to persuade him to leave Master's side to go shopping again in the future (or even just to give Master a bit of privacy when Master wants to go on a date)?
