  what happens if Master is explicitly suicidal
#+end_quote

Gargoyle would provide a euthanasia service, but would likely do his best to get an heir from the Master first, so he'd feel like he was confident do be able to continue doing master's wishes by following NuMaster. If Master refused, he'd serve master by providing the euthanasia service and then either present himself to his immediate prior master (if appropriate), a friend of the suicidal master, or the next person he happens to come across.

  Brutus hypothetical
#+end_quote

Gargoyle would call in a favour and get someone else to do the shopping (whether it be a supernatural friend of his, ordering the items online, or getting a TaskRabbit) and monitor Brutus. If the shopping could not be done otherwise, the shopping wouldn't get done. He might try and take Brutus on the shopping trip with him though that depends on the definition of "imprison". I think Gargoyle would consider forcibly carrying Brutus under his arm on the shopping trip to be excluded from the definition but if it was included he wouldn't go on the shopping trip or would remove all feasible weapons from the vicinity.

Most likely he'd openly disobey the order and say that he doesn't trust Brutus so he's not leaving and the Master would get very grumpy at him for that. If Gargoyle was presented with suitable evidence of Brutus' loyalty, he'd happily go shopping.
