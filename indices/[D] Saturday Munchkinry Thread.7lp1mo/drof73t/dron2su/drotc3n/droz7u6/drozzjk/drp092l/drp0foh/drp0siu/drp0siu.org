Okay, so Gargoyle's GO levels depend on what Gargoyle knows he did, not what Master thinks he did. (Which probably means that he doesn't actually need to /tell/ a generous Master about giving a coin to the beggar to get the huge GO hit from doing as Master wants. Especially if Master disapproves of bragging). There might still be a way to game this, but it requires deliberate self-deception on the part of Gargoyle, so that seems unlikely to work.

Next scenario, then. Let us assume that Master is addicted to Drug. Master will do anything to get more Drug, even though it's completely messing up Master in the long term. Gargoyle knows that getting Master off Drug will be long, hard work, and Master will fight every step of the way; but, at the same time, Drug is ruining Master's life. How does Gargoyle handle this situation?
