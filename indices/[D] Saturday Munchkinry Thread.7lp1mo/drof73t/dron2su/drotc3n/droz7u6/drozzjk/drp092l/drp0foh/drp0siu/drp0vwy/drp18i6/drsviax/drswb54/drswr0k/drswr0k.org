  Should Gargoyle deliberately get Master addicted to heroin, and does the answer to this change if the previous Master was an addict?

Oh that's getting dark. I'd say no, because Master, when asked, would say he didn't want to be a heroin addict. But if prior Master was, and lived a blissful life, then Gargoyle would think "for your own good!".... It's a good thing Gargoyle has spend the past 400 years in service of vampires who don't get addicted to drugs or this might actually be a real possibility.
