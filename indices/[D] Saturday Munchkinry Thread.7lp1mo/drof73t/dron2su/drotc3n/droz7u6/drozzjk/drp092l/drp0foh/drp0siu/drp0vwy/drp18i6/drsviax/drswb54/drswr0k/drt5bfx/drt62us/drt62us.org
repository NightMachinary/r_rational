My Vampires won't allow this to happen as they need to have a human to latch onto so they can excrete their waste products; being fed blood through a syringe would result in them dying eventually.

In general though that's the exact sort of thing the gargoyle would do if he was assured he could get away with it - the problem is if Master discovers he was lying, there's a huge negative hit to GO.

Which might mean that after the deception ahs gone long enough the Gargoyle has to kill Master as the hit in GO from killing him is smaller than the hit from him discovering the truth..... hmmm
