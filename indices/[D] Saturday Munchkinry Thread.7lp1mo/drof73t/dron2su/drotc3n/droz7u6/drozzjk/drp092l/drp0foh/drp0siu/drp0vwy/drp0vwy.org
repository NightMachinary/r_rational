Under the "best friend heuristic", Gargoyle would get Master off the drug as compassionately as possible; unless Master is very old and likely to die soon, or the "ruining his life" is something that Gargoyle can fix himself. (Is it stopping Master going to work? Gargoyle will impersonate him and work remotely.)

I think the spectrum of drug use is such that a habitual user who doesn't have to worry about things like money or housing could probably have a life the Gargoyle would be happy with?
