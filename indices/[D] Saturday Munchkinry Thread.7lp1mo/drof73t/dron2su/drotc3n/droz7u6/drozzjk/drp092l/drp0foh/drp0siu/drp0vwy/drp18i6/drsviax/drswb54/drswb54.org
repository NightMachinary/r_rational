  Interesting thought: let's dial Device down a bit and say it is instead a drug that treats Master's otherwise untreatable, say, epilepsy (or depression). Would Gargoyle spend his time trying to invent that drug? Thinking about him as a character, he's not a "scientific" sort, but if it was in the best interests of his master he'd have to learn to be so, or at least hire a team of scientists to do it on his behalf.

To expand on this, then; assume Master is an average, well-adjusted human who suffers from neither clinical depression nor drug addiction. Should Gargoyle deliberately get Master addicted to heroin, and does the answer to this change if the previous Master was an addict?
