Hmmmm. I guess Gargoyle could fix most of the "ruining his life" by working triple-time earning (or stealing) enough money to keep Master well supplied with drugs without Master selling off his house and all his possessions. (I don't actually know all that much about ho drug addiction works - I'm just trying to think up situations where Master's stated desires and what is best for Master are as contradictory as possible).

Next question, then. Brutus has betrayed Master, using a Magic Device that more or less mind controls Master, making Master deliriously happy whenever Master does what Brutus tells Master to do. Gargoyle knows that Master will be eventually thankful if Gargoyle destroys the Magic Device, but Master will never be anywhere near as happy out of its control as he is while under its control. Should Gargoyle destroy the Device?

Follow-up question - instead of Brutus using the Device, Gargoyle simply finds the Device and finds out what it does. Will Gargoyle use the Device on Master to make Master happier?
