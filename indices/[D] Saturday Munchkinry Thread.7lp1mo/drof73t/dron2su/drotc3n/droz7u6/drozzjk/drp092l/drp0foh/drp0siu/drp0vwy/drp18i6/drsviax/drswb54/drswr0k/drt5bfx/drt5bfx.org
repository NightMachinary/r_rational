Unintended consequence scenarios are often dark.

Alright, for a vampire example, then; let us say that a given vampire Master has been persuaded that it is Wrong to drink human blood. At the same time, not drinking human blood has negative effects on his health.

Of course Gargoyle would be happy to search for a substitute, but let us say he could not find one. How likely would it be that Gargoyle would /claim/ to have found a substitute - and simply ambush people in dark alleys, extract their blood with the help of a syringe, and add a bit of food colouring and flavourant?
