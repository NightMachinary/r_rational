  drug addiction example

Yeah, I don't know much about severe, say, heroin addiction either and unless I want to write a story in which Gargoyle has a master with a severe heroin addiction, there's really no need for me to go research that. I get the feeling a lot of the problems are related to money, assuming "cutting all contact with family" is not considered a problem - which it might be to a gargoyle, but I guess it depends on how nice it feels to be on heroin? Like, stereotypical heroin addicts tend to prefer being on heroin to being with their family, and I'm not sure if that says more about how good heroin is or how bad a typical heroin addict's family is. But regardless if the Master would prefer heroin to having their wife and kids around, the repugnant conclusion is that Gargoyle should not interfere with this "downwards spiral".

  Gargoyle knows that Master will be eventually thankful if Gargoyle destroys the Magic Device, but Master will never be anywhere near as happy out of its control as he is while under its control. Should Gargoyle destroy the Device?

I'd say yes; "pure" happiness isn't everything. Otherwise Gargoyle should invent the proverbial machine that stimulates your pleasure neuron and you just sit there blissed out like you're on a sybian machine or something.

  Gargoyle simply finds the Device and finds out what it does.

Oh! I already answered that question just now! Great minds think alike.

Interesting thought: let's dial Device down a bit and say it is instead a drug that treats Master's otherwise untreatable, say, epilepsy (or depression). Would Gargoyle spend his time trying to invent that drug? Thinking about him as a character, he's not a "scientific" sort, but if it was in the best interests of his master he'd have to learn to be so, or at least hire a team of scientists to do it on his behalf.

Looping back around: if Master has untreatable depression such that euthenasia might be the most compassionate option, would Gargoyle prefer to devote years to developing a cure for that depression or just do the euthenasia and then find a less depressed master? I suppose you'd weigh it against the number of years Master would live without depression and then do a QALY type thing on it to determine if spending X years with extremely bad depression is worth it to acheive Y "happy" years.
