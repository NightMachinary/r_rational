  unavoidably separated from Master for some time
#+end_quote

He's going to spend the time looking for his master and maintaining his affairs; this will probably happen until someone gives him an order and the "endorphins" from that would cause him to imprint on someone new, maybe?

Like, I imagine, biologically, he'd get "gargoyleoxycontin" (call it GO) from obeying orders and improving his masters' happiness; but eventually he's not able to keep doing that if he's not getting the positive feedback of improving his master's utility function (you know... a smile or a thankyou in return, or just seeing that now he's got the master a more comfortable chair he no longer shifts awkwardly after sitting several hours). If the master isn't around and he's feeling like a failure he's going to be motivated to find a new source of GO, and whoever is responsible for that will reap the benefits.

So that's what I'd probably say would happen: similar to the tree example in my OP, he'd keep trying to satisfy his absent master (and locate them), until one day he gains so little satisfaction from "satisfying his absent master" that the hit of GO he gets from the New Person is high enough to outweigh the huge negative hit to his GO from abandoning his "current master".

Of course, this has consequences - he'll basically be forced to work for a utility monster - so it's probably not a full, workable solution. I do kind of like the idea of him spending a century looking for a missing master and eventually deciding that the master must be dead; might write a drabble of that, in fact.

Also, it's a wonder that a wife or child of his hasn't managed to manipulate the world so that way wife/child ends up as Master which would solve a hell of a lot of problems for Gargoyle (and is perhaps the way the original imprinting was meant to work from a biological point of view?).

  how hard is it to persuade him to leave Master's side to go shopping again in the future
#+end_quote

Probably not very, if that's what Master wanted and Master was in a secure location. Master wants Gargoyle to go shopping, so off Gargoyle goes! (Maybe Master sneaking off is what Master wants!)
