  How do they know what's in their master's utility function?
#+end_quote

Communication and common sense; Gargoyles probably miss stuff sometimes but as they grow and learn they get better at understanding, so one who is very old like Mine is going to be pretty good at knowing what a general human function is and able to work it out at the edges.

  What if their master is suicidal?
#+end_quote

Depends. Would probably seek treatment (the magical sort) and if [[http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/sex-abuse-victim-in-her-20s-allowed-by-doctors-to-choose-euthanasia-due-to-incurable-ptsd/news-story/33d67a4ee6e5980d0c8f6c38147f1576][that's not possible would assist Master in undergoing it humanely]]]

  apparently the gargoyle can refuse due to the off chance the master can go to jail
#+end_quote

Probably not on a 0.1% chance like you're proposing, but the Gargoyle is a victim of logical fallacies like anyone else so he's likely to be generous with those. If he's ordered to kill his own son and his Master is, say, the supreme ruler of the world, and regularly gives such orders with no personal consequences, then Son is going to be deadsies.

  Based on this ability, the gargoyle should be able to reason himself out of any clearly unreasonable paperclippification.

Unfortunately that's what I'm afraid of. I'm kind of hoping for something like in Asimov's /Runaround/, where perhaps the Gargoyle gets absorbed in a task: maybe a better example is /The Sorcerer's Apprentice/ in /Fantasia/? He could quickly be snapped out of it but not after he's bought potatoes from every shop within 100km and peeled all of them, filling the house with potatoes. After all, the vampire master did say "I will be needing a great deal of potatoes, more than you have ever prepared before, so you best ensure you purchase them in sufficient quantities": little the vampire master knew that the Gargoyle had once worked as a kitchenhand for a 12 day feast.

  What about a future master that will live until the heat death of the universe? Surely, since this master will live so much longer than all his other masters, the gargoyle should prioritize the master that will appreciate his efforts for the longest...

Speaking of Asimov, /. . . That Thou Art Mindful of Him/ might be a good source of inspiration - he could quite easily conclude that because he himself will outlive all his masters, he should be his own master. I think that would lead to him being very sad though, but it might be an interesting conflict to add to one of his storylines.
