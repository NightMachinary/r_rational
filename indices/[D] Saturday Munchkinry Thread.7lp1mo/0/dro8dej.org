How would humanity fare in what I refer as an infocalypse?

Overnight, every piece of textual information becomes irreversably encrypted. All digital data is gone, every piece of book or writing down to the street signs is now just gibberish. Any technology that relies on firmware stops working. Pictograms are fine but any written information in pictures is likewise gone. This includes hieroglyphics (they are now different hieroglyphs with no meaning).

What are the ramifications? How much of the classical and modern literature can be pieced back together? If this were a daily recurrent event how would we cope with not being able to record anything?
