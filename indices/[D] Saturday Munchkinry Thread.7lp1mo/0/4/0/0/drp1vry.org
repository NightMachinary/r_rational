You'd need to have someone able to write a Turing-complete pictogram-based compiler from memory. Surprisingly, such a person is probably not going to be hard to find - Turing completeness requires only about half-a-dozen operations. (I don't know off the top of my head what they are, but I'm sure there are several thousand people who do). Of course, a language which is Turing complete and /nothing else/ is a pain and a half to work with (in much the same way as you /can/ move a tonne of sand using only a single pair of tweezers, but...) but once you have that much then people can use that compiler to create more complex compilers...

  Youtube videos also would be unreachable unless someone already converted to film stocks.

Why? It's not writing, in any shape or form...
