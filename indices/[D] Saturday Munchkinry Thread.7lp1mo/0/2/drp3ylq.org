So, "textual information" is gibberish, but pictograms are fine? In that case, I guess I'm confused as to where the line is drawn.

Pictograms are a form of writing, in that they're a set of symbols that convey a specific meaning (or set of meanings).

So does that mean symbolic street signs (those without text) are perfectly comprehensible? What about emojis? What about, say, Chinese characters, which are generally considered logograms, but some (like the numeric 一二三) are ideograms (like street signs)?

And post-infocalypse, are humans completely unable to understand anything written going forward, and/or is text auto-encrypted going forward? For instance, if we write the word 'Apple', does it just automatically encrypt, or do we just not understand it? If we map the letters to new symbols, or pictures, or emojis, and write the word, will it still encrypt?
