Yes I suppose edge cases are a bit hard to define.

Pictograms have meaning but they dont corresond to an alphabet or a writing system. For example a street sign of a cake or a pretzel with an arrow to show the way to a bakery would remain the same but a text written in Windings would be encrypted. So would Chinese or Japanese.

We can infer what is written no problem. But instead of saying Apple it says $we:% in the same font or whatever medium it was in. No mapping is possible, think of it as a gigantic one time pad.

In the case it is a recurrent event I was thinking a daily wipe but instant encryption is a possible variant. We can somewhat manage daily wipes I think but it is a much bigger problem if it constantly destroys data.
