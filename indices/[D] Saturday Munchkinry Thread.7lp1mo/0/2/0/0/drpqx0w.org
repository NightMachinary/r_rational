Interesting. So an emoji of a tree would be understandable, but the single Chinese character that corresponds to tree (æœ¨) would be encrypted? Meaning it's not about the characters/writing itself, but just because humans have formally defined the second as a writing system? So post-infocalypse, if we turned emojis into a more formal/universally understood system, they would instantly start to encrypt, because people have collectively started thinking about it as a writing system?
