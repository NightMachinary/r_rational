You developed a future-only time travel machine. It's similar to relativistic time dilation, it builds a spherical, self sustaining, "field" that slows downs the rate of time to a very small fraction, roughly a second per year.

Creating and dissipating the field requires a decent amount of energy, roughly 10 million joules. The process can take from 1 to 10 seconds to complete, can't be done faster or slower.

It's possible to place things inside the field later, but the time dilation is very harmful for whatever is only partially inside (e.g. things short-circuit because the time dilation acts as increase resistance, limbs are lost from blood flow problems). The field has some surface tension, 1N is required to push through, which avoids many accidents.

Besides using it to preserve people (i.e. cryonics without the cryo) or valuable things (e.g. art in museums) what other of neat things would be possible?
