That's only about 3 kWh. At the average price in the US, it would cost 33 cents per use. It's cheap enough that I imagine rich people would use it as a refrigerator. Imagine being able to keep your food fresh and piping hot so you can just take it out and eat it.

It would be good for sending astronauts to other planets. Which I admit is an example of cryonics without the cryo, but it's nice to show specific uses of that.
