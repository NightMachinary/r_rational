The amount of energy required to push things into the field seems low. You would logically have to supply enough energy to accelerate them to the speed they would seem to be moving inside. Logically, a time retarder field would act like a very rigid body, the permeability and rigidity of the virtual object would be in proportion to the level of acceleration.

I suggest reading Niven's short story "ARM" where his future cop Gil Hamilton encounters what's basically the opposite of your machine. A lot of the effects of objects inside the field on the outside world would be reversed for yours.
