The field has some sensitive timing needs, anything between one and ten seconds work (as explained in the initial comment), so you need a power source that gives you one million watts over ten seconds, ten million watts in a second, or anything between. Having those near your kitchen is not safe, if there's an accident it's going to be very fatal.
