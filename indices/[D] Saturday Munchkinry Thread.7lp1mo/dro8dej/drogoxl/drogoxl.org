Hm. The biggest problem I see here is the encryption of all pre-existing code. Assuming that it can't execute any more, we would have to rebuild the entire digital revolution from scratch. That means the vast majority of infrastructure, down to cars, trains, and combine harvesters, abruptly stops working. If this had happened in the 1960s, it would be a cultural catastrophe. Right now? It would be a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.

Also, graphic designers would be very smug.

The ones that survive.
