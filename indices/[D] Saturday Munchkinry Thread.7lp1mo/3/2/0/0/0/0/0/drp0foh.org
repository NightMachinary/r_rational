My heuristic for this is "Gargoyle acts to you like the best possible friend would".

Specific beggar example, it depends on the Master.

Is Master a generous, philanthropic sort? Gargoyle would give beggar money, and tell Master about it later. He gets a tiny GO hit for giving beggar money, large GO hit for Master being proud of him.

Is Master a miserly sort of guy? Gargoyle would keep coin, miss out on GO from helping better, but get a huge GO dose for giving Master the coin.

Master exactly in between? Gargoyle would keep coin for himself, so he can buy things for himself / his master / his family.

  Taking this to the monstrous extreme, would Gargoyle collapse the local economy to create more beggars so that he gets more GO by giving them coins?
#+end_quote

No, he'd "lose" a ton of GO (gain lots of anti-GO?) from creating the beggars in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  will Gargoyle arrange things in such a way as to (untraceably) cause problems for Master, where such problems can be easily, quickly and above all else visibly dealt with by Gargoyle, so that Master will be grateful to Gargoyle?
#+end_quote

No, the GO loss from causing a bad thing would be an order of magnitude more than the GO gain from solving the problem. Like, let's give the following GO "scores" as examples:

-1000: Causing someone to become a beggar

+1: giving a beggar a coin

+40: making generous master proud

+50: giving greedy master coin

+100: bringing a beggar out of poverty

+110: preventing someone becoming a beggar

NB: there's probably a way to "money-pump" these (e.g. takes more than 100 coins to bring a beggar out of poverty), they're just for illustration
