Hmmm. So, if Master wants to die, then that's explicitly permitted.

Alright. Next hypothetical. Gargoyle is off on Master's business when he happens to find a coin lying on the ground, and he stops to pick it up. Five minutes later, he sees a beggar at the side of the road, looking for coins. Gargoyle knows that if he gives the beggar the coin (which is not Master's coin, so doing so does not in any way impoverish Master) then the beggar will thank him. Now, clearly the beggar is not Master, and Master has given no explicit or implicit orders one way or another about beggars. If Gargoyle gives the coin to the beggar, and the beggar thanks Gargoyle, then does that give Gargoyle some GO?

Taking this to the monstrous extreme, would Gargoyle collapse the local economy to create more beggars so that he gets more GO by giving them coins?

Similarly, will Gargoyle arrange things in such a way as to (untraceably) cause problems for Master, where such problems can be easily, quickly and above all else /visibly/ dealt with by Gargoyle, so that Master will be grateful to Gargoyle?
