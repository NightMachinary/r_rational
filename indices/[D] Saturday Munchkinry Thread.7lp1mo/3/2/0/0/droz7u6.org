Okay. Next question, then; what happens if Master is explicitly suicidal? On the one hand, Master wants to die and doesn't want to be prevented from dying; on the other hand, if Master dies then Master can never say 'thank you' again.

  Probably not very, if that's what Master wanted and Master was in a secure location. Master wants Gargoyle to go shopping, so off Gargoyle goes! (Maybe Master sneaking off is what Master wants!)

Okay, let's adjust the situation a little. Master has a 'friend', called Brutus. Gargoyle overhears Brutus plotting to betray Master. Gargoyle dutifully reports this to Master, and is told by Master (who believes Brutus is a better and more loyal friend than Gargoyle, mainly because Gargoyle is new) that he must have misunderstood and he is absolutely under no circumstances to harm or imprison Brutus.

Brutus is in the next room, sharpening his knife. (He collects knives). Master tells Gargoyle to go shopping. How does Gargoyle handle this?
