How do they know what's in their master's utility function? Apparently they can refuse certain orders like cutting off their master's leg. What if their master is suicidal?

Your example of creative interpretation creates some questions. If the master's utility function says "I will gain 1,000 utility points by killing the gargoyles's son with a 0.1% chance this will lead me to prison, which I rate at -10,000 utility points", apparently the gargoyle can refuse due to the off chance the master can go to jail. So, the gargoyle must have some heuristic independent of their master's for their decision making. Based on this ability, the gargoyle should be able to reason himself out of any clearly unreasonable paperclippification.

Future masters, eh? What about a future master that will live until the heat death of the universe? Surely, since this master will live so much longer than all his other masters, the gargoyle should prioritize the master that will appreciate his efforts for the longest...

Introducing the gargoyle to Roko's Basilisk sounds like the perfect way to induce the desired effect. Sometime in the 1900s, the gargoyle pieces together to idea of the basilisk and realizes what he must do. He secretly nudges the path of invention, facilitating the unprecedented rise in computing power and technology while seeding the ideas of AI so that his master will someday rule. Perhaps he tries to make humanity complacent of the threat of a rogue AGI. Perhaps he acts just has he would normally, as a benign servant whose only goal is to serve his masters' wishes. If only there was some version of him will the computing power to truly serve its master so dutifully as he does...
