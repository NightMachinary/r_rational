I have a gargoyle character in my urban fantasy universe. He follows orders and I want to make him into a paperclipper. (EDIT: after some thought, papperclipiper is probably the wrong word: I want him to follow orders and it to have unforseen consequences in a kind of AI safety lesson sort of way, but not for his utility function to literally be something ridiculous)

He's been around for some 50,000 years but underwent a mind-wipe about 3000 BCE as part of his story arc that will almost certainly never make it to the page. So the event I'm asking about can be set any time within the last 5,000 years.

Gargoyles are a species of willing servants: their utility function is to maximise their "master's" utility function. They can fly and transform and do some small magic spells (making things disappear into a pocket dimension). They are also fully sentient: this particular gargoyle has had several wives over the years, children, etc. But they value their master's utility above their own children's.

So, they'll follow orders for the most part: but if you order them to cut off your leg, they're not going to do that unless your leg is stuck in a bear trap and you're a vampire and the sun's about to rise.

They have experience from living in human society that e.g. humans die when they don't have access to oxygen, that people don't actually want him to press their sexual pleasure buttons 24/7 even if they ask to be happy all the time, etc. However, I imagine early on in his career he may have had to learn some of the things that are more unique to our cultures (50,000 years ago he came from something that was basically Atlantis, so he'd be familiar with most general parts of human-ish society from having lived and grown up in one), which could be some paperclip opportunities.

Random summary:

- If his master dies without a will, Gargoyle will assign himself to an obvious heir / the head butler in the castle / a passing street urchin

- If he's like going hiking in the wilderness with his master and his master is killed by a stray bolt of lightning the Gargoyle will start slowly going a bit insane, assign himself to be the servant of a local animal or tree and do his best to interpret that creatures' desires until he sees a person and is like "oh my god will you let me be your master PLEASE"

- If e.g. his vampire master wants to kill the gargoyle's son, he can and will interpret things creatively: "if Master kills Son, the police will find a body, come looking, they might take Master and put him in prison and the prison has a yard where he has to go out in the sun! So Master killing Son will kill Master! I'm going to have to stop this for Master's OWN GOOD"

- He can't be stolen

- He's basically invulnerable, but will be very unlikely to follow orders resulting in his own death because he won't be able to follow future orders from his master or future masters he might have

- He can transform and fly

- He will follow an order to the best of his ability and knowledge, and is willing to negotiate after the fact

Restating the challenge:

Given this, what's an order or unstated desire the Gargoyle can misinterpret that will result in undesirable behaviour that will not be easily corrected? But will also not destroy the universe, please...

Preferably this is something that happens in the 1900s-present day, but anything that could explain how he learned a certain human moral norm in ancient Egypt would also be great to write about.
