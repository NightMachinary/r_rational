The way to make him a paperclipper, I think, is for him to go insane and latch onto a concept as his master - something that can't be harmed by his actions. His master could die, and then in the daze, a passing preacher could inspire a religious fervor in him. He latches on to God as his master, and sets about engineering the biblical apocalypse.

That might be a bit on the nose, though.
