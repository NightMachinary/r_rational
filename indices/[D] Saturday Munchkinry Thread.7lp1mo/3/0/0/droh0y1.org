Interesting thought. He'd assign the priest as his master in that case, but the religion angle does make for some interesting opportunities as people act weirdly because of it and he'd want to help the priest out with that.

Like, Gargoyle is a "person", so I think it's going to take a hell of a lot for him to take on the concept of happiness as his master when there's a big oak tree /right there/ that could use some extra water, you know?
