#+begin_quote
  gargoyle going to great lengths to prevent its master from ever dying
#+end_quote

as a gargoyle's master I'd consider this a feature, not a bug! (in euthanasia situations the gargoyle is likely to be supportive/assistive)

#+begin_quote
  possibly constructing a great number of back-up masters with identical utility functions
#+end_quote

Hmm that would be interesting.

I suppose philosophically it becomes, let's use an example - say the Gargoyle is working for someone who really loves the colour blue - what does this make the Gargoyle's "base" utility function?

1) Have a master -> do what master likes

2) Have a master -> do what master likes -> paint everything blue

I'd assume the "base" function would "stop" at the second level, rather than the third level being made part of his "base" function. Like, he'd know that painting everything blue is Good because Master Wants It, but he knows just as well that Master might want everything Red tomorrow or that Master might give him as a gift to his friend who really likes echidnas and his next purpose in life will become echidna husbandry.

I see your point though. I do like the idea of him resisting his ownership being transferred.
