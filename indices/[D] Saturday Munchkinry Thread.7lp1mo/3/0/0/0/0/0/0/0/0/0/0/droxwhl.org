I suppose "maximise master's utility function" is not the right way to state/conceptualise it, then. I want him to follow orders but to resist orders that are obviously bad / have unintended consequences, and to stop doing things if he gets new information that indicates what he was doing is not the right thing. But it's probably not as highly abstracted as actually invoking utility functions, when I formulate it like that?
