What you are talking about is called spontaneous human combustion. It is thought to be a myth.

If it was true, you would expect to see people bursting into flames all the time. However, it seems that every proposed case of spontaneous combustion always happens when the victim is alone. It makes more sense to just call these "deaths by fire" caused by some external combustion source, but instead people assume that spontaneous combustion must have happened based on nothing but a charred corpse.

Also, cremation in extremely hot ovens takes about 3 hours. I would bet my life that the bones being reduced to ashes in 20 minutes is false.
