  According to Britannica, up to 10% of gas in the intestine is oxygen, up to 15% of it is methane and up to 50% of it is hydrogen.

Link? Because I'd expect a mixture of 50% hydrogen and 10% oxygen to ignite pretty much immediately instead of waiting for a shock or a spark or whatever. Hydrogen is pretty volatile.

Also, as the comment said, spontaneous human combustion is an urban legend.
