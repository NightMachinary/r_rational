If it were stored as fat it wouldnt work really, I got your gist. It still means eating years of obsessive binging for food for a single gram of magicmatter. A kg of fat has 3.7e7 joules, if we assume 25% conversion effiency (which is what humans usually get out of food), this gives you... 1e-10grams. So you need to eat ten thousand tons of fat to get one gram magic matter, which is very far out of any reasonable rate even binge eating whales could conceivably consume.

Or you beings have evolved for much higher caloric intake, like whales!
