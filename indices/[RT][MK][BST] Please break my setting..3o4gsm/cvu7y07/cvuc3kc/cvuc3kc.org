Lots of awesome ideas here; the whole "going to space with magic alone" thing was sort of the initial spark behind the whole setting.

  Why are humanity immune/carriers, when most other species have evolved symbiosis?

Part of that is explained, part of it is a huge mystery behind the setting. Basically, humanity became sapient WITHOUT magic for whatever reason, so when it encounters a human, the virus says "hey, it's cool, we don't need to do anything else." It's basically an uplifting mechanism from some unknown progenitor race. However, if a human is exposed long enough (the first to be actually affected were scientists studying magic, or people with regular alien contact), it tries to forcibly create the alien "magic" organs in their biology, and often this just straight-up kills the host; they aren't really compatible with our biology. Sometimes, though, you get lucky, and it doesn't kill you. Doesn't mean there aren't complications down the line.

Any kind of persistent magical effects (propulsion, force fields, warp gates, etc) can be powered through certain crystals + plant matter from the alien planets, sort of like fossil fuels, or you know, burning logs. It's a consistent power source, but not very flexible; you have to re-cast the whole spell to switch sources if it runs out, which can get really complicated. This is sort of how humans end up "cheating" and using alien technology; the resources are pretty scarce for us though, since we don't have them on earth.
