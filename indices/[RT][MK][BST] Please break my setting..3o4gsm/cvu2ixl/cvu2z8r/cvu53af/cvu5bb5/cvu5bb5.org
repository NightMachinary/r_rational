+I guess I'm not explaining it properly; you can only define locations to the spell in terms of a specific point in space. When you're using a "beacon" as a reference point, you're not saying "go to the beacon," you're saying, "go to x y z location relative to that beacon's position in space at the instant of casting." So if the beacon is moving at all, it's just going to take a snapshot of the moving ship, and you'll end up in the middle of space.+

Edit: Even when I'm saying there I realize I'm spouting nonsense. As given, what you say makes sense; I just really don't want time travel to be a thing in this universe. I'll have to figure out another patch.
