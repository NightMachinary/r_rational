  It's exposure to the virus, though the virus is spread through magical species, so it really is the same either way. It takes hundreds of years for the uplift to take place though; by the time the story takes place, those species are starting to get smarter, but are still non-sapient.

Is it hundreds of years minimum, or is it a function of starting distance from sapience? Because the first probably means humanity would bank on cracking the problem and having its own wizards before it becomes an issue, and the second probably means that a war of extinction was waged on chimpanzees and dolphins and embassies were constructed for bonobos and African Grey parrots.
