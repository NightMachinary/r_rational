  I assume 1c overrides 1a, but as it stands it looks contradictory. Edit: or do you mean half of humanity died after First contact, but > most of the survivors didn't get magical powers?

The virus passes over the vast majority of people, doing absolutely nothing. If it does affect you, it will try to give you magic; about 50% of the time, you will die. If you survive, you will get magic, but there's still a good chance that's what kills you in the end. If you then have kids, those kids may still have issues, but the prognosis is much higher, and they'll be closer to "normal" health, in addition to magic.

  Wizard german shepherds when? But seriously, that's probably the killer app: not trying to make human mages, but taking this > tailor-made EZ-Uplift process to create loyal vassal species.

It's exposure to the virus, though the virus is spread through magical species, so it really is the same either way. It takes hundreds of years for the uplift to take place though; by the time the story takes place, those species are starting to get smarter, but are still non-sapient. The issue with humans is that we were already sapient when we got exposed, so it tried to give us magic *immediately.* Again, the reason for this is a mystery.
