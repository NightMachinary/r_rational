  When using magic, any energy used is taken by converting this substance to energy with near 100% efficiency, and applying it to the world at large.

Breaks your setting right there. One gram yields the equivalent of 21.5 kilotons of tnt - the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. So either all the magical species are gods who with a snap of their finger do interstellar travel or -more likely- are an extinction event. You get multi-megaton bomb organs, and you, and you! Everyone! Even the psychopaths and angry teenagers! And babies!

So via selection effects only docile, extremely pacifistic species remain.
