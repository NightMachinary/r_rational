That was only an example and I made an assumption, that magic is not a superpower, that you just get at full power after being bitten by radioactive spider. If it's dependant on organ, it has to be exercised to raise it's output just like brain or muscles. Said value would be capability of average magician, so the one after some training. Infant on the other hand would have much lower output, since it's body is not accustomed to casting magic and as OP said it requires concentration.
