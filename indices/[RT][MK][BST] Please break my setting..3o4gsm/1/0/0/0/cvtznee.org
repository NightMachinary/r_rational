That's a really interesting direction, I didn't even think of that. It's not really stored as fat per se, think more "organ specifically designed to hold kidney stones." Except the kidney stones are marble-sized, but maybe a kilogram or so each. The body naturally uses up excess energy in naturally-magical species, but that would be an interesting take for human mages- if you eat too much, you risk setting random objects on fire.

Also, I should have specified in the OP, tech like interstellar ships are powered by actual fuel- persistent effects can be powered by outside fuel sources, like some native plants and minerals.
