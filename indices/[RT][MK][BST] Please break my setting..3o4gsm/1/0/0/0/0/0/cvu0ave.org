That was sort of my rationale behind making it an "annihilation" type conversion; it gets stored in very small amounts, but pays huge dividends in terms of energy output.

Also, the matter/energy conversion method is not known; the "organ" loses a certain amount of mass, at a proportional rate of energy output, both of which can be measured. However, no one really knows how it gets from "magic kidney stones" to "boom whiz poof."
