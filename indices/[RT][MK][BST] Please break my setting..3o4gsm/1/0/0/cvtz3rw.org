I mean you do have the high caloric intake in there. If one needs to eat all that energy first and convert it into that magical matter-

That'd would allow you to write in a scenario thats surprisingly similar to modern US in some aspects. Everyone is obsessed with eating high caloric food all the time. There are metabollically privileged magic users - who have a high conversion ratio and stay slim- and bad disprivileged ones, who get fat trying to power up reserves.

A great magical work, like starting/manning an interstellar ship, requires the spending of an entire lifetime of carefully hoarded food. Any mildly big miracle is to be pondered most carefully, undoing month of eating.

A lesser known fact about tour the france: racers already need more calories than their bodies can reasonably digest. They all get intravenous feeding...
