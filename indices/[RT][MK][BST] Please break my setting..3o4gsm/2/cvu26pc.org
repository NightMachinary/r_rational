  1a). An individual of a non-magical, sapient species (humans are the only one confirmed), can gain some magical ability through a genetic virus, and therefore pass it on to their offspring. *However, the virus has approximately a 50% chance of killing the host*, and those so infected generally have a shorter lifespan. *The survival rate of said offspring is much higher*.

  1c). The virus is ubiquitous among all magical species, but does nothing to them. Earth is now completely infected, but the vast majority of people are immune, *and of those not immune, most just die*. The rate of people who end up with magical powers (and a lower life expectancy) is about 1 in 100000.

I assume 1c overrides 1a, but as it stands it looks contradictory. Edit: or do you mean half of humanity died after First Contact, but most of the survivors didn't get magical powers?

  1b). An individual of a non-magical, near-sapient species becomes sapient through prolonged, multi-generational exposure (*to what, magic, the virus?*), and becomes a magical species.

Wizard german shepherds when? But seriously, that's probably the killer app: not trying to make human mages, but taking this tailor-made EZ-Uplift process to create loyal vassal species.
