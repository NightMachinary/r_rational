Teleportation is nice. You've made it possible to create something similar to a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone][tachyonic antitelephone]], except messages are passed instantly. That makes it pretty easy to send information into the past.

Time dilation is mutual. If I'm on a ship moving at a relativistic speed relative to you, then you perceive my clock ticking slower than yours, just as I simultaneously perceive your clock ticking slower than mine. If you teleport to my ship, you've just gone backwards in time. You'll go backwards again when you teleport home.

Let's exploit that. Build a ship with a large nuclear reactor to power grow lamps for crops. Include water recycling systems, air recycling systems, and everything else we'll need for mostly self-sufficient living. Have many spellcasters aboard the ship, and use magic to propel the ship as fast as we can make it go.

After a five years have passed, we can collect all scientific papers and research data published in that period of time and load it onto a microchip smaller than a speck of dust. We can then teleport the chip back and forth between the ship and Earth, sending it further back in time until hardly a year has passed. What happens from here is anyone's guess. Are there many worlds? Does the timeline start over each time someone/something goes into the past?

Most likely, we will now be able to complete decades of research on a global scale in the blink of an eye. Projects like cloning the magic organs and linking them to computerized neural interfaces might take centuries normally, but now it could all be done in a few years. We'll call these magic interfaces.

Spell research with the magic interfaces can proceed similarly quickly, allowing humans to rapidly master magic. The most munchkiny use I can think of would be atomic-scale manipulation for on-the-fly genetic engineering and nanotechnology. You're not moving much material, so energy requirements are practically nil, yet gains are massive. Now you can transport nanites to asteroids, moons, and planets, terrforming and industrializing across the galaxy to make worlds suitable for humans and their new-fangled magic interfaces, all in the span of a few decades.
