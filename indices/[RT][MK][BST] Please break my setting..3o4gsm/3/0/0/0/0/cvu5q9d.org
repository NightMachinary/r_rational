In other words, teleportation changes your position, but conserves your velocity relative to your starting position and velocity. I got that, and I'm saying that's fine. We only need to accelerate a speck to match speeds with the ship, energy requirements to do that are significant but quite manageable.

Even if that is not feasible for some reason, the easy alternative solution would be to teleport a small radio beacon a few seconds ahead of the ship's position and have it transmit the data to the ship.
