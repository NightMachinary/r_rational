  If you teleport to my ship

I like the concept, but teleportation spells do require either a reference beacon or an exactly specified location. If the beacon is moving at relative speeds, then it won't be able to find it, and just fizzle. The way the aliens actually do "exploration" travel, incidentally, is by using teleportation spells to send a beacon "arbitrarily far THAT WAY, scry it to make sure it's safe, and then saying to a ship, "okay, teleport to THAT object that we just sent." Most travel is done between consistent base stations.
