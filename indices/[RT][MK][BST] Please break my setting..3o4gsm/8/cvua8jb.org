could you, say, extract this superelement that powers magic via surgery, and use it as a fuel source? Ethics aside, if you can't cast magic yourself, you could always steal the magic element from someone who has it and experiment on it to figure out why it works, how it works, how to make it in a lab, etc. You could also do some genetic engineering to create an algae-like microorganism that eats stuff and excretes the magic element.
