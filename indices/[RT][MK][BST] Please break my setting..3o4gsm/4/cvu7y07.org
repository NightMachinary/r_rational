It's interesting that magic appears to be almost purely offensive.

Transmutation probably has all kinds of neat uses, but I'm really not a chemist. I mean, I could blow things up, that's about it. Oh, can you transmute a specific element inside an existing compound, something like that? You could also make a nuke with this, so they'll have had nukes for longer than we did. (Incidentally, if it needs to be a reasonably pure element, that's not all that hard.)

FTL travel is time travel, so there's an obvious loophole (?) right there. It's so common that people will probably suspend their disbelief, though, if they even notice.

If you can do a sustained acceleration that's faster than gravity, you can go to space with magic alone, I think. Might want to run the numbers, but a majority of the effort of space travel is the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation rather than "real" energy requirements.

Magical temperature manipulation ... that's neat. Cooling things down is, well, /cooler/ than heating them up. You can do some neat things with that.

Why are humanity immune/carriers, when most other species have evolved some level of symbiosis with this virus? Why are we different?

It's a shame that there's no way for me to get these powers, since I'm not all that lucky. You could strip away most of a person's body, stick some wires in their brain for motivation, and use them as part of a mechanical magic-based device; but ethics. I bet there are villains doing it, though. Don't even have to be psychopaths, could be an ethnic "they're not people" thing, species-based morality (you see people going on about it sometimes), could be doing it with someone they decided "deserved" it for doing something bad.

Teleportation ... probably the best use of this is data transfer, but humans probably already have FTL data transfer. Oh, magic satellites is nice.

You could make a forcefield with the "apply physical force" thing. Push everything out of an area, once you've got a vacuum it'll feel like a solid object. But sadly, I think it would take too much power to be genuinely useful. The greatest of party tricks, though. And it's a perfect insulator! (Sort of, it's transparent to infrared.) That's handy.

Oh! Clones. If they have FTL, they've gotta have clones. That's another way for a villain to break the rules; mass-clone people, check them for magic as soon as the fetus'll react to stimulus, kill the ones that don't. You can brute-force magic potential. Heck, you might be able to physically duplicate a magic-user and see if they keep their powers, which they probably will.

Mass-produced, automated magic is a villains-only tech, and it's really freaking cool. Forcefields! Actual forcefields! Also proper teleportation and some engineering stuff I guess; and better weapons but honestly if you can't kill someone with this magic system you're not even trying.

  It's possible to teleport on a large scale with supplemental energy sources, in fact, that's how their interstellar travel works.

Supplemental /what/?!
