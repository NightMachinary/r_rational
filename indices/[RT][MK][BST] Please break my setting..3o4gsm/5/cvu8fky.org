The main problem with checking for stable elements much heavier than Uranium is that the way we create them is to mash two atoms together and hope they stick. Because the neutron to proton ratio for stable isotopes goes up the higher we go, this results in heavy atoms of provably less stable isotopes than what we would get with more neutrons.

So. Your transmutation. Does it allow mages to create superheavy elements? Because there very likely are elements up there that are, if not stable, at least stable enough to have a half life of months or centuries rather than nano seconds. I know in my own world I use this as an excuse to shove in Orichalcum and a few other imaginary materials.
