I completely agree.

Additionally I found the MC to be thoroughly dislikable, both due to his character and his agonizing stupidity.

Not to mention that the author appears to have memory problems, since he keeps contradicting thing that he established in earlier chapters.

His mother, for example. In the three chapters that she is mentioned she gets three different characterizations. And the number of times that he has met her in his life keeps going down.
