I read it for a while, but between the clumsy references, the relentless gory nihilism, and the clumsy word choice I just lost interest. It's good enough to suck you in - decent grammar, okay characterization - but no aspect rises above "meh" in the firsr bit. Like, if you disliked Worm, this has all the things people cite as turning them off of it, but multiplied to a level even I can't stand. And look at my username.
