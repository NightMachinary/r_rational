Couple of thoughts:

Is it really the last one of its species? Other than systematic elimination of all others before this one was lifted, the poisoning of the planet would probably not be enough to just eliminate them that fast.

Could it then not also lift another elements of his species, seeing as it seemed to have obtained a similar level of mental manipulation?

And even if not, other than the planet being completely devoid of natural resources, could it not find a way off planet for it or its kind?

In other words, it's a nice enough comic, but it would gain a lot with the removal of the last two pages, the rushed try to get a book-start-book-end concept and to decry "evolution" as "defeated" end up dragging it down. Specially because the great advantage of the mind as an evolutionary element is increasing the possibilities of adaptation, and that concept passes right by this comic.
