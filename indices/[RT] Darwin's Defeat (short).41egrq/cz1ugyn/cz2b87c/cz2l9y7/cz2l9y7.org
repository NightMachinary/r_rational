Well yes, I understand this concept, but that is not why I asked that question there. The point is, does at the moment at which this comic passes, the creature is the very last one of its species?

Because if so then it raises a lot of questions: did the other ones get killed before this one was lifted? It mentions armies which implies army of its same species, but supposedly they are all dead? Or does it mean that the whole species will not survive another generation due to what was done to the planet.

Because everything that does not imply that the rest of the species was totally wiped out(and even that), still allows for avenues of exit and adaptation through which the species might survive.

And if he wiped out the whole species except for this one element then he was pretty stupid? He would do better to isolate one and uplift it and then extract it, instead of gambling that the uplift would not have any negative effects. What would happen if the adaptation capabilities of the species would induce a huge growth of his cerebral mass and a brain aneurysm? And what if its psychic powers entered into a feedback loop? When you have a unique source material you do not reduce it to a single element before trying to obtain the desired result product.
