  Is it really the last one of its species? Other than systematic elimination of all others before this one was lifted, the poisoning of the planet would probably not be enough to just eliminate them that fast.

We can assume that if the whole species becomes extinct at time /t/, then time /t-sigma/ there is one member of the species left. If it's intentional by the alien to wait until there's only one left so it's less likely to betray him, this would make sense.

That's not to say that it's necessarily the most likely situation, just that it's plausible within the setting.
