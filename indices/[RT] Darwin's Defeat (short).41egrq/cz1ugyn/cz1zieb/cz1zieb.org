Indeed. I've seen this comic before, and I've always wondered why so many people seem to see the ending as the creature making the right choice. Surely even if he's the last of his kind it would have been better if he retained his powers and used it to help other creatures in need? It's not like getting off the planet is the issue either, with his precognitive abilities he could just pretend to join the alien and betray him once he's own board.

I think it's probably 'Bad man gave him powers artificially => those powers are bad => choosing to give them up = good'
