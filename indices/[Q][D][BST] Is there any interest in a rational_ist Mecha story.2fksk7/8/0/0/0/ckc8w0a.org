Better would probably be something spider-like with turreted weapons on its top, underside, and edges. If it wanted to bring mass firepower to bear, it would bend so that its hull was perpendicular to the ground, bringing edge and top weapons to bear. If it wanted to go hull-down it would spread its legs wider to bring its center of mass down. And so on. Put hands on the ends of the legs and you're good to go.
