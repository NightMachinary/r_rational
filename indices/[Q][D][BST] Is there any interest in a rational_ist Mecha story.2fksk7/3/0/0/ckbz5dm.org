For more dangerous(/SPIDERS) territory, the Israel/Palestinian war fought via mecha.

For a technical note, as you might already be aware the Iron Man model is implausible because it needs to violate conservation of momentum in order to not hurt the human wearing it. The smallest you can plausibly go is about twice the size of the reassembled armor Stane uses in the first movie. This can be overridden if you have it as a remote-piloted humanoid drone, which has its advantages especially in comparatively early stages of robot war adoption since you probably have a bunch of Special Forces around who can use their already-developed instincts to pilot them.

This also puts it at about twice the size of Lagann, I think. The pinballing effect it has would be a problem even if it was less cartoonishly exaggerated.
