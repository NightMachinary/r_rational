The biggest thing to take into account: realistic mecha aren't heavy armor. Instead, they're light, stealthy, mobile urban assault forces. Basically, think ground helicopter.

A mecha can't move as fast as a tank across flat ground, in the same way that a helicopter can't go in a straight line as fast as a fixed-wing aircraft. They can't carry as much payload, they are less efficient, and they aren't anywhere near as durable.

However, mecha are far more maneuverable, particularly in the ways that let you dodge behind buildings or pop up and down behind a small hill. A pile of rubble, like you'd get from a destroyed building, is an insurmountable obstacle to anything on wheels or tracks but a wide-open highway to a mecha. Balancing and crouching (shorter levers) means they can hugely vary their carrying capacity, which when combined with hands (built-in cargo cranes) lets them engage a wide variety of threats.

A typical engagement against a mecha will have it running down cross streets so that it can appear in random places to toss a single missile from its external rack and then disappear back into the mess to find another place to hit you. If anything big enough to whack it gets line of effect, it'll dodge down another street or into a building and run away. If you change what you're using to hunt it, it'll grab a weapons cache that it carried in before it engaged and come back with weapons that counter your hunters.
