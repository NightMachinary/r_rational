Ok, you are /clever/, and /right/. The ideal "rational" mecha is basically something almost /Iron Man/-like, or about the size of the plain (uncombined) Lagann: fundamentally a design for nimble but mighty urban warfare in situations where "firebomb the site from the air" just doesn't work (usually for political reasons).

I can now see a mecha series about the future occupation of Iraq.
