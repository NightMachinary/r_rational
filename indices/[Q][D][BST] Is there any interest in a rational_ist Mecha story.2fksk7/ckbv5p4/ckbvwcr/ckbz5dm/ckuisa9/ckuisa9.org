(Yeah I'm a month late to this party)

Isn't the Iron Man model plausible if you lower your expectations? I imagine armor that's just designed to keep up with the human inside it, not improving their speed at all, but doing all the carrying for them. They could be well-armored against regular bullets, and not bother trying to stop anti-tank stuff because conservation of momentum would kill the pilot anyway. Even if the end result is less powerful than a tank, you could fit more of them in a space than tanks, so the available concentration of firepower is higher. And they can go into buildings.
