My personal preference is towards super robots, so my opinion probably won't be too helpful here. For what it's worth, I don't really want to try to justify mechas at all; I'd probably try to sidestep the whole issue by setting the story in, say, a virtual-reality videogame simulation or something artificially constructed like that.

On the other hand, 'rational' doesn't always mean 'coheres to what we know about physics'- focusing on the problem-solving and analytical aspects could be just as interesting. For example, a story in which the mechas being piloted are actually stages of an alien organism's life-cycle might provide an interesting puzzle for our protagonists to slowly unravel. (This is actually an idea I've had for a long time, and I could go into more detail on this particular puzzle-setting idea if people want.)

Anyways: at the furthest end of realism is basically the story of a tank crew trying to survive in a battlefield. Choose how unrealistic you want to be by your own discretion, I suppose.
