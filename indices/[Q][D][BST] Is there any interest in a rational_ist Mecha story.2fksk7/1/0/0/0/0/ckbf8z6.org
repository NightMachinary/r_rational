Well, effective is more a question of /cost/ than just results. There's no doubt that Cap performed admirably in his role, but we don't know how much the super serum program cost the military, and it might be that return on investment was quite a bit lower than simply finding and training some more conventional special forces. Though it's complicated by the fact that the program was sabotaged at very nearly the exact worst moment.

As far as mechs go, I can see them possibly being effective on the field, just not the most sensible investment given the costs involved with making and/or maintaining them /unless/ there's some kind of secondary motivation like propaganda, entertainment, or an idiot ruler that wants something that looks cool.
