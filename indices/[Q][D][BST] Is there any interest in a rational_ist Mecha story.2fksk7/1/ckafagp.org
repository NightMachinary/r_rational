I'd love to see it, because mecha are pretty much the trope codifier for Rule of Cool.

That said, you're going to have a really tough time of it. There are pretty much no conditions under which upright human tanks are the optimal combat design. Here are some of the problems you'll need to find answers to:

- Mecha are basically a giant pile of shot traps strapped together.\\
- Tanks are relatively low-lying and can hide behind terrain features pretty well. Mecha can't, unless they lie down, at which point they are just inefficiently designed tanks.
- Realistic mecha will be slow moving and their weight will put incredible strain on their joints. Fast-moving agile mecha are science fantasy.
- One of the benefits of mecha that often gets quoted is hands, but the only advantage hands have is that they allow holding / manipulating a variety of tools. A fighting machine doesn't really need a variety of tools: it needs "blow thing up" and "blow thing up more".\\
- Tanks can center-axis mount their weapons in order to absorb recoil, mecha can't unless you put it in the chest, in which case you've given up the advantage of hands. Even then, you're an unstable two-legged upright pole instead of a low-lying box with long fat treads.
- A gun built into the arm is just a tank barrel. A hand-carried gun will by necessity have a smaller ammo capacity than what a tank with equivalent technology could mount. It probably also can't hit as hard, due to needing to be more miniaturized.

Here are a couple of ideas for how you could justify having them:

- If mecha combat is a sporting event -- basically mecha gladiators for the entertainment of the masses.
- If they are built as highly mobile rough-country artillery platforms instead of as close-quarters fighters.
- If the mecha are old gladiator rigs left over from a more civilized era and now being repurposed as weapons of war because they hit hard even though they are impractical. Bonus points if they're being used by the ragtag misfit rebels against the vastly more powerful imperial troops of DarkEvil McBadGuy.
- If the mecha are actually captured exoskeletons of a much larger race, being appropriated by humans because they are the only things that hit hard enough to penetrate the other race's armor. (You then need to deal with square-cube law issues as you explain your larger aliens, and why aliens and humans are fighting in a universe that makes interstellar contact, let alone combat, extremely nonsensical.)
