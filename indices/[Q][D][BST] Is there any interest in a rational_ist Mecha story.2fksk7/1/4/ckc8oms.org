  One of the benefits of mecha that often gets quoted is hands, but the only advantage hands have is that they allow holding / manipulating a variety of tools. A fighting machine doesn't really need a variety of tools: it needs "blow thing up" and "blow thing up more".

A note: "blow things up" and "blow things up /at different ranges/, /with different effects/ is more than enough to require weapon-swapping. For example, if most of the people you're fighting are RPG-toting infantry, a pack of artillery rockets is going to be next to useless compared to a bunch of machine guns, and if the main opposition is main battle tanks you want a big gun firing high-velocity long-rod penetrators. The ability to put down your giant cannon and pick up a couple rocket tubes or machine guns makes your platform significantly more flexible and effective.
