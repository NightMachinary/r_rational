  As far as I can tell, the more expensive a platform is the more likely it'll be modular.

I think there's a question of causality here. Is it more modular because it's more expensive, or it is more expensive because it's more modular? My vote goes for "more expensive because more modular".

  A jet fighter has to do all of ELINT, air superiority, ground attack, bombing, and missile defense

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_United_States_military_aircraft][Wikipedia suggests]] that most aircraft are designed for a single purpose, although there are a few [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multirole_combat_aircraft][multirole aircraft]].

Although, yes, fighters can typically swap out what kind of missiles their hardpoints are carrying. I'm not sure if a given hardpoint can be either a missile or a bomb, but maybe. So, yes, there's some flexibility there. Still, that's a long way from "I'm going to swap out my long range missile pack for another rack of medium lasers".

Regardless, handheld weapons are never going to be as effective for a mech as builtins. They will have a much smaller ammo capacity, and won't hit as hard due to being smaller--both because if you focus on pure power you don't focus on making the weapon small enough to be hand-held, and because the gun has less mass and a weaker mounting (hand/wrist instead of whole body) to absorb recoil.

  If you can get it to the point where the mecha alone can do the work, you now have the ability to do something like send all your guns in on trucks behind your front line so that if your mecha needs to rearm it can run back a kilometer, pick up a new gun, and run back to the fight.

Sure, but then you have mecha that are dependent on wheeled logistics to be able to fight. At this point you've lost much of the benefit of the mech's go-anywhere legged design, and you have a critical point of vulnerability in your weapons platform. The enemy can now soft-kill the mech, just by finding and destroying its logistics train. Which means you now need to send forces to protect the logistics train, which jacks up the effective cost of the mech in terms of both money and materiel, and reduces the tactical flexibility you gain from it, since it ties up other forces.

But, sure, maybe handheld weapons are totally the way to go because mecha need huge flexibility. I doubt it though; for the money you would spend having highly flexible hand-carried weapon mecha, you could buy a bunch more simpler mecha of various specialized kinds...or just a whole lot of tanks and planes.
