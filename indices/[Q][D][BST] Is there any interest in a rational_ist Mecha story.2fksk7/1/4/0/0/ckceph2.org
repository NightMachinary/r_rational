Yes. However, if you don't have hands or a similarly modular design, it becomes much more difficult to do that swapping even during downtime. Main battle tanks tend to have their one gun and that's it; changing it out would require disassembling the entire tank and rebuilding it. That's the situation you want to avoid. Hands aren't /necessary/ for that, but they do make it somewhat easier, particularly if you've designed them so the mecha itself can do the heavy lifting during outfitting. If you can get it to the point where the mecha alone can do the work, you now have the ability to do something like send all your guns in on trucks behind your front line so that if your mecha needs to rearm it can run back a kilometer, pick up a new gun, and run back to the fight.
