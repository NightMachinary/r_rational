Sensibly designed mechs. Not giant mechanical humans or even animals, but tanks made for some different kind of warfare they are then shown of in; for the most mechlike results, probably climbing and jumping around in/on skyscrapers, forest canopies, and mountains far to steep for rolling-type locomotion.
