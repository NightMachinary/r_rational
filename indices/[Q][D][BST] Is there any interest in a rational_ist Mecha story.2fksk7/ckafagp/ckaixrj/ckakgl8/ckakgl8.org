  Rational Mobile Fighter G Gundam please. That could totally work.

I'm not familiar with the Gundam series...is MFGG a gladiator thing?

TVTropes has this to say about why Gundam managed to make mecha a sensible combat choice:

#+begin_quote
  Yoshiyuki Tomino wanted to write a Real Robot anime. However, anyone remotely familiar with either engineering or military tactics will tell you that such devices are almost impossible to effectively use; a bipedal platform is needlessly complicated, hard to properly armor, and the easiest thing to shoot at in a battlefield. Enter the Minovsky Particle: an EMP-like, sensor-jamming, delicate-electronics wrecking Plot Device that not only renders all ranged targeting and guided missiles useless, but requires Helium-3 to produce. Consequently, humans had to go to space to get Helium-3, fight old-school close combat battles using systems capable of tricky microgravity maneuvering, and eventually expand on the technology to make maintenance easier.

I'm still not sure that I buy that mecha are the optimal design, even under these conditions -- seems to me you could do all the same things with something shaped more like a fly-by-wire jet, but meh.

  The way they control their Mobile Suits justifies the human shape.

How do they control their suits?
