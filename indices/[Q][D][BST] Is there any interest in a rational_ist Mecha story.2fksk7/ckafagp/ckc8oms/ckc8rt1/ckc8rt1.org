Yes, but you have to tote all that along, including the ammo, meaning that you have much less of the ammo that you actually need at the moment. A better solution is to either make sure you know what mission you're going on and use an appropriate loadout or, more likely, use a combined-arms strategy where each member of a mech lance carries a different set of weaponry for covering different situations. You can also have some general purpose weapons, like missiles. They're overkill for taking out a squad of soldiers, but they'll get the job done.
