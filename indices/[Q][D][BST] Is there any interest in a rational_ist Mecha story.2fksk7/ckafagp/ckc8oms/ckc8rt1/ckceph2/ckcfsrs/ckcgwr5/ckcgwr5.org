  Real militaries suggest that this isn't that big a priority.

As far as I can tell, the more expensive a platform is the more likely it'll be modular. A six-million-dollar tank has minimal flexibility, a twenty-million-dollar attack helicopter has a fixed gun and can mount a couple different rockets or missiles, and a thirty-million-dollar multirole fighter mounts just about everything. Basically, the more expensive something is, the less you want to have to rebuild it if you /do/ have to do something different, and the cheaper something is the easier it is to branch out by just building a bunch of different variations.

Also, modularity is more valuable the more flexible a platform has to be. The only things a tank is really designed or expected to deal with are personnel and other tanks, so they have machine guns and an anti-armor gun and that's it. A jet fighter has to do all of ELINT, air superiority, ground attack, bombing, and missile defense, so it's hugely modular. Mecha are going to be a little bit combined-arms, but they'll still be replacing a large variety of dedicated infantry support and artillery vehicles.

  Besides, if you want to be able to swap out the main gun, there's no reason it couldn't be built modular. That would be simpler and less involved than building a humanoid mecha that has to actually balance and walk.

Agreed; humanoid is bad. Two legs are insufficiently redundant and the materials science isn't there. Hands are mostly so you can service your gun without a maintenance bay or ground crew. I'm thinking something much more like a spider tank, with a very flat body and six or eight legs around the periphery. Weapons would be mounted to a big modular turret on top of the body. The two frontmost legs would be special, with extra flexibility and manipulators so you can use them for lifting turret assemblies into place. Extra legs are there for stability (both while moving and standing still), redundancy (so you can lose a couple legs without suffering a mobility kill), maneuverability (inverted pendulum dynamics are useful, but sometimes you just want to go /that way/), and height (you want to be able to scuttle around while hull-down, and being designed to crab-walk is better than crawling).
