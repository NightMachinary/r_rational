yes. if i may pose a thought, perhaps the reason for the robots being shaped like people is that hands are a good multi purpose platform and when you are building a large war machine you want to make it easy to use, a neural interface would be easy but perhaps unsettling and clumsy if you make the robot not human shaped.
