So, I know EE probably didn't give us enough to piece together what Cat's first scheme in her new Role would be, but my bet is on her faking Thief's death to create an opening. What are your thoughts on why else can they need a body double that's going to (at least for now) be kept out of sight?

Also, I'm almost as fascinated as Black that Cat broke the stupid succession story. Would his fight with White Knight in Nicae count as a beginning of a pattern of lose-draw-win? I'm guessing not, since Hanno doesn't seem to have much agency in what he does, and Black's primary opponent was the Bard.
