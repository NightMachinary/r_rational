I keep thinking Cat's new name is so obvious.

The White Knight is good.

The Black Knight is evil.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Sheba][The Black Queen is good.]]

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snow_Queen][The White Queen is evil.]]

She's a winter-oriented fae-adjacent magic-using queen who is pro-order, pro-evil. Cat is Jadis.

Also: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axum][Aksum is a real place]], as is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant][Levant]]. Still not sure the setting of Calernia doesn't have some relation to Earth like the Bastardverse does.
