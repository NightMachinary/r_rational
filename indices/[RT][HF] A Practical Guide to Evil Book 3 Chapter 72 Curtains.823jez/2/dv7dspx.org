Cat's apprenticeship to Black started when he stabbed her with a knife to give her a Name dream. It ended with her stabbing him as a reminder of her goal to build a better world.

At the same time, I feel Cat's ideas are once more undermined by her hypocrisy. She tells Black to become a better person so he can fit in the society she builds while at the same time using shadows to devour soldiers because she's impatient... That's a bit of a double standard there Cat. You don't even feel bad about it.

The reason for exiling Black was motivated by her feeling of betrayal more than any calculated reasoning in my opinion. Black's involvement in the Akua situation was about the same as Cat's - he dealt with the problem in an effective manner. He didn't know much about the super-weapon being built or about the killing of a major southern city. If he did, I imagine he would kill her in her sleep; it's exactly the sort of thing Black fights against.

Blaming Malicia, on the other hand, would be perfectly reasonable because she had both the knowledge and the means to stop Diabolist, but she didn't. I'm surprised Cat is not frothing at her mouth at the thought of the Dread Empress.
