I think that, right now, Cat is too busy wondering what Malicia's next actions to be angry at her. Also, she already discussed with the Empress about the whole "helping Diabolist destroy the world" thing so it's less of a sudden development and more of a scale to settle later.

As for hypocrisy, well, it wouldn't be Cat without some. She at least acknowledges that isn't fit to live in the world she want to build either.
