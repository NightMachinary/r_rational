Cat is a legal military combatant or a sovereign state?

Good to know.

I think your expectations of a formal military surrender that abides by your precise rules are a little off base when you're talking about civilians.

As a civilian, though, her definitions of it are not as precise as what you hold her up to, and she didn't have the necessary time to work out the details when it was going down. If you surrender to the enemy and they reward your good will by proceeding to kill of your friends, you are quite within your rights to resist.
