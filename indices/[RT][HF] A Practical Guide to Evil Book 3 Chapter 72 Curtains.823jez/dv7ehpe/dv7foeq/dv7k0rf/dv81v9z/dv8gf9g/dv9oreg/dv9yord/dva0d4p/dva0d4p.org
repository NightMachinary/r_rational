  So, it's ok to wound someone since we know they will heal? You can stab someone, no worries, this person will heal sooner or later?
#+end_quote

When they are a multiple murderer and incredibly accomplished combatant actively trying to kill you yes, it is.

  I mean, her first interaction was wounding him past the point of recovery, but no worries, it's ok. Please.
#+end_quote

Actually, she was careful to avoid wounding him too badly and there is very little he cannot regenerate from. It isn't her fault Armsmasters stasis fucked up his regeneration, and he still ended up healing later - it just took longer.

  And she killed Aster, which was a baby, wasn't threatening her in any way, and though a bullet in the head was a mercy. Very "Good" mindset.
#+end_quote

Toddler, not baby. And she did so because Aster was the captive of an incredibly capable deranged lunatic with a habit of using his pet monsters to use people as spare parts to create /more/ monsters.

She didn't just walk down the street and pop a cap in a random kid.

  As for Alexandria, Taylor says she is doing things for the Greater Good, up to the point she has to do sacrifice. At this point, everything stop, self serving mode on. When you surrender and still try to impose conditions while threatening people, these people tell you to fuck off, that's normal. Except in Taylor mind.
#+end_quote

When surrendering at the height of your power, you have the right to dictate terms. Instead, Alexandria refused to give her the slightest shred of credit or respect and chose to provoke her as much as possible by convincing her she was having Taylors friends hunted down like animals. All in an attempt to twist the system into allowing her an opportunity to literally enslave Taylor.

Alexandria is one of the heroes, but she is by no means "good".
