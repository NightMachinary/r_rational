To be fair, that was her view with the information available. At the time it was both impossible and undesirable to attempt to resist the Tower.

Impossible was obvious, but undesirable because they'd have no chance to rebuild and end up being a constant graveyard while being invaded by everyone in turn (which we see in the Fourfold Crossing).

But now that the Tower is weakened, all the major Legion generals but one have been slain (and all the other competent ones being under Cat), all the major legions being gutted, the Tower having its primary magical superweapons destroyed or subverted, and it's major living heroes either unwilling to stop her or actively aiding her, resisting the tower went from /impossible/ to /very possible/.

Now that Malicia has shown she will backstab everyone, even her best "friend", that she is willing to sell or give out secrets as part of her plots, that she has no qualms about using a superweapon that will ensure a MAD scenario, that she is willing to throw away the Black-inspired "new villainy" for the old-school villainy despite all those decades of worth... well, it's gone from /undesirable/ to /can we move this along faster please/.
