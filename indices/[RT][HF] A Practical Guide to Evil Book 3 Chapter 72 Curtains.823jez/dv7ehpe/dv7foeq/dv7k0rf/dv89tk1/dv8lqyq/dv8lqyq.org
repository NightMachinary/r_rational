I contest the first and last quote lines in your comment pretty heavily. From the beginning her "plan" was to join the military and become an influencer. Lots of open space between plan start and finish there. And I'm pretty sure her - a teenager - thinking she'll do a better job than everyone else is one of the fundamental underpinnings of her entire character.

More broadly: Cat's goal is "uplift Callow", but other than some broad strokes regarding ejecting outside influence she's kind of vague on how exactly she intends to achieve the end state she's shooting for. It kinda seems to boil down to "put myself in the absolute leader position by acquiring power/influence".

All the concrete/enduring steps she takes seem to be spur of the moment things: She dismantled/suborned the dark guilds when they got in her way, but IIRC this wasn't something she had set in stone earlier, it just happened because they inconvenienced her. Setting up Callowan rulers was (for a time) achieved via taking advantage of the aftermath of the rebellion she (arguably) instigated, but again it wasn't like she went into the fight with sword guy with that plan in mind. Again, IIRC it was entirely spur of the moment.

I think that last event illustrates my point, in that after the rebellion she was in a prime position to take advantage of it but hadn't put a lot of thought into effectively doing so. The plan she enacted (mixing Callowan and Praesi on the board of governors or w/e) wasn't a strong one, and I don't think it's uncharitable to call it naive. It was vulnerable to Praesi subversion (which she knew - scorpion and the frog and all) and it was vulnerable to her not being around to actively police things (which as a Named without a big support base and being driven by the gods/narrative was probably inevitable, Fae incursion or not).

I think there are a lot of parallels to Worm there, especially Cauldron. They had a goal to spam superheroes and hope for the best; they didn't ever have a plan to defeat alien god man. And much in the same way they did a lot of bad stuff in pursuit of a goal they ultimately didn't achieve, Cat seems to be committed to doing whatever it takes to achieve her goal of being boss of Callow. She's banking on being able to change things once she reaches that position, but I kinda worry she'll finally reach the top and realize she ended up sacrificing the majority of what drove her to reach her goal. I can definitely see parallels to Taylor there.

Edit: because I just realized how this post might be taken - I'm in no way implying that PotG is at all derivative of Worm. The trope of lawful evil (or w/e, I'm not that familiar with DnD) hero making things worse via tunnel vision is not a new one.
