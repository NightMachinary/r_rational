AFAIK we only have this:

#+begin_quote
  The first step is hardest, they said to her

  You will have to walk through fire

  It will burn away what you once were,

  And always devour whole a liar.

  They say the third step is the cruelest

  Walk when the moon is at her clearest:

  Love ends with the kiss of the knife,

  Trust is the wager that takes your life.
