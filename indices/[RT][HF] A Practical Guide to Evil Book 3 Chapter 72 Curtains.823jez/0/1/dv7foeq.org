I haven't considered it but this really does fit The Girl Who Climbed The Tower, you're spot on. "Love ends with the kiss of the knife" indeed.

I think Cat's on a path to become a true monster - more so than even Black, Malicia or Akua. All of them are monsters, true, but they're also human: Akua, who loved her father; Black, who cares so deeply about Calamities and Malicia who reminisces about the good old times with Black over cheap wine.

Cat still has this human element - she had a good time with Archer this very chapter - but I think she will steadily sacrifice more and more of herself to achieve her goals. She already let go of love, how much longer until she lets go of companionship? Already, we've seen her manipulate the Woe. How much longer will it take until they're only tools at her disposal?
