She is not even chaotic good. She doesn't have any moral compass. She is just a warlord, doing her law on her territory. At best, she is chaotic neutral, but not good by any means. Her priorities are completly fucked up (how many people was injured/killed by her quests for Dinah?), and she can't be reasonned with when it's important. She acts on emotions, very unlike Cat.
