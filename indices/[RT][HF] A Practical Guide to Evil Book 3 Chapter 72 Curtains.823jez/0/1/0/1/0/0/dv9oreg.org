Gouges eyes? You mean the guy who turns into a monster and has killed several people? That's her showing a Batman level of restraint... in this case, holding to her personal principles above that of outside authority, even when it makes sense *not* to do so. She shouldn't have gouged his eyes, she was well within "good" morality to straight-up kill him.

Killing major heroes? Are you referring to the one that threatened her friends and was apparently killing one each hour? Or are you talking about the other ones that were trying to kill her directly? Because none of what they were doing was particularly /heroic/, or even /good/. And if you are trying to kill someone, they are quite within their rights to stop you by any means necessary.

I don't remember the children, so unless you're referring to collateral damage, the S9K clones, or underage heroes (ie: child soldiers) attacking her, you'll have to clarify that one.

So far, none of those screams "evil". They are not particularly good, but can be done by a Good character. In the case of the eyes, it was her trying to find a good solution... /and she knew they would grow back/.
