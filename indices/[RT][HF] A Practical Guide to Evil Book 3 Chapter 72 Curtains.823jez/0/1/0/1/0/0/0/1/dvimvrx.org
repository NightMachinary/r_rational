Yes, you can wound someone knowing they will heal, especially if they are a /regenerator/ and have that level of healing... and even /more/ especially if it's a choice between that or their life.

In addition, how many weak spots does he have to her bugs? Did you consider the fact that 99% of his surface area is immune to her attacks in your calculation, or does he just count as Joe Schmo Regular Guy in the morality court?

Apparently you don't understand the concept of a "mercy kill". If the person's death is better than the alternative (in this case, being tortured by the world's craziest psychopath and experimented on by the world's most skilled bio tinker into being a mental and physical monster to be cloned repeatedly into many broken forms to be used as living weapon/child soldiers), you may have to choose the "better" option. Is that Good? If it isn't, it's not Evil either, but firmly in the Neutral category.

As for Alexandria--that "Hero of Heroes" was (as far as Taylor knew, especially since she trusted Alexandria to be true to her word) *killing off her friends one by one*. Just like how killing someone in self-defense when their goal is to kill you does not qualify as an evil (or even illegal) act, neither does doing so to protect another person.

Taylor is quite firmly in the Neutral camp because she has a mix of booth Good and Evil, and while she's done some terrible things, she doesn't generally do them purely out of self-interest, for fun, or out of laziness. She /tries/ to do the right thing, but often is in a situation where she can't, and compromises must be made.

You know, almost like a deconstruction of your "typical" black-and-white morality superhero universe.
