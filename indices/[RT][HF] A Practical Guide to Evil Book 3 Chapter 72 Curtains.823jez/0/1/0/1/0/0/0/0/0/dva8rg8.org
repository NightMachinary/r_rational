My point being: Worm is not PGTE, Worm is not a Manichean story (And PGTE manage to be both a Manichean story without being one), and Taylor is not someone "good", not by a long shot. Even if she fights against villain villains and villain heroes. She did pretty shitty things, and clearly deserved to be punished for that. She thinks she is doing "good things", but she is only self righteous.

And no, when you surrender, you surrender. It's the point of surrendering. If you are threatening people if they don't meet your conditions, you are not surrendering. And if you are an enemy who is not surrendering and will do aggressive actions very soon, you will be treated as an enemy who must be dispatched. Honestly, even if the PRT chief was an asshole, it wasn't he who was wrong there.
