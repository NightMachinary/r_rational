So, it's ok to wound someone since we know they will heal? You can stab someone, no worries, this person will heal sooner or later?

I mean, her first interaction was wounding him past the point of recovery, but no worries, it's ok. Please.

And she killed Aster, which was a baby, wasn't threatening her in any way, and though a bullet in the head was a mercy. Very "Good" mindset.

As for Alexandria, Taylor says she is doing things for the Greater Good, up to the point she has to do sacrifice. At this point, everything stop, self serving mode on. When you surrender and still try to impose conditions while threatening people, these people tell you to fuck off, that's normal. Except in Taylor mind.

I don't get how people can think Taylor could be a "good" character. I mean, she never did anything worthy of the tag. Never.
