I can see why you are doing the comparaison, but it's clearly wrong. The whole point of PGTE is "I am Cat, and I have a plan for Callow". Even before getting the Squire name, even meeting Black. She has a plan since the very beginning, and she try to stick to it (with more or less success).

Taylor had no plan. She is changing her mind multiple times during the serie, reacts instead of acts, tell people she is doing things "for the greater good" while she is absolutely not. She is lying to herself from the very beginning to the very end. She manages to do the difference against Scion by pure luck.

Cat is nothing like that. She is going to the path of Evil by Choice (and "It is, we are told, the only choice that ever really matters."), not because of some shallow circonstances like "I love my friends" and "Me, a teenager, think i'm doing a better job than everyone".
