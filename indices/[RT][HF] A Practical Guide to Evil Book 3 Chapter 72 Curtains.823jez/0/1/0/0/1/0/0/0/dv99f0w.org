What socioeconomic issues? Stop trying to project modern society unto Callow. The tech level of is comparable to that of medieval Europe; you don't need much specialized knowledge to run things.

All of Callow's biggest current problems are external (Wars); it's internal administration has already been massively improved since the ruling council.
