- Acquire power.
- ????
- Fix Callow!

That's not much of a plan? Power is not the be all end all of problem solving apparatuses. Do what with that power? How will she fix Callow's political system, economy, or culture. She's dealing with problems too deep to be fixed by a half-educated teenager with a violent streak and her band of sycophants will know how to deal with. Socioeconomic issues can't be chased away by pointing a sword at and threatening them. And her failure as a leader and a person is her unfounded assumption that she'll just magically find a way because she's just that special.
