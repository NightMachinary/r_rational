Actually modern society did invent capitalism (before then it was mercantilism all the way), investing (without joint stock companies it was very impossible to have many investors, and without tech progress or colonies there wasn't much to invest in anyways), and regulatory capture (without a large, centralized regulatory state there wasn't much to capture).
