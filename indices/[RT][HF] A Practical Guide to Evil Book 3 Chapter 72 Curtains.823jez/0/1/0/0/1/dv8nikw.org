Cat says she has a plan. So she must have a plan. Please don't pay attention that an actual concrete set of steps to improve Callow politically and economically, or the fact that her actions almost always involve Callow being embroiled in more and more disastrous conflict. The total lack of actual concrete goals and inability to not constantly undermine her own stated desires are all just part of the plan.

Also, I would hardly call Taylor's desire to stick with what is effectively her adopted family "shallow" lol.
