Theory: The Girl Who Climbed the Tower is an ironic song that ends with the protagonist dying after sacrificing everything. The full song will be sung by the Bard before her and Catherine's Final stand off. Catherine will be shaken by the reveal that she is fated to lose, but says fuck it and forces the story to change through being a cunning monster. After killing the Bard for good, She then sings the song again but with the last verse changed.
