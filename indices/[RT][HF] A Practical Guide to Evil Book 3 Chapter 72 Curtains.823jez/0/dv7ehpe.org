Seriously, last chapter she was having people assassinated as a bargaining chip, now she's crucifying thirty mages for crossing her, wearing the soul of her dead rival as an ornament and mindraping trusted soldiers because she got impatient. Whatever her new name would be, it's somewhere far, far south of Good.

Speaking of her new name, Black Queen and Black Knight are now officially out. And, with her stabbing a loved one after he lost her trust, we've just passed the third verse of The Girl Who Climbed The Tower and got that much closer to Dread Empress. Things are getting tense.
