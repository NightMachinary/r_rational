Huh, funny that Archer is the most loosely tied member of the Woe to Catherine. I kind of thought that Thief was the outsider of their little band after the moment they had in Dormer, but I suppose it makes sense that Archer would follow after her master's footsteps and 'retire' once their novel-worthy moments are all used up.
