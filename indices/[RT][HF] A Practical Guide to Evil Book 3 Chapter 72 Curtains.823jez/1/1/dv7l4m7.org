I kind of thought the whole thing was each of them indulging in self deception: archer claiming she will leave, while she gets all friends forever with cat, and cat musing that her work will be finished one day so she can holiday with her bff. It seemed like both of them knew they were talking baloney, but it was nice to lie and not be called on it.

Really, neither of them expects to live to see any of those plans come to fruition.
