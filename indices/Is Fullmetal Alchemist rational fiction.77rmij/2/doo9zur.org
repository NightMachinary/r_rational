No because the defeat and demise of almost all the antagonists is based on them making a continuous chain of stupid\ineffective decisions.

The beginnig arcs were pretty decent in this regard because at that point the author was just gradually unveiling the setting, and the "villains" didn't have to be muzzled yet.

But afterwards the main characters had to start winning somehow against incredible odds, and so the antagonists became bumbling caricatures of their previously depicted selves.

Also No because the most basic premise of the story, the idea of equal exchange, is flawed with "humanity bias". Just because we-the-humans see some things as having roughly similar values doesn't mean the objective universe would have the same notions.

This second point can be ameliorated somewhat by saying that magic\"alchemy" itself comes from a conscious, subjective entity. But that would be a rather cliche handwave explanation for problems like this.
