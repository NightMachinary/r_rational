Pinging [[/u/ywecur][u/ywecur]] because this is my favorite tv show of all time and there's no way I'm not going to take the opportunity to talk about to someone who asks.

I completely agree with you about how great FMA: Brotherhood is, but not on what keeps it from being perfectly rational. I don't think the black box nature of alchemy is the biggest "rational sin" of the magic system. The show doesn't go into detail about how to draw transmutation circles because it wants to spend time on things that are more important to the plot and themes, it would've just been additional exposition. For me, the biggest issue with alchemy is that the definition of human transmutation seems rather inconsistent.

Early on, it seems like it just means trying to resurrect the dead and we see alchemy used to alter human bodies. However, we later see Ed use human transmutation on himself to escape Greed and there's a tense scene in the final battle where the homunculi injure Riza to try and force Mustang to perform human transmutation to stop her from bleeding out. Maybe it's made more clear in the manga, but Brotherhood did not explain the commonality between these plot points.

The only other inconsistency I noticed, though it bothers me much less and is more of a central conceit of the plot that can't be rectified, is that the alchemy that can bind souls to suits of armor is literally the only "spell" that isn't based around manipulating matter. From a distance, it seems like an odd exception to an otherwise thematically consistent magic system and was presumably included just so Al could be a more interesting character. Thankfully, it worked.
