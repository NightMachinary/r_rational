Don't know about the non-Brotherhood version, but the manga that Brotherhood is based on is fairly close. There weren't any "plot demands it" that I can remember, the antagonists have somewhat unique beliefs and values, characters use intelligent solutions to problems, the world... sort of has consistent rules?

The magic is really the main bit of fuzziness to be honest, it's sometimes well developed but there's no real explanation given as to why some alchemists are experts in some things versus others. Sometimes the reason for an alchemical secret is revealed, but often times it's not, and you're just left thinking "Well I guess he just had a secret rare formula/diagram."

That aside though, it's pretty fantastic and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for new anime.
