In Alchemy the circles are full of all sorts of writing that we don't ever learn about, presumably some formula or runes that tell the magic what to do. In that sense it's like wand waving, but we don't actually see the runes, so we don't actually know what a spell will do ahead of time, or how flexible it is. Also when they just clap their hands together to do alchemy, or snap their fingers if Mustang, they're shaping what the magic does entirely with their mind: we have no idea what they're about to do, other than some basic contextual clues.

How do they aim the magic, if it needs to be aimed? How much distance can it cover? What shape will the construct be in? What chemical composition, exactly? All that is decided apparently in their heads, and is variable.

In HPMOR, the blackbox is entirely on the back end. We have no idea WHY magic works the way it does, but we know exactly HOW it works: make the right wand movement, say the right words, get the predictable effect.

If HPMOR was more like FMA's magic, spells wouldn't use incantations at all. They would just wave their wands in some arcane and mysterious way and different effects would come out, the way we sometimes see advanced magic users do it.
