Yes, but mostly because it's more rigid.

In Harry Potter for the most part you have spells that do the same thing every time you cast them. Some get stronger based on your emotion or "energy" you put into them, but once you know what a spell does you can guess how it will be used in any given circumstance.

(The exception to this is wandless/wordless magic, which doesn't play any major part in the story and is mostly spectacle)

In FMA the the magic, alchemy, is much more freeform. The basic laws are understandable, like you can only change matter's form, equivalent exchange, etc, but somewhere between drawing the circle/clapping the hands and the finished product there's a black box we're never privy to, and the enemies often have a wide range of abilities unknown to the protagonists, so it's much easier to be surprised by what someone does with alchemy.
