Yeah, I just figured "human transmutation" meant anything to do with the "soul," such as reviving someone from the dead (rather than just recreating their body) or binding Al to the armor. Both of those are the thing which caused the boys to see Truth, so I figured transmuting parts of bodies is just treated as any other matter.

It did bother me that the idea of Al being a spirit tied to armor isn't explored more, though.
