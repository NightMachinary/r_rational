I personally usually use the word 'hard' in relation to science fiction to describe fiction that more closely obeys the laws of physics as we know/understand them today, or when breaking those explains a lot of the physics it's breaking and how it does so in some sort of manner. For example, a work where everything obeys lightspeed limitations and relativity and works within those restrictions to achieve interstellar travel by generation ships or cryosleep or bussard ramjets or digitization and transmission to be rebuilt by civilizations at another star or the like is 'harder' SF than one where people go to Warp Speed and FTL by pulling a big red lever labelled FTL with no explanation.

[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness][TVTropes]] backs me up in this interpretation.

There's a lot of really good science fiction that has been as soft as butter (e.g. Dune, Hyperion, etc); hardness is no real indicator of quality.
