Really? They have relativistic space combat! No scifi ever has relativistic space combat!

Just because they have FTL travel is a pretty poor reason to ignore the sheer sciencyness of this work. FTL isn't /disproven/ either, and no scifi ever has been able to get away without /some/ handwaving.

The way I see it, the story explicitly asks you to suspend disbelief about magic, FTL and incomprehensible alien tech (which I suspect is because magic), and everything else is thoroughly hard scifi, meaning extrapolable based on modern science. Not only that, it sets hard rules about the limitations of technology and then follows them scrupulously.

The equivalent to my mind is saying Blindsight isn't hard scifi because Vampires.

Both stories are about as hard as modern scifi can get. 4 Mohs
