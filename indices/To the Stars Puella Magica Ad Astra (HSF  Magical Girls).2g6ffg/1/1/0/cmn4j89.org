/No scifi ever has relativistic space combat!/

There's kind of a lot of SF that has done this, particularly various military SF.

Basically, if you have to take all the magic that is at the core of the story, all the FTL, and all the incomprehensible alien tech, and all the elements where the "soul" and "mind" are tied to magic gems and happiness and the like (not a result of physical and chemical processes in neurons but instead magic)... and you label that all "not really part of the story in spite of being core conceits of the story" then what remains is, indeed, medium-hard science fiction. However, if you take all the FTL teleporting and time-travelling dragons and psionics out of McCaffrey's Pern what you have left is also 'hard sci-fi'. And if you take all the bene-gesserit and future prediction and FTL travel and magic forcefields which turn into nukes if hit by lasers and the like out of Dune, you have a 'hard sci-fi' book. And if you take all the capsaicin out of chili peppers then the peppers aren't spicy. By this sort of metric we can easily place /anything/ as hard science fiction, by deciding that the stuff that is soft doesn't count.

This is a fundamentally unhelpful way to think about things. Stories are not defined as sciency because everyone obeys the universal laws of gravitation and because nobody violates the laws of thermodynamics; they are defined as /not sciency/ by the presence of not-sciency elements, not by the addition of sciency elements. Almost all elements of almost all stories will always follow science because science matches up to inherent expectations of the universe - 95%+ of stories involve humans that obey the rules of chemistry and biology, for example, but the fact that the humans have the Krebs cycle occuring in all their cells and stuff gets you no credit at all when you have the humans in question use soul-based magic to travel back in time to do a groundhog day scenario to attempt to rescue their friend from a magic immortal alien ferret's machinations.

Hardness of science fiction cannot be logically assessed or measured by presence of science-based stuff because 99%+ of all background stuff in all worlds is science based; only the /absence/ of science-violating stuff makes sense as a metric.
