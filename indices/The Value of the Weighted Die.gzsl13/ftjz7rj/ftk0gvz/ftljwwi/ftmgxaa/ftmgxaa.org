Language isn't math. Grammatical rules don't represent truths of reality, they're just how we try to describe and lend consistency to this hodgepodge of symbols that emerged organically from human interactions as a communication tool. Grammatical errors can be distracting, or in some cases make a work more difficult to understand, but they don't make a work /non-rational/ in and of themselves.
