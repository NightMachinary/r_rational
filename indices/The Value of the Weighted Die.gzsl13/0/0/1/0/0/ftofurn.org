As someone who was once accused of being an Eliezer alt for writing an omake, I'm /very/ sceptical of Eliezer being Groon (the author of The Erogamer).

A year before Groon started The Erogamer, they wrote [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/taylor-hebert-harem-protagonist.26134/][Taylor Hebert: Harem Protagonist]]. It's pretty clearly a first draft of the later work in terms of its premise, and also pretty difficult to see as an intermediate step between HPMOR and the Erogamer, in terms of its writing quality.

I've yet to see any evidence presented for the two authors being the same person beyond the existence of readers who enjoyed both of their works.
