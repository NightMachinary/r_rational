It's crude, uncultured, aggressive, and /rude/. And the way you convey crude, uncultured, and rude in English, especially if you're also conveying aggressive, is frequent swearing. Frequent /mild/ swearing is totally sufficient; as I said, including "dammit" into every other sentence is a pretty good translation. I'm more of a linguist than an actual manga fan, so I don't have a great handle on how rude he is beyond that; at a guess, frequent stronger profanity would be overdoing it, and the appropriate level of profanity is roughly "Jayne Cobb". (Hinata, obviously, should be at the level of Simon Tam.)
