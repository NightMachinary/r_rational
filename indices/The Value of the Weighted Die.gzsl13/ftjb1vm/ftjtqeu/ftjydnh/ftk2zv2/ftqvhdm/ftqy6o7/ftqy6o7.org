  And nobody says "crap" anymore

I don't believe this is true. If there was ever a difference in severity between 'crap' and 'shit' it's gone, but I don't think I ever noticed that difference to exist, and I think I and most people I know use them about the same amount.

Something some of my friends do - and it may be coincidence but they are all fairly weeb-ish - is to use "Heck." (no exclamation point; said very mildly), as their go-to expression of 'this is unpleasant".
