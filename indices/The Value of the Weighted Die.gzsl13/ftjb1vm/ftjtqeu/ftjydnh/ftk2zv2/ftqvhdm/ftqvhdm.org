I kinda feel like profanity just works so differently between English and Japanese that it's hard to translate. Japanese has politeness levels built in. English tries to be egalitarian but there's still a bunch of class-signally culture influencing the language, so the only difference between mild and strong profanity in English is whether or not you have to bleep it on Comedy Central. Naruto's "CHIKUSHOOO!"s are troublesome because Anglophone culture is only just beginning to admit that children can hear cartoon children shouting "FUUUUUCK!" without turning into criminals, and a big "DAAAMN!" doesn't really work (other than the 1990 Ninja Turtles ... I'm confused that they got away with that).

It's annoying. "Kuso!" is used more or less exactly like swearing in English... except that, until very recently, it was totally acceptable for children's anime, but "dammit!" is not allowed in the same capacity in the Anglosphere. This probably resolves itself as soon as Millennials usurp the 20th century censors.

What is mild swearing for adults is utterly forbidden for Naruto's target audience, in English. Whereas in Japanese, it's just understood that everyone knows not to swear like a ninja to one's elders, so there's not as much panic over children hearing the words. The closest thing English has/had to legit mild profanity is/was "crap", which was one of those words you could sneak in once or twice only for the censors to get lots of angry phonecalls and remove it on reruns. And nobody says "crap" anymore. It's kinda frustrating because now people go from 0 to "shit" with no in-between, but I digress.

So yes, Naruto is the sort of character who wouldn't give a crap about whether or not Anglophone Soccer Moms would approve of his language. But the censors are downstream of culture. So what can you do?

(You translate Japanese kid-friendly "dammit!"s to "crap it!". It will be hilarious and the censors will let it through, for approximately the week before kids start saying it all the time and their parents complain, because we still refuse to formalize the "don't talk like that around your parents / teachers / employers" thing, and instead go with the "NEVER EVER IT IS BAD!" rule. Of course, the last time politeness levels were imported, we lost a whole pronoun. ... I miss "thou" and I wasn't even around when it was.)
