  If something has been done a dozen times before, there's no point in showing it to the reader yet again. In fanfiction this is an even more urgent problem. If a canon event has to happen for plot reasons, but it isn't being done really amazingly differently, then show only the part that is amazing. Better yet, just have the viewpoint character remember the whole thing afterward for two paragraphs. Don't write it out in a whole chapter.

How I wish I could put this up as a banner in the Worm section of the SB/SV forums. It's honestly gotten to the point where I have to wonder if they do it just feel better about their word count, or if a lot of these writers are genuinely scared of doing anything else that isn't retreading canon with a different flavoring. Anyone familiar with Worm fanfics probably already knows what scenes and events I'm talking about that have been done ad nauseum.

Also, it's a bit funny how much thought went into this fic's bell test, and yet you have stuff like this in it:

  Hinata looked over it with her byakugan. “It---it's real, at least. It's not any kind of motherfucking genjutsu illusion,”

I'm not one of those people that thinks no one should swear ever, and I understand that kids and teens irl swear a lot, but it still feels kind of weird to read Naruto and Hinata saying fuck. Not to say their entire characterization is undermined by a couple swear words, just that it doesn't bode well when the original character doesn't do it much or at all.

I haven't read The Waves Arisen (yet) so maybe there's some sort of justification for it, might as well give it a shot since it seems like an interesting take at least.

  doing original stuff should be understood in terms of a change in character or circumstance that causes optimizing characters to impose new meanings on a scene and does not mean using nuclear weapons to win fights from canon

Ah yes I, too, read Shinobi: The RPG.
