There's actually a worm fic I really like called I Need Some Space where the author skips past all the boring stations of canon parts, up until Taylor can't go hang out with the Undersiders after the bank heist, so they get captured by Bakuda and fucking murdered and Taylor, horrified, essentially gets pushed into the Wards in the same parole situation SS was in. Because SS also fucking died, because of course she did the girl tried to save some civilians from Bakuda and had some bad timing and was an unbalanced child soldier fighting someone way out of her league who wasn't disarmed by the MC beforehand.
