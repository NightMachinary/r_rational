Wait... what?

I never heard any speculation that you wrote it.

To be honest, if you wrote it then I'm /disappointed/. I thought there were TWO great writers out there (I've read and loved several of your works, and of course I very much loved /The Waves Arisen/); if you wrote it then that's one fewer excellent writer of this sort of fiction.

But I have no idea why, if you did write it under a pen name, you would want to keep the identities separate. Ah well... not really my business -- that's for you and Wertifloke to worry about.
