I've been fervently reassured I didn't need to be familliar with anything /Naruto/ to read /The Waves Arisen/, so when I did, I harbored for a bit a certain sense of betrayal... Because yes, the story's amazing and the important parts are very enjoyable even without context, but the story also keeps doing really frustrating things like name-dropping things and acting like they'll be explained later or like the reader's supposed to already know what they are (the ninja-police) and not explaining them at all, or even worse, mentioning things like that once and then never again (the ninja-dogs).

So, future readers, consider yourself warned: you might want to keep open Narutopedia at hand :)
