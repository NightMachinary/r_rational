That may be how /your/ language works. Real mastery comes when you realise that language /is/ math, grammar /does/ reflect the structure of the human brain, and in particular, the English language, as developed up until roughly September 1992, is the Correct language derivable from quantum field theory. In particular the "die/dice" distinction comes from the mass of the charm quark. If it were a little higher it would be "die/dise", a little lower, "die/dies". To get the plural to be the same as the singular, however, you would have to go into regions of parameter space far removed from what's survivable for humans.
