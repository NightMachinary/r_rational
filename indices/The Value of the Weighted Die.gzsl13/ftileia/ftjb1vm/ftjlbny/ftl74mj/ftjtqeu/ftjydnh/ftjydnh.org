  Honestly any fanfic that doesn't have Naruto swearing regularly is translating from Japanese poorly. Maybe he should just be adding "dammit" to every other sentence, but there is no reasonable way to translate the 'dattebayo' verbal tic that doesn't involve frequent mild-or-stronger profanity.

Erh, no, not really? at least from what I remember from when I used to care about Naruto, dattebayo doesn't really mean anything, it's just a way to denote how crude and uncultured his way of speaking is. It's not one of those things that translate directly into English, so for such cases it's best to give the character a slight accent, or have them use simpler words than the rest of the cast. Having them constantly swearing can detract a lot from the story too, it can shift the focus away from what is important or even be a way to flanderize a character. If you've read Worm and then fanfics you'll probably notice that Shadow Stalker is always portrayed as someone who swears like a sailor, she doesn't really do that to that level in canon, her violence is often described and portrayed as physical. Same with Cockblocker who is always screaming Bullshit, when he said it like once in canon.

This all might come across as nitpicky, mostly because it is, but even these small things often serve as a flag for the quality of what you're reading. Although in this very specific case (The Waves Arisen) the point is moot because the swearing was added by the OP and wasn't on the writing itself. Still, you can see the negative effects just by way of us discussing this instead of what OP was proposing and would have preferred us discussing.

F-bombs are best left saved for the moments that truly deserve it, imo.

  Have you read El-Ahrairah? It solidly avoids this. Mainly by Switching Taylor to a Thinker (same shard, different aspect) and then dealing with the consequences of Contessa reacting to her existence, but it deliberately stays far afield even given that. That and Something Completely Different (light-hearted by Worm standards fic about a transhumanist SI who is a Tinker whose specialty is working with corpses) are my favorites by far. (Though as I am a vocal disliker of the original my opinions possibly should be discounted, I admit.)

I have, I also read my fair share of wormfics some years ago until I got sick of it, sadly the fics with decent writing are a minority. In retrospective it's kinda funny that for all of the flack that the Memorial trilogy (Cenotaph/Wake/Legacy) constantly gets the vast majority of fics don't compare or even come close. That for every /Weaver Nine/, /Copacetic/ or /Loaf/ you get like thirty lazy Alt-Powers that start with Taylor triggering in the locker, fighting Lung, meeting Lisa in the Boardwalk, The Bank, and then dying before or during the Leviathan fight. There is no creativity, little to no desire to expand or invent something new, and from my experience from trailing these accursed forums, SB is mostly to blame. You can see why I moved on lmao, it's just more fun to read other webfics or pick an actual book once in a while.
