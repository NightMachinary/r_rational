.. The worm fanfic I want to read at this point is the one where Taylor gets a shard that fails at making her want to escalate /everything/ -

What ever process the shards use to make their victims seek out conflicts at all costs is not flawless, or there would be no rogues, and a story following someone capable of noticing that all the other powered people are just.. insane.. would be interesting.
