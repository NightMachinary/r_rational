That's fair, a damn/dammit would indeed be way more appropriate and inline with the character. It wouldn't be my first choice as a writer, but I can see it as some sort of endearing quirk like the original 'dattebayo' is (or is supposed to be).

  I'm more of a linguist than an actual manga fan, so I don't have a great handle on how rude he is beyond that; at a guess, frequent stronger profanity would be overdoing it

I don't think canon Naruto's rudeness goes beyond his dattebayo or the occasional chikushou whenever something goes wrong, and even then his character isn't a mean-spirited one (in social interactions). Remember that his whole dream about being hokage is more about being accepted by his village than about the power of ruling over them.
