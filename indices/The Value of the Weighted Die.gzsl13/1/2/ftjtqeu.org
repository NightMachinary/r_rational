Honestly any fanfic that doesn't have Naruto swearing regularly is translating from Japanese poorly. Maybe he should just be adding "dammit" to every other sentence, but there is no reasonable way to translate the 'dattebayo' verbal tic that doesn't involve frequent mild-or-stronger profanity. (Though you'd be right for Hinata.)

Have you read [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/][El-Ahrairah]]? It solidly avoids this. Mainly by Switching Taylor to a Thinker (same shard, different aspect) and then dealing with the consequences of Contessa reacting to her existence, but it deliberately stays far afield even given that. That and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/something-completely-different-worm-tinker-si-original-city.25042/][Something Completely Different]] (light-hearted by Worm standards fic about a transhumanist SI who is a Tinker whose specialty is working with corpses) are my favorites by far. (Though as I am a vocal disliker of the original my opinions possibly should be discounted, I admit.)
