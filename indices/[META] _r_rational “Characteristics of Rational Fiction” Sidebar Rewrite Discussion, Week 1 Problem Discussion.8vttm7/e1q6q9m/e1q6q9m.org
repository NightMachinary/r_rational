The most useful portion of the survey thrown together last week was the one-word description portion that asked for people to check as many boxes as they'd like to fill in what they thought should be on the subreddit.

(I didn't put it in the OP due to botched methodology, but if you'd like to see the rest of the results of the survey you can find links [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8vtsyb/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational][in the companion thread]]).
