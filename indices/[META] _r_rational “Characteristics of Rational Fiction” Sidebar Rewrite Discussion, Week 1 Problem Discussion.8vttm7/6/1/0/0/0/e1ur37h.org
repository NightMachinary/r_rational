I agree with all of that. I think the person you were to replying to was saying that with the current definition you can always argue that a work you don't like isn't rational because the price of beer was 1.5 times higher than it should be in the local tavern.

That's not necessarily a point I agree with, btw (finding a definition that is impossible to misuse is way outside the scope of what we're trying to do here and also quite likely impossible), I was just trying to clarify the argument.
