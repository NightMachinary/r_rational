What I am saying is more like, we usually don't judge a movie on how good it is based on a small error like that. Which I think was the point of the previous poster's opinion.

I'm not saying things like that shouldn't be noted, but just that quality of work isn't usually directly tied to something like that.

However, it is a question of degrees, if a theoretical movie, like the Machinist, had 1000 such errors, well, that would probably drive someone mad and greatly detract from the quality of the movie and the enjoyment of it.

But the original post did mention a few such errors, rather than some great quantity of them. Although I do recognize that for some people some small error like that could jump out at them very strongly and still ruin or greatly detract from a movie.
