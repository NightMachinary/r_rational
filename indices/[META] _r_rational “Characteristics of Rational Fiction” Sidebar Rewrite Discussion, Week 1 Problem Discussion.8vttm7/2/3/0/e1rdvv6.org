Unless my story is Batman, the irrational character doesn't belong to me!

But I found it interesting how you used the phrase "recover" when the idea of an irrational character is introduced. People being stupid isn't irrational if it fits their character. A farmer suddenly working at a bank will still be considered ignorant after a year's experience when compared to the veteran. That is still in the realms of rationality.

A veteran banker who knows the ins and out, have them hold the idiot ball, /that/ is the irrational part that puts me off, not stupid characters.
