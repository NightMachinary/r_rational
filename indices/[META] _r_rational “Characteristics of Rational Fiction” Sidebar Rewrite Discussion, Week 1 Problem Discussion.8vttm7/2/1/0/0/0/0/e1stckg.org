  That's in the category of simply bad writing at this stage. It's been said many times that coincidences shouldn't solve problems (but can start them). The final baddie getting nerfed without action from the main character (or previous characterizations) would feel cheap. This applies to all genres.

True. I do think that less extreme versions of my example appear more commonly in non-rational fiction than in the rational ones, but not because it /is/ unlikely, but rather because it /feels/ arbitrary.

Maybe a better example to show the disconnect would go in the other direction: The protagonist has a clever idea to solve a problem, using the resources that are available to them, with the writer setting up everything well in advance. I'm not talking about some crazy, convoluted scheme, but your good, old, two-step plan. However, a critical, unpredictable misfortune forces them to adapt.

I do not think that throwing obstacles in the form of 'bad luck' in front of the protagonist is necessarily bad writing. Also, it can certainly be realistic; things go wrong without good reason all the time. However, I believe it would not be rational.
