  Would it be realistic for Voldemort to forget a rune and have his ritual blow up right before his final battle? Sure, mistakes happen and inconvenient timing is not actually that improbable. But it isn't rational, is it?

That's in the category of simply bad writing at this stage. It's been said many times that coincidences shouldn't solve problems (but can start them). The final baddie getting nerfed without action from the main character (or previous characterizations) would feel cheap. This applies to all genres.

We may disagree on how we define rational fiction, but the thing we seem to both be saying is that we don't want to step away from a moment in a story and say, "Hmm...really?"

How quickly we disconnect from a story depends on our tolerance level with each piece of work. Hence my original post stating that some may accept an 80% rational novel, while someone else might disconnect even sooner.
