Main goal as I see it (feel free to suggest another):

The definition provides a standard that allows the users of the community to know what stories and discussions are rational. Using the standard to decide how to upvote, the community can grow while remaining focused on producing rational stories.

Characteristics of a ideal definition, while recognizing that perfect is impossible (feel free to suggest more, or suggest ignoring some):

- Allows for growth of the community

  - Doesn't drive away newcomers that would otherwise be a good fit here
  - Is not so specific that growth is curtailed unnecessarily
  - Is not so strict that nobody can write to it, or nobody feels confident writing to it
  - Isn't used like a stick to hit people with, driving away parts of the community

- Keeps quality of content high

  - Is not so vague that non-rational stories dominate and drive down quality
  - Isn't so permissive that crap rational stories become the norm
  - Doesn't allow another genre to step in and take over
  - Is totally used like a stick to drive away bad parts of the community

- Is easily and immediately understood.

  - Can't be too long (should fit in the sidebar, should be finishable)
  - Should be easy to parse
  - Shouldn't have multiple meanings

- Can be applied to stories already written

  - Stories not specifically written to be rational can still be judged
  - How to make a story more rational would be obvious

- Can be used to guide new writing

  - Isn't overwhelming to authors that would produce stories of sufficient quality
  - Gives people ideas

- Cleaves reality at the joints

  - using the definition, rational and non-rational examples are distinct
  - most users agree where a given story falls
  - even if two stories are both rational or not rational, one can tell which story is /more/ rational

--------------

I think the main trade off is between keeping content quality high and allowing for growth. In a glut of content, the definition would push the highest quality to the front. In a dearth, the definition would permit enough volume that growth is encouraged.

I'll note that, from my perspective, the community is currently growing too slowly and I perceive a high standard of quality that makes it intimidating to post here. I don't think that's the result of the sidebar, but just the fact that many people here are discerning and intelligent.

I wonder if it's possible write a definition that causes the community to grow to 100,000 readers and the average quality of the stories to be 10x? It's a hard thing to wonder without proposing solutions. It might be impossible.

Would any of us still be here if the community were ten times as popular with ten times the quality? I'd probably no longer post, but I'd certainly enjoy the content and subscribe.

Also, this description of an ideal definition is longer than I'd expect the definition to be.
