Perhaps it would be useful to distinguish between "rational" the genre (which "A Lady Awakened" could go in) and "rational" the subreddit, which is primarily web-published serials about fantasy deconstructions. In that case, it could still be good for us to define the genre, and then limit the subreddit to the intersection of the genre and "web-published serials about fantasy."
