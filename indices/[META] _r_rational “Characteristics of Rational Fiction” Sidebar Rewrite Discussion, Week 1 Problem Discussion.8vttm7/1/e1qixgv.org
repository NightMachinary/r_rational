What do we do with professionally-published works? Especially ones that are realistic or historical fiction?

Celia Grant's "[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553593838][A Lady Awakened]]" is a historical romance with a level-headed protagonist. The characters seem about as [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 intelligent]] as the characters in the works that get frequently posted here.

Even though the characters are mostly rational, I wouldn't expect books like "A Lady Awakened" to be a particularly popular among the subreddit. Maybe a romance novel would be interesting as a one-off. But in practice, there's a big filter on genre (historical romance vs. fantasy deconstruction) and publication format (book vs web-serial).

This leads to a disconnect.

If we add "... web-published serials about fantasy deconstructions" to the sidebar, we've lost a core idea.

If we don't add that, then we're not really filtering on "is rationalist" but "is interesting to the sub." And, in the latter case, who cares about the precise definition we put on the right hand side?
