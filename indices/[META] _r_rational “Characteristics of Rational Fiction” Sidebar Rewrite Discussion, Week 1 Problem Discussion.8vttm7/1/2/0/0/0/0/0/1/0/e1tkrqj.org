If there is no practical way to do so they don't. If the choice is between:

1. A world in which both people that can't afford to pay for books and people that can afford to pay but don't want to have access to torrents.
2. A world in which neither of those groups have access to torrents.

Then a good consequential does some reasoning and decides whether the gained utility from providing access to books to the people that can't pay for them is worth the lost utility from writers not getting paid for their work (and there thus being less full time writers and less high quality books).

I think that the group of people that cannot afford to pay â‚¬5,- for an ebook is small enough that the balance tips in favor of having more full time writers.
