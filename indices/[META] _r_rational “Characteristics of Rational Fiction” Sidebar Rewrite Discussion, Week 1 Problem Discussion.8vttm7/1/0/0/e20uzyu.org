Pride and Prejudice wouldn't actually take all that much work to turn into rational fiction (per my own sense of the genre). The plot is more or less fine, the characters are more or less fine, all you'd really need to change is the internal narration, and then make tweaks to the characters to fit. It's already a book that's about social expectations, conflicts of values, updating based on new information, etc., I mostly think that it's the lens that would make most of us say "nope, not rational fiction", rather than the genre or plot.

(Granted, this subreddit definitely has its preferences in terms of genre and plot, but I don't at all think that love stories and regency dramas would be instantly discounted, so long as they took the right form.)
