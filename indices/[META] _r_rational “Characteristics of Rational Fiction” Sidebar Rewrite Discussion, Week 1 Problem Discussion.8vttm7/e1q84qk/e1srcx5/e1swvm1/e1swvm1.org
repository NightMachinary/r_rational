I think my contention would be that classification gets problematic when you start talking about events or characters, rather than the prose itself.

Imagine a story about a detective that talks to a lot of people about a case he's trying to solve, but whose internal thoughts are almost entirely opaque to us, or only very vaguely guessable by the questions that he asks and the actions that he takes. When you get to the end of the work, the detective says "Ah ha! I've got it!" and then explains how he arrived at the solution.

Now imagine that /same/ story, with all the same dialogue and plot beats, but we follow the detective's line of thinking the entire way through, and when he says "Ah ha! I've got it!", that's the product of all the thought that you've seen on display across the pages.

I don't think that I would put forth that the first example ought to be outright disqualified, but the second definitely seems like more what we mean when we use the RT tag.

(Obviously you could turn the second story into the first, but you couldn't necessarily turn the first story into the second, because it might be that the plot beats, characterization, etc. weren't written the way they were because of honest attempts at writing internal thoughts, and instead were more motivated by the author wanting to conceal things from the reader for that "Ah ha!" moment at the end. And there would be some obvious problems with pacing and narrative structure in moving between the two, so I'm not saying that it would be a good idea.)

As far as this goes toward answering your question ... I can imagine someone working really hard on a hard science fiction transhumanist setting, and then writing a novel set there which was nothing more than petty drama between characters. I can imagine that would go over with the audience on this subreddit fairly well, in part due to genre preferences, and in part due to the value placed on worldbuilding, but it's not what I would classify as rational fiction if the work and thought that went into the setting is all background to an actual text that has none of that thought on display, except, perhaps, by inference.
