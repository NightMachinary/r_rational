In previous discussions like these, I've heard people talk about Yudkowsky's definition of [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][level 1 intelligent characters]] as, while maybe not an underpinning foundation, almost ubiquitous in rational fiction.

I think that what you describe, of rational fiction being a type of story built to express and display thought, meshes well with this. A level 1 intelligent character is one that we can imagine thinking from their own viewpoint with their own goals and fears and biases, and a story full of level 1 intelligent characters is one where you can, if you look, see thought behind every action.

To continue this and interlock with the noted fondness for worldbuilding here, a world with deep and thorough worldbuilding is one where you can see thought behind every detail, though in this case the thoughts of the author more than the thoughts of the people relevant to the detail in-setting.

It also helps to bridge the gap between 'traditional' ratfics and stories like UNSONG, which are enjoyed here despite, well, controversial opinions on its rational-ness.

The question I would ask to challenge this idea, I think, is whether or not it is too broad a definition to be meaningful. It appears, to me, to do a good job encompassing a common thread between all rationalfics, but does it also include within its domain stories that are decidedly /not/ rationalfics? If so, what stipulations would we have to add to tighten the boundaries?
