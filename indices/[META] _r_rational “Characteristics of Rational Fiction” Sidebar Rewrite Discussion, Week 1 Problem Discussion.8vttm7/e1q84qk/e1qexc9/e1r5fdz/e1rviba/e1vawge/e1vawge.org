I don't think that we should craft a definition that intentionally excludes them, but I think a True Definition will exclude most of them without actually having to try, because I don't think they're usually what we mean when we say "rational fiction", in the same way that I think "realist" works wouldn't be what we mean either.

I do enjoy Agatha Christie, but her books really don't seem to use the same part of the brain as other works that are definitively within the canon of accepted rational fiction. They don't produce the same feelings when read, I guess, at least for me. I'd be interested to know if other peoples' experience differs, beyond the categorical/definitional question.
