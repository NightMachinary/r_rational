  The question I would ask to challenge this idea, I think, is whether or not it is too broad a definition to be meaningful. It appears, to me, to do a good job encompassing a common thread between all rationalfics, but does it also include within its domain stories that are decidedly not rationalfics? If so, what stipulations would we have to add to tighten the boundaries?

I think that some amount of false positives and false negatives are inevitable, but it's going to depend a lot on wording, and interpretation of that wording, and interpretation of the works themselves.

So far as I'm concerned, here are the big categorical problem areas:

- Author tracts espousing a particular philosophy or issue position, especially when done Socratically
- Historical (or other "realist") fiction
- Sherlock Holmes
- Works with good worldbuilding which mostly sits in the background of the actual plot and characters
- Works with inconsistent levels of RT
- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit][Fair-Play Whodunnits]]

(Note that these are just the areas I think are definitionally thorny.)

If we define RT as being (primarily) about form, rather than subject matter, plot, or characters directly, we can make a better sliding scale, I think. Most stuff in the mystery genre gets excluded, because most are about the accumulation of information and evidence, rather than the application of thought to the problem - though there's allowance for specific works which /are/ about that. Intelligent characters who solve things with their intelligence without that intelligence actually being displayed or followed (Reed Richards, Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes) get cut out, regardless of how plausible or rule-following that off-camera intelligence might be.
