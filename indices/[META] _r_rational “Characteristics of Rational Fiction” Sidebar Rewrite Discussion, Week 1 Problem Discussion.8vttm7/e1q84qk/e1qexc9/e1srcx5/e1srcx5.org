I think this is an intriguing way to classify many common problems. I have difficulties coming up with problematic examples.

What about stories that focus not on individual characters but rather on entire societies? Say, a story that shows (through various protagonists) a society evolving (in a consistent, well thought-out fashion) towards a transhumanistic ideal? Not a lot of thinking to be had there (some key-decisions maybe, but I am thinking of the large-scale stuff being more central).
