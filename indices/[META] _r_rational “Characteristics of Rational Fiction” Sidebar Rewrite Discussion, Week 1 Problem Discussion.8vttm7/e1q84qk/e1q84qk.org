If you want the skinny on *Narrativism vs. Simulationism*, [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9AfeqVGDHDY5ldctk444LNCt4V33ffl2DWCqQo7zLc/edit?usp=sharing][this is my write-up]]. I don't actually think that this is important to the discussion at hand, since it's about the process that an author uses to construct a work, rather than the work itself, but you might disagree.

--------------

In film theory, realism is about the showing of 'truth', attempting to display something that is objective and real. To this end, realist film-making will hide away as many aspects of unreality as possible, going so far as to maintain steady shots with few cuts and place the camera at eye-level, so that the viewer can better see the scene as it would be seen by a person actually in that world. There aren't many great examples of this in its more-pure form, but many films fall on the "more realist" side of the spectrum.

Contrasting that, formalism does away with attempts at objectivity, instead presenting the world as the filmmaker sees it, intending to make full use of the form rather than simply limiting themselves to reality per se. They use costumes and sets that are meant to evoke and delight rather than to be in any way realistic. Good examples would be the oeuvre of Wes Anderson, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Amelie, and many others.

(Sitting between the two is classicism, which we're going to ignore, because it's basically just the mid-point of the spectrum.)

By plain reading, you might think that RT is just another term for a prose version of realism. After all, isn't what RT authors are trying to do to make their worlds closer to how worlds actually are, even (or especially) if they include some speculative elements? I tend to hear this a lot.

My own opinion is that RT is really more of a parallel to formalism ... but the thing that it's usually trying to express is */thought/*, which ends up putting it in realist clothing. If the story is about thought, then the world can't be inconsistent, both because the reader will be primed for a higher awareness of the world and its workings, and because those workings will likely end up central to the plot.

To get at this distinction a bit, I would consider a story like Jason Shiga's [[http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php][Fleep]] to fall under the umbrella of RT, while still being highly formalist in not just style, but plot as well. (Fleep was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2eld3m/fleep_a_man_wakes_in_a_strange_phone_booth/][previously posted to the subreddit]], to very positive response.)

If this axis of inspection is mostly correct, it would explain away a lot of intuitions people have about the RT tag. Competence is common, because you don't tend to get good demonstration of or expression of thought from incompetent people. Heightened intelligence is common for the same reason. Munchkinry /is/ demonstration of thought - and I think that we can agree that munchkinry which skipped showing the work wouldn't qualify for RT.

I don't really know how this might add up to a solution for the sidebar, but it's sort of my starting point for thinking about the problem, as far as what the underpinning is.
