Hypothesis: there's a potential superstimulus that one could create for this “formalism of thought,” such that the resulting work would delight the members of this community, even though it was objectively bad by any other measure of fiction. Something that might be described as “ASMR video: the inside of someone's head when working out a difficult problem.”

It might be important to distinguish whether the community cares “what's good for it” (i.e. cares about its RT fiction being /good fiction/), or whether we're just here to suck the thinky juices out of works, whatever their quality.

By analogy to non-fiction prose: the Sequences, SSC blog posts, etc. are “rationalist prose”---but what percentage of people here read them to grow/discuss/etc.; and what percentage just read them as a communally-anointed font of insight porn?

If there are large numbers of both groups, it might be better to serve their needs separately, rather than to ask what we all, collectively, want.
