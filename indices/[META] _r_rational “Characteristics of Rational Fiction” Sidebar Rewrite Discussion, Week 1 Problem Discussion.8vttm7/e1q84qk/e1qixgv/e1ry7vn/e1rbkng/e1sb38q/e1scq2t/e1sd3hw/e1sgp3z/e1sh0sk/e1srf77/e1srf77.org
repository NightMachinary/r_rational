That's a very individualist moral perspective, and you're going to run into a lot of utilitarians here.

Utilitarianism assigns moral weight to someone's actions not just on what they do or what consequences that they intend, but also upon unintended consequences that should have been foreseeable (and willful ignorance is generally not a valid defense, as a foreseeable consequence of that is unforeseen consequences to your actions).

For a utilitarian, posting a link ---knowing that, by doing so, you'll be enabling others, who would not have otherwise committed a moral failing, to do so --- can /absolutely/ be a moral failing in itself.

And, again, although I haven't conducted a survey, I'll make an educated guess and say there are probably more utilitarians than individualists here.
