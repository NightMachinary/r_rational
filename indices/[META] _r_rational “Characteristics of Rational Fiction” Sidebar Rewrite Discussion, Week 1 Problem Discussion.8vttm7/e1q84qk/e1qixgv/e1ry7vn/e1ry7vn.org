I would not be against more talk about published works that happen to be rational on this subreddit (or even talking about what parts of such works are rational, as already occasionally happens). I would expect these sort of things to be eclipsed by talk about web serials, mostly because those stories receive updates much more often, but I don't see a reason to exclude them a-priori.

Different genres is a more interesting problem, because I agree with your assessment that historical romance novels are unlikely to be interesting to a majority of the people on this subreddit. I think it's probably still better to not exclude those a-priori either. Just leave it as a known distinction between theory and practice; stories from other genres are absolutely welcome, they'll just stand out a bit as a-typical against all the fantasy/sci-fi stories.

And hey, maybe at some point [[/u/AlexanderWales]] writes a rational Pride and Prejudice fanfic that becomes so popular that in a year or two the entire subreddit is dedicated to rational historical romance novels. I'd be ok with that.
