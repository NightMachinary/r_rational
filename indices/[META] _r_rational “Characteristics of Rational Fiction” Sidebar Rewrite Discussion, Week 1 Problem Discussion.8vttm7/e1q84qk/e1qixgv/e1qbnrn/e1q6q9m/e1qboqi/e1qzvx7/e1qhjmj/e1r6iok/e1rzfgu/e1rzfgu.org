I think this is incredibly important if we want the community to grow, but it also raises an interesting question; should we try to get more posts on the subreddit that are about writing resources (like the [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing][Optimize Literally Everything]] guide) and/or specifically talk about topics involving writing, rather than reading, rational stories (like the Wednesday worldbuilding threads)?

I don't have a good answer and it's more about what we want to see on this subreddit, rather than what a rational story is, but I think it's something we should consider if we are going to rewrite the sidebar.

  Also, this description of an ideal definition is longer than I'd expect the definition to be.

This is not surprising, given that one of the things the definition needs to be optimized for is brevity.
