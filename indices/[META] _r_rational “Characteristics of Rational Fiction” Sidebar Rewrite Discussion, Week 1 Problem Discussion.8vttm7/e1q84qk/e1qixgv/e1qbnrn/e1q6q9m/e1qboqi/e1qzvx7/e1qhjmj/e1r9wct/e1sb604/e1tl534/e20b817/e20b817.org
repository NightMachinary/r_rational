I think this line would be comparable to this: Let's say your favorite movie is The Machinist, for the sake of argument. Great movie, in your opinion. But someone else is like, "Well, at some point, he was wearing shoes, and then in the next scene, in the same place and time, he wasn't wearing shoes. So it is a bad movie."

I think that the "basically dismiss a story as not being rational simply because it isn't fully consistent on a couple of points." is referring to an example like that, but in literary form.

At least that was how I saw it.
