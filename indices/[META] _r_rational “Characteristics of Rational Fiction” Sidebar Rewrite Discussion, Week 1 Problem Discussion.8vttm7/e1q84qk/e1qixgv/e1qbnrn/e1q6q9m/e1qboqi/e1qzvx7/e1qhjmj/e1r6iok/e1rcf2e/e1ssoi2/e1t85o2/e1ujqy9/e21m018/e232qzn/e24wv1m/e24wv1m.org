*Can rational fiction be reduced to a binary yes/no, or should it be a continuum?

I feel like this question elides the actual answer, which is that rational fiction CAN be reduced to a binary/yes/no, but should be a continuum.

I don't see a lot of value in a binary yes/no check for what stories are considered 'rational'. Rather I'd like to use it like we use 'noir' or 'cyberpunk' when we talk about fiction. It is a tag, if you've liked other things with this tag you might like this (because it was written by folks who liked other things with that tag).

*How large a role does munchkinry play?

I think munchkinry (that is, a character and the readers are given the rules of the story, then uses technicalities in them to achieve something) is to rational stories as dames smoking cigarettes and gravelly voiced dudes with guns are to noir.

That is, it isn't necessary or sufficient, but is a beloved staple of the genre.

In passing, I'd mention that munchkinry can destroy rationalist fiction if used improperly. The Hyperdrive Ram scene from Star Wars isn't bad as a scene, it is bad because it makes the setting (more) nonsensical. If munchkinry makes everyone who didn't munchkin an idiot (that is, it doesn't require some component everyone else lacks) then it strips the rational component from a story, in my view.

*Is there utility in distinguishing between narrativist and simulationist rational fiction?

I tend to use those terms when considering RPGs in the old GNS model of rpgs, from wherever that was from. Simulationist is the DM simulating the world, sandbox style, and letting the players run wild. Narrativist is the DM telling a story, with some player input, while Gamist is the DM challenging the players mastery of the system.

It seems obvious to me that all rationalist fiction, indeed all fiction, is narrativist, according to the above. You can't let the readers run around a sandbox, because they have no way to input to you what they want to do next. You can't challenge them as Gamists for similar reasons. The form of fiction (as opposed to RPGs) dictates a narrativist purpose.

*Is there utility in distinguishing between rational and rationalist fiction?

Maybe? Like I said above, I tend to think of such descriptors as tags. 'Rationalist' seems to be fixed at HPMOR and Luminosity. I could imagine adding another one to that set if I came upon another story where characters ruminated at length upon logical fallacies and pondered their own thoughts compulsively.

*What is the role that any solution itself should have? Should it be a guideline, or a set of rules to delete posts by?

A guideline, I think. The 'real' Rational Tag is the upvotes of the sub. 'Rational' fiction is stuff we upvote a lot (thus the overlap with 'Good' fiction.

If someone writes an awesome fic, and I never see it because they didn't post it here because of the text on the side of the page, then I feel like we are losing sight of the main goal.

Everyone post, Upvote will know his own!
