I think being too specific would be problematic because we might curtain the growth of the community by excluding valuable stories and authors.

Being too vague would be bad because too many stories would meet the definition, and regardless of how the community grows the stories wouldn't match what is desired.

Similarly, mistargeting the definition wouldn't cause the desired stories to appear.

I notice that the reason I want a good definition for rational stories is so that others will know how to write them and what qualifies (of things already written). I expect a good definition to make more rational stories available to me by growing the community, and a bad one to cause the community to dissolve into things I consider irrelevant, or into nothing at all.

I wonder: are our goals the same in choosing a definition? My goal being "This community thrives and produces content I enjoy." It's obvious we'd all like that, but for choosing a definition it matters that we make sure we are on the same page regarding the goal.

It could be that 'provides a succinct but not authoritative summary for newcomers' is all we need out of the definition, if our goal is reduced to just allowing people to know if they'll like the content here. That goal is reasonable for the sidebar.
