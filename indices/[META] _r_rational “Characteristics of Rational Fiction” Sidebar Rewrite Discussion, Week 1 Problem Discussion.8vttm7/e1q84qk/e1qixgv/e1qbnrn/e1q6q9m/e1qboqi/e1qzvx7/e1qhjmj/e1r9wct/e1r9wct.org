I think this is one of the big weaknesses of the current sidebar definition; it's underspecific.

Many of these 'characteristics' are simply aspects of good writing, or broad statements about what values we place on stories without /actually/ being statements about values (which they ought to be, if that's what we're talking about). It would be very easy to write fiction which fits those characteristics, but isn't rational fiction as it would be recognized by readers of this subreddit, which is a good clue that the characteristics are a significant underfit. As one example, a large amount of historical fiction would qualify as rational fiction if you went by the sidebar, with only the third point possibly being disqualifying.

Moreover, it's very easy to circumvent these characteristics, and I've seen people use the arguments a number of times. We say that factions have to be driven into conflict by their differing beliefs and values, but then we say nothing about the complexity of those values, how much they're inspected by the story or known to the reader, etc. You could write the most morally simplistic tale in the world and justify the conflict as being because of beliefs and values rather than "good" and "evil": the antagonist values the suffering of others, that's his character sorted.

From my perspective, the closest that the sidebar gets to actually working is the third point, the "intelligent use of knowledge and resources to solve problems". In other words, problems aren't primarily solved by luck, or by unintelligent use of knowledge and resources. This does the most work to disqualify stories that don't fit the mold ... and I still think that it's underspecific, because "intelligent use" is far too weaselly, especially if that characteristic is going to be doing the heavy lifting.
