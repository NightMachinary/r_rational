I kinda wanna just explore those questions in the OP, since I have opinions!

- Can rational fiction be reduced to a binary yes/no, or should it be a continuum?

I think it's absolutely possible for it to be a binary yes/no, to a certain extent. I can easily imagine a rational fiction definition with archetypical titles that fit the definition perfectly. Especially if they are used as tools to define the genre. However, i think that a straight "no" gives a problem, where we are too easily excluding pieces of fiction that are almost rational, but not quite there (as examples, I'd give Zombie Knight and Ward, which are close enough to rational to trigger the same rational feelings when reading, but upon significant thought dont seem quite right)

- How large a role does munchkinry play?

I don't think munchkinry is essential to rational fiction, but i /do/ think that munchkinry is an important staple. i know that restrictiveness of definition was a concern in the prior topic, and id argue that a question like "does a story have munchkinry" would be far too exclusionary. especially since i think a holistic approach should be taken to judging stories, and it is far too easy to imagine a non-rational story with elements of munchkinry (indeed, irrational munchkinry is almost as common as rational munchkinry

- Is there utility in distinguishing between narrativist and simulationist rational fiction?

based on alexander wales's definition of these concepts in his write-up, the comparison seems almost perfectly analagous to rationality and rationalization. however, i dont think its impossible to do narrativism so well that it seems like simulationism, so just like with munchkinry it seems more like a staple than a core value.

- Is there utility in distinguishing between rational and rationalist fiction?

For this one, I think absolutely yes. rationalist fiction does just seem to be a completely different beast to rational fiction, and i think that a reader can feel the difference very easily. and i think that difference is important, since they almost function on different meta-levels. for me, rational fiction is generally stuff that i can zone out and enjoy without violating my suspension of disbelief, whereas ill intentionally engage with rationalist fiction, and i think that difference in attitude is enough for a distinction to be warranted.

- What is the role that any solution itself should have? Should it be a guideline, or a set of rules to delete posts by?

I don't like the idea of using rules to delete posts. i think the rules should be used to moderate tags, and thats it. so something like pokemon origin of species gets the rationalist tag, worth the candle gets a rational tag, zombie knight gets some sort of close-enough tag, and something that doesnt twig any of the rational indicators (ive been reading too much ratfic, cant even think of any non-rational web fiction) gets a non-rational tag. i think non-rational posts on this sub are few and far enough between that its not a big deal if we leave them up with a NR tag, so long as they dont get spammed (which should of course be grounds to delete a post)

and fwiw i think those 4 are a great set of tags to categorize things by, but i think that might be getting too close to suggesting a solution...sorry!
