To add my two cents: when I make posts, I never know if I'm overstepping the bounds of the subreddit. I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5v5f4i/i_feel_like_theres_a_lot_of_potential_for_a/?ref=share&ref_source=link][have]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7obnf7/fw_admin_message_from_god/?ref=share&ref_source=link][a]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8nmcqb/c_harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_ricktionality/?ref=share&ref_source=link][history]] of posting crack fics here that use rationalist tropes for humor. Based on the upvotes and the comments, those posts were all well-received, and I haven't gotten any angry moderator messages yet. I hope to post more in the future. Yet the rules of this subreddit say "post links to or discussion of rational fiction only," and my crack fics are most definitely /not/ rational according to any reasonable definition (they could be called "rational-adjacent"). I guess since I don't post too often, the moderators allow my posts by discretion. My question is: how do people feel about posts like mine that seriously bend or break the official rules of this subreddit? Are they okay as long as they don't take over? Should they be placed in a new weekly thread for rationalist-adjacent content? Once this meta-discussion of the definition of rationalist fiction is over, will there be a purge in which all posts like mine are instantly removed?
