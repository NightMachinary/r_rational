I don't think people should have cats /or/ dogs. It's kind of insulting that there are people starving while cats/dogs live like kings. I'd suggest adoption of humans with a similar level of financial responsibility being a thing but I can see the issues with incentivizing poverty and slavery by making that sort of thing legal.

I'm ok with people spending money on entertainment so as to remain productive but spending it on non-human living things while humans die is a bit /too/ callous and self-serving IMO. Surely something that's similarly entertainign can be found for less money and the other portion of the money can be donated towards mosquito nets or something?
