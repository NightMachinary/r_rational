I suspect that part of the reason for it to have been on the sidebar in the past is that it helps with the "if you give Frodo a lightsaber, you have to give Sauron a deathstar" thing. If you make Frodo rational, you have to make Sauron rational or else Frodo easily wins. Obviously, there are better ways to make it work besides making the antagonist evil, but it is a tool that many rational fics use (most notable, HPMOR).
