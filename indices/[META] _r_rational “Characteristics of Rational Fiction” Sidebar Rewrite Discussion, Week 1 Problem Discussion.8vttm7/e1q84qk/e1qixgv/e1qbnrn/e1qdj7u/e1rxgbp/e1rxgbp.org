Responding to two of your posts at the same time:

  How characters respond to irrationality can make the story even more rational.

and

  A veteran banker who knows the ins and out, have them hold the idiot ball, that is the irrational part that puts me off, not stupid characters.

I think there is a very important point here: the way we use the word rational when describing stories and the way we use it when describing people in the real world are different. (This is not unusual btw, just look at the Fantasy genre, if you take that name literally, /every/ story would fall into that genre).

Real world people very often act irrational, but they act irrational in realistic ways, not in ways that are convenient for the plot. Of course a rational story can include irrational characters (and almost all of them do), it should just make clear to the reader why the actions of that character are completely reasonable and utterly normal /from the perspective and worldview of that character/.

I think I disagree with you about the Joker, though. The irrationality of the Joker is not the common irrationality that real world people exhibit. The sum total of the Jokers characterization in the movie is that he "just wants to see the world burn". The story does not evoke empathy for the Joker in the way that it does for Two-Face or Ra's Al-Gul (both of whom could, with a little steelmanning, be perfectly valid antagonists for a rational story), it does not allow you to see the world from his perspective and understand why he is doing the things he is doing. We're just supposed to accept that some people are just evil, period.

That's what the current definition in the sidebar is (badly) arguing against and it is something that I think should be reflected in whatever new definition we come up with here.
