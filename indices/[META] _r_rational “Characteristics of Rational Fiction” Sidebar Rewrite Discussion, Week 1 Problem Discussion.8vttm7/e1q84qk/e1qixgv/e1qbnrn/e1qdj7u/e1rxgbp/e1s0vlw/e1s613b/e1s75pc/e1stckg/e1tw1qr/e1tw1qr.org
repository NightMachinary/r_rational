  I do not think that throwing obstacles in the form of 'bad luck' in front of the protagonist is necessarily bad writing. Also, it can certainly be realistic; things go wrong without good reason all the time. However, I believe it would not be rational.

The way I read this, you want victories for both the good guys and the bad guys to be earned (ie. be a direct consequence of their actions, rather than coming from a lucky break). Or conversely, all setbacks in a rational story, both for the good guys and the bad guys, are due to enemy action. Is this a fair summary of your position?

If so, how does that work for stories where the antagonist is non-anthropomorphic (like the rational zombie apocalypse story mentioned above), would those stories be disqualified by default?
