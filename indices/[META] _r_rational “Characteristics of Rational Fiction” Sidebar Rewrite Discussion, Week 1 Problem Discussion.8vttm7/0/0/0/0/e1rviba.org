I don't have any comments on your main point, but I would consider Fair-Play Whodunnits to be rational fiction or at least close enough to it that we shouldn't bother trying to craft our definition to exclude them.

The obvious caveat here is that I'm talking about a true Fair-Play Whodunnit, the TV-Tropes examples list is, as per usual, largely filled with things that are not examples of the trope.
