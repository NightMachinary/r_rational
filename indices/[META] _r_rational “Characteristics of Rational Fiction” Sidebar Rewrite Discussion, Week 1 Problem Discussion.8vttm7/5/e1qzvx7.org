*Thoughts on the aspects of the problem:*

- By "rational fiction" most of us, we have a vague sense of what we mean, it being the type of story that shares many of the characteristics we liked in HPMOR and stories inspired by it. But we want a description that can clearly communicate what those sought-after characteristics are, for people who aren't already familiar with the corpus of this vague genre.

- For a newcomer, the description should serve to help them know whether this is the kind of genre they're interested in.

- For an author or possible poster, it should help them know whether the stories they'll be writing/recommending will find a possibly favorable audience here.

*Potential failure modes:*

- Being overly specific -- treating incidental aspects of the works in the genre as if they're crucial aspects of the entire genre. (e.g. does rational fiction even need have intelligent characters, even though all currently known examples thereof do have them?)

- Being overly vague -- having a description that could be said to apply to pretty much most stories.

- Mistargeting the set of characteristics we seek in rational fiction, so that we instead list the characteristics we would seek in /any/ fiction, rather that the characteristics we seek in rational fiction. Unless you're the type of person that only ever enjoys one particular genre, you should be able to imagine a story that falls clearly outside the genre as described and which you nonetheless enjoy greatly. We don't seek to describe /good/ fiction. We seek to describe the /genre/ we like, in accordance with our tastes and preferences, but you should nonetheless be able to conceive examples of the genre you dislike (despite them being unquestionably part of the genre) and non-examples of the genre you love (despite them being unquestionably not parts of it).
