I think the definition of rational fiction should focus less on what it actually is and more on what it does, as the current approach is needlessly stiffing. To clarify what I mean, let's look at definition of sci-fi - a genre which still struggles with its own identity. Straight from wikipedia, we have:

#+begin_quote
  Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a "literature of ideas".
#+end_quote

And a little bit further down,

#+begin_quote
  Isaac Asimov said: "Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology."
#+end_quote

In both of the above, the answer doesn't tell you what sci-fi /is/ but what it /does/. It gives you the key ideas and questions surrounding the genre.

Looking at the sidebar now, my main problems is with how the definition is stated rather than their spirit. I'll illustrate using the following:

#+begin_example
  The fictional world has consistent rules, and sticks to them.
#+end_example

This applies to probably 90% of all commercially successful fiction. What this is saying is that rational fiction isn't crap, i.e. it's internally consistent. More than that, it's incredibly cut and dry. It doesn't facilitate discussion at all - you can basically dismiss a story as not being rational simply because it isn't fully consistent on a couple of points.

This is a huge problem as when you look at other genre definitions they purposefully don't box themselves in too much. You want a lot of room so that creative people can come up with cool ideas and approaches that you haven't thought of yet, which I think the current systen doesn't provide.
