I don't think that argument holds well. You aren't omniscient with respect to what happens in the world of the story, and factors outside of your knowledge can account for whatever inconsistencies you see. In fact, they can account even for the largest imaginable inconsistencies - heroes in my Artifact of Immortality example might be mindcontrolled, or had their memories edited to forget the existence of the artifact, or something. In my opinion, the issue is similar to that of postulating more and more [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle][epicycles]] as you get more and more accurate astronomic data - eventually your world model simply gets too darn complicated to consider seriously. At that point you either invent a simpler model, decide that evidence is a lie, or make peace with an overly complicated model.

In the context of stories, first would be inventing a single fan theory that in one fell swoop explains 50 inconsistencies across the board, like that Darth Jar Jar thing. If /author/ does that, and shows some factor on-screen that explains all the previous seeming inconsistencies, it's a fairly thematic ratfic moment.

Second, in the context of stories, would be deciding that author did not think the story through and it really is inconsistent. Finally, third option doesn't really exist, since you can argue with an author in a way you can't with Nature.
