In my opinion consistency can be viewed as a spectrum, based on how much thinking it takes for someone to find an inconsistency, on how big that inconsistency is when found, and on how complicated it would be to postulate a reason that explains the inconsistency away. Characters never using (and never even discussing the possibility of using) an Artifact Of Immortality they found in episode 2 even though they are constantly in mortal danger is one thing. Prices of beer in the local taverns being 1.5 times as high as expected after modeling the whole supply and production chain (over the course of three real life weeks) and accounting for all optimisations that usage of magic would allow for compared to real life is another.
