Damn it, I meant to prepare this post yesterday and just forgot. So we'll do it live! I think we can all agree that there is such a thing as a "rational story" which makes it stand out from other fiction, otherwise, why are we even here? Therefore, determining the best ways to determine this quality is a worthy goal of the community.

Anyway...

*A Hilariously Brief Overview*

There will be different ideologies present which must be accounted for, such as some users arguing for a definition which measures an idealized but nonexistent rationalfic and other users who desire a definition with specific results when used to measure existing popular stories. There may even be meta-level disagreement about the role of the sidebar and its utility in a subreddit, which I think should be avoided as besides the point. Here's a few ways it could go:

- *Narrow Defintion* argues for a set of definitions and traits, or a single definition, which stories pass or fail. The purpose is to efficiently judge whether or not a story fits according to obvious metric. I don't think this one will fly because it is, unsurprisingly, too narrow in scope and inadequate the task considering the abundant stories available for catalog.

- *Checklist* format tries to give a list of traits which stories may or may not contain. The primary difference between the Narrow and the Checklist is that this are allows stories to seriously violate one or more of these traits and still be judged "rational" if the successfully pass the other tests. This is most similar to the current sidebar and I don't expect it significantly improve the situation. It inevitably leads to bickering over the exact traits and definitions so enshrined and leaves out qualities which were not articulated in those definitions.

- *Whatever Is Most Upvoted*, aka Mob Rule. Not to disparage mobs, but I don't think this is what we are looking for to base the sidebar by sorting by top/all-time and just taking the top ten entries as the gold standard (no offense, MoL).

Notably, those who want the definitions to stay the same are excluded, and should be. As a matter of policy, there should be no option given for inaction, or else it is likely that option will result if the other groups do not come to some sort of compromise.

*II: My Personal Opinion*

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/][I was here before the sub was founded]], so I would like to think I have at least some amount of understanding.

First, I am /not/ sure that there is a major difference between *rational* and *rationalist* fiction. The existing divide is merely an artifact of insufficient data and would not remain if there were 10,000x times as many rationalfics to properly explore the spectrum. However, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/][I wrote a long time ago]] about my opinion that what makes rational stories rational. It's kind of an alternate view that doesn't work particularly well with the usual traits and definitions, so I can't expect it to be shared by the other users. Essentially, a story, but certainly a rational story, /can have/ and /should have/ a thesis, even if it subtle, emotional, and never actually stated. If this thesis is upheld through the story, it is rational. This is, I think, one of the best ways to generalize the notion of rational fiction outside a tiny internet community with a very specific taste. This metric can works the community loves but doesn't count as rational such as /Worm/ and group it with definitive works like /Methods/. I don't think I'll ever come to love a definiton which divides these two stories which outwardly have so little in common, because for me they certainly possess that "quality" which them stand out fro, the stories I've read. (this may have the side effect of including Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan/ I'm not a complaining). I'm sure I'm failing to describe what exactly I mean by this sort of "premis/thesis/conclusion", and I can only say that I have to give it more specifc thought and elaboration, but most of it is in the "They Should Have Sent A Poet" post linked above.

You may respond that "Isn't that just the fallacy of 'Rational Fiction is Good Fiction'?" To which the answer is clearly no. Countless beloved and excelletn stories don't try to stick to a premise and theme.

You may respond that this definition has nothing really to do with the traits currently taken to describe rational fiction. I don't have a strong response to this, other than "I'm sure they will work together". I heard somewhere that the goal of fantasy is to engage you emotionally, while the goal of science fiction is to engage you intellectually. The best rational fiction can do both, but I have yet to be able to articulate how or why. Still working on that part.
