It's almost a clich√© that in order to find the right answers, you need to be asking the right questions.

Luckily, brainstorming questions is totally my jam.

I'm going to try to avoid asking closed questions, although I'm sure a couple of them will sneak in. The reason I'm doing that is that closed-ended questions, by their very nature, limit how much thinking you put into the answer. So, rather than ask, "Is it necessary for a rational story to have a rational antagonist?" it's better to ask questions like, "What does a rational antagonist contribute to the story?" or "How can you keep a story with a rational protagonist but a non-rational antagonist interesting?" or "How does making your antagonist rational change the character arc of your protagonist?"

The first of those four questions can only be answered "Yes" or "No"\\
(plus or minus conditionals). However, there's no limit to how the three open-ended questions can be answered, so you're likely to get better-thought-out answers to them.

I'll be answering all of these questions to my own satisfaction later (probably next week), but for now, just questions.

So, let's start:

** *General rationality:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: general-rationality
   :END:

- What is rationality?
- What is rationalism?
- What is science?
- To what extent can any human being be rational?
- How rational is a [[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/WEIRD][WEIRD]] person, compared to someone less educated?
- How easy is it to learn rationality?

** *Rational settings:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rational-settings
   :END:

- To what extent is it useful or necessary to set a rational story in world whose physical rules are consistent? To what extent is it harmful?
- To what extent is it useful or necessary to set a rational story in world with real-world physics? To what extent is it harmful?
- To what extent is it useful or necessary to set a rational story in a nation whose laws were designed rationally? To what extent is it harmful?
- To what extent is it useful or necessary to set a rational story in a culture whose customs and values are based in rationality? To what extent is it harmful?

** *Rational characters:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rational-characters
   :END:

- What makes a character rational?
- What makes a character a rationalist? How does that differ from simply being rational?
- Why would you want to show a character becoming /more/ rational as the story progresses? How about becoming /less/ rational?
- "Perfectly rational" characters are, almost by definition, inhuman. How are these characters useful in rational fiction? How are they harmful?

/Protagonists:/

- To what extent is it necessary that the protagonist(s) be rational in a rational story?
- To what extent is it necessary that the protagonist(s) become more rational as the story progresses?
- How would perfect rationality from your protagonist affect how interesting your story is? How relatable the character is?
- To what extent does it matter whether your protagonist's value system is humanist?
- To what extent does it matter whether your protagonist's value system is self-consistent?
- To what extent does it matter whether your protagonist's goals are consistent with their stated system of values?
- To what extent does it matter whether your protagonist's methods are a rational means to their goals?

/Antagonists:/

- To what extent is it necessary that the antagonist(s) be rational in a rational story?
- To what extent is it necessary that the antagonist(s) become more (or less) rational as the story progresses?
- How would perfect rationality from your antagonist affect how interesting your story is? How relatable the character is?
- To what extent does it matter whether your antagonist's value system is humanist?
- To what extent does it matter whether your antagonist's value system is self-consistent?
- To what extent does it matter whether your antagonist's goals are consistent with their stated system of values?
- To what extent does it matter whether your antagonist's methods are a rational means to their goals?
- To what extent does it matter whether your protagonist learns anything from your antagonist? And vice versa?

/Secondary characters:/

- What proportion of the secondary characters should be rational? If a large proportion, what makes the main character special? If a small proportion, why is the main character more rational than their peers?
- Should any characters be /more/ rational than your -tagonists?

** *Rational Plot:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rational-plot
   :END:

- How much agency should the characters have (i.e. to what extent should the ending of the story depend on the characters' decisions)?
- How predictable should the consequences of the characters' actions be? How much do you sacrifice your ability to surprise your reader in the name of having the consequences follow logically from what your characters do?
- If depicting a recurring event, how important is it to know why no one has put an end to the cycle before?
- If depicting a unique event, how important is it to know why no one has done this before?
- Either way, how important is it for your protagonists to have a good reason to be the ones to deal with the mess?

** *Rational Themes*:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rational-themes
   :END:

- To what extent is "the benefits of rationality" a necessary theme when writing a rationalist story?

** *Rational Technique:*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rational-technique
   :END:

- To what extent should the characters, when critiquing their own state of mind, cite real-world phenomena, events, studies, terminology, etc. in a rational story? In a rationalist story?
- To what extent do the examples above need to be accurate, as opposed to just getting their point across?

If anyone can think of more questions to add, or expand upon, please, feel free. I'll give it a night's further thought myself.
