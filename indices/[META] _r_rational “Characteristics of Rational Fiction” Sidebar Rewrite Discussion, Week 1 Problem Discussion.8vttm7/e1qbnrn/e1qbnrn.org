Hello, author of /Aeromancer/ here!

Let me tell you what brought me here and what nearly drove me away.

Two discussions stick out in my mind for what I consider positive, and then less so. There was a thread about a rational Wakanda, and within there was a brief discussion about how to rationalize it further. The topic was how the choosing of kings was irrational. I loved how someone asked to define why they thought it was irrational, and how it /could/ be defined as rational (warring tribe, the strongest person becomes king & becomes panther simultaneously). The discussion ended in an agreement that the movie demonstrated the flaws of the ascension system, and that to be rational they should have changed it at the end. I liked this discussion a lot because it provided solutions and more meaty stuff (including an attempt to rationalize the opposing side), rather than a simple "it's that way because the plot demanded it!"

The other discussion was regarding Batman: The Dark Knight. If my memory serves me correctly, the statement was that the movie was irrational because the Joker was marked in the "evil for the sake of evil" category. I disliked this train of thought, and don't think a story is immediately irrational because of that. How characters respond to irrationality can make the story even more rational.

I made an account and came to this sub a few months ago because I enjoyed seeing the discussions around MoL and discovered WtC here. I liked how they told their stories. I decided to write my own and post it here.

After posting two chapters, I nearly left lol

I was told that my first chapter was irrational because a motive for a character wasn't expressed (the counselor), and that a magic style happened that wasn't defined earlier in the chapter. (Both of which were brought to attention the next chapter, or at a later chapter.)

For my second chapter, I was told my story was irrational because the characters didn't react to something in a realistic way. I asked to further define what the poster meant, and he simply wanted the character to be angrier or more scared. What's ironic about that is that I had recently come off of a post in [[/r/askreddit][r/askreddit]] regarding the Haiwain Missle Crisis that happened in January. The question? How did people react when they got the news a missile was inbound and could kill them.

The reactions were /so/ different with each person. Some filled their tubs with water, others ran red lights. But then you have the grandma who was making toast, got the message, then asked the grandchild if they wanted jam on the bread. Another person was on the toilet and swiped the message away, thinking "oh well". A third was sleeping, saw the notification, and decided to keep sleeping.

The problem with defining a rational story is that everyone has their own subjective opinion on what it is. It might be better to think of a story along the lines of /how/ rational is it, rather than /is it/ rational. Some people may enjoy an 80% rational fiction and think it belongs here, but another would think otherwise.

(Granted, I don't have a definition on what is considered 80% rational, only that the number /does/ exist in each person, but it varies greatly.)
