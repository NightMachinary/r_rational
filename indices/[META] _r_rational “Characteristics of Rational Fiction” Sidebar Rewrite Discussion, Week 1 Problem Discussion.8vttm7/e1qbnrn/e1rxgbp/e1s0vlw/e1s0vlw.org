  Real world people very often act irrational, but they act irrational in realistic ways...it should just make clear to the reader why the actions of that character are completely reasonable and utterly normal /from the perspective and worldview of that character./

This is where our definitions start to get subjective. If something is realistic and is completely reasonable, then why would it ever be classified as irrational?

My veteran banker holding the idiot ball example would be something irrational to me. There was no reason for him to be idiotic. But add in a few things, like a recent wife's death, or lack of sleep, then suddenly his idiot ball moment has be /rationalized/, and therefore is no longer irrational. To me, having that plausible reason makes all the difference whether I consider something irrational or not, and whether it pulls me out of the story to say /seriously?/

  I think I disagree with you about the Joker...it does not allow you to see the world from his perspective and understand why he is doing the things he is doing

I believe he wanted to show people that they were as twisted as him (Batman said this during the climax). Even without knowing any other background or sob story, that line of thought intrigued me and never pulled me out of the story to say /really?/
