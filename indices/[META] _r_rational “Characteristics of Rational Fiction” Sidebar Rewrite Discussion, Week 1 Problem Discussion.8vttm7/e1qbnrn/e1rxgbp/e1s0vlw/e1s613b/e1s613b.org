  This is where our definitions start to get subjective. If something is realistic and is completely reasonable, then why would it ever be classified as irrational?

You touch on something that I think is quite important: For me, being rational and being realistic are very different things, and the latter should not be used as an indicator of the former. Instead, actions should /feel/ realistic, whether or not that is actually the case. Would it be realistic for Voldemort to forget a rune and have his ritual blow up right before his final battle? Sure, mistakes happen and inconvenient timing is not actually that improbable. But it isn't rational, is it?

When I hear what a character is doing, I want to (eventually) think 'Yeah, that makes sense'. It does not really matter whether I can come up with a justification why they would do it (which is rarely difficult), if it does not make sense to me after I have read the whole thing I would not call it rational.
