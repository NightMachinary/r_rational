  The way I read this, you want victories for both the good guys and the bad guys to be earned [...]. Or conversely, all setbacks in a rational story, both for the good guys and the bad guys, are due to enemy action. Is this a fair summary of your position?
#+end_quote

Yes, I do agree with that sentiment.

  If so, how does that work for stories where the antagonist is non-anthropomorphic [...], would those stories be disqualified by default?
#+end_quote

I feel that I do not fully understand your question. In this example, the antagonist (e.g. the zombie horde) would not 'earn' their victories, but the story presumably does not focus on them. The protagonist is free to intelligently overcome the obstacles, which are not posed by an adversary, but rather the environment. So, I would say that earning your victories by beating out an intelligent, non-underpowered anthropomorphic adversary is certainly one way for a story to be rational, but winning against a dumb, overpowered world works fine as well: The solution has to be clever, the problem may be stupid.

If the author chooses to write long parts about the overwhelming force and easy victories of the zombie horde, than those parts would be disqualified.
