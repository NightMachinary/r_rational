This is a valid point, but only necessarily a problem with fanfiction, I think.

When writing fanfiction, there already /exists/ a way that the main character can win. If you just buff the MC, (by making them rational) then the villain should, if they aren't buffed in some way, lose even more easily than in the original work, which sorta kills the conflict.

Naturally, this could be solved by buffing the antagonist in other ways, or adding other handicaps to the MC, but making the villain rational has a poetic symmetry to it, and I can see why this is done.

In a world created from scratch where the MC is designed with rational traits to begin with, you could just create a whole different power dynamic from the beginning, which could even more easily not entail rationality for everyone, if you so pleased.
