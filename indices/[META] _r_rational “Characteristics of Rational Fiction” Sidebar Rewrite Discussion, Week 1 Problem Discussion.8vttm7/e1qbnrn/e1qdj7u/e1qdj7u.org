  The other discussion was regarding Batman: The Dark Knight. If my memory serves me correctly, the statement was that the movie was irrational because the Joker was marked in the "evil for the sake of evil" category. I disliked this train of thought, and don't think a story is immediately irrational because of that. How characters respond to irrationality can make the story even more rational.

I think this is one of the big weaknesses of the current sidebar definition; it's overspecific. You can /for sure/ write a rational zombie story, as with any Man vs Nature story. You could write a rational story about engineers diagnosing an engine failure! So why, when an antagonist gets added in, do they need to not be just evil? Besides that, the current definitions don't even cut to the core of the problem, because "beliefs and values" can be pretty dumb, and also isomorphic to "evil for the sake of evil". A sadist values the suffering of others; does that make a horror story "more rational" than if the villain's motives are simply unexplained?

Now, I would argue that it's generally good writing to have a well-thought-out antagonist, and if you're writing rational fiction, then the focus of your story probably shouldn't be on the motives of someone who's simply insane ... which cuts out a lot of space to work within. And even if the antagonist is "plain" evil, they need to be /consistent/ in their goals, skills, and methods, as otherwise everything becomes arbitrary and immune from thought.
