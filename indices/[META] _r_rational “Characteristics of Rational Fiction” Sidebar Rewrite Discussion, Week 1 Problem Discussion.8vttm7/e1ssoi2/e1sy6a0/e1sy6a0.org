Moderators aren't really in the habit of policing posts based on whether something is or is not rational fiction, partly because that would require us to read all of the stuff posted to this subreddit, which we don't have the time for (especially given the popularity of megaword fiction here), and partly because of inherent disagreement on definitions. It happens, sometimes, but not terribly often. I don't anticipate that changing, because whatever the new definition in the sidebar is, there are still going to be disagreements.

(Of the ~35 posts removed in the past three months, 9 were fiction. Of those 9, 1 was removed by AutoMod for being a link to the mobile version (reposted shortly after with no issue), 4 were double posts, 3 were posts made before a chapter went up, and 1 was a short script-style bit of prose that was widely downvoted and then removed by AutoMod.)

I generally think there's a place for "rational adjacent" in the subreddit, so long as there's not too much of it, but if "rational fiction" is fuzzy, then "rational adjacent" is even more fuzzy, and yes, at moderator discretion, some of that might be removed, especially if it's just shitposting. But it's probably just going to be removed at the same rates that it's removed now, which is not much.

(We're much more likely to remove posts that aren't fiction, especially if there's already a weekly thread for them.)

(We're also three mods with different views on things, and I didn't consult before writing this response.)
