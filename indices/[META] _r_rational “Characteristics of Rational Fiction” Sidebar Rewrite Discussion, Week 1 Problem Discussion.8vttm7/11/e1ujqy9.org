Proposed Problem: The current definition is a bad at starting useful discussions.

In practice, asking "Is Work X Rational?" generates a bad thread. The current sub-points don't help too much, either. "There isn't an explicit good/evil faction," doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement.

- How should the definition come up when people are making / discussing recommendations?

And perhaps:

- Would an ideal discussion focus on (1) what the author tried to do, (2) what the author managed to do, or (3) what the author lampshaded?
- What should we do about stories that are intended to be rational but fall short of the mark?
