  In honor of Earth Day and the future of the planet, The Future of Life Institute is co-sponsoring a short fiction writing contest with Sapiens Plurum. We love the Handmaid's Tale and Black Mirror as much as anyone, but we think the world needs more utopian fiction right now. So we're asking you to write down your vision for the future and share it with us.

The quoted text is not found in the link (and the link doesn't actually emphasize optimism in the prompt, except in linking to the utopia article). Or am i missing something?
