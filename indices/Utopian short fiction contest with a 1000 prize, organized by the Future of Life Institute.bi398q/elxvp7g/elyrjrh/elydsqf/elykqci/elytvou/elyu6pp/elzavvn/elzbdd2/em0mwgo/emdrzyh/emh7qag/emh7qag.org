Eh, surveillance is also incredibly dangerous when employed against the people. The primary problem is the same as the one brought up when the Nazis invaded Poland - the only difference between close surveillance and political and ethnical targeting data is the intent of the holder. The Nazis got reliable information on who was Jewish, and very few Jews escaped Poland. The Goverment always has the ability to arrest anyone it wants, what it usually lacks is the information on who it should apprehend. Giving it that information is terrifyingly dangerous.

The surveillance information is at high risk of being leaked or stolen, especially in the hands of massive organizations that have to make it available to a /lot/ of people.

TL;DR A certain combination of power and information is extremely dangerous and should not be given to anyone lest they use it for their own needs, like winning the next election or Hydra's plot from Captain America: Winter Soldier to quell rebellions, neither of which work if they don't have information on who has the opinions they dislike.

Further, I'd argue that similar benefits as the surveillance grants (though not working as swiftly) can be gained simply through robust and well-designed education and incentive systems that encourages citizens to be vigilant and empathic with others, along of course with well-funded child-care and police systems manned by dedicated professionals with training in psychology and deescalation.

You can get a /lot/ closer to utopia simply by taking some of our current societies and adjusting some of the biggest flaws.
