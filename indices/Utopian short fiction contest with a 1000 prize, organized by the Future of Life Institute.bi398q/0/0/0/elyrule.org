Yeah, I thought someone would bring up "For sale: baby shoes. Never worn" or similar. I didn't know there was an actual industry standard, to me something under 1500 words isn't really a "work of fiction" in any way but the loosest sense of the word. Like "Yesterday I went to the store and they were out of milk. I was devastated." Story? Yes. Flash fiction? Meh. Guess I'm just being ornery or pedantic or something.
