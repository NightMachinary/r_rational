Star Trek is kind of utopian: Earth finally has its act together. Countries no longer make war at each other, poverty is obsolete, etc. And freed of those conflicts, humanity explores outer space and gets into trouble there.

Solutions to a current problem often create new problems. Think of modern medicine. On the up side, an infection that used to kill people can be wiped away by a few pills of antibiotics. On the down side, an injury that used to kill someone might become a lifelong coma with a ventilator and feeding tube. "Right to life" wasn't an issue for our ancestors.
