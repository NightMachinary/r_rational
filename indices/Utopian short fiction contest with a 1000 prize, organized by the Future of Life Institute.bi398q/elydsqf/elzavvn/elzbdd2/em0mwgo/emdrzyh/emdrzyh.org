I keep thinking that surveillance is a pivotal piece of what would make a utopia even possible.

​

Why do suburban Americans all want to live in their own enclosed in mini-manors? With backyards and isolated buildings from each other and large collections of firearms?

​

Because they feel they /need/ them. Because they fear, right or wrong, the oppressed descendants of former slaves. They fear their neighbors as well.

​

Well, if we have ubiquitous surveillance - a dense enough carpet of sensors that essentially nowhere a human goes on earth is not covered, except for a few extreme locales, and people can bring their own surveillance nodes to those if they want - combined with machine learning systems to actually /watch/ everyone - these fears could disappear.

​

Why fear your neighbor? Your neighbor doesn't have a gun or deadly weapon, those are now banned and if they ever pick one up they will be immediately arrested. You can send your kids to play without fear - anyone who lays an unlawful hand on them will be tased by a drone in under 60 seconds. Your girlfriend can sunbathe nude in a public park - no one will rape her, again, anyone who tries gets tased immediately.

The police no longer need to carry deadly weapons as no one they come to arrest have any either. For the rare scenarios where it's a response to a suspect armed with a deadly weapon, a drone armed with nonlethal only is sent in instead.

​

You can't steal anything and no one fears theft. If you try to steal something, either you automatically are billed for the item or a drone will come by later to recover the item if it's something you can't afford to pay for.
