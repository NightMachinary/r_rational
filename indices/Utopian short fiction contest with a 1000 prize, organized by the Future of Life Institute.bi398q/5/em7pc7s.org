This got me thinking about utopias, and after a first moment where I actually found it hard to even imagine /what/ exactly could sound like a satisfying ideal world that does not sound like a total nightmare to someone else I think I started developing a good potential setting.

The problem is the word limit. 3000 words are very little to weave the necessary world-building into a natural-sounding narrative. It's easy to do by framing everything as, say, a lesson of some sort, but that makes the story basically just an infodump. I'll see if I can think of a quickly resolved conflict that is also representative of the world as a whole, but it's a hard task.
