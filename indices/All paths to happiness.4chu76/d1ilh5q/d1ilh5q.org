I'm interested in how someone might /actually/ use a device like this.

Off the top of my head I can't think of that many things you could do with this, you can't ever split too many timelines, because if you do there will inevitably be one universe where the highest value happens not to coincide with what you want.

Honestly using only one device I'm not sure how many universes you could create and interact with, before you get unwanted results but I'm guessing it can't be more than millions at most.
