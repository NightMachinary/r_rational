Nitpick: The search space of all 10GB movies is absolutely big enough to contain a file that will take control of any imperfectly secure video player with room to spare. Likely enough room for a super AI with the goal to enter the largest possible number into the device.

I'd give good odds that every possible 10 /KB/ file is almost definitely enough to bypass the video player and hack the value input panel, provided it's wired up to the computer.
