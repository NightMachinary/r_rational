Hey, this is a thing I've brainstormed before! And it has some ideas I didn't think of. But it also has some issues I had caught.

#+begin_quote
  My computer had captured the sequence of eighty thousand million 0s and 1s with which the machine had answered to those keystrokes [...] I put an “.avi” extension to the resulting file and tried to open it in the video player of my operating system.

So, the problem with this approach is that you are not optimizing for the best possible movie. You are optimizing for whatever sequence of 0s and 1s results in the highest number getting typed on your keypad.

This can go wrong in a number of ways. For example, in that search space, there may be a video that fills you with such self-loathing that you decide you wish to end all of your lives. So you type 99999 and then kill yourself.

In fact I expect there are /all sorts/ of possible videos that would convince you to input 99999 because the other you's "/need/ to see this". A humongous amount. (Almost none of which would be an excellent Oscar-bait movie, since those usually get their you's to input "1" as planned.) I very much doubt that the one most effective at convincing you to spend a while typing 9's will be any good for you.

And that's not even getting into the more exotic scenarios.

Maybe Basilisks are possible, in which case the winner will be whichever video is most effective at hacking your brain to get you to write /lots/ and /lots/ of 9's, until your nose presses the Enter key when you collapse onto the blood-soaked keyboard.

Maybe the file triggers a specific bug in your video player, which spirals into some kind of spontaneously generated virus, which just happens to contain code that allows it to hack your keyboard's drivers and input numbers faster than any human possibly could. That's unlikely for a search space this small. But if you keep messing with larger and larger randomly generated files, eventually you'll get nothing but more and more efficient versions of this virus.

  Using the same technique, in the following years I “wrote” the best-selling novels, I “programmed” the best video-games, I “recorded” the best songs, and made the most important scientific discoveries. I won all the research prizes that could be achieved with a merely theoretical setup

Okay, I'll just roll with the wish fulfillment fantasy here, but there's no way you don't end up in some kind of cell after your second highly public miracle.

#+begin_quote
  decided that this file would tell me what to do during the next year to be happy: throughout the year I would follow all the advices included in that file which made some sense
#+end_quote

In addition to the problems listed above (and we are now definitely into virus territory), and the one the story itself pointed out, now we have ethical concerns. Of all possible sets of sensical instructions, most will result in your painful death. Of the remainder, most will result in pain for yourself and others. How much death and suffering are you willing to inflict, throughout the multiverse, just for the chance to improve the surviving you's lives?

  Well, that text was only one idea that another myself, from another universe, valued enormously for how much he felt intrigued by it, nothing else.
#+end_quote

(As a side-note: it's weird how casual the narrator sounds here, having just encountered /literally the most exciting idea possible/ for him under those conditions.)

#+begin_quote
  I approach the machine and I introduce the value which, according to what we all agreed four decades ago (when it was just I), would represent the maximum possible score. In fact, we had (I had) agreed that that score would be, in fact, unreachable, and that all scores would have to be beneath it. [...] Fuck you, fuck you, bastards!! Now you all will receive the instructions that lead to this shitty life of mine!
#+end_quote

Sorry, narrator, but they won't. This experiment is so /ridiculously/ open to noise that the winning number is going to be way, way above whatever limit /you/ feel the need to bind yourself to. And it won't be typed by human hands.
