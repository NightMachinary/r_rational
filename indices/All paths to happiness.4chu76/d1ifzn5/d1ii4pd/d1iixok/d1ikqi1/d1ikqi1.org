Thanks! I've already read all of the recommendations, but the film, Predestination, is new to me. The last link is very helpful too.

I noticed that you seem to want to add stories with time-travel/split-dimensions to your collection. If you want the manga, Qualia the Purple, as an offline copy, I know how to help you get a pdf copy.
