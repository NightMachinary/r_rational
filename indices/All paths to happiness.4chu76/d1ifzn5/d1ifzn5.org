A nice thought experiment that is going into my dimension-related media collection.

Also, I don't know in what percentile of bifurcations will mr. Rodr√≠guez read through this thread, but here are some nitpickings anyways:

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, in the universe in which I succeeded, I would type 1 into the machine keyboard and press enter, and in all others I would type 0 and press enter.
#+end_quote

Even assuming that the universe is completely deterministic and at the time of splitting all the universes were the same, his alt-versions' states of mind would get slightly changed based on the output they read on the pager's screen. And with 2^{160} universes, at least in some of them the resulting state of mind would be self-sabotaging (sending a 1 when according to the rules they should've sent a 0). He got that partially covered by the end of the story, but still.

#+begin_quote
  For the following years, I enjoyed all kinds of luxuries from my unlimited economic capacity.
#+end_quote

He wouldn't have years, since the society would quickly adapt to --- and drastically change because of --- this openly accessible toolkit.

#+begin_quote
  all myselves would have viewed all the movies that can be stored in a 10 gigabyte file (btw, enough to obtain a high image and sound quality)
#+end_quote

A cinema-tier file-format would require much more disk space than that, not mentioning the raw originals.

#+begin_quote
  the ending drama
#+end_quote

Was somewhat interesting and yet completely unnecessary. Besides, I reckon that if a meeseeks was getting a row of 1s without feeling any happier, he would just auto-terminate his branch of experiment by typing in a 0, since the advice was clearly not working.

Questions:

#+begin_quote
  This myself had no chance to test it before scoring it, because in order to do so he should have created his own universes in order to establish a new communication, which would have prevented him from communicating with me: every time you write a score, you break the possibility of getting in touch again with formerly deployed universes.
#+end_quote

Couldn't he have acquired multiple splitting-tools, especially since they were so cheap? This way resetting wouldn't be required --- each separate device would be linking to each separate bifurcation set.
