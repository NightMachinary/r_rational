Actually, that timeline's information would never be sent back and since there are other timelines who has the main character live to send information back, it's as if he never 'sees' any futures that results in his death. That's a potential 'flaw' in the machine. If there is an extremely likely future which results in his death and a very unlikely future that doesn't result in his death, he will only receive information from the unlikely future and end up surprised when he dies if the information doesn't affect his actions enough to avoid the likely death.
