You can press the button once, enter 1 in the 0 timeline, live your life/acquire information in the other timeline (what happens if the button never gets pressed? Automatic 0?), and send a letter back in the following way: Press the button, if it's not the next bit of the letter, enter 0; repeat. When the letter is done, enter 2. This is not /quite/ as dangerous in and of itself because it only involves one timeline with a possible traitor (and linearly many that diverge by a few seconds). You might want to decrease the probability that you don't get to use the plan by repeating the "You can press the button once, enter 1 in the 0 timeline, " step a (predetermined) number of times - best get the computer to do it a ridiculous number of times (Good thing we're still being linear! We might still want to use a CPU that absolutely does not fuck up one in a zillion logical operations.). The danger here is that the first AGI to get spawned by the mundane world will hack you to send back the optimal letter, so you might not want to wait too long before sending one. (Or even just some friend/government could coerce you to send yourself advice that would send the device into the hands of that friend/government, so better tell nobody, and don't drink.)
