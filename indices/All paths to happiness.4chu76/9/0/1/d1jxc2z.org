Like I said you probably can't expect to get any useful results once you create more than millions of universes (even with massive precautions). Which means you probably can't do much along the lines of creating information out of pure noise like he did in the story.

However you can still use it to potentially generate /simple/ information in addition to using it to get information from really lucky versions of yourself.

However ultimately in real life you would have to deal with the fact that if you do anything to big with the device it will attract dangerous attention.
