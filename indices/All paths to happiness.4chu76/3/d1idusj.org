Although the multiversal mechanics are neat (and similar to things I've thought of myself), this is a classic example of how "precommitments" as we imagine them are not actual precommitments in game theory.

On the same tack, are the odds of a film consisting of literally random binary winning twenty four Oscars /really/ higher than the odds of somebody's fingers slipping and typing in an absurdly high number when they meant to type in zero?
