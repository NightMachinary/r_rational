Thamiel was the vast joke that no one would have believed was real given enough information. He wasn't necessary, per se, he was more like the evil that would eventually inspire good into being, by virtue of simply following his course. He put on the act of evil being par for the course of the world(am i using the idiom right?) while knowing that it was not, that it was an illusion mantained by people that didn't know better. He played the devil because it was what he would do if he wasn't self aware of it. Because he is self aware, he does it anyway, because he knows this is what he "needs" to do.
