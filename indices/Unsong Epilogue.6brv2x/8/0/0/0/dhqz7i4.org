With regard to Tegmarkism, the Unsong God says he plants seeds, and uses his omniscience to see whether they are good. So the seed could be the math and laws of physics, after setting them the Unsong God stops interfering.

However, even if he stops interfering from that point, that is a lot like starting a machine, seeing that it will brutally torture and kill countless people, and refusing to turn it off because it also produces a pretty leviathan.

With regard to Omega points, this is a bit of a gray area, but I still say it's evil. Here's a simpler thought experiment: suppose I have a time machine. I now go and brutally torture a random stranger, then use my time machine to travel back to before the torture session. Thus the torture session is not "actually real" (technically), since it never happened in this timeline and no one but me remembers it. Is this ethical? Would it be ethical if I wiped my own memories too?

If it is ethical, then God would also be ethical in creating millions of hellscapes lasting for millions of years, in which he commits all kinds of horrible evils for sadistic joy, while promising that he will turn back time at the end so whatever unspeakable thing he's doing now isn't "real" evil.
