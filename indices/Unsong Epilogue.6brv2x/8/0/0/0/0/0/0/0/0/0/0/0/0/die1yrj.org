I am glad you have taken the time to properly try to see my point of view. I will strive to respond in kind: A'IGHT U PIECE OF SH- Just kidding. Now, What you said is that it either doesn't make sense or is just plain wrong for (U)God to let the world exist at all if there is evil in it, to the point that it upsets the Good-Evil balance. Is that correct? Now, my point is most aptly described by option (1), but the other holds some weight for me as well: The Leviathan is great. Fine. That's a well established point throughout the story. However, towards the end we are posed the statement: (U)God let's the world exist because eventually Good will upset Evil in the world by itself. Now, we know that the Leviathan exists in the world, and it is Greatâ„¢, does that mean that the Leviathan is part of the Good that will upset the GEB? Abso-Fucking-Lutely. But it is /not enough/. If there were not enough other wonders in the world brought about by humans and nature to upset the evil that exists /by the very existence of space and time/ (remember that? that was a thing) then (U)God would have just destroyed the seed and tred again with some other universe. Further, I don't think we can clearly say what /is/ the most important thing in the (U)World, because so many had to happen exactly how they did to create, well, Albion(est Uriel's puns were gretaest part in that epilogue). In that perspective it does become a little jarring to see the Leviathan being put so much emphasis on, but I don't think it undermines the point I was trying to make that (U)God didn't let the world exist because of a "pretty Leviathan"(I feel a lot less enmity towards you right now, so using "pretty Leviathan" sounds pretty bad, actually), but because the park would eventually develop into one that not only has some great attractions, but is also very clean and organized and everyone loves.
