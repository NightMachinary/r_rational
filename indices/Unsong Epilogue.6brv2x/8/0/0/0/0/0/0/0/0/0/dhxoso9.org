  Leviathan may be the GREATEST wonder but it is not the MAIN wonder.

Erm, aren't those the exact same thing? If I open a theme park, the greatest thrill ride IS the main attraction. How is the GREATEST thing not the MAIN thing?

  Also, the whole "obsession" with Leviathan JOKES were made by a bunch of guys JOKING AROUND that god liked his big fish.

That is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence, as shown by your next statement.

  Also, the last chapter explains that Leviathan's Kabalistic meaning is "the world", because it is so grand that it is as great a metaphor to (U)God as the rest of the entire world is.

This statement argues for what I've been saying better than anything I've said so far. The Leviathan is the world. It is the grandest thing, the thing that glorifies the Unsong God's name. The Unsong God likes the leviathan so much that he even stations Metatron, his avatar/speaker, with the leviathan. Not the fox. Not the bear. Not the angels or the saints. You sure as heck won't find Metatron by chasing the pope or the behemoth or the angel cloud fortresses or any other symbol of goodness. Only the Leviathan. You have literally just stated the best argument for why the Leviathan is the main wonder.

And even if you still don't consider it as the main wonder, surely you can admit that the leviathan contributes a significant amount to the NET goodness of the world according to the Unsong God? If so, the leviathan increases the amount of suffering that god is willing to have in exchange. Therefore, a significant fraction of extra evil in the Unsong world is allowed for the existence of the pretty leviathan. I don't understand why you find any part of this incorrect, and actually encourage you to keep responding so you can teach me why.
