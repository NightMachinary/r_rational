(U)God doesn't let the world the world exist with all it's evil because 8there's a pretty Leviathan/, but because the world will eventually become good *by it's own internal logic/. Leviathan is indeed the greates attraction, the greatest thing in existence, the absolute symbol of (U)God's power, but it wouldn't be enough reason for an entirely evil world to exist. The /main/ attraction is /the world in it's entirety/. Do you go to a theme park for a single ride in the most insane attraction that ever existed? Drive for hours and spend tens, or meybe even hundreds of dollars for a single ride in the greatest attraction? well I don't. If you believe anyone would, if you believe anyone would go to a park that only has /that/, in spite of all the surrounding shittyness, then that's your issue.
