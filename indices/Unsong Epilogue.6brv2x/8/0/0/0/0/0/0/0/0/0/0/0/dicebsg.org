Thanks for responding, I think I understand your argument a bit better now. You're saying either one of two things:

(1) The Leviathan is great, but the world is better, so the leviathan is only a small part of the happiness.

(2) The Leviathan is great, but the world is infinitely better thanks to infinite love, so the leviathan is nothing.

If you mean (1), my objection still stands. The Unsong God is like a customer going to a theme park, he's willing to pay more to enter a theme park with its greatest attraction than an identical theme park without its greatest attraction. Except in this case, he's paying with evil and giving humans suffering. The fact that he's willing to allow more suffering because the leviathan exists is what I've been objecting to this whole time.

If you mean (2), then his answers to Job become plain weird. Why mention the Leviathan at all if it is overshadowed by infinite good? Why is there so much focus on the Leviathan even though its supposed to only contribute an infinitesimally small fraction of good to the world? While "infinite love" and "transcendent joy" just get mere mentions, The Unsong God expounds plenty on how utterly amazing the Leviathan is and chooses to emphasize it's destruction to Job when Job complains.

Don't you see it? Rather than threatening to erase heaven or whatever is giving out infinite love, the Unsong God instead threatens to erase the Leviathan if Job doesn't shut up and suffer quietly. Why would the Unsong God do that if the Leviathan is just an insignificant thing?

P.S. If the greatest attraction is great enough, I would totally go to a theme park just for that one attraction.
