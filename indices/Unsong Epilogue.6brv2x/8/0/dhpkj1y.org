And you know what the absolute worst part was? It was that after creating Job's world, and letting it run on for years, he then asks Job if he would like his whole world and all other sentient beings in it to be erased, just so Job wouldn't have boils. As if that would make everything better.

There is a BIG, *BIG* difference between creating something and then destroying it, versus never creating that thing at all. It's like murdering all your fully grown adult children versus never losing your virginity in the first place. Let's try a different analogy to demonstrate how heinous this is. Imagine a world where the Comet King is unpopular. So when he asked for women to make Cometspawn, no one volunteered.

And so, Comet King decides that, for the greater good, he should just sexually assault a bunch of women. So he does, resulting in lots of traumatized women and beautiful Cometspawn. You know, the greater good (/sorta/). And at the end of it all, one of the few remaining women who still have their sanity/lives talks to him about why he inflicted such evils upon them, and the Comet King tells her: "Look at my beautiful spawn! Would you rather I kill them all and you as well? Just because you want to selfishly stop your own suffering?"

Because you know, that's totally the same as never assaulting her in the first place (/sarcasm/).

The Comet King at least has a debatable excuse: Cometspawn are vital for fighting hell. The Unsong God's excuse is "Leviathans are pretty".
