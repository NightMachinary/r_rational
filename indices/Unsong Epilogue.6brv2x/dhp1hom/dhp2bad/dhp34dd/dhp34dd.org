I'm not as good a writer as Scott, so I'm sure he could do a better job given enough time & space to work with, but I'd have enjoyed this more if there were some setup about who can speak the Shem HaMephorash & why, what exactly it means to 'fix hell', why all the people in Aaron's head don't show up earlier, and so on. It all feels like there's a few important pieces of supporting worldbuilding that are missing.

The reactions of everyone to merging into a single entity are also... lacking, to say the least. I find it hard to believe Dylan, for example, wouldn't try to either take charge, kick up a huge fuss, or otherwise manipulate or exert control on things. There's also much less shock and outright horror at impending nonexistence from pretty much everyone (except maybe Uriel).

Like, I don't want to bash on the epilogue that much. It's not outright bad, but it's not at the same level as the rest of UNSONG.
