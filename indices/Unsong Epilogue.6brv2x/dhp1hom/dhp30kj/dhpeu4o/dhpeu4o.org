Besides the head thing, the idea that the kabbalistic marriage works that way wasn't foreshadowed at all, I don't think? It's a handy way of avoiding any of the dead characters we bonded with from "really dying," even for a little while, but there's no reason given as to why Aaron only noticed the other minds (or why they only spoke up) once everything was over and done with. Did it have something to do with the Comet King's actions in Hell "freeing" whoever went there? If that's the case, why were Sohu and Uriel there, even if we accept that Ana and Erica belonged there?
