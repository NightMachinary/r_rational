All right, it's over! Now it's time for the fanfics!

(In all seriousness, though, I doubt there will be any fanfics of UNSONG, simply because of the sheer amount of /knowledge/ needed to write a kabbalistic scene that would do the original justice. If there ever is an UNSONG fanfic, it'll almost certainly have to be a group effort, which seems unlikely.)
