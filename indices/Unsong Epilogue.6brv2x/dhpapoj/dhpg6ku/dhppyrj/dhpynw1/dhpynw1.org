For what it's worth, I figured out Robin's scheme well in advance and it made perfect sense to me.

TCK isn't morally perfect, and a willingness to go over-the-top for people he loves is well-established as a moral failing of his. If you want him to turn evil in order to go to Hell, sending his wife there is just the logical choice.

  why did the sky crack? Well, apparently in a workd with a well defined magic system based on the Hebrew alphabet, reciting the bible in English has real world effects if it's done in space.

There's a lot more to the magic system than just the Names, though. The whole Apollo 11 thing was based on the "Uriel's machine" part of the magic system, with Adam Kadmon and the non-magical "laws of physics" working like a glitchy computer.

Also, this isn't a mystery, it's the premise of the setting.
