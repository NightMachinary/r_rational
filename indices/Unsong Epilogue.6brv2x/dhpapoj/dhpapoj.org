This is mostly a collection of topics about which I feel Unsong underperformed relative to my (high) expectations. These should be read while taking into account that overall I enjoyed the story.

SPOILERS AHEAD

*The bad parts:*

A weak point is the relative uselessness of Unsong (the organization), which is (1) underpowered relative to the real important entities, like angels, demons, Cometspawn, etc; (2) quite useless at hoarding names and (3) becomes completely irrelevant after book 1. From the title of the story (and the logo), one would expect it would be this overly important organization that would influence the events and characters in the book, and this expectation is broken without even being acknowledged.

Similarly, the extremely scary Malia could use some more screen time. She is kinda reduced to the role of a blood bag.

As someone else has said, Metatron is supposed not to talk, but he decides to disguise himself as human and steal a boat to search for himself ar some point. Just so that the seed of the universe grows into something good or something to that effect. The angels actually lie/are wrong when they say that Metatron rides on top of a purple boat which is actually the Leviathan. This is annoyingly misleading for the reader.

The chapter about the War of the Angels is veeeery inconsistent regarding the angels. They go from praising God for 7 days and 7 nights to talking like they're living in a SSC post. It's just too jarring.

Sarah, the kabbahlistic secret weapon (as well as the Vital Name + ensouled Tharmas) is not used in a meaningful way, and the whole sacrifice thing is undone in a couple of chapters after TOK unceremoniously burns the supercomputer as a side effect of killing Caelius. While it might get across the idea that all resistance is futile before the might of TCK/TOK, it comes out as a little underwhelming.

Globally, the pacing is a little off. It takes way to long for us to discover that TCK is actually an important main character and not a minor background event. I felt somewhat betrayed as I felt that the story was straying further and further away from the awesome atmosphere of this fictional depiction of the Bay Area Unitarians (which is still my favorite part of the book). I eventually adjusted, though.

After giving us every indication that it's easy to distinguish a Golem from a human corpse, the book has TCK faking his death with a Golem capable of fooling the Cometspawn. Simeon does believe that fooling them with a Golem might be possible, but we've already seem him being wrong about the Drug Lord and the Captain, so I don't think his opinion was meant to be taken as gospel.

Aaron's misinterpretation of the "fall of a bird" prophecy is irrealistic and out of character. He doesn't even consider the possibility that Robin is the bird, after mentioning that TCK was brokenhearted after her death one or two paragraphs above. The reader doesn't know her name yet, but Aaron does. On a positive note, I really like the fact that his kabbahlistic deduction is visibly very weird and sounded wrong at the time (at least to me).

The "anthropic" explanation for all the coincidences is not very satisfying, but that's probably just my personal preference.

The mechanics of telepathy are poorly understood by the reader, even if they are familiar to the characters. Telepathy seems to mostly work according to the whims of the plot, which narratively is a bad thing.

The story didn't really gain much for being a serial instead of being published in one go or on bigger chunks.

The African soul inconsistency is never addressed: how come many africans don't have a soul and are perfectly ordinary humans while Sara turns into a general artificial intelligence the moment she receives hers?

My other criticisms are related to (lots of) little details, mostly inconsistencies, and nothing about the large scale structure of the novel. They are inevitable for a project of this magnitude without a proper editor. An editor could also "fix" many of the "flaws" I mention here.

*Overall I have to say it's quite good. Among my favorite parts:*

Book 1 is amazing - the depiction of the fictional version of the Bay Area ruled by the theonomic corporations is one of the best things I've read on the internet. I'd have liked more of this.

Props for giving an answer to theodicy. I didn't think the story would actually do it.

I now love biblical whale puns. It's my favorite genre of puns.

Interesting "local" puzzles (the way Unsong discovers the name generating computer, the mystery of the Panama canal, the angel library code, the secret of the seventh sail, the identity of the Captain - or at least the fact that Metatron possesses him sometimes). This is in contrast to the large scale puzzles, which are impossible to guess with any certainty (who is TOK? Why can Malia see Ana while she is invisible? What/who is the drug Lord? Which Golem(s) has Gadiriel created before Sarah? Why did the name stop working? It turns out that the Confounding name confounds people without them noticing and can rewrite Aaron's memories in such a way that he actually holds in his mind a valid mnemonic of 72 letters that makes sente o.O).

Most of Aaron's kabbahlistic rambling moments are great too.

The universe is colorful and interesting.

The distortions of real history are really great, and even better are the tidbits of real history/bible verses/talmud references so outrageous that they seem fake.

The broadcast chapter is great.

Chapter 72 is suitably bleak, especially the very last part. It did feel a little rushed, though.

The epilogue, even if very rushed contrasts nicely with the overly bleak ending of chapter 72 (even if Thamiel's role is a little obscure). It mixes nicely with the Blake references throughout the book.
