Remeber, current epoch humans are different from the humans that were created by god. Remeber how trees were redesigned to run on math? A similar process was undertaken for humans, designing them so that they could run without divine light, solely on math. Since we don't see any west Africans after Uriel's machine fails, it's impossible to say what effect that had on them.

What Sarah demonstrates, I think, is that you can artificially give anything, from dust to a computer, sentience with the ensouling name, and that with math you can also give things something equivalent to sentience, though not hooked up to whatever divine machinery cares about souls.
