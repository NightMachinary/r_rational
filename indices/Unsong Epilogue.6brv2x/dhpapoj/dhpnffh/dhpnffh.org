  Aaron's misinterpretation of the "fall of a bird" prophecy is irrealistic and out of character.

Aaron misinterpreting prophecies is TOTALLY in-character. See the 'Miss American Pie' interlude.

  The African soul inconsistency is never addressed: how come many africans don't have a soul and are perfectly ordinary humans while Sara turns into a general artificial intelligence the moment she receives hers?
#+end_quote

I don't think that's an inconsistency. It simply may be that having a soul is a sufficient, but not necessary condition for, um... let's call it 'apparent consciousness'.

But if we're talking inconsistencies, I can think of two major ones:

- The Shrouded Constitution anachronism
- We are told angels can't use Names, but the SCABMOM ritual contains an invocation of a Name. It seems Uriel shouldn't have been able to perform it with Sohu; this is never addressed.
