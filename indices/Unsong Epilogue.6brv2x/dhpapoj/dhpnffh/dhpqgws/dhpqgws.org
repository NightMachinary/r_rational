Regarding the Prophecy: first, does Aaron really misinterpret the American Pie that badly? He says some correct things, like God's judgement being suspended (hell is destroyed and all that). And we actually never get a completely explained version of the song. Second, father Ellis's interpretation is almost as wild as Aaron's and we only see him interpreting a bit of it (the bit he interprets is correct though).

On the other hand, for the prophecy of the bird you have: (1) the Cometspawn send for the Sercret of TOK shortly after Robin has died , leaving TCK brokenhearted (2) the prophecy talks about "the fall of a bird" (not even a sparrow! And while a robin isn't even a sparrow, a bird is) and (3) TCK listens to the prophecy and never tells anyone about it, for reasons. Both Aaron and Jinxiang completely fail to make the connection that was obvious the moment Robin was introduced... Try rereading that chapter knowing that TCK's wife is named Robin.

I still thought TOK was Acher (I gave it a higher probability than TOK, something like 50% vs 45%), though, mostly because if the characters failed to make this obvious inference then maybe I was in the wrong (also because of the other reasons I mention in the comment where I talk about the puzzles).
