So I think a fairly obvious takeaway is that Thamiel didn't actually enjoy being evil, he was just placed there to do it by God. His role as God's left hand is to be the root of all Evil; God creates Good which is perfection, and then places Thamiel in all these Universes so that he can act to create Evil. He doesn't enjoy doing it, but he has to.

“So many centuries,” it pled. “So much misery, so many tears, so many years of suffering. You couldn't imagine it, nobody could imagine it, but I did what God wanted, I did my duty, but you have to tell me, please, at the end of everything, did I do good?”

Anyone else think this parallels The Comet King really well? Having to become evil despite your own nature, putting on a disguise (Thamiel not showing his true self, TCK becoming TOK), having sex with Robin West, and being killed by your own weapon in the end so the world can be changed with the haMephorash.
