So -- people who read through to the end of this, how was it? I made it something like 14 or 15 chapters in (reading as each chapter was released, about a year ago), and really enjoyed certain parts of it, but other parts found really boring -- specifically when (as I recall) it would go into these multiple paragraph spiels on how (e.g.) there are 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, which is twice the number of attendees at The Last Supper and also the product of two primes, signifying the immutable theistic dualism implicit in the aforementioned event, and if you convert "immutable theistic dualism" to hex the first two digits are 69, a popular sex position where two lovers pleasure each other symmetrically, just like the soul and the body under ideal circumstances, which is made further relevant in the relation 2^{13} = 8,192, for 8192 is the precise length in KB of the program that governed the steering functions of the ship that in the 1969 lunar mission broke the firmament of being, demonstrating the conflict between humanity's scientific and spiritual progress, and the 8th, 1st, 9th, and 2nd letters in English spell HAIB, referring both to the Hawaii Association of International Buddhists and the Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, which represent the Soul and the Body, respectively, and HAIB is also an alternate, accented spelling of HEB, or the Epistle to the Hebrews, one of the major themes of which is the role of Jesus as mediator between Body and Soul, Etc. Etc. Etc.

I generally quite liked the worldbuilding and magic and munchkinry (and found the characters to be decent and the writing quality above average), but all of the numerological "fundamental interconnectedness of all things" asides made my eyes glaze over. Just wasn't for me... so I decided to put it down until it finished and ask someone as to the balance of the former things to the latter.
