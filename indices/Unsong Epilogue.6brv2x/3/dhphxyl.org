I think... I find this story disturbing on a personally existential level.... all of the horrific things the Comet King had to do because of some technicality that you have to be both evil to get into hell yet willing and able to use the Explicit Name to unmake it? A universe were science and math prove to be a shallow facade constructed by an angel that happens to really like math? The only consistent rule being the whimsical coincidences designed to barely redeem the universe enough from evil so that it is worth instantiating in the first place? And of course... all the puns.

The Epilogue... for some reason I don't quite trust the hive mind at the end to fix things. You have... a kabbalist obsessed with puns and bizarre reasoning enough to make would should have been totally irrational and impractical choices, a theologian who care so much about the answer to the problem of evil she would rather ask god that than ask for a way of fixing the world that is currently undergoing an apocalypse, two revolutionary without a cause willing to do violence for poorly thought out reasons, an archangel that had to be explained social skills and basic moral reasoning by a little girl, an very young AI obsessed with her creator... anyway, combining all of their minds, I guess I don't trust things to sort themselves out.

This story had a lot of fun elements, it was just uniquely disturbing at the same time, and I think I wasn't quite willing to suspend disbelief enough to trust that there was a theodicy or to trust Metatron's answer. From failure to suspend disbelief, other details seem a lot worse or more disturbing. For instance... why didn't they Comet King come up with the idea of using the telepathic connection to transfer knowledge of the Explicit name to people already in hell? If one person can't use it, then he could find the right combination of hell bound people, connect them telepathically before they die, and then redeem them after they die and go to hell. It makes the Comet King's wife's plan (or lack thereof) seem really stupid in comparison.
