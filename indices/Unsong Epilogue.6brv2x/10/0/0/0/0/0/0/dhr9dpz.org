I DISAGREE. URIEL IS CLEARLY THE BEST ARCHANGEL.

FOR ONE, MOST OF THE OTHERS ARE DEAD OR SOMEHOW USELESS. SECOND, URIEL MANAGED TO HOLD OFF THAMIEL FOR AROUND SIX THOUSAND YEARS, WHICH IS BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER ARCHANGELS COMBINED. THIRD, HE WAS THE ONLY ARCHANGEL WILLING TO TRY EXPLAINING THINGS TO HUMANS. FOURTH, HE HAS LEARNED ABOUT KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES.
