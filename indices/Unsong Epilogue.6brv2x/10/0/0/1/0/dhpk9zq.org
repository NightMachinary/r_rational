Like, there's a difference between "we're bonded now and so my soul has residence in your head after I die" and "We're bonded now so we can talk from far distances, even from the afterlife." It really should have come up when we were with Ana, after Erica died: it was intentionally vague as to how she knew what she knew, and it irks me a little that Erica didn't just go "Oh, hey, I guess I'm in your head now, that's weird huh?"
