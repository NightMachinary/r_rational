It was completely foreshadowed. Ana only knew about Malia's blood in Mark's locket because she had Erica and Dylan in her head. There were a couple lines devoted specifically to the feeling she got thinking about them that implied they were dead.

It had already been established that thoughts could be passed unconsciously with Sohu and the Vital Name.

It was all but confirmed, finally, when Uriel tells Sohu about how he made SKABMOM, and what it did. He specified that it would work even after death, even. (Edit: and then we saw it in practice with Uriel and Sohu, of course.)

While this was somewhat of a step beyond what had been shown previously, I think it was perfectly clear. Many other readers in the comments (though I will admit that they are the sharpest of all of us) also came to these same conclusions.
