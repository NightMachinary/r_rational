I thought it was beautiful. Honestly I thought the ending at the end of Ch 72 was perfect, but the epilogue added a nice extra touch of detail to it. I'm not sure what wasn't properly supported though? The only new idea that's introduced is the nature of Thamiel's withered head, everything else was set up in a previous chapter or a natural extension of the novel's themes.
