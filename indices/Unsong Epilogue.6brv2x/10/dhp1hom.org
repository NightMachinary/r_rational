I'll be completely honest, I feel like the epilogue comes completely out of left field in a lot of ways and lacks the necessary setup to work properly. I can see how it tries to resolve a lot of the remaining loose ends, but it doesn't really work out that well because it's both too short and not properly supported by the previous chapters.
