/Please bear in mind that I might be misinterpreting these "puzzles" as something that can be solved by the reader... This might or might not be Scott's intention./

The "puzzles" were "solved", because the answers were ultimately revealed somehow. I say they are unsatisfying because the story is crafted in a way that you almost have 50% evidence in favor or agains an answer, and no real way of deciding beforehand which answer seems more likely. While I understand that the author doesn't want us to guess the answer too soon, I think that on rereading, we should be able to find some clues pointing in that direction. I don't think this ever happens. Some examples:

- who is TOK? The only 2 pieces of evidence in favor of TCK are (1) why would a relative nobody kill someone who has drawn blood from Thamiel? and (2) why would Vihaan be in league with TOK? Everything else is either neutral or agains: TCK's body is recovered, and still the Cometspawn are fooled; there are loads of red herrings pointing towards Acher; TCK has said Robin that he can't just accumulate sin and kill himself and go to hell (yet he does exactly that in the end!); at one point, Sohu is seemingly memory wiped after Uriel tells her about Acher; TCK wants to maximize sin, yet he makes Las Vegas into a well run civilized city instead of a hive of scum and villainy. The prophecy can be interpreted either way (even if Aaron's interpretation is veeery unconvincing). While the few points in favor are pretty strong, I think this "puzzle" is unfair for the reader because there are equally good points against.

- the Identity of the Captain: same thing... The scene in Panama canal is cleverly crafted so that he can be either God (dog) or Nemo (omen), with no evidence pointing either way. He is the voice of God that never talks, except he is in human form and talks A LOT. Besides, he has a more active role than Aaron. He gets Father Ellis into the crew for some reason (to get Elijah into heaven?). The angels clearly say that metatron is on top of the golden sails of a purple ship (why? To fool the humans? Do angels even coordinate that much?).

- why did the sky crack? Well, apparently in a workd with a well defined magic system based on the Hebrew alphabet, reciting the bible in English has real world effects if it's done in space. This is disappointing after I've read the sentence again and again trying to find something that even sounded like Hebrew.

- who has betrayed the crew of the Not a Metaphor? You could roll the dice on this one. I have a comment in which I outline possible reasons for all the three passengers (I ultimately guess wrong), and on rereading the relevant chapters I can't find any clue that points in the right direction

- who is Malia? Well, this one actually has some hints, but only in the chapter where Robin sells her soul to the Devil. So this one might actually be a good puzzle.

- who is the human-like Golem created by Gadiriel? We get no hint at all in the right direction (Reagan? Really?), and it comes out of the blue, in an otherwise unremarkable chapter.

Again, maybe these are not to be taken as puzzles, and it's my mistake I read them as such. What I wanted to say is that (to me!) the story seems to setup a lot of puzzles that the reader doesn't have an opportunity to solve either rationally or kabbahlistically. Maybe you can get there with some knowledge if Blake's mythology?

Some things are left unanswered of course, but that's to be expected in a universe like Unsong. My point is that while the "puzzles" have answers, the are either not very satisfying or don't seem fair.
