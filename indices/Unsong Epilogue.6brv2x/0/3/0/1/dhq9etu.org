  who is TOK? The only 2 pieces of evidence in favor of TCK are (1) why would a relative nobody kill someone who has drawn blood from Thamiel? and (2) why would Vihaan be in league with TOK?

I am rereading Unsong now, and while I'm only partway through, I'm noticing many hints I missed the first time. There actually are a lot of hints for TOK=TCK in retrospect, long before the more obvious stuff. For example, Aaron discusses in the first 15 chapters or so the puzzling prophecies about the Mosiach and how there would be two, an evil one and a wicked one, and how he would either come in the most just or the most evil generation or both. (EDIT: there's even a discussion between TCK and Thamiel a few chapters later about the various messiahs and whether they are the same person) This looks like a throwaway bit of 'weird Talmud stuff', but of course, in retrospect it's obvious that it's quite literal: The Comet King is the good messiah (kabbalistically powerful and devoted to good) but he turns into the bad messiah TOK (equally kabbalistically powerful and devoted to evil), and the Unsong generation is the most wicked generation due to the world collapsing and Thamiel being active but also the most just one after the world gets rewritten into paradise by Aaron-Albion. TCK says when he breaks, he'll break like a comet: visible only to the most far-sighted but continuing on the same course (to destroy Hell) and how comets end in fire and destruction and the end of all things.

Likewise, Sarah and Tharmas's role is foreshadowed by the Rubaiyat "if we could grasp the world entire", the modal realism argument is foreshadowed /twice/ (in the discussion of the 'Digrammatron' and Aaron's discussion of Lurianic cosmology), and even the Captain being Metatron is foreshadowed repeatedly right from the start: while discussing stealing the boat, he is addressed as "Oh God" by future crew and he is described by Lin as "He is" when Ana asks his name. These are not coincidences etc.
