Sure, there are hints, but for every hint pointing in the right direction you often have /an equally convincing/ hint pointing in the wrong direction.

#+begin_quote
  Aaron discusses in the first 15 chapters or so the puzzling prophecies about the Mosiach and how there would be two
#+end_quote

I am aware of this prophecy. This sentence says that there would be two messiah, not one messiah that turns into another messiah. Of course you /can/ say that the sentence /is consistent/ with TCK=TOK, but I can't see how it tips the balance in favor of TCK=TOK (if anything, it hints toward the opposite conclusion). It is not quite literal. The literal meaning is that there are TWO messiah.

#+begin_quote
  TCK says when he breaks, he'll break like a comet: visible only to the most far-sighted but continuing on the same course (to destroy Hell).
#+end_quote

I'll grant you this one. This is a hint that even after being broken, TCK will want yo destroy Hell. Whether he will be able to or not is another question (he can't if he's been killed by TOK :p), but this sentence is probably a clue pointing the right direction.

  he is addressed as "Oh God" by future crew
#+end_quote

Couldn't find this one.

#+begin_quote
  and he is described by Lin as "He is" when Ana asks his name.
#+end_quote

This one is too good, especially after the part about the Right Hand of God xD I endorse this as evidence in favor of him being Metatron/God. It's funny that in the comments a commenter suggests that being Metatron is a possibility at this point, and I speculate on the fact that Nemo reversed becomes Omen. We were not that far from the truth. Hidden patterns everywhere.

But in the end, I think the arguments against (he's too active and talks too much) make this 50%/50%.

I don't really have an opinion on Sarah/Tharmas.
