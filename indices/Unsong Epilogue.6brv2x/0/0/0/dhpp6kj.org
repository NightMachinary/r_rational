I don't think your first point is a very serious one. It's just a "timing" issue, right? It can be solved by editing a couple of lines of dialog. A more serious timing issue is Ana's possession by the drug lord, which seems to happen several hours after the events in Vegas. Scott promised he would fix that one eventually (this one actually made me think that the Drug Lord was making an empty threat until Scott corrected me in the comments).

I had failed to notice your last inconsistency! This one's a big one. Maybe it could be solved by making Uriel use the name through some kind of celestial kabbahla (plucking the letters out of thin air) while Sohu says the name? That would be (more) consistent.

Regarding the African problem: it's serious in my opinion because at the time it seems to validate Aaron's perception that ensouling a computer is totally safe, as humans with or without souls are very similar. I thought the whole point of the Madrid conference was to show us that something else might be involved in making Sarah conscious, besides the Vital Name (God's intervention, Raziel behind the Scenes, etc).
