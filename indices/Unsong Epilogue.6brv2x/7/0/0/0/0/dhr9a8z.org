Eh, I wouldn't be too sad if a bunch of current politicians blew up.

My preferred method would be giant meteor applied at great velocity. This would accomplish two things: First, it would wipe out the entire political establishment, allowing us to start fresh. Second, it would convince whoever wound up in the replacement government that it would be a /really good idea/ to throw silly amounts of money at NASA.
