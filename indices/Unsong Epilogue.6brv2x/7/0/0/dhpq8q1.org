And this speech.

  “Media outlets,” said Dylan “are supposed to tell you the state of the world. But they can only do so much. Yes, the newspapers can tell you that the health system is failing, that there aren't enough scrolls with the Coagulant Name for everybody who needs them. They can give you all sorts of statistics, they can show you pictures of the corpses. All nice and well. But somehow, people just don't seem to get the message. Something has been lost. The widow wailing because her husband bled to death after a car accident, she's got something that the guy sitting in an armchair reading the paper hasn't. The widow understands what a shortage of the Coagulant Name means, understands what it means when the guy in the suit says that we can't lower the price or else it would ‘hurt innovation'. The guy in his armchair has been told, but he hasn't understood. A failure of communication, you see? Everywhere people suffer, and the media tells people, but they don't get it.

  “I have always thought we can do better. That's what we do here at BOOJUM Media, Ltd. You can talk about elephants all day long, but at some point if you want someone to understand you've got to take them to the zoo and throw them in the elephant cage. The only way to make people understand what it's like to live in fear is to make them live in fear. The only way to make people understand what it's like to suffer is to make them suffer. You can tell a Senator a thousand times that people are dying out there, but it's not until the Senator's colleague gets a letter-bomb that it sinks in. We're not just a media outlet. We're a boutique media oulet. We cater to the rich and famous, the elite. We give them a better class of service, the premium deal. The middle-class get to read about other people's suffering in the newspapers. But the rich? They deserve better! They deserve to experience a little piece of it, to have all the conflicts of the world packaged neatly in brown paper and brought to them in their own living room. It's the most elite media service in the world, and we do it all for free, all for the warm glow of knowing that we made a difference.”

I can /morally/ disagree, but I can't /rationally/ disagree. It just comes down to an emotional distaste for violence.
