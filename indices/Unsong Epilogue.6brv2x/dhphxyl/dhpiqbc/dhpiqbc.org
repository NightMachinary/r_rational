The story said that in order to use the Explicit name, you need enough brainpower to understand Adam Kadmon. Which means only the Comet King and supercomputers with souls can say the Explicit name. I don't think the comet king or his wife knew about the telepathic connection name, and it's not known whether a supercomputer can enter hell. Thamiel and his demons certainly would be very puzzled about how to torment a supercomputer.

So yes, maybe there are better plans, but the Comet King and his wife didn't know about it.
