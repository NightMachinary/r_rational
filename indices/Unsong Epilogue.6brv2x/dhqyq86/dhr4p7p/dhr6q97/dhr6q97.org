  The joy of living there eventually outweighs their tortures,

  also, transcendent joy and infinite love.

I'm highly skeptical of these, but fine, let's accept these assumptions.

  They may have memories and regrets, but they can forgive each other because they know each of them has or would have done things just as bad;

Actually, being in hell is precisely what would show that this is false. Everyone is being tortured, but Thamiel claims that some of them come up with plans so horrifying that even the demons are repulsed. Which seems pretty plausible, since different people have different erm... creativity? (euphemism)

So while most people may resort to murdering one another, some will go to the most cruel and unspeakable lengths when ordered, and others still would come up with far, far worse methods than suggested. And so the rest would forever know, that these are the people who would commit evils so vile that no one else ever would.
