The denizens of hell get to live in a hell transformed to heaven. Since death has metaphysical importance and hell is not a place on the normal plane of existence, they presumably stay there but aren't erased. The joy of living there eventually outweighs their tortures, and no one is tortured in the future, so the universe will become net good and justify its existence as part of the net-good multiverse. They may be suspicious initially but the Broadcast establishes that the false-hope always is yanked away quickly - the demons don't /need/ to stretch it out to be convincing because the damned are so desperate and are suckers. If anything, that implies that they will immediately believe in the Comet King's changes (because they're suckers, but this time they're right). They may have memories and regrets, but they can forgive each other because they know each of them has or would have done things just as bad; also, transcendent joy and infinite love.
