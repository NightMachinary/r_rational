Actually, after reading the epilogue again, I'm kinda confused by what happened. It felt like the epilogue chapter just had the words "Happy End" on it without any specific information, because they simply spoke the world-remaking word.

How exactly does that solve the problem of evil specifically? Thamiel may have been faking evil, but I doubt the rest of the denizens of hell were. What happens to them? Just erased and put out of their misery? Freed from hell only to have to live with their traumas and horrible suspicions that this is just another "hope trap" by the torture experts of hell?

And what of that little boy who came up with countless methods of perverse and horrific torture methods to use on his mother, and actually used them? Even if he's freed from hell, doesn't he still have to live with the memory and guilt of it? How would he interact with other people now that they all fear and revile him for his evils? How would he interact with the mother he tortured for millenniums? What specifically happened in the end to give him salvation?
