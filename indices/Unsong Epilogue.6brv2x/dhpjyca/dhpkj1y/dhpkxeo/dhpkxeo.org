Eh, this /really/ depends on your cosmology.

If you're following something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis][Tegmarkism]] (also, ironically, [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uk/beyond_the_reach_of_god/][Beyond the Reach of God]]), then the reality of a world depends purely on the mathematical law that describes it. As such, a God "creating" (computing, evaluating) it doesn't necessarily do anything at all - but it's also possible that there's a Tiplerian [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_Point][Omega point]] of complete self-observation at the end of the universe, which is necessary for that universe to be /"actually real"/. As such, God could offer Job to never have existed /and have that be a meaningful offer/ because the universe's reality depends on an ultimate point of observation rather than an ongoing act of creation. So there's room here, philosophically, for God's offer to be plausible.
