I don't think you and I have read the same story. The point of the universe isn't to create a pretty leviathan, in fact there is no point at all. (U)God didn't create our universe with any intention of it being good, (U)He created it because he was trying to see if it would even function in the first place. When (U)He saw that, by it's internal consistency alone, the world would eventually be wholly good in accordance to (U)His wishes he let it run, in spite of the fact that it is pretty much a bug in the overall scheme of All Things That Are. The most complicated and wonderful bug that (U)God ever laid eyes on. There's this promise that It will all be worth it. When Job sees what (U)He means, he agrees.
