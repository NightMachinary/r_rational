I'm aware that the Unsong God also mentioned a bunch of other "wonders" and "goodness" like the behemoth and the fox and the bear and the saints. But there's a whole bunch of other Unsong chapters that suggest the Unsong god is obsessed with the Leviathan, to the point where the only way to meet the Unsong god is to chase the Leviathan. That's not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence (according to Unsong). Hence the Leviathan must be the main "wonder" or "goodness" that the Unsong god cares about, which means it's not wrong to say that he let the universe seed grow because it would create a pretty leviathan.

Which part of this argument do you find incorrect?
