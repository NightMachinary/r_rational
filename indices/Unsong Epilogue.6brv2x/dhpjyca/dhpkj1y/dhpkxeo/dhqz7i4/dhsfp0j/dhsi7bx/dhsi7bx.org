  When Job sees what (U)He means, he agrees.
#+end_quote

No, no he did not. I can even quote it from the chapter. When the Unsong God said he let Job get covered in boils and suffering so that he could also have things of beauty that will glorify his holy name, and that Job would just have to shut up put up with it until Job dies and gets sent to heaven, Job said, and I quote:

#+begin_quote
  “That's not a fucking lot of consolation, God.”
#+end_quote

And then you know what happened? The Unsong God basically went full intimidation mode. Full "I HAVE DONE AMAZING THINGS. I KNOW AMAZING THINGS! YOU DON'T!" And then said that utterly atrocious line about how he can erase Job's world just so he wouldn't have boils. And then the Unsong god even showed Job all of the pictures of the people who would get erased if Job continued complaining that he didn't want boils.

After which of course Job agreed. Because not agreeing would send the Unsong God on a murder spree erasing his entire world, and Job actually has the morals to not let such evils happen.

  The point of the universe isn't to create a pretty leviathan He created it because he was trying to see if it would even function in the first place.
#+end_quote

Technically true, but what the Unsong God did isn't that different: He didn't "create" the universe to create a pretty leviathan, he created it, THEN saw that it would create a pretty leviathan and decided to let it run, even though it would also create plenty of evil.

  )He saw that, by it's internal consistency alone, the world would eventually be wholly good in accordance to (U)His wishes he let it run, in spite of the fact that it is pretty much a bug in the overall scheme of All Things That Are.

Quote from Unsong:

#+begin_quote
  I BEHELD ADAM KADMON, THE SEED OF YOUR WORLD, AND SAW THAT IT WAS A GOOD SEED. THAT IT WOULD GROW INTO MORE GOOD THAN EVIL.
#+end_quote

In other words, he decided that the universe that would grow from that seed would contain lots of evil, but also lots of good, and so refused to stop the seed from growing. Now, what does the Unsong God consider to be "good" things? He specifically describes the seed as quote:

#+begin_quote
  YOURS WILL GROW INTO A THING OF BEAUTY THAT WILL GLORIFY MY HOLY NAME.
#+end_quote

And then goes on to describe a list of "wonders" that the seed has created, including:

#+begin_quote
  AND THE LEVIATHAN WHO RESIDES IN THE SEA.
#+end_quote

In other words, the Unsong God considers leviathans to be things of beauty that glorify his holy name, and so willingly grows seeds of suffering if they also create an adequate amount of "wonders" like leviathans and behemoths. In short: he let the universe (with plenty of suffering) grow, because leviathans (and other "wonders") are pretty (things that would glorify his name).
