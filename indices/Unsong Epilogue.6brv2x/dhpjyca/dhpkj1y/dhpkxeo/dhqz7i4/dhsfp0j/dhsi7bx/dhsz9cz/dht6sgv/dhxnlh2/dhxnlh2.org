Leviathan may be the GREATEST wonder but it is not the MAIN wonder. God let the universe exist because the NET goodness would eventually upset the good-evil balance. Also, the whole "obsession" with Leviathan JOKES were made by a bunch of guys JOKING AROUND that god liked his big fish. Also, the way to meet god is chasing (U)METATRON, and he is with leviathan. Also, the last chapter explains that Leviathan's Kabalistic meaning is "the world", because it is so grand that it is as great a metaphor to (U)God as the rest of the entire world is. I don't even know why I'm bothering to keep responding to you.
