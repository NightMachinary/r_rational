I just found this story recently, and while the ride was entertaining, I found myself very unsatisfied with God's answer to Job in chapter 71.

I have always found "sacrifices for the greater good" to not be acts of good, but rather acts of desperation. People sacrifice for the greater good because as puny mortals, people see or have no better options, and fear that if they do not, the world will fall into ruins and everyone will suffer.

To see the omniscient and omnipotent God of Unsong operating on the same logic is utterly terrifying, significantly more so because it could also be true in reality. And also incredibly disgusting, because Unsong's God explains that he gave Job tremendous suffering, not for reasons like saving the world, but for reasons like making a beautiful Leviathan.

I don't think the garden of worlds metaphor properly describes how horrible this is, so let's try another. Imagine the multiverse is a computer, and each world is a picture. A JPG, BMP, PNG, or whatever. The Unsong God states that the Leviathan is a thing of beauty, so say we have a file Leviathan.JPG, which is a picture of the leviathan with a plain white background, i.e., a world that contains only the leviathan and nothing else. He could make two such worlds, but that's like just copying Leviathan.JPG, so now he has two copies of one picture, not two pictures.

So the Unsong God decides, let's make a new picture, LeviathanAndJob.JPG, which still has the Leviathan in the foreground, but behind it is Job, covered in boils and all other manner of suffering. That's a different picture, so now the Unsong God has two beautiful Leviathans. In essence, the Unsong God created Job and all his suffering to be the foil. The contrast for his picture. And considering all the discussion about minor permutations, the Unsong God probably has a full folder of distinct LeviathanAndStuff.JPGs, each with a different hellscape behind the Leviathan, just so he can have a bunch of beautiful Leviathans on his multiverse computer.
