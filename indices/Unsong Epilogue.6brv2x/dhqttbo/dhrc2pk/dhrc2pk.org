"A simple example would be that 11/24 hours you spend in Hell, and 13/24 hours you spend in Heaven" That is not true: the proportion is whatever it needs to be to be juust acceptable. For instance, it may be that you need 20 hours of Heaven to outweigh 4 hours of Hell.

And actually, it may be that any 'just right' equilibrium is just not acceptable: in the universe we are seeing, there has been a finite time in which there was a Hell, and there is (presumably) an infinite time into the future in which the universe will be unquestionably good-optimized. And this is one of the worst universes possible. So maybe the utility function is such that the only 'net good' acceptable is an infinite good of a higher order than whatever evil (infinite or finite) you have.
