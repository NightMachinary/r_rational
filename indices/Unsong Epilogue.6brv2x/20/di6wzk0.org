Picked this up a few days ago, but while it started pretty good and I really enjoyed the humor and interactions between the two mc's, I can't help but feel 24 chapters in that it has gotten really annoying (though the humor mostly remains).

What annoys me the most is the incessant perspective changes breaking the characters narratives at inopportune, cliffhanger-ish, moments.

Worse yet is that it is jumping wildly between not only /who/, but also /when/, without any clear indicators aside from a number at start of chapter for the year ...which I can't remember who is when anyway. The /who/ is what is needed, though it doesn't help that sometimes there are flashbacks which aren't too apparent until a bit into it (slightly related, author loves to skirt around who certain named characters are such as com+ik+et king, artificially forcing them to feel "mysterious" and slowly revealing through incessant flashbacks).

Some chapters even lack an indication of who it is until a name is dropped maybe halfway in, although this is not always the /mc's/ name (and sometimes this was the case for entirely new characters not introduced so far), and there was a chapter just recently which failed to make it apparent who were speaking until the very end (thamiel addressing the un).

Aside from the incessant perspective switches, there are far too many references that seem to require the reader to have deep knowledge of judaism and related theism, or even related /languages/, while lacking proper author notes for making sense of it. Worse is when those parts are clearly important to both plot and the humor (which is so good I managed to reach 24 chapters before giving up), in particular I remember a chapter which ended in some non-english phrase that from context I could only assume to be the entire punchline to the chapter culminating in a joke. After digging through comment-field it might possibly have been a whale-joke, although I am not entirely certain as even there it wasn't mentioned in any greater depth.

This lack of understanding of some references is only made /worse/ by the lack of author notes (and this time I include comment-field unlike last time I mentioned such notes). It is to the extent I saw a reader ask about author notes, whose comment received the answer (from author) that it would be /Bad Practice/ for the author to make the references more accessible for readers foreign to the languages used.

Admittedly, I do agree it might be so for /symbolic/ things such as characters names, but I can't for those references literally spelled out to the readers, provided they know hebrew or have knowledge in judaism beyond what was touched upon in social studies grades 1-9 (which honestly is not a lot). Yes, technically its all symbolism in this novel, but you can probably infer my meaning if I add that symbolism for names tie differently to the plot, than when a character actually /says/ something where its obvious all characters in the story understands and only reader is left out.

But I obviously can't obviously complain about the /bad/ parts, nor will I. As I mentioned before, the humor is great and reminds me a bit of terry pratchett (especially uriels all-caps). The amount of symbolism author manages to get into the story is astounding even when just considering the stuff I /do/ get, at least if I do some concessions for unknown phrases such as /kabbalist/ or /torah/ and other terms which one can decode from context with fairly high certainty.

I also must laud author for building up a vivid world with a few characters who hold interesting chemistry/interaction (particularly liked the whale-pun segments with 2 mc's), though the descriptions can get rather long-winded and tedious (like when san fran was compared to jerusalem).

And, the absolute *best* part, fittingly saved for last, are the two repeated catchphrases of how /The todium is all kinds of crazy/ (I def. botched the spelling on that one), and how /Nothing is ever a coincidence/.

EDIT: almost forgot, I felt like author were often trying to make jokes related to american geography. I did not get those at all unless context were obvious (like when talking about jerusalems garbage dump and comparing to what I am assuming is some suburb in america). This is one of the things I mentioned could /really/ have used some author-notes, particularly as context sometimes implied something was a /fictional area/ with symbolic or humoristic importance instead, but I just couldn't be sure.
