Well, now that it's over, my opinion on the story as whole:

It was a very fun and clever story, the last time I'd cracked up so much was while reading The Seventh Horcrux and that was explicitly a crackfic. If someone had told my I'd like a story with such an abundance of puns I wouldn't have believed them.

The most impressive part were the incredibly convoluted coincidences Scott managed to bring up. I can hardly imagine how much research that took.

The various ideas in the story were very cool, from the brute forcing of magic words, the mechanics of placebomancy, and the drugs effects on reality. The angels were really interesting too.

I also quite enjoyed Sohu and Uriel's story. Ana's and the Comet King's were good too.

At this point however, we get to my criticism. One storyline I thought was mostly pointless was that of Boojum. I mean, sure, it ended up being important that Mark got Malia's blood, but that whole thread feels like it could have been replaced by something simpler without much being lost. I liked Malia's story and I wish we could have seen more of her, but the Boojum crowd mostly seemed to be there to react to Dylan's antics.

And finally, another weak point was Aaron. I don't know if it was intentional, but mostly his role in the story is to be there while important things happen, being done by other people. He had a couple of moments of brilliance, like when he escaped from Unsong or when he used Aramaic against the Drug Lord, but mostly he was just there, moving from one place to another while somebody else did the stuff that actually mattered.

On the whole, I quite liked it and I thank Scott for writing it.
