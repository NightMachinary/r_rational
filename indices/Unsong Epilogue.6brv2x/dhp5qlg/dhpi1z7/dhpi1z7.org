My problem with the series as a whole is that it's not always more than the sum of its parts. I felt that way about BOOJUM in particular; I liked the chapters, but they felt like they were a separate story that had been welded onto this one. (Many of the chapters are adapted into Unsong from previous things that Scott has written, so perhaps that's literally the case.)
