I just realized you can make a Utility Monster for any "goodness" function of God, and have a Universe that is 49.9...% minimizing the goodness function, and the rest of the time maximizing it, and that universe will exist...

A simple example would be that 11/24 hours you spend in Hell, and 13/24 hours you spend in Heaven.

This is a universe that exists in UNSONG.
