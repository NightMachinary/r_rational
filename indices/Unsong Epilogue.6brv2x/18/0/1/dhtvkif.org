The thought that I immediately have in response to that is "Better is one day in Your courts than thousands elsewhere."

This is not an encouraging sentiment, as it echoes the idea of the sinner, tormented in Hell for years, then told that it was all a mistake, and brought up to Heaven... and just when the traumatized victim is starting to believe it's really over, the floor drops out from under them and they're back in Hell.

You could, of course, come up with some numerical weighting of the 'goodness' function that suggests this is acceptable. Such math doesn't stop it from being horrible, though.
