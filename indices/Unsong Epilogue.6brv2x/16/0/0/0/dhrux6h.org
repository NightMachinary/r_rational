  I'm highly skeptical of these, but fine, let's accept these assumptions.

Why would you be skeptical? An entire chapter is set in SF with transcendent joy and infinite love, and the outweighing follows directly from the theodicy.

  So while most people may resort to murdering one another, some will go to the most cruel and unspeakable lengths when ordered, and others still would come up with far, far worse methods than suggested. And so the rest would forever know, that these are the people who would commit evils so vile that no one else ever would.

And some people are more athletic and others are smarter and whatnot. Why would being a little more creative matter at all compared to /infinite/ love and /transcendent/ joy?

(Seriously, of all the criticisms of Unsong so far...)
