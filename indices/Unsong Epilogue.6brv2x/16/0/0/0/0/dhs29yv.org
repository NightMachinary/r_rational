  Why would you be skeptical? An entire chapter is set in SF with transcendent joy and infinite love, and the outweighing follows directly from the theodicy.

An entire chapter in SF showing people being brainwashed into professing infinite love and transcendent wisdom by LSD, and the rest of the world being so terrified that they have built a blockade around SF, and Metatron himself having to come running to save Erica from the infinite love of LSD? And of Neil Armstrong tricking unwilling people into having his "infinite love" in a way that's eerily similar to how the Ziggurat-maniac drug lord formed his Peyote slaves? Yes, that is exactly why I'm skeptical.

  And some people are more athletic and others are smarter and whatnot. Why would being a little more creative matter at all

It was a euphemism for unspeakable amounts of evil orders of magnitude more than the average person. It's not a "little" more. We're talking about things so horrible that they weren't shown in the torture broadcast, because even the demons were repulsed. Things so utterly unforgivable, that you gotta be like pumped full of LSD to even consi- Oh.

Well I suppose if the whole world was so high that they don't care about anything, anything is forgivable.

  (Seriously, of all the criticisms of Unsong so far...)

My criticism here is that these issues were never addressed. Apart from Thamiel going "PUNK'D! I WAS GOOD THIS WHOLE TIME!", we got pretty much no information about what happened to the people in hell.

Hell was basically the main point of everything in the story: the moment hell was discovered, all the utilitarians dropped everything to save people in hell. Starving people in africa? Dying people in hospitals? Screw them, UNSONG it up to fight hell! Yet in the end we aren't told anything about what happened to the people in hell, other than the Comet King saying the explicit name, and even that wasn't explicitly stated, just Aaron's best guess of what would happen.
