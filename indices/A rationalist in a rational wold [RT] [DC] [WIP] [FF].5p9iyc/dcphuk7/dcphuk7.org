I was expecting him to end up in a futuristic rational world, suddenly realizing that actually the protagonist here was the person he swapped with, who will use his hyper rationality to change the world.\\
Whereas on the other hand he will probably end up living off basic income as a social outcast because everyone else in this world is so much more clever and sophisticated that they would never want anything to do with him.

It would be kind of a funny genre inversion, though making a story about someone who ends up in a world where they're comparatively stupid and have no special powers would be hard to stretch into a story.
