There are already people in our own world who have maxed out on rationalizing optimizing things. Rationally exploiting the inefficiencies of the market in a positive sum game manner (and negative sum game manner) is called "finance". Trying to advance the overall current state of knowledge requires extensive background study (a "undergraduate degree") and extensive mentoring to learn how to read the latest knowledge, format your studies to be submitted into the latest knowledge, and then get funding for your research (a "PhD"). And so on for numerous skill area. Their is room for people with totally original ideas who are willing to skip all the steps and go straight to producing them,"entrepreneurship", however these people need to raw charisma to win private funding, the work ethic to work massive amount of time, the skill to implement their idea, and the perseverance when their first idea fails and the need to get back up into their second idea.

Conversely, in a fantasy world, their may be a lot of low hanging fruit if your science knowledge and Earth education provides a good source of new ideas. The excitement or desperation of being thrust into a new world may, at least initially, force the work ethic to actualize these knowledge and ideas. The laws of physics of Earth are fairly circumscribed in what we know they allow, no entropy violations and such. Whereas the laws of magic of a fantasy world may have entirely unexplored applications and methodologies, just waiting for someone to try the right things to get to them. Thus a fantasy world and/or magic represents vast possibilities that simply don't exist on Earth. In actuality, it is possible that a fantasy world might already have researchers who have found all the low hanging fruit and the only thing left is even harder discoveries that require more background knowledge and resources than a PhD on Earth does, but then again, maybe not. Also, even in a medieval world, if the protagonist can leverage their uniqueness into just a small advantage, they may be able to carve out social status for themselves, which is a nice fantasy (even though they are objectively worse off without running water, electricity, etc.).
