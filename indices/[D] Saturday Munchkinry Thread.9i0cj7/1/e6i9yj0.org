So recently I've been thinking about "Avada Kedavra" as an offensive spell. In a universe where the magical rules are more in tune with the natural ones, it would obviously be horribly inefficient. If we assume it takes proportional magical energy to destroy something containing that magical energy, what would the optimal offensive spells be, and what form would they take (beam, projectile, gas, shock wave etc)?

Ground rules:

1. Larger area of effect = larger cost.

2. Each spell can have multiple layered effects, up to 3.

3. Spells can either be static or dynamic. A dynamic spell will fulfill it's effect whether or not it hits the correct place on the body. Static spells must hit the correct body part. Dynamic spells are more taxing.

4. Effects follow a semi-realistic system. Destroying something is more taxing than displacing it (to a point), creating something is more taxing than altering something. Heating is more efficient than cooling. You can set things on fire, cut them, explode them, glue them together, inflict pain, cramps, change properties, induce actions etc. Be creative, and think common sense when it comes to mana cost.

Example spells (just to jog your imagination)

Blood boil: A projectile that boils the blood around the area struck. Static. Two effects, applying heat (1) to a specific area (2). Not very taxing, due to its simple effect and specific scope.

Glue: A 30 yard 45* degree shock wave attack. Victims body is stuck to anything it touches, including itself. Lips, fingers, etc. One effect, attachment. Expensive to cast, because of its large area and unspecific scope.

Avada Kedavra: Beam that instantly stops every cell in the victims body from engaging in further chemical reactions resulting in instant death. 1 effect, altering cells. Impossible to cast, because of its expensive effect (alteration) and scope (every single cell).

If you need clarification just tell me, but feel free to post your ideas even if you're not sure. My rules are probably full of holes so I'd appreciate any suggestions. The point here is for you guys to find all the obviously broken stuff so i can patch it up.
