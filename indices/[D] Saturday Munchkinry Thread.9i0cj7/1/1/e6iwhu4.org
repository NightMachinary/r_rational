Most effective combat spells are probably a dynamic one that makes tiny cuts severing specific nerves. Another effective spell would be one that induces an air embolism. An effective static one shoots or sprays hot sparks that effect a very limited area but are hot enough to ignite on contact. Flashbangs should be cheap as well.

It seems that based on the versatility every offensive spell would have a specific counter defense. If you think someone is going to flay your skin then you can make an enchantment to keep your blood in or hold your skin together before the fight. How many defenses you can keep up and offenses you can make for each fight is going to vary based on your magical power. Wizard combat could be a bit like rock, paper, scissors though it depends a bit on whether you can make contingent spells and the relative efficiency of defenses and attacks.
