  Air embolisms would be powerful as well, but that constitutes creation. So I'm not sure which is best.

An air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists favoring entry of gas. You don't need to create the air when you can force it through capilliaries or some other entry point.
