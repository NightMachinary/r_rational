Suppose you have a character John that has an inborn ability to time travel by just thinking about when he wants to go back to and has grown up always able to fix his mistakes.

No time limits. No travel count limits. Sends his mind back to his younger body. Cannot go forward. If he dies, it's permanent.

Let's not make John rational/ist because such a character would have infinite time to think and it's going to be as hard to predict as AGI, but this time the FOOM period is 0 seconds. Instead we have Alice who John talks to. Since John can simply rewind time if he screws up, he has no fears about confiding his ability to Alice (even though it could actually be dangerous. Think how Zach in MOL talked with everyone). Alice does some quick tests and finds that John does indeed have this ability. Alice realises major implications of this but must tread carefully, because it is all to easy for John to back out in an instant.

You are Alice. What are your objectives and how do you achieve them?

Eg:\\
a) You are convinced that it's a terrible ethical problem for John to exist, so you must find a way to kill him and you cannot afford any chance of failure.\\
b) You would benefit greatly from exploiting his abilities, but so would anyone else. How do you convince him you're more important, trustworthy, etc?

EDIT: added details to the ability. Elaborated on the task.
