(a): John's abilities /should not/ present any sort of ethical problem. But if he needs to be killed, the obvious way to do so is with a painless poison that will kill him in his sleep.

(b): Appeal to alturism. Find a way to leverage his abilities to help not me personally, but the world as a whole. Memorising lottery numbers and donating the winnings to charity is one option but there are so many more ways to benefit from the ability to bring information into the past. Wait until a scandal breaks and then go back, armed with certain phone numbers, to make sure that the scandalous activity in question either never happened at all, or was stopped almost at once.

From John's point of view, he can travel to the past. From Alice's point of view, John can bring information from the future.
