Well, it all depends, if he is a somewhat decent guy, teach him stuff and train.

If not, get him drunk and kill him in his sleep.

If he is somewhat decent, I would try to convince him of forming that organization. Since he would do all the work in the past and can't come back asking for question, he would need to do it mostly by himself. I would advice him, to get some decent lieutenants, who do most of the work.

So my todo list for him: 1. Go to this time, and write down following instructions: 2. buy lottery ticket with that number 3. employ these guys for your organization (via pay phone) 3a. tell them to kill these guys at time/locations 3b. tell them to infiltrate these companies/countries/organisations 3c. tell them to start propaganda campaign 4. go to university and learn what you like (economics, biology, physics, programming, math or painting) 5. when you see an opportunity to achieve a goal or make the world better, use your power to make sure you can use it. 6. work some jobs (waiter, mechanic or whatever) 7. come back to me

I mean, I don't know John. I don't even know how old he is or in which country he lives or how far back he can go. And honestly John would be pissed at me, cause I would try to talk him into time travel suicide/murder.

Also he would get sick of me, trying to convince him to go vegan and make a vegan propaganda cartoon in the past.

Now more realistic, I would look up, what other people did after the earliest time John could do something actively (like after he learned to walk) and convince John to let his organization do this. Like the Bill& MelindaGates Foundation who fights against some diseases. Or smallpox. Some enviroment laws lobbying, before the products, we made the laws for, get to the market.
