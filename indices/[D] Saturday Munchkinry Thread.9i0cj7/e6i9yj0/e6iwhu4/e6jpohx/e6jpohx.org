All good ideas. Severing nerves is probably the most efficient way to render someone helpless. Air embolisms would be powerful as well, but that constitutes creation. So I'm not sure which is best.

I'm thinking of making things have a "magical density", meaning that certain materials and things require more mana to affect. So the brain, nerves, heart etc would be harder to affect than a lump of wood equal in size.

  Wizard combat could be a bit like rock, paper, scissors though it depends a bit on whether you can make contingent spells and the relative efficiency of defenses and attacks.

This is sort of how i envisioned it would turn out as well. Not sure how i want to make the general costs of defense vs offense. On one hand, offensive spells have to move, and be launched outside the wizard's body, which would accrue some cost.

On the other, some defensive spells have to be applied to the whole body, and they have to be maintained (generally speaking). I'm leaning towards making defensive spells less costly, as they are a counter. Maybe by making them only trigger once, or a set amount of times (according to wizard).

I assume knowledge of the opponent would be priceless in this situation. Knowing an opponents favored offensive spells and wards would practically win you the fight. Even knowing stuff like his home country or family might give you a clue to what meta he follows. In the same vein spontaneity would be powerful as well.
