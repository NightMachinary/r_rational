He can time travel or he can send his present mind back into his past body? Can he go to the future?\\
Cause I think that is important.

I would convince him to have a child (not sure if with me, cause giving birth sucks) or better more children. And to let his ability be tested. Try to find the mechanism. (And steal it for myself.^^ And some decades later give as many as possible that power. )

Other than that, try to make him smarter, and teach him to think before acting. Also give him the reflex to go back in time (1hr or some days), if he panics/gets threatened. Assuming he is a decent human being.

Next get some money via betting and lotteries then invest it (in the past). Start an organization that influence the world for him/me/us. (They get told they work for aliens with a predictive algorithm or some other bullshit.)

Now no clue what technology he could jumpstart. But whatever he does, he should tell his organization, which would give the knowledge to someone else. Let's start with internet and rockets. Maybe cheap food or cloned meat.

And whenever a war breaks out send the organization some years before out for non-violent activism and peace propaganda. (Depending what the cause and reason for the war is. Maybe send assassins.)

Of course in RL I would tell John to go back in time and kill himself, so we/he can find out what happens.
