Question is, why would John care? He doesn't need to be rational to know he's omnipotent and he's had (more than) a lifetime to develop methods of exploiting time travel to manipulate people. For all you know, he could've talked to you already and knows exactly how to act to get you to think he's a good person. He could be repeating the last few seconds of your conversation hundreds of times until you give the response he wants. And why would he care about the welfare of humanity when all of his progress would be wiped when he goes back in time?
