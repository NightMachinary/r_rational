Study neuroscience, create a spell to nudge a specific part of the brain that will kill the individual. The spell would ideally be invisible, work from any point of contact (i.e. it hits the body, locates the brain, and only applies the force there). If that's pseudo-science, you could probably still do something similar. If vital organs are too magically dense, with a whole lot of study you could probably create a spell that can use quantum tunnelling(magically created, but itself non-magical enough to bypass the magical density defence), or simply travel between atoms until it reaches its destination, at which point it non-magically expands and damages the target.

Outside of something of that style, the best thing I think would be something like a micro railgun to shoot holes in heads. With magic, you can easily apply a lot of force to even something very light, potentially even cancelling air resistance completely. Thus, almost the only thing the spell needs to be able to do is produce enough kinetic energy to pierce somebody's skull. Even just air particles held together by magic could work.

To avoid stuff like this you could introduce an extra cost to extremely precise spell work, i.e. really large and really small effects both take a lot of power.
