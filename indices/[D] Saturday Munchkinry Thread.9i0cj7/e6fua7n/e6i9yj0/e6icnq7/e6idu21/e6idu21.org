In the original HP I'd agree. With my modified rules i could see a few situations where you'd need something else.

If you're outnumbered spell incantation speed isn't the only important factor, but also cost. It depends on the method, but knocking someone out would probably be pretty costly (most effective method would probably be by pain, unless you know some other easy way to turn someone unconscious). It doesn't matter if you're able to knock 10 enemies out in 10 seconds if it leaves you out of energy against the other 10.

Counters are also a big thing. There are wards against offensive spells, and most the popular offensive spells would probably also have the most extensive wards. People also know how to play around it.

Knocking someone out also isn't permanent. If you're vs a group they could just go around waking each other up, with magic if need be.
