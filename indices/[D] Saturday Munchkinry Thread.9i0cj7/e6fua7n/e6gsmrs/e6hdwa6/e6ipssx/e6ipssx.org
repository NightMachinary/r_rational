It's far more rational to assume that he's average, good, or the mundane / shitty sort of evil than a supervillain trying to maximize harm. This situation appeals to all the vast majority of people:

- Get rich quick (that appeals to virtually everyone).

- You have so much money that it's now meaningless. (It could eventually break through to most people).

- Make everyone love you through works of charity. (Again, this appeals to most people).

​

I really think that a selfish person who wants to maximize positive fame with the ability to eventually choose the most efficient path is almost indistinguishable from someone who is perfectly altruistic. And as to the question of what is he manipulating you, well why is it important that he is doing so? The most obvious answer would be to sleep with you; well, a selfish person with the ability to redo actions until they maximize effect would present as no different than an incredibly attentive partner who naturally knows your needs.

​

In the vast majority of cases, motivation doesn't really matter unless they're a psychopath. The ability to maximize the affect of actions means that if you can convince them to do great works of good by spending something that is essentially meaningless, there's no difference. The only difference is if they want to maximize harm; which isn't the way the vast majority of people work. The probability of net gain far outweighs the probability of harm.
