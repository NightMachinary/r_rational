The way to divvy up the Visitors, using the infinitely branching hotel, would go something like "One, you get a room in the small hotel, so that way you aren't alone in your own infinite branch of the larger one. Everybody else, at each branch, remember the number of branches you've already passed, and think of that digit of your name. If it's even, go to the left, and if it's odd, go to the right. Once your at a branch and have finished your name, you've found your room." Right?
