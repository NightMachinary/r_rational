Not so. 0.1 and 0.3 would end up in the same room, and so would 1/3 and 1/9. In fact, infinitely many would end up in every infinitely far room, except poor lonely One. One doesn't need to be alone, though. They can find their room by their other name, 0.999... But /every/ finitely representable Visitor has another decimal name! 0.5 and 0.4999... will go to different rooms, so where should 1/2 go?

If you want a scheme like that, it'd be better to represent their names in binary and go off that. Then there will be only one Visitor per room. But remember that their names aren't ever really "finished". There's no rule that infinitely repeating zeroes is different from anything else, except by convention. But then everyone ends up infinitely far from the entrance with infinite wasted space, which is inelegant, so I guess you can keep that convention. And of course, every finitely representable Visitor has two binary names as well, one with infinitely repeating zeroes, one with infinitely repeating ones! Well, Zero only has the one, but that's more because of how we write numbers than because of anything Zero does special. If you add another special case for that, your rules are starting to look really ad hoc and unnatural...
