Yeah, although Part 5 definitely gives you a real sense of what it actually means for something to represent a different order of infinity at it's most fundamental level.

And /that/ I think is the real payoff for this entire mini-series/playlist. Also it gives you a good feel for what exactly Vihart's whole [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iUh_CSjaSw]["Anti-pi" rant]] is REALLY all about. I freaking love it.
