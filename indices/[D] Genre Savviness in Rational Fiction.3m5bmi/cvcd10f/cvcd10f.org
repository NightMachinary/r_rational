A tangential question, based on what I /thought/ this post was going to be about before clicking it: presuming that "rational fiction" /is itself/ a genre... then there would be "rational fiction tropes." Could there, therefore, be a character who is /savvy to the fact that they are a character in a ratfic/? If so, would that mean doing anything differently, if they were already planning on being a rational, motivated consequentialist as their naive level-zero strategy?

One thing that leaps to mind is that the naive "shounen rationalist" usually attempts to bootstrap themselves into a force capable of saving the world or somesuch. From the rational fiction I've read so far, genre-savvy in this case would involve realizing that there's probably going to be at least one agent already capable of doing what you want to do (because there has to be something to serve as an entertaining final challenge for the hero)---and it's likely much easier to take control of/backdoor/charm that agent than to grind yourself up to its level first. To use a metaphor, it is much more effective to "sequence-break" the narrative than to do all the harrowing skin-of-your-teeth engaging stuff involved with doing a "100% speedrun" of the narrative. You could very easily "win" /HPMOR/ or /Worm/ or most other original rational stories right at the beginning by just befriending exactly one character left originally ignored until the late-game. (This comes, a bit, from the relationship between rational fiction and detective fiction: in both, it is bad form for an author to "solve" the story using a character or item that was only introduced near the end. Because of this, the solution to the story is usually /accessible/ in the story-setting from fairly early on.)

Any others?
