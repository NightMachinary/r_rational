That's true if you're one of the protagonists, or working based on a design drafted by one of the protagonists. I notice that there's almost a "conservation of intelligence" effect in rational fiction: the protagonists and antagonists get all the brains. There are no unallied factions; no Tom Bombadil characters, wandering around with all the mental firepower but no desire to use it; and no paperclipper-agents doing powerful works at /orthogonal/ purposes, heroes of their own stories, but potentially allies /or/ enemies in the protagonist's.

I think a big "hole" in the current selection of rational fiction is that every character is forced to either have everything in the set of {intelligent, rational, well-read, consequentialist, motivated, heavily-empathetic-to-in-group} or none of it. There are no brilliant lazy people, no motivated idiots, no deontological rationalists, no selfish do-gooders, etc. In other words, the stories so far are very bare-bones demonstrations of what it's like to be a complete rationalist, instead of making any attempt at highlighting particular /aspects/ of optimal thinking.

This might be the reason a lot of rational fiction feels so "same-y"; everyone is trying to write the same poem about an entire tree, rather than focusing on a particular branch or leaf or bit of bark. And there are no ensemble stories, either---anthologies of poems to cover the tree in combination.
