The truth is that genre savviness is an absurd proposition, for the /exact/ same reason that so many things rationalists label "acausal" are. You're trying to predict future outcomes by psychoanalyzing a being that created and has exclusive control over your entire world.

If you're in a world where awareness of a genre's tropes gives you an advantage, you're /probably/ not in a world where you're capable of realizing this.
