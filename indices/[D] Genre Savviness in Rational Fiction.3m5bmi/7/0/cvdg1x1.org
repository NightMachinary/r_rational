  You're trying to predict future outcomes by psychoanalyzing a being that created and has exclusive control over your entire world.

It doesn't have to be that a god-like creature has control over your entire world.

For example: A bomb with all the wires spray painted black, with false batteries, fake timers, etc; so that it's more difficult to disarm.

Yes, it /could/ be figured out even if you've never seen any fiction about bomb disarming, but you might not think about it if you haven't seen any fiction on the subject.

Basically, if there is any trope that you see that you think would be stupid to do in real life, and then adjust for that when you're in that type of situation, you're being genre savy.
