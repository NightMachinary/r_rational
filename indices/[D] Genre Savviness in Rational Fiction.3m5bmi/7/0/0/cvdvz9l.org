See, I like this but it's not generally what I think of when I think of "genre savvy". When I think of "genre savvy" I think of "there's a bunch of different wires on this bomb, and that only happens on TV, and on TV it's always the red wire you have to cut, so I'll just skip over the part where we try to figure out which wire it is and cut the red BOOM", which is stupid.
