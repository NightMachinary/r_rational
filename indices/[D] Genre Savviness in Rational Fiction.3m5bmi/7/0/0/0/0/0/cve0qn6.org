  So what I'm getting, really, is that effective genre savviness is only something that can be attributed to a fictional character - no one can rationally emulate it themselves - because everyone, regardless of whether they're fictional or not, is in their own real life.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I think that you are saying is that since no one believes, for example, "I am in a horror movie," no one will act as if they are in a horror movie (avoiding dangerous horror movie scenarios that might be neutral, or even safe scenarios in real life).

If that's the case, there's a distinction to be made. If you live in a world where your experiences match

  It absolutely baffles me when people criticize fictional characters for, say, "not having seen all the other horror movies". Of course they haven't seen all the other horror movies - they're in one!

There's nothing logically inconsistent about being in a horror movie, and also having seen horror movies.

Maybe they have (or they might not have) seen all the other horror movies. It just might not matter.

If you think you're in our universe (as horror movie characters often do), then a rational person might ignore tropes and do the rational thing.

Example: Even if running into the basement is a death sentence in horror movies, since they don't know that they're in one (and think they're in our universe), they might rationally choose to go into the basement.

This is /different/ than being genre savvy.

Being genre savvy is about recognizing things like, "Every time someone is running away from a killer, in my universe, and they go into the basement, they get killed."

Or, more generally, it's about recognizing, "Thus far, in my life, [insert horror movie trope], has been accurate representations of my universe. So, regardless of what universe I'm in, I'm going to act as if horror movie tropes are in effect."

The bottom line is this. If you live in [insert genre here] universe, you will be living with [insert genre here] type tropes *all of your life*. You won't even think of them as tropes. You'll just think of them as the way that the world works.
