This plays into the cycle of deconstruction and reconstruction.

Deconstruction starts to pop up when people get tired of the same old tropes, when they want to see the pretensions and assumptions stripped away because they've seen them so many times before. When Batman goes from the grinning Caped Crusader to a tortured soul who beats the shit out of villains because of his severe psychological problems, when instead of */Wham!/* and */Pow!/* we get broken bones and bloodied knuckles ... well, that /starts out fresh/. But then a decade later, all the new superheroes (and most of the old ones) have had this deconstructionist approach applied to them, they've been torn apart and laid bare, and the audience expects it -- and because they expect it, they start to care a lot less. (Deconstruction doesn't always mean dark and gritty, but I think there's a strong tendency for it to be that, just because most tropes make the world a lighter and fluffier place.)

So deconstruction gets you halfway there. But it's not the whole story, because, well, there was a reason that authors did things the way they were doing them in the first place, and it wasn't just about convenience. The slasher movie protagonist got driven into the basement because /that's an exciting place/. It's the most abandoned and unfinished part of the house, with forgotten bits of junk and power tools, poorly lit and slightly off-kilter. But just because it's been done before doesn't mean that you can't do it. You just need to make sure that it's the smart thing to do, that it /makes sense/ for the intelligent protagonist to head into the basement /anyway/. Deconstruction takes something old and makes it fresh by destroying it. Reconstruction takes something old and makes it fresh by improving it.

I really believe that you can have a genre savvy character who still keeps falling into the tropes of his genre, all the while thinking, "I know this is what they do in books, but it actually makes sense this time", and that this could be a good book. (The biggest problem being that the author would seem self-congratulatory.)
