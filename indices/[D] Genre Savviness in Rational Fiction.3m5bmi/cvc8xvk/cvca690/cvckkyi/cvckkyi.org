  Deconstruction doesn't always mean dark and gritty, but I think there's a strong tendency for it to be that, just because most tropes make the world a lighter and fluffier place.

Hmmm... I disagree slightly with the latter statement. Tropes mostly make the world a place that's easier to tell narratively-satisfying stories in. A good example is how [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound][Only a Flesh Wound]] allows for /being shot/ to be reasonably survivable, thus ensuring the character can go on to spend time avenging their having gotten shot instead of just dying all of a sudden.

Getting shot is not exactly Lighter and Softer in the first place, and in fact, moving further up the Grimdark axis /still/ tends to leave the author in the situation that while maybe the main characters get shot /more often/, they still have to bloody well survive it somehow because otherwise /there's no story left/.

So I'd tend to say that Decon/Recon Cycles work based on whatever your genre's tropes actually were in the first place, and if the Decon part always seems to come out "Darker and Edgier", that's probably just because Hollywood and certain paperback fantasy authors these days have a bit of a fetish for making things Dark and Edgy /in replacement for/ making them genuinely realistic. So now, Batman's as much a psychopath as the Joker, but still, nobody ever [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim?from=Main.WhyDontYaJustShootHim][/just shoots/ the Batman]].

I'm also specifically thinking that, for instance, if you wanted to deconstruct /A Song of Ice and Fire/, or /Warhammer 40K/, or some other work known for being "grimdark" in its conventions, your deconstruction would inevitably have to include such notions as "Game theory says sometimes diplomacy is the most effective thing."

Or, to give a counterexample, /Neon Genesis Evangelion/ famously went so far into deconstructing Humongous Mecha tropes by trying to make the whole thing Very Psychological and Philosophical that many viewers have long-since lost sympathy for the characters by the end. Hence, "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji."
