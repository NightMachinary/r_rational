/A Song of Ice and Fire/ is [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DeconstructedTrope/ASongOfIceAndFire][already a deconstruction]]. Deconstructing a deconstruction seems like it's going to do something weird that's not really going to be part of our Decon/Recon cycle. If you deconstruct /Scream/, what do you get? Probably not a standard deconstruction, because you're down a layer. And then if you deconstruct the deconstruction of the deconstruction ... you're just moving closer to reality, I guess.

I suppose I think the reason that I see tropes as (generally) making the world a lighter and fluffier place is that most stories are structured around pleasing the audience. So sure, the hero gets his village burned down in the opening act, but he rarely suffers from PTSD. People get shot, but it's just a flesh wound. The hero has to suffer, but he also has to triumph, and in most genres, there's still an expectation of a happy ending (or at least a pleasing resolution to whatever the central conflict is).

Obviously that doesn't apply to torture porn, tragedy, etc.
