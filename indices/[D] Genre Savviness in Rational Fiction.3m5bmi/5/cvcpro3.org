For me personally, genre savvy characters usually make fiction worse, unless the whole work is about meta-fictional commentary. HPMOR is one big exception because it's basically a huge piece of meta-fictional commentary, focused on examining the hero stereotype. (IMO that, and not rationality, is the most interesting theme of HPMOR.) But that particular message, like any other message in fiction, can only enrich the reader once.

If you have something new and different to say about fiction as a whole, then by all means use genre savvy characters and any other devices you like. But if you just want to tell an exciting story on the "object level" of fiction, then making a villain who says "I'm a smart villain who doesn't gloat" is just another tired trope that you'd do better to avoid. Instead, try to come up with your own ideas that will enrich the reader in new ways. Write a toybox filled with wonder, like JK Rowling did, instead of using boring munchkiny logic to deconstruct someone else's toybox.
