  If you think about it, Genre Saviness often isn't a good idea in real life.

Wouldn't genre saviness in real life just be a person understanding that they're in real life, and acting accordingly?

I can see how /fiction/ genre saviness isn't highly useful ([[http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/][obligatory link to Generalization from fictional evidence]]), but being genre savy normally means knowing about the genre /that you're in,/ not just knowing about other somewhat similar genres.
