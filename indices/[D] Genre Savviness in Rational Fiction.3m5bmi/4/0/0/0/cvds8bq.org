  But fictional characters don't know that they're in a work of fiction.

First I'd like to point out that some do exactly that, that's one form of genre saviness.

Secondly, in the other form, they don't /need/ to know that they're in a work of fiction. All they need to know is the rules by which their universe works.

There is little /practical/ difference between the rule "When someone says 'what else could go wrong,' usually, something worse goes wrong." in fiction... and the rule "When a person is insulted, they will usually get angry" in real life.

There is, however, a logical difference. In the first rule, the universe is being influenced by words (literally, the act of saying "what else could go wrong," can physically force the clouds to gather above you and cause a thunderstorm). In the second rule, the words are being processed by the brain, causing mental pain, causing an anger response.

But the logical difference doesn't matter. Whether you are in the weird universe, or in ours, you should still be able to observe patterns and be able to predict future outcomes.
