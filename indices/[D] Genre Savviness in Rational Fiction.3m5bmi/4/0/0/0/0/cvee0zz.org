The problem though is that most fiction doesn't have characters that are genre savvy to that degree. Which means that being genre savvy automatically puts you inside a smaller subclass of fiction.

Plus being a fictional character is one of the few cases where a malicious god controlling your thoughts is literally true, which makes epistemology difficult.

Modeling the world to better predict it and take advantage is of course a good idea, but the sophistication of the model is obviously limited by your own resources. When you are a fictional character, it is literally impossible to fully model the relevant factors because that would require modeling the authors mind, which would in turn require modeling the authors model of your own mind and then you get the halting problem and so on.

It's almost like asking whether faced with overwhelming proof that 1+1=3, whether you would believe it and start acting to take advantage of it.
