If you think about it, Genre Saviness often isn't a good idea in real life.

The problem is that fiction has many constraints such as the need to have a plot, maintain tension, be entertaining, have few enough characters for the reader to keep straight etc. Fiction is never a plausible simulation, it's just supposed to feel like one.

So in many cases the things which it makes sense to do in fiction are not things which it makes sense to do in real life and vice versa.
