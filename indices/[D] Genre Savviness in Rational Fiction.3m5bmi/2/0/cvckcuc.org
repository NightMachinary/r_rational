In a typical piece of rational fiction, science and engineering will be rewarded more than in the real world. If you know that you're in a piece of rational fiction, then you know that your science experiments are much more likely to produce results, that your clever thinking is much more likely to be correct, and that random pieces of knowledge from the past are likely to be relevant at some crucial moment. This partly comes down to the need for structuring a narrative; no one wants to see the failures pile up over and over.
