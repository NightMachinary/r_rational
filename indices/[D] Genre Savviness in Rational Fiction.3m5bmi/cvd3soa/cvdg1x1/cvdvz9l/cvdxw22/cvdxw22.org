  and on TV it's always the red wire you have to cut, so I'll just skip over the part where we try to figure out which wire it is and cut the red BOOM", which is stupid.

I guess that depends on how much time you have to consider alternative hypotheses.

If you estimate that you have 3 seconds left, you mine as well cut the red wire (or any wire that you can get the wire cutter around).

If you have a few minutes, you might think "bomb-makers watch tv shows too, and so they might make the red wire the one that makes it blow up, so maybe I should cut the green one."

If you have hours/days/months, you can call in the bomb squad.

It's more of a function of available time, than of genre-saviness.

Regardless, being genre savvy in real life means being savvy /about real life/.

You wouldn't call a person in a romantic-comedy who is reacting to horror movie tropes to be genre savvy. They are only genre savvy if they understand /the genre that they're in/.

So if you, in the genre "real life," are reacting as if you are in the genre "terrorist bomb drama," and cut the red wire, then yes, that would be stupid.

If however, you were a character in the genre "terrorist bomb drama," and you notice that it really is /always/ the red wire in all the bombs you've ever disarmed (numbering in the hundreds), it's genre savvy (and intelligent) to just cut the red wire.

The reason that most characters /aren't/ genre savvy, is to keep the universe somewhat similar to our own.

If ghosts were real, and they really did haunt people, visibly phasing through walls, making objects fly across the room, leaving cytoplasmic goo everywhere, then it's highly likely that virtually everyone would believe in ghosts in that universe. Ghost deniers, in that universe, would be akin to holocaust deniers in ours. In that universe, there is tons of evidence that ghosts exist, and the only people who would deny it are those who are, for whatever reason, extremely emotionally attached to there not being any ghosts.

A world in which virtually everyone believes in ghosts is... odd to us. It would have vast ripple effects, which most authors don't think about. So, as a default, everyone is genre unsavvy.
