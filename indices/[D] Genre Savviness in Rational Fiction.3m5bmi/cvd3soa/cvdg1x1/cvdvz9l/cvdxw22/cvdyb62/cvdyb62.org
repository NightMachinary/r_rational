[[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy]]

So what I'm getting, really, is that effective genre savviness is only something that can be /attributed to a fictional character/ - no one can rationally /emulate it themselves/ - because everyone, regardless of whether they're fictional or not, is in their own real life.

It absolutely baffles me when people criticize fictional characters for, say, "not having seen all the other horror movies". Of course they haven't seen all the other horror movies - they're in one!
