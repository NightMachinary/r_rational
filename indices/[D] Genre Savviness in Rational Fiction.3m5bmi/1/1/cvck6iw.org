  For me the benefit of "genre savvy" characters or in general characters who don't do the things you associate with that genre is that it signals the author's intention to tell a fresh story. If I'm watching a horror movie and the characters say, "Let's split up," I know what's going to happen next. But if another character answers, "No, let's stick together," and they do, then I'm paying attention, because what I'm about to see isn't something I've seen before a hundred times.
