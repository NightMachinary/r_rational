For me the benefit of "genre savvy" characters or in general characters who don't do the things you associate with that genre is that it signals the author's intention to tell a fresh story. If I'm watching a horror movie and the characters say, "Let's split up," I know what's going to happen next. But if another character answers, "No, let's stick together," and they /do/, then I'm paying attention, because what I'm about to see isn't something I've seen before a hundred times.

Splitting up isn't /stupid/, it's /stale/. When Harry says to Hermione that he's not going to make her talk about her trauma like people normally would do because his books say that's dumb, it forces me to wake up and engage with what's happening on the page. That same freshness also makes the characters seem more real since. When Quirrell says, "Nah, just AK everything," it sends a message that this character isn't going to do anything convenient for the plot or the world. He's going to be as hard to beat as possible because that's what he wants to do, ease-of-storywriting be damned. The character feels like he exists for himself, not for the author.

I suppose it also plays into writing intelligent characters. At some point the smart guy has to /do things differently/, otherwise what's the point of being smart?
