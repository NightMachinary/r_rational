Yes it is. The only "rule" in their universe is that more fame = greater superpowers. Fame is more easily garnered through compelling stories just by virtue of human nature. Characters then change their actions based on their knowledge of what makes a compelling story in order to garner more fame and power. What I appreciate about this story is that [[/u/alexanderwales]] has created a world where the smart thing for the character to do is to realize what "genre" the story of their fame is and actively try to create it. The characters in this story don't necessarily have awareness of the genre of this specific story; instead, they are savvy to all the story genres and intentionally act out their own dramas to fit them. This results in more fame for them and an enjoyable experience for the reader.
