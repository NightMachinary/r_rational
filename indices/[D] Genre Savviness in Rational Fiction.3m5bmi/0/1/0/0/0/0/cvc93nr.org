I think it is. It's a subtle difference but it's there in 2 ways.

First, characters in most stories simply act like themselves, reacting how anyone normally would, or doing things to further the plot simply because the author needs them to. Here, the characters intentionally modify their actions to fit within a specific genre so that their stories are more compelling. Yes, they're indirectly exploiting a rule of their universe, but to do so, they must be genre savvy. In contrast, most characters in other stories are genre blind.

Second, and this is only a minor point, being genre savvy has nothing to do with the physical laws of their universe. Only fame does. Characters who exploit their knowledge of story archetypes in order to appeal to a wider group of people are not directly exploiting a physical law, because there is no physical law that says archetypal stories have more appeal. Instead, they are using their understanding of human culture to realize what will be popular. Perhaps on another planet in their universe, people become famous for entirely different reasons. This could easily be true without changing the physical laws of the universe because it is a cultural phenomenon.
