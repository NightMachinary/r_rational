I like that distinction. The second kind can definitely get annoying.

It's funny how people make fun of horror characters for doing 'stupid' things, when usually they're behaving pretty normally, but just don't realize they're in a horror movie and thus that splitting off from the main group or what have you is a death sentence. I split off from groups all the time!
