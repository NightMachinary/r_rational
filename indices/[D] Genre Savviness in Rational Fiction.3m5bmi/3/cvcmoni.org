It seems to me that the main problem in realizing you're in a world that works by the conventions of a genre could be the fact that so much of those conventions are embedded in what's shown, rather than what actually happens. Ie heroes usually end a story triumphant, but that would be hard to tell because their story wouldn't be cut off then in reality---a year later they're down and out. Also, because stories abridge reality, the Genre Conventions would be obscured by all the noise surrounding actual Scenes.

Basically, to the extent a genre is interpretive rather than interpolative of reality, its influence is meaningless to the characters.

You could have a world where glowing sigils appear randomly on people's foreheads, and stay for a random while, which make the person's life proceed according to the conventions of a certain genre (probably different colors of sigil). Naturally, as fashions go in and out in the spirit world new sigils appear and old ones become rarer.

Another way to do this would be to have people be genre-touched, though they might have a way of changing their genre. Maybe not everyone has a genre, new ones probably emerge. It could be at birth, or maybe random rune-covered milestones appear that can if touched Link you to a certain genre until a story in that genre has run its course, which if you resist it could be a long time. Maybe you can find Villain Stones, Hero Stones, the more common Extra Stones, etc. Maybe you are paid with magic power (a resource used to invoke tropes from the respective genre?) or another reward on completion of your part in the story. Or perhaps just a resource to be used for something else, like little runic poker chips that magic casinos that appear only on certain holidays accept.

Another route you could take is that because of all the noise, identifying the world's genre would call for real science, not just observation---you'd have to replicate specific situations, like a villain confrontation, and see what was more likely to happen even if highly improbable, exactly what the probabilistic lean was, etc. The problem would be an Observer Effect where if you're replicating these situations, they may no longer be in a story where the conventions apply! Also, what happens if the conventions of two genres conflict?
