Let me start. First off, I think it's useful to divide "genre savvy" into two different categories:

1. Characters who avoid mistakes which other characters in fiction makes, usually by virtue of having read the same stories that the reader has. The villain recognizes the urge to gloat as destructive, having seen it over and over again in movies, and decides that he's going to be better than that.
2. Characters who have some knowledge of the genre they're in and try to use that to their advantage. The virgin knows that she's in a horror movie and avoids having sex because she knows that this will increase her chances of survival.

The distinction is mostly about whether there's an element of going meta involved. These get mixed pretty freely when people talk about "genre savvy" though, especially in things like [[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html]["The Evil Overlord's List"]]. I personally think that the first type tends to work a lot better in fiction than the second type, but that's because I tend to get tired of winks and nods.
