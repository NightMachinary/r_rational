I think you're doing a magnificent job of incorporating the second type in [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]]. The characters are all genre savvy, and go a step further by intentionally acting in ways that create compelling and archetypal stories in their genre. This also provides an in-universe explanation for why characters may act in a way that might not be optimal in real life but creates a compelling story that follows certain archetypes. It basically preempts any potential plot holes by having the characters themselves intending to create a story, essentially lampshading the fact that they are already in a story. It almost appears meta at first glance, but it is actually wholly self-contained.

Worm by Wildbow does something similar by providing in-universe explanations for why people with super powers dress in costumes and knock each other out, but don't try to kill each other.
