Oh, right now the platform doesn't support this kind of stuff, and I don't think I'll be adding colored text and background display control as the part of main functionality.

But I have been thinking about adding functionality to allow artists to have their own custom websites on subdomains, or plugged into the platform with rss or something like that.

Like we could set it up so that you have blog that is specifically designed for your format, but still takes the advantages of the platform(you get traffic/subscribers/comments/etc).

Or, maybe it would make sense to just have everythig(both illustrations and text) in an image format, that way you could easily control the color of text, background, etc.

Can you send me an example of your comics? Maybe we can figure out how to make this work.
