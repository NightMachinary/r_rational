That would be great, my biggest concern with the text is that sometimes the words get a bit heavy and it seemed like that was a waste of bandwidth... but if we cut and select them appropriately that could work!

Would love to collaborate further, send me a PM and I can get you my more immediate contact info so we don't have to fill up the reddit with this :)
