This looks awesome!

I think that the most straightforward thing to do is to simply convert all the illustrations+text into images. You would be able to style it in any way you like in photoshop, and then just upload a series of images.

That would fit perfectly well with the platform, and with any other format as well.

I would be happy to help you with that if you want, and to help you promote your stuff too =)
