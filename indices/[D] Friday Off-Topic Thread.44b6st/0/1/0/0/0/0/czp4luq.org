My stories have been living on forums, but I'm planning to migrate them to dedicated sites, your community seems like it would be a good area to do that. The original piece in it's forum version is [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46308-Deep-Rise-An-Illustrated-Xenofiction-Adventure][Deep Rise]]

I'm way behind in translating that to a blog [[http://deepaccord.blogspot.com][here]]

My other piece I'm actively working on is originaly [[http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My!-Generic-Monster-Girls!-Wee-aboo-Intensifies][here]] and I'm now mirroring it to [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oh-my-generic-monster-girls-space-battle-forums-edition.366441/][this forum]]

The kind of hybrid comic/written story format is a bit tricky to adapt to single image conventions... It's been the biggest hurdle in me trying to figure out WHERE to promote my work.
