Hmmm, my format is images and text in sequence one after the other. To be legible it honestly needs several images and chunks of texts to be able to follow.

One of my pieces also has absolute need of colored text control, and possibly background display control.

I've been 'slowly' working to port it over to a blog format but a comic community like this probably would be MUCH BETTER for the stage of readership/audience I presently have. (a couple hundred dedicated readers).
