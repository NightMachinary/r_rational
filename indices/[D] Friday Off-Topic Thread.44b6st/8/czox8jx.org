I wanted to ask - what other communities are you a part of?

I've found [[/r/rational]] through HPMOR which I found through HN, and for a long time I was unaware of these things, so without some luck I wouldn't be here. So I'm wondering if I'm missing out on some other awesome thing that I just didn't happen upon yet.

What things other than rationality are you guys into?

--------------

From myself, I would recommend [[http://www.harmontown.com][Harmontown]], an awesome and hilarious podcast by Dan Harmon, creator of Community and Rick and Morty. It has nothing to do with rationality, it's just incredibly brilliant improv comedy.

Also I am really-really into 3D graphics(specifically - sidefx Houdini), which is the most fun hobbie I've ever had. If you haven't tried it - I highly recommend it, it's a super fun thing to do.
