Well, there's a famous book "Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies" by Nick Bostrom, so I'd recommend that.

As far as I know, genies lose their powers when set free, so that shouldn't be a problem =)

If it doesn't - then you'd be releasing a being of unlimited power, of course it would be an existential threat.

The problem with AI is that it's smarter than you are, and it's hard to figure out how to controll someone who is smarter.

If genie is smarter and also magical on top of that, I don't see what would you gain from releasing it.

Though I would love to read a story about a really intelligent protagonist trying to manipulate a genie, or release him binded by some conditions in exchange for something.....
