If I'm reading the community info correctly this doesn't belong as a top level post, but I'm currently working on a story with a genie in and I'm trying to work out how similar a genie is to an AI and why - i.e. is it the right thing to release a genie from servitude or not, and how do you decide? Does anyone have any thoughts on what characteristics make a being into an existential threat rather than (or as well as) a slave? Or could you point me at some non-technical reading on the subject?
