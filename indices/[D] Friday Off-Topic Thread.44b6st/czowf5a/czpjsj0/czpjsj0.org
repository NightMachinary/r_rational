Looked and then came back to criticise without following any links.

Your titles are to small and your background distracts too much from the titles. Within 1/2 a second how long I was willing to see if I liked anything I couldn't see the titles. It took me maybe 3 seconds to see the web-comic titles.

This is a bad thing, unless you want only people already committed to looking to convert to the comics you are advertising.
