Right now most of the comics are single images, but I would be happy to see all sorts of comics.

In terms of functionality currently you can upload an image and write a description, you can try it and see if it fits your format. If it doesn't - you could send me a link to your comics, maybe I can add the necessary features to make it work well for you.
