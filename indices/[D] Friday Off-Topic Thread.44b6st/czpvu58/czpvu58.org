I'd like to financially support the modding community for Fallout 4 but I'm not sure that would be a fair distribution and I'm not rich enough to just throw money at everyone who deserves it and hope it works out. Mainly I'd like a way of supporting good stuff in a way that gives the right incentives and doesn't require hours and hours of mental debate over who deserves what.

My main concern about mandatory payed (paied?) mods is hoarding of knowledge. If there's no money in it and people do it for the joy of it then it incentivizes modders to keep things secret from each other which hurts the community as a whole.

On a related note: if Alice does a favor for Bob then is the magnitude of the favor determined by how much work it was for Alice or for how much it benefits Bob? Should I favor the graphics mods more because they require more work to produce or the gameplay-based ones because they make a bigger difference? What if a mod that took ten minutes to make makes a huge difference? I have conflicting intuitions on that.
