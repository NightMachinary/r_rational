I had a weird dream last night where my life was a Quest (in the vein of Quest fiction as seen on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity).

I've been idly wondering today about the feasibility of doing something like that, using community group think to control an individual life to potentially avoid a lot of the common issues individuals have with decision making and such.

It may make for an interesting experiment.
