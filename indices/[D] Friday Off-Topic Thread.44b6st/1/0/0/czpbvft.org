Mayhaps. As a scientific study, it would likely be more of a proof of concept / prelude. Too many variables involved and such.

That said, keeping a written log and maybe a daily of weekly video log might not be a terrible idea. Things to keep in mind.

Brainstorming ways of doing it, but I think it should prove...something. Interesting at least.
