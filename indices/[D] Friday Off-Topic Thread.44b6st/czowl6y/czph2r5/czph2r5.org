A big issue you can have here is with having characters understand logically if a genie is good or forced to be good. Some AI will hate humanity but be forced to act benevolent due to programing. Therefore it may never be safe to trust a genie as any genie who wishes to escape would of course act benevolent whether they were or not, so they could escape.
