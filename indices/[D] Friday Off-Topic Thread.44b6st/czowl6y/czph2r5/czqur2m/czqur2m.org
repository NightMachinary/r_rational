That argument equally applies to finding a kidnapped person, with an IQ higher than yours, in a cell in someone's dungeon and deciding whether you should release him, keep him there, or shoot him. I am not convinced that the answer is always "keep him imprisoned" or "shoot him", even if you don't know exactly how high his IQ is and fear that it could be high enough for him to be dangerous if released from the cell.
