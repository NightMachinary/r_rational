I'm sure you can think of other stories you've read that deal with the same topics.

The main point of Friendly AI questions is how to analyse and deal with beings that have a radically inhuman mind. If the genie thinks mostly like a normal person (if sometimes a little crazy), like the genie in the /Aladdin/ movie, then you can probably trust your instincts when you judge whether he's a good person or not. On the other hand, if his mind is weird and alien, you have no guarantee that his concept of "a good person" is anything like human. What does it mean to trust such a being? Can you ever tell whether the AI is what it seems or just a superhumanly good actor?

The other side of this story is existential risk, and how the way you treat a person changes when the lives of millions are on the line. This one comes up a lot in stories with high stakes. If Darkseid is threatening to explode the Earth, due process and presumption of innocence are not anyone's primary concern. But is it acceptable to keep a superhuman locked up, not because of anything he's done, just because of the potential for damage he has? Cynical detachment says yes, but that kind of thinking has dangers of its own.
