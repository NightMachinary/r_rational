Obviously this might not be a traditional genie, but I'll limit myself to that case for now.

I guess there are only two relevant characteristics: the genie's abilities and intentions. For example, most genies are portrayed as near-omnipotent and if a genie is capable of granting wishes that would affect the entire human race, they are by definition an existential threat no matter their intentions (because like a WMD, if anyone is able to acquire them then they could destroy humanity). Next, if the genie is malicious and reinterprets your wishes in a manner that causes harm that's obviously very different than a semantically-faithful wish-granter.

In either the high-powered or the malicious genie case, they're a threat and shouldn't be released. So that's where the author comes in, because there are definitely ways you could make this straightforward situation into a mind-bending puzzle.
