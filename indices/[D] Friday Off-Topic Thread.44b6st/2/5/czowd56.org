If the book or series I first read is utterly brilliant I have come to realise that the next one is unlikely to match it - e.g. I don't think Philip Pullman has written anything else as good as His Dark Materials or Suzanne Collins as good as The Hunger Games. This is particularly true if the other stuff I go on to read is earlier, but I think it's mostly true that masterpieces are rare and regression to the mean happens.

Having said that there /are/ authors I enjoy almost all of, it's just that they're rarer.
