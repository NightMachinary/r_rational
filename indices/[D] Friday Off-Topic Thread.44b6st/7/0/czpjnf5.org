Thank you. I'll make a note to watch it some time, politics is spiders but I'm very curious how much is bias free and how much assigns blame to a companies fiduciary duty to it's stockholders (i.e. greed, which is also sometimes known as enlightened self interest ) vs the problems caused by state outcome based entities (ACORN).
