[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Lee_Martinez][A. Lee Martinez]] is a highly entertaining author, he does not write strictly rationalist fiction but most of his characters are very sensible and at least nominal rational individuals for the worlds they live in.

And he loves exploring some really diverse worlds! Honestly ANY ONE of his novels has enough fodder to go digging into various fun offshoot stories for multiple books, but he seems prone to just writing in new settings every book with different but equally well executed characters.
