If an author has previously written two books that I found enjoyable, anything else from them is definitely worth my time.

If they've written one good book, it could be a fluke, but I won't regret giving them a second chance.

The writer of geniusly meta game /[[http://www.stanleyparable.com/][The Stanley Parable]]/ went on to make merely adequate /[[http://thebeginnersgui.de/][The Beginner's Guide]]/. Greg Egan's /Permutation City/ is far more accessible and memorable than any of his other novels, /Quarantine/ is the only one that comes close.

One-hit wonders are a statistical inevitability. Of course an author's best and most famous work will not be representative of the rest of their bibliography. That's just regression to the mean.
