Quite possibly. I disliked the lack of concrete... anything. The whole power system was situational and based on interpretation, so when the protagonist won against overwhelming odds I couldn't think "that was a clever way to do things", instead I could only think "Okay, so the writer wanted him to win".

It's unfair and unfortunate, but there we go. Without fully defined powers, strengths and weaknesses it becomes essentially meaningless for the weak to defeat the strong.
