fair enough. I actually never finished Pact. I was in one of the later arcs, but something distracted me from finishing and now I actually have no idea what chapters I had and hadn't gotten to (I mostly remember Blake coming back from the Drains and lots of awesome shit happening). A very similar thing happened Twig, and probably Worm too. (but I eventually finished worm sans epilogues, and I'm re-reading Twig entirely (probably)).

My opinion of Pact derives mostly from me remembering all of the bits I enjoyed, and little else, so I don't suppose I'm being terribly objective.
