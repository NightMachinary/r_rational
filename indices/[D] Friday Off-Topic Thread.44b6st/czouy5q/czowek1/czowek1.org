You might be well served to consider what, exactly, you like about those stories. Authors tend to be consistent in how adept they are at character, dialogue, plotting, and description. Many are also dependable in how ably they weave a plot between those pillars.

Authors are often /inconsistent/ in theme, plot twist, and focus.

So if you enjoyed how a story was /told/, stick with the author. If you enjoyed what a story is /about/, you may be disappointed. There are high-profile exceptions - Neal Stephenson comes to mind - but for the most part you'll have better luck sustaining theme or twist by finding fans of the work you enjoy and asking them for similar recommendations.

The author usually has other fish to fry.
