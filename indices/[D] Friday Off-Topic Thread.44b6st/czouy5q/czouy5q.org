If an author has previously written a book (or multiple books) that you found enjoyable, how much do you expect /other/ books from the same author to be /similarly/ enjoyable?

--------------

I'm wary of trusting authors to be consistent. Even though [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1960462][ShaperV]]'s /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ is my favorite book of all time, his unfinished story /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5207262][Indomitable]]/ is merely /good/ (Shadow Clone antics notwithstanding)--and, when I attempted to read his original story /[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3198066][Fimbulwinter]]/ (years ago, IIRC; I probably should look at it again, since I remember almost nothing about it), I didn't find it even /remotely/ interesting. Likewise, /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198][Background Pony]]/ is almost definitely my favorite story for /Friendship Is Magic/--but, when I bothered to check out the other works of its author ([[http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=1491][shortskirtsandexplosions]]/[[http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=32973][Imploding Colon]]/[[http://www.fimfiction.net/index.php?view=category&user=158394][Just Essay]]), it turned out that hardly anything else in his body of work even came /close/ to matching /Background Pony/ (in my eyes, at least), and I was very disheartened to unfollow him after many months of anticipating another masterpiece.

I could come up with several more examples--[[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589][Card]] ([[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40409][the Shadow Quartet]] vs. [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43963][the Ender Quintet]] or /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9534][Shadow of the Hegemon]]/ vs. /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234724][Shadow Puppets]]/), [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1858][Robinson]] (/[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2723][The Years of Rice and Salt]]/ vs. /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77507][Red Mars]]/), and [[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9494][Lovecraft]] (/The Case of Charles Dexter Ward/ vs. /The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath/) immediately come to mind.
