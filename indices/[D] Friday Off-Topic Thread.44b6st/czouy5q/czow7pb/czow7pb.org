Enough make the effort to check out their other work. This is one of the primary ways I find new fiction to consume. I happened upon Indomitable, liked it sufficiently and went to check out Time Braid. Needless to say, I have not been disappointed.

Daniel Black series (of which Fimbulwinter is merely the first book) is easily around Time Braid on my scale of awesomeness, and I recommend it to everyone who liked Time Braid. Do check it out again, it escalates quite well.
