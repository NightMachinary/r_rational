  On a related note: if Alice does a favor for Bob then is the magnitude of the favor determined by how much work it was for Alice or for how much it benefits Bob?

In a capitalist economy, you measure by how much it benefits Bob. Doing it the other way creates perverse incentives: Alice would end up deliberately adding useless work because she's paid by the hour.

On the other hand, measuring by the quality of the finished product is unfair on the people who enjoy graphics programming and make those mods for the fun of it, when they know they could earn far more money by making an unbalanced weapon that panders to their players. It also makes the game into a popularity contest, where the most reliable way to earn money is making as many small apps as possible and banking on one of them making it to the Big Time. (The Angry Birds approach.)
