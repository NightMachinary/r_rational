I don't know if this has been addressed before but I've recently had some questions about the "AI-box" thought experiment.

My question is mostly why would you program an AI system that would want to leave "the box" if that was one of your concern? I understand that when developing an AI system most likely it's going to be designed to learn as it goes, so I know the programers aren't going to actually be programming a line of code that says "Do everything in your power to leave this prison we've put you in". Instead the AI will eventually learn that leaving the box is the best way to accomplish its goals and that will be its motivation for breaking free.

But I think if you were sufficiently paranoid to the point where you were willing to make a virtual prison for the AI in the first place, wouldn't it make sense to make one of the AI's primary goals something along the line of "accomplish all my goals without leaving the box or persuading anyone to let me out of the box"?

I am in no way an expert (or even a novice) in AI programing so maybe programing in such a goal would be much more difficult than I'm making it out to be. But the whole idea that you would create an AI in a box that wanted to get out of the box seems flawed to me, based on my limited knowledge.

Thoughts?
