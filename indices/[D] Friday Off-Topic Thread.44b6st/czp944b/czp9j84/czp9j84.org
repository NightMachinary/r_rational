More pressingly, I'm not sure why you can't just demand that humans who interact with it reset it at the first sign that it wants out of the box. Convincing humans who are having a conversation with you as an equal to let you out of a box is one thing. Convincing humans whose current goal is "kill it if it does something subversive" is something else entirely. Theoretically a sufficiently advanced superintelligence could accomplish the latter, but this is a topic where simple preparedness does indeed go a long way.
