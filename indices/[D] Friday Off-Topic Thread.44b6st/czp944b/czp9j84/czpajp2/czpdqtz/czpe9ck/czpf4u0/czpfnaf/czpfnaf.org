I'd say the inherent flaw in that is that we can't reasonably guess exactly how much information is needed for something that operates at a much higher intelligence than us to deduce its situation.

And the same issue occurs that all it takes is once for the censors to underestimate the AI before it figures out what the danger is. Though I imagine that it's probably more likely that any AI that wanted to get out would probably let us know that it wanted to get out without realizing that was a bad thing first. Especially if it's not programed with a strong desire for self-preservation.

And if the protocol was strict enough that simply letting on that it was aware it was imprisoned would result in it being destroyed, then I think we'd have a very hard time not giving it enough information to where it would eventually ask the wrong question and have to be scrapped.

Unless the AI itself was not very curious, I think the obvious question it would eventually ask is "How are you getting the information you're giving me?" and the answers to that would almost certainly lead the AI to realize that there exists a world outside of its prison. And depending on what it's main goals are, this realization would almost certainly make it want to escape the prison in order to better achieve those goals.

But that's just me speculating. Maybe people smarter than I could devise such a way to give an AI useful information, that would keep it in the dark about its own imprisonment.
