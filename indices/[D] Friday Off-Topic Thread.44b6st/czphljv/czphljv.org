I watched The Big Short tonight. It's a good movie. Doesn't go into a lot of detail, but gives a very unflattering account of the culture and rampant fraud in the finance sector that lead up to the 2008 economic meltdown. It didn't really teach me anything I haven't read already, but putting fake faces on it made it more... personal?
