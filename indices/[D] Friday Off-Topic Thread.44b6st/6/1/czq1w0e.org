I loved Enemy Unknown, and I'm super-excited for the added customisation possibilities in the sequel. I got really attached to some of my soldiers last time even when their main distinguishing features were hairstyles and armour colours. It sounds like Firaxis have doubled down on that, which is great.

Unfortunately Steam's new year sale has wiped out my gaming budget for the next few months, but I'll definitely pick it up eventually.
