[[/r/dwarffortress]] is a very strange place where losing is fun and people share their crazy fortresses and the stupid reasons that everyone inside of them died. Common problems leading to the end of fortresses include: too many cats, not enough socks, fortress submerged in magma, dwarf went mad then pulled the wrong lever, Nobles.

[[/r/kerbalspaceprogram]] is a very friendly place where people of all skill levels joke about forgetting to put landing legs on their space rockets and having to crash land on the mun /very gently/.
