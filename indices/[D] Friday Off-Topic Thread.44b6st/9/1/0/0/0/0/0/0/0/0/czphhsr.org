What I'm suggesting is some software mechanism, engrained in the AI, that outputs its thought processes as text. It's not aware of this software mechanism - both in the sense that it hasn't been informed of its existence and in the sense that, if it were informed of its existence, it would not be able to manipulate its output because it does not have direct control of it. The equivalent of a device that reads a human mind, except that it should be much easier to produce because we're actually building the AI in question from the ground up so we have a better understanding of how its mind works.
