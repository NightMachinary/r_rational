. . . Please go read Emperal Eyes by Daniel Keys Moran, or that alien message by EY or the recent crystal /something/ novel. What translation algorythym is going to define the AI's internal thoughts as human readable concepts? How does concept 4adefnb7fg2h map onto justice and how do you know that your definition is the AI's definition, and not the one the Taliban uses to justify murdering rape victims, or to use an Asimov reference how do you know "Human" is not defined only as people who can directly manipulate the EM spectrum, and not the accepted definition of human?

Please don't get me wrong I'm all for AI research, but at a certain level of complexity, things are not comprehend-able, such as the simple neural network I am using in my master's thesis. Sayng you want a blue box that reports the conscious thoughts of the AI assumes you have the bandwidth to read the conscious thoughts and that the language mapping will be equivalent, the former is impractical and the latter is laughable.
