That's an interesting idea. But what would such an output method look like?

If it's anything that we could read as text output, it could manipulate us just as effectively as if it were talking to us. Though I suppose what you're proposing is that it would also tell us its intentions behind everything it's doing?

I guess I'm having a hard time picturing a system where we would be aware that it's manipulating us that wouldn't have the potential of AI to manipulate us.
