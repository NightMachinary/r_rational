  “There's Ravenclaw for the smart kids, and Slytherin for the other kind of smart kids, and Hufflepuff for the kids who work hard, and then Gryffindor for the bad kids?”

/Interesting./ That's quite the different reputation that Slytherin and Gryffindor have achieved in this timeline. I get that Gryffindor is now tainted by its association with Riddle, the same way Slytherin was in the canon timeline, so that makes sense, but Slytherin now being associated with "the other kind of smart kids" seems odd. Would Slytherin now represent social intelligence?

Also: the poor hat spends all year coming up with a new song, and Tom mutes it so that no one can hear. That's just cruel.
