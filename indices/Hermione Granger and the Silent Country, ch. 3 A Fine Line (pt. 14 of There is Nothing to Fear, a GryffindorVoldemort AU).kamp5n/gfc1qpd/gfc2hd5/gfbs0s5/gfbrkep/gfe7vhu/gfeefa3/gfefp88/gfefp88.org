It's not especially out of character, I would argue it's in-character. Given canon-Hermione was perfectly willing to mindwipe her parents for their own good, i don't believe a little lie to set their minds at ease would be a stretch of her canon characterisation, and this version was significantly more socially isolated than in canon.

She even discussed the trip with McGonagall, the authority-figure who led to the family abandoning Britain in the first place, and who apparently has no trouble misleading the folks.
