A good reminder that HJPEV's hypercompetence comes entirely from the fact that he's the mind-clone of a hypercompetent psychopath. And even with that advantage, he nearly destroyed the world the moment he had the power to do so, and would have done it if he hadn't taken the Unbreakable Vow.

Real children aren't like that.
