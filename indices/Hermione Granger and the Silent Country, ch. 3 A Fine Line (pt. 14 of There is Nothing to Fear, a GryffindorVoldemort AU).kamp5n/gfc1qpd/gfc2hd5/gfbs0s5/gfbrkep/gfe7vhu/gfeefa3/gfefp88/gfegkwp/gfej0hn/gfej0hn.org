McGonagall's initial actions are to secure Hermione (and whoever else she's able to) from being a victim of the rash of child disappearances across Britain. As a muggleborn she's a clear target, with absolutely no protections in place if the reigning powers decide to vanish her forever.

That... is not the case anymore. I'm uncertain if she's a citizen of Magical France but she IS a student of Beauxbatons, and under the school's protection if nothing else. Kidnapping her would be a major diplomatic incident at the very least, if not the kind of excuse neighbouring countries could use for war.

The wizarding world in this fic seems to hark back to feudal Europe in many ways (Beauxbatons being a Capet stronghold, Norway-Denmark existing). Riddle would giving his neighbours a reason to gang up on him and undo the revolution (see Napoleon for how that sort of thing can turn out), just to nab a single, if gifted, witch. The surrounding powers MUST be pretty nervous about this revolution of demi-human rights and political representation after all...
