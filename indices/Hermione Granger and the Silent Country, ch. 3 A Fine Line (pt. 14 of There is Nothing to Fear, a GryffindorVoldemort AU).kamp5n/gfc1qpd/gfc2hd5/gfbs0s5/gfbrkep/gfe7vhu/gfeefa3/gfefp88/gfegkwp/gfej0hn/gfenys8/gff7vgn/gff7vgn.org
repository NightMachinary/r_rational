"Allowing to expatriate" =/= blatant kidnapping. Helen of Troy is one case in literature where an entirely willing "expatriation" led to war. And that was without the threat of revolution Riddle's politics bring. Just look at the US' cold war efforts to contain communism, if you want a more recent example. These aren't modern nation-states, either, but tiny communities largely led by hereditary aristocracy. Such constructions can be fierce in protecting their powerbase.

Sure the neighbouring countries did nothing while

1. It was a strictly internal British matter
2. They had no idea of the end result and what radical politics might spring up from it

If both of those things change then yeah, I really do think it could lead to war.
