  Hermione's parents were good sports about waking up so early, better than they would have been if they knew where she was ultimately going.

She's going through with this /without her parents knowledge/?? This continues to be wildly out of character and out of line with everyone's behavior two chapters ago. It feels like the horror movie where the dumb teens go into the haunted house and keep investigating the weird noises even as they find butcher equipment and blood on the walls.

I've loved this story so far and will continue to read but will likely stop doing so with a rational lens. it seems like this beat was just demanded by the plot and so the idiot ball got picked up.
