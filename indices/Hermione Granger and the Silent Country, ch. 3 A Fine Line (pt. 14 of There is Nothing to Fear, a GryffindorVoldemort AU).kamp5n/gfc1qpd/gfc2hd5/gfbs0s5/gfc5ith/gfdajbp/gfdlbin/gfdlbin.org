  If Riddle doesn't turn out to be actually evil in his actions it's either because he's not actually the antagonist, which would be weird; or a failure of the author's morality.

Or because the author doesn't write characters like that? I didn't expect to read a comment like this in this subreddit.

Imagining that people are evil TM is something from a disney movie

Utilitarianism is not a "failure of morality" and it's hard for me to imagine someone writing this unless you are claiming to be a prophet who has somehow access to objective morality

The book will be much more interesting with a nuanced antagonist, though it's even more interesting if society is the antagonist, sociological instead of psychological.
