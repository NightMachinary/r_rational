  In that case, we can be certain he /is/, in fact, a villain.

Motives shouldn't be a concern, only actions. There have been plenty of great people throughout history who were mostly concerned about themselves, and plenty of terrible people fully convinced they were in the right and that what they were doing was best for others.

If his goal is to be immortalized metaphorically by creating a more just society then that's good. If his goal is to create a society that might find a solution to actual immortality that doesn't involve killing people, one which can be applied to everyone, then that's also good. We don't know what his actual goal is yet (although the former seems more likely given his characterization).

That all being said, until we know the full extent of his actions, we definitely can't say if he's evil or not. Mr. Sable is ominous. The sorting hat is ominous. Instilling dissociation into his followers by convincing them they become someone else when they put on the mask is ominous. If Riddle doesn't turn out to be actually evil in his actions it's either because he's not actually the antagonist, which would be weird; or a failure of the author's morality.
