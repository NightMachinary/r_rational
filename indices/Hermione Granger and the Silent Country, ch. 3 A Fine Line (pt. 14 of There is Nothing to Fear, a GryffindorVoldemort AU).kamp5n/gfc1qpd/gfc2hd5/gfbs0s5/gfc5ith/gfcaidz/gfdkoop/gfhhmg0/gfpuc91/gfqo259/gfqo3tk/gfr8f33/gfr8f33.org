Yes, I suppose that doesn't match the stereotype of "authoritarian", does yet? The word "authoritarian" as used in english does preclude "free speech" and "democracy".

But within the context of this conversation, we were talking about something more specific: "a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state", and it was further a requirement that the state be working for the will of the people (rather than state employees benefiting themselves).

So what would an "all powerful state" which is working "for the will of the people" even look like? Well, they'd probably operate on the premise that their legitimacy to govern derives from the will of the people, so they'd likely want some sort of system to determine what the will of the people is (such as democracy, ballot initiatives, polls, voting...) and they definitely couldn't censor the speech of the people, which is an expression of the will of the people.

But they'd still hold all the power, that's a key ingredient. So the king, the state, the police, or whoever is in charge of all this has legitimate use of power whereas random thugs and also you and I for that matter, do not. State-sanctioned uses of power would be seen as "legitimate" and other uses of power as "illegitimate". There would probably be just one state (rather than a coalition of smaller states) and it would probably be discouraged for citizens to have weapons, so that they couldn't directly exert power. Instead, those who want power must seize it through the democratic mechanism, via voting or influencing others.

And if someone came in with a different perspective...it can happen, what if a bunch of American bible thumpers and Jesus freaks or or Saudi Sharia-heads suddenly came in to Norway and suppose they didn't believe in democracy as a valid way of doing things? How successful would they be at implementing their own systems?

Well, realistically unfortunately the real world Norway would probably be horribly racist about the latter group while unusually tolerant and accepting of the former because Norwegians obviously aren't immune to that sort of thing, but in our Imaginary Idealized Heavenly Norway Of Our Dreams, my guess is that at least on paper, they would be tolerated as citizens on equal footing with others (a flat, diverse society) but in practice any attempt to exert their value systems would be shut down by the police, and they'd be forced to advocate for their systems through democracy - a process which they would lose, and then they would die of old age, and then their grandchildren would secularize.

Idk it kind of sounds like "a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state" which tries to represent the will of the people rather than have state employees working purely for their own benefit to me. I'm not seeing any real attempt to distribute power...other than democracy. So I guess it's up to you to what degree it's not an "all powerful state" if it's an all powerful state which happens to be running a free speech democracy.

Consider this in contrast to, say, in the united states, where there is an active ideological push to keep power local, for the citizens and local militia to be armed, for states to be able to locally do things and use their state police to enforce them, that the federal government might rather not allow, and so on.

It's sort of tricky to talk about this because I think in practical political reality there's only two sides, the traditional right which represents those who wish to hold on to power, and the egalitarian left which represents those who are tired of their shit and are increasingly able to do something about it. The true compass has one axis. "Auth" and "Lib" are sort of pretensions to meta-principles that each side uses which are discarded when convenient. When the right wing pushes for curtailing and restricting the power of the state in a manner that allows the power of corporations, religious institutions, more conservative state governments, and children of the old feudal elite to fill the vacuum, it's not really because they are "lib" or "auth".
