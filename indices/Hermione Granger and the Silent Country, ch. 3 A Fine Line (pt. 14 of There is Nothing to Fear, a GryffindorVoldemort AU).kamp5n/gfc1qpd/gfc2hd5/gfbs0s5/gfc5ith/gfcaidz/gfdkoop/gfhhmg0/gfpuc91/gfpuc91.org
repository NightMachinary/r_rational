  Hierarchy/authoritarianism is the one corner of that graph that can exist; that basically describes feudalism, which is how most of Western society was organized between the fall of the Roman Republic and the Reformation.

You've identified feudalism as the authright corner, but go back further in history and you will find two of the other corners.

  You can't reach the "stateless flat, diverse society" corner, because such a corner requires commonality of belief, and whatever institution is enforcing such commonality on a diverse populace is basically a state by a different name.

You can, if there's a large commons. The presence of a large commons makes it difficult for anyone to exert coercive power, as people can always disengage and support themselves using the commons. Removing the /practical possibility/ of oppressing others removes the need to have everyone buy into the ideological goal of not oppressing others. You can find examples of this dynamic in hunter-gatherer societies which happen to live in abundant natural environments with easy access to all of life's necessities.

Sadly for libleft!humanity, the commons are gone, and unlike in the past our capacity for violence has expanded sufficiently to cover the entire world, so the possibility of "escaping" to the commons is gone.

  You can't reach the "stateless hierarchy" corner, because any functional hierarchy is basically a state by a different name.
#+end_quote

You can, in a society which does have the concept of "legal" and "illegal", but still has practical disparities in terms of power, control, and capacity to do violence. It's not a very nice way to live. (It's also not really what libright had in mind, as libright generally does want a state to enforce property rights)

You can find real examples of this in societies which are transitioning from foraging into subsistence agriculture. Edible wild animals and plants are in decline, so they've started scratching at the dirt to supplement their diets... and that means the beginnings of property, of defending land, and of not pissing off whoever controls that land if you'd like to eat, but that's not a state.

#+begin_quote
  You can, theoretically, have a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state, but the rules you'd have to construct to prevent those working for the state from benefiting themselves, their families, patrons, etc., are exactly the kind of rules that humans are good at finding loopholes in, so it's practically impossible.

I agree that this one has not /yet/ existed, but it does seem to be what modern social democracies such as Norway are aiming for, and what China/Russia promised but thoroughly didn't deliver.
