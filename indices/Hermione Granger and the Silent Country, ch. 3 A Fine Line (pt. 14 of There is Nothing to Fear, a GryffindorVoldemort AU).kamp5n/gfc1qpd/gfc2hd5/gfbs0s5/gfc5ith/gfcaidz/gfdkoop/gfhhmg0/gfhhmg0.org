  I wonder how Riddle looks from a left-wing perspective.
#+end_quote

I'm going to need to set this up a bit. Please keep in mind that any definitions of "left" and "right" are my own, and I fully expect you to hold different definitions.

First, I'm going to discard the idea that the "social" and "economic" ideas of the left and right are somehow separable. The social ideal of the left is a flat, diverse society, where no one has any more power than anyone else. Their economic path to this is socialism (or, as you move closer to the centre, a "fair trade" economy). The social ideal of the right is hierarchical, where those who have demonstrated merit are put in charge of society. Their economic path to this is free market capitalism (or, as you move closer to the centre, regulated capitalism). You can't really extract one from the other; the social ideals of the left are the source of their economic ideals, and the same is true of the right.

Now, I'm sure that you're all familiar with the "political compass", which displays a square where left and right is one axis, and authoritarianism (up) and statelessness (down) is the other. This axis is about how much power a state (or other similar institution) should have to further your ideals. So, the further you are to the left, the more the state (such as it exists) should be benefiting everyone, the further to the right you are, the more it should be benefiting the meritorious over the lazy, the criminal, and the otherwise abhorrent.

There is an inherent lie to this compass, in that a square is entirely the wrong shape: three of the "corners" can't exist. You can't reach the "stateless hierarchy" corner, because any functional hierarchy is basically a state by a different name. You can't reach the "stateless flat, diverse society" corner, because such a corner requires commonality of belief, and whatever institution is enforcing such commonality on a diverse populace is basically a state by a different name. You can, theoretically, have a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state, but the rules you'd have to construct to prevent those working for the state from benefiting themselves, their families, patrons, etc., are exactly the kind of rules that humans are good at finding loopholes in, so it's practically impossible. Hierarchy/authoritarianism is the one corner of that graph that can exist; that basically describes feudalism, which is how most of Western society was organized between the fall of the Roman Republic and the Reformation.

There's one more axis I want to bring into this, which is legitimacy vs tyranny, and this has to do with the /public perception/ of the government. Let's discard the left-right axis, for the moment, and look at the relationship between this axis and the "up-down" axis. A state which is universally regarded as legitimate /will not/ be overthrown; a state which is powerful enough /cannot/ be, and a state which is *both* is basically invincible. However, there's a nice, wide quarter-circle towards the weak-state/tyrannical corner where a state is vulnerable to being overthrown, regardless of whether its ideals are towards the left or the right.

So, as a leftist, politics is the art of using the government to break down hierarchies and promote equality, while rooting out people who would use it to increase hierarchy to their own benefit, and giving the government enough power to do so, but /not/ so much power that it becomes impossible to overthrow if it slides into tyranny.

...It's not an easy balance to find, and one of the biggest problems in left-wing politics is the knowledge that to reach total equality requires either tyranny or complete intellectual conformity, and this tends to lead to purity tests, infighting, and even, in rare cases, violent purges (e.g. the Reign of Terror in France, or the Great Purge in Soviet Russia), which are inimical to the spirit of a flat, diverse society.

With all of that sorted out, let us consider Riddle's Britain.

On the stateless-authoritarian scale, it is near the far top of the graph, nearly perfectly authoritarian. Riddle is completely in charge of his Death Eaters; the Death Eaters are in complete control of the State; the State is powerful enough to control the wizarding world, and the wizarding world has completely subsumed the Muggle government.

On the tyranny-legitimacy scale of public perception, there are two possible perspectives to look from. The first is the community of wizards/witches and magical creatures, and, from their perspective, the government probably looks legitimate enough. Casting down the nobility and raising up the magical creatures, and adding elected seats to the Wizengamot, along with bringing families like the Malfoys into the fold, have probably given Riddle enough support among the magical community that a large number of people feel that things are better under his rule. There is undoubtedly (quiet) dissent, but, with Dumbledore gone, no apparent organized resistance. For the muggles... we don't know what things are like. Probably bad. We haven't been given a window into the Muggle world, other than that brief glance at the aftermath of the dragon attack (Muggle casualties disregarded and breathless concerns about Muggle explosives) which doesn't bode well for them. But no matter how bad things are for the Muggles, they probably don't have the strength to resist the might of the wizarding world, if they even have the faintest idea who is oppressing them.

As for left-right... The Death Eaters are now the government, and one thing that this series has not done is /tell us what the Death Eaters want/. We have [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15449145][vague insinuations]] of "reforms that were more extreme than anything that Riddle had thus far dared to voice except through his Death Eaters"; we have James [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24335107/chapters/58675660][swearing]] to "fight, and suffer, and die for the cause of the Death Eaters," but no statement of what that cause is. All we know is that they follow Riddle without question. So, what does Riddle want? We know of two things that he wants, that do not appear to be the consolidation of power for its own sake: he has personally sought out the Deathly Hallows, and the Veil of Death.

So, with all of that preamble: how does Riddle look from a left-wing perspective?

He's fucking terrifying.

He's appropriating left-wing rhetoric in the name of consolidating power; he is enacting some left-wing policies for the purposes of populism. However, the only true goals that I can infer from his actions are a quest for immortality through the Deathly Hallows, as well as gaining power for power's sake. Yes, he has probably done some good through the nuclear disarmament of Britain, but, in doing so, he has likely removed Muggle Britain's ability to threaten his reign (which is likely the main reason why he did so). He has done some good by demolishing some of the wizarding world's internal hierarchies, to the advantage of muggleborns and magical creatures, but he likely did so only for the political support of the Gryffindors and the creatures themselves, and has used that support to entrench an even more harmful hierarchy, with himself at the top, and Muggles in oppression at the bottom.

He is exactly the reason why the political left often seem to value the norms and mechanisms of government more than the results which those mechanisms produce: we know what dangers lie down the path of Robespierre and Stalin, when revolutionaries talk big talk about "the Greater Good," and then achieve their goal, accrue too much power to themselves, and start purging dissidents. The biggest difference between someone like Riddle, and Stalin and Robespierre, is that those latter two were mortal and mundane.

So let me raise my voice against the utilitarians here and say that yes, he is a villain, regardless of the small existential good he's done thus far by disarming one country. And he's all the more terrifying of a villain for his rise to power being so plausible.
