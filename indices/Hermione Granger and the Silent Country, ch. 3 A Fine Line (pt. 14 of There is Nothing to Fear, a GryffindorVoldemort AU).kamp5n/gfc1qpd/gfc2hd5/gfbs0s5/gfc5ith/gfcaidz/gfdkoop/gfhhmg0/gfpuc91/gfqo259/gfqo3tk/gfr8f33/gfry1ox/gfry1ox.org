  it was further a requirement that the state be working for the will of the people (rather than state employees benefiting themselves).

See, this is why, in my initial categorization, I put "legitimacy vs tyranny" on an entirely orthogonal axis to the other two. A left-auth government, as I would define it, would enforce an absence of hierarchy, whether or not that is the will of the people, or good for the people.

  But they'd still hold all the power, that's a key ingredient. So the king, the state, the police, or whoever is in charge of all this has legitimate use of power whereas random thugs and also you and I for that matter, do not.
#+end_quote

That's just it: they /don't/ have all the power. If the people have the power to replace a government they don't like, then /they/ have the power. Even right-libertarians and anarcho-communists don't want there to be /no/ organizations working for the defense and welfare of the people; they just don't want those organizations to constitute a "state."

  State-sanctioned uses of power would be seen as "legitimate" and other uses of power as "illegitimate". There would probably be just one state (rather than a coalition of smaller states) and it would probably be discouraged for citizens to have weapons, so that they couldn't directly exert power.

I think we're operating on definitions of "power." You seem to be conflating "power" with "force" (specifically, violent force). I'm using it more to mean "control." A democratic government, especially one with a constitution guaranteeing civil rights (one that is followed, anyway) is very much limited in how much it can control its populace.

  And if someone came in with a different perspective...
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how this example proves that the state has power; the only thing you give as an example of this is "in practice any attempt to exert [anti-democratic] value systems would be shut down by the police"... I'm pretty sure that the the violent overthrow of a government is against the law anywhere (for obvious reasons), although, like laws against suicide, it's a law that can only be enforced for unsuccessful attempts. Using the police's ability to shut down a coup attempt, one which would have pretty much zero popular support, as a gauge of how strong the government, seems like a very weird measure of government strength. By that definition, pretty much any state would be strong.

Again: this is why I put the popular support of a government on a different axis: if you need popular support to stay in power, you're not strong; if you need to exert control of the populace to stay in power, you're not popular. If you have *both* the power to enforce control of the populace (if necessary) /and/ popular support, your State is pretty much invincible.

*That's* your model for a "less powerful" government than Norway? The one with the largest military in the world, as well as militarized police department, which are protected against civil litigation for violating people's rights by the doctrine of qualified immunity? Okay...

  where there is an active ideological push to keep power local, [...] for states to be able to locally do things and use their state police to enforce them, that the federal government might rather not allow, and so on
#+end_quote

...But how is that a measure of how powerful "The State" is? I mean, yes, the /Federal/ government is limited by that, but if the "local" government gets all of those powers that the Feds don't, then wouldn't that just mean that you're under two semi-powerful governments adding up to one powerful one? Especially given the push for ideological conformity within the main two political parties, leading to less and less daylight between the federal government and that of a state governed by the same party?

  for the citizens and local militia to be armed
#+end_quote

For *some* of them to be armed, sure. For others, the mere possession of a firearm seems to be justification for lethal force from police.

Also, doesn't "militia," in the constitutional sense, refer to the National Guard?

#+begin_quote
  The true compass has one axis. "Auth" and "Lib" are sort of pretensions to meta-principles that each side uses which are discarded when convenient.
#+end_quote

I'm have no idea whether or not you're correct about the right. I do know that it is an active point of argument on the left, whether a state is inherently a tool for creating hierarchy and must be abolished for the leftist utopia to come about, or whether people are dicks and some form of state control is necessary for leftist utopia to come about. My own personal opinion is that "utopia" quite literally means "place that doesn't exist," so it's a dumb argument anyway.
