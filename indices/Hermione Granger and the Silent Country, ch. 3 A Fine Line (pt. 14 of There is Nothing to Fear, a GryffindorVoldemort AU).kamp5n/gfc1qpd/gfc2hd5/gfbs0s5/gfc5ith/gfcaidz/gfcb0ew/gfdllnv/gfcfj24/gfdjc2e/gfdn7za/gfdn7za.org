It tends to be that people who had a positive childhood are strongly against socialised parenting, and then those who had a negative childhood also are usually traditionalists (because of the correlation between poor outcomes) not progressives so they support family structure too.

We have already crossed the line anyway since everyone accepts taking children from drug addicts or abusive households but few support socialised/collective parenting
