That's fair. I was a sort of right-wing paleocon before I went lefty so I'm personally very cautious of /anything/ that leaves skulls, but in part it's just a personal reaction to still having some of those, I don't know what you'd call 'em, cached thoughts / mental habits left over. I can see where you're coming from, though.

I'm glad you're in a better, and safer, place right now (if I'm reading you correctly).
