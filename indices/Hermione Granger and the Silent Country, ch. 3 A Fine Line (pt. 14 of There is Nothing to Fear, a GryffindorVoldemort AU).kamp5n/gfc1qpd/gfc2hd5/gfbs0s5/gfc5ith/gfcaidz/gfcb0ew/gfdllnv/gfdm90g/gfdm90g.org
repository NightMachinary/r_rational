Oh, sure! What makes the utilitarian calculus weird for me in this instance is that all of the good effects (heck, /all/ of the effects, really) on muggles are just happenstance: Riddle is doing stuff that /just so happens/ to reduce existential risk for muggles, and "is this good for muggles?" doesn't seem to enter into his decision-making at all.

(So, "Riddle's regime is a net positive for muggles right now" might be true, but it's overlooking the vital point that the math could change at any moment because Riddle isn't actually /trying/ to improve muggle welfare, and he would /pose/ an existential risk to muggles in the moment that this seemed like something he could and ought to do.)

  Socialized parenting is progressive in any case

Right now, the muggle-borns aren't getting socialized parenting, they're still being parented by specific sets of parents, just not the parents they were born to.
