Eh, she's very obviously an incredibly bright witch, great academic performance/goals and thirst for knowledge, that information should easily be obtained by Riddle and his faction. Someone sits down with her, points out that a more complete immersion in the magical world (not spending time with her birth parents) would have improved her knowledge of magic, Hermione counters with her parents having supported her and made her the person she is today, other person points out that supportive birth parents are never guaranteed, and that Riddle and his testing methods for a (magical) parent's worth (through whatever invasive spying goes on behind the scenes) will result in higher average performance, with a lower chance of child abuse in the extreme cases.

Hermione values knowledge/performance, Hermione is thankful for the strong relationship with her parents, Hermione reluctantly acknowledges that Riddle has made some definite positive changes to magical Britain, even if she disagrees with his particular methods. Hermione who was basically set up as the greatest witch of her generation in canon, with this predicted from an early age. Riddle getting someone like that on side, operating completely in a foreign country, would benefit his public perception and support in a few years time.

Also, the way that the Dark Arts is taught at Hogwarts could be a point for or against Riddle for Hermione (something something knowledge has no agenda, only those that use it do). Riddle's "influence" over the government of the UK could easily be spun in a positive light, and accurately explanations of the threat of nuclear weapons are an easy door to a grudging acceptance. And any changes in the laws around underage magic to make it more accessible (and therefore, private study as a youth more possible) would also be a point in Riddle's favour in Hermione's eyes (if you can track underage magic, changing it to tracking based on spells used would deny potentially dangerous or malicious ones specifically. Wingardium Leviosa in your own time is probably fine, curses and hexes not so much).
