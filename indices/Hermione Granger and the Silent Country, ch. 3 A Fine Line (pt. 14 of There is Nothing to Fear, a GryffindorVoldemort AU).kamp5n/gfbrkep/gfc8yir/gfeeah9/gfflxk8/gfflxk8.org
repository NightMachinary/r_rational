Canon Hermione started SPEW. This Hermione just encountered severely discriminated non-humans who are easier to relate to (fellow students who have been discriminated against for their origins and cultural differences), without the whole complication of the House Elves having their magical species-wide Stockholm Syndrome. I don't think she'll be making badges for Riddle any time soon, but there's no way she's going to walk away without serious second thoughts about either Riddle or the results Riddle has gained as a bare minimum.
