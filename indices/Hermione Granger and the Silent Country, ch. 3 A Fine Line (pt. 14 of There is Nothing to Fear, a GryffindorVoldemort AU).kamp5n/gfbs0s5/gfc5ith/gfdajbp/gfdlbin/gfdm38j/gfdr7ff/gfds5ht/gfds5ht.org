The main difference with her seems to be that she's more confident, which the author might be doing to make up for the possible absence of Ron---I noticed he wasn't mentioned this chapter even while the twins and Ginny were. Hopefully Harry's time at Durmstrang has changed him a lot more, because I'd be happy to see him switched to his opposite the same way Riddle has been.
