Evil according to my perception of morality, of course. Subjectivity is implied. I'm not doing that Disney shit, I'm saying that if all he's done is the worst of what he's presented as having done so far then he shouldn't be presented as the antagonist. We shouldn't be expected to sympathize with people whose goal it is to defeat him, as is almost definitely the case with Harry and probably will be with Hermione.

The failure of morality wouldn't be just in making him utilitarian, it would be if the author made him the antagonist and presented him as villainous even if the worst thing he's doing is just extreme methods to achieve a just cause.

I agree with your statement on sociology being the villain, but that's not the story I've been reading so far, so it seems unlikely for that to happen.
