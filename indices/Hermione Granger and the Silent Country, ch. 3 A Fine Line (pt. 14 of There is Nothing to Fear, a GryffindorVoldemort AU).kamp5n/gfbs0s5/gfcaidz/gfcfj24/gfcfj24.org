Eh, I'm pretty damn left wing myself, but I'd be more onboard than off with Riddle's Britain. I've got too many relatives who should be in prison (and tbh, too many relatives who should be beaten to death whilst in prison). I'm also queer, and when you are genuinely unsure if some of your relatives would beat and/or kill you if they found out and thought they could get away with it, you become more tolerant of a "permanent solution" to those beliefs. They'll always be more LGBTQI people, and always have been through history, but not so much for Nazis (as a particularly extreme example).

I mean, just speaking purely in skulls on the road, if Riddle decided every muggle in the UK would no longer be able to have kids, there wouldn't be any skulls to speak of whilst achieving Riddle's goal of magical supremacy. There's arguments about rights here, but I always found having a right to determining another's life like that weird, since people are born into abusive families often enough, or with enough long-term health conditions, that there is a definite number of people with a horrible life for reasons out of their own control, purely because of the desires of others to have kids. Like people will condemn torture, wanton murder and rape, as well as overly harsh imprisonment for creating unwarranted and pointless suffering, but then turn around and let people with whatever history of brutality or exploitation have kids without any oversight. There's admittedly (huge and glaring) opportunities for abuse with giving any government that power over people, but acknowledging that turns it into a goal to strive towards improving the situation (and having extensive checks and balances) and not something to be completely ignored. And there's enough non-invasive temporary birth control methods either created or in development (there's that contraceptive gel for people with penises from a few years earlier, currently undergoing testing) that, even if people are concerned about the side-effects of contraceptive measures, you can support research and development in that area first.

(Uh, before I get any particularly concerned pms, I'm estranged from the vast majority of my relatives now, so I'm not in any specific risk. And the worst of them have at least documentation of the allegations against them)
