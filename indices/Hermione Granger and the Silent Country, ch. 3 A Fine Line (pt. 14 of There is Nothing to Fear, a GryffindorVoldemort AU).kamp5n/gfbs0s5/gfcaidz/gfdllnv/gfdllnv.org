  Saying "but more people are being saved in the case of a nuclear war, so the math checks out!" feels like it's missing the point.

That's utilitarianism. You might feel confident that there's no nuclear war because you're alive now but if we were the last remnants of a destroyed planet then I expect you'd be saying "What of course let Hitler live if it keeps nuclear war from happening"

It's totally reasonable to respond to extinction level threats with serious action. If a gamma ray hits the earth tomorrow the few survivors in the space station will wish say, that we didn't go into lockdown and sent a colony to Mars instead. (this is obviously a false dichotomy but it's illustrative)

  A more progressive strategy would be to keep muggle-borns with their birth families but approach them long before it's time for Hogwarts (ideally, as soon as you notice them use accidental magic).

Socialized parenting is progressive in any case, parents raising their children is traditionalist
