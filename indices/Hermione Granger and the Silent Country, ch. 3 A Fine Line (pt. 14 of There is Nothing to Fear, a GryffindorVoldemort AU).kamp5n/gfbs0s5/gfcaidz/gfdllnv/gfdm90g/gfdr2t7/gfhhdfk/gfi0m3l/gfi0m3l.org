I don't know, are there any groups who have done that for the good of the children rather than for ethnic cleansing?

I don't think there are any examples of socialised parenting outside of a handful of tribal groups and even then parents knew which one was their child

I also don't know why it's not quite the same and to be honest it's still hard to say that they are better off when removed from abusers. Foster care and orphanages have not exactly been high quality institutions

Perhaps North Korean children going to South Korean families
