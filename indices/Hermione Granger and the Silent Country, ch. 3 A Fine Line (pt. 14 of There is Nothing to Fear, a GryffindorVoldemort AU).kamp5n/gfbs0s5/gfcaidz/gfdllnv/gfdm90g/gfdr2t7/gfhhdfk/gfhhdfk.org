Are there /any/ examples of the systematic fracturing of the family units of an entire category of people resulting in a remotely positive outcome? We do it for children of abusive or drug-addicted parents, certainly, but that's not quite the same. There's generally investigation, due process, and efforts at remediation before we resort to taking the kids away. Riddle appears instead to be abducting children the moment they express magic, and mind-wiping the parents so they can't complain.

Like, did we do something like that with the children of Nazi loyalists? I don't think so, but it may have actually been a decent idea just to accelerate de-Nazification and turn that entire generation against their parents as quickly and seamlessly as possible. But that's the only kind of circumstance where I can see this going well.
