That's a good question, and it's difficult to answer because Riddle's Britain is such a mixed bag.

The goblins seem to have only benefited, no question about it: They get to have wands. They are permitted, but apparently not /required/, to attend Hogwarts. Also (to point out a couple things that haven't come up yet), they have guaranteed seats on the Wizengamot /and/ goblin property laws take precedence in interactions between goblins and wizards (this includes the Sword of Gryffindor).

Other nonhumans, part-humans, etc are also doing better, it seems.

The Wizengamot itself has been reorganized and is, at least on its face, a more democratic institution (the pre-revolutionary Wizengamot had only five directly-elected seats out of fifty).

Muggles are /probably/ benefitting overall (Britain's actions have really strengthened the nuclear disarmament movement) but let's not forget that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27264121/chapters/66607840][the French government thinks the British are abducting muggle kids]] and has no idea why (too many kids are disappearing for them to all be muggle-borns). It's really hard to say that Riddle's regime is "good" for muggles, when all the good stuff is a side effect of "Riddle doesn't want Britain to be targeted in a nuclear war" and meanwhile there's, well, dozens of kids disappearing in Scotland alone. Saying "but more people are being saved in the case of a nuclear war, so the math checks out!" feels like it's missing the point.

It's also difficult to really spin the muggle-born abductions in a good way. As readers have pointed out in the past, Riddle is a magic supremacist, so it's probably not too far from the truth to say that cultural cleansing / indoctrination is not just a side effect of stealing muggle-borns, but the whole /point/. A more progressive strategy would be to keep muggle-borns with their birth families but approach them long before it's time for Hogwarts (ideally, as soon as you notice them use accidental magic).

But the question isn't "is Riddle's government good?" It's more like "is Riddle's government good /enough/?" Can we tolerate the skulls on the road if we think that there are fewer skulls now than in yesterday's world?

That's a harder question to answer, because we don't necessarily live in a world where skull-free roads are possible. Suffice it to say, Riddle couldn't stay in power if everyone in Britain turned against him, which means that he has to actually keep at least /some/ groups happy. Is it possible to remove some skulls over /here/ without adding more skulls over /there/? What if Riddle's government is actually the best system possible under the current circumstances, because anything else will break down the coalition that maintains it or even because Riddle himself is necessary to the system because nobody else has generated enough trust with e.g. the goblins?

All this is to say that, despite being a socialist, I couldn't personally accept Riddle's Britain, but a Stalinist would probably have fewer issues.
