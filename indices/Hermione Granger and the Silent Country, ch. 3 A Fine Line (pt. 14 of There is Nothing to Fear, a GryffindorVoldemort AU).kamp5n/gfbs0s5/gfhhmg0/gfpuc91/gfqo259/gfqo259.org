Fair enough about the two stateless corners. I was thinking more about present-day practicality than historical accuracy with my argument that they can't exist.

    You can, theoretically, have a flat, diverse society with an all-powerful state, but the rules you'd have to construct to prevent those working for the state from benefiting themselves, their families, patrons, etc., are exactly the kind of rules that humans are good at finding loopholes in, so it's practically impossible.

  I agree that this one has not yet existed, but it does seem to be what modern social democracies such as Norway are aiming for, and what China/Russia promised but thoroughly didn't deliver.

Absolutely agreed on China and the USSR. Those became single-party cronyist states almost immediately, which is why I have virtually no faith in the auth-left corner existing in anywhere other than theory.

I disagree that this corner is anywhere near what modern social democracies are aiming for. I mean, to use your example of Norway: yes, they've actually created a functional state which I would consider to be on the left side of the political spectrum, which is an impressive accomplishment in itself. But it's a functional representative democracy (according to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index][Democracy Index]], it's currently *the most* democratic country in the world), with a constitution which guarantees basic human rights, and an independent judiciary.

Among the rights guaranteed by the Norwegian constitution is free speech:

  - There shall be freedom of expression.
  - No person may be held liable in law for having imparted or received information, ideas or messages unless this can be justified in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression, which are the seeking of truth, the promotion of democracy and the individual's freedom to form opinions. Such legal liability shall be prescribed by law.
  - Everyone shall be free to speak their mind frankly on the administration of the State and on any other subject whatsoever. Clearly defined limitations to this right may only be imposed when particularly weighty considerations so justify in relation to the grounds for freedom of expression.
  - Prior censorship and other preventive measures may not be applied unless so required in order to protect children and young persons from the harmful influence of moving pictures. Censorship of letters may only be imposed in institutions.
  - Everyone has a right of access to documents of the State and municipal administration and a right to follow the proceedings of the courts and democratically elected bodies. Limitations to this right may be prescribed by law to protect the privacy of the individual or for other weighty reasons.
  - It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions that facilitate open and enlightened public discourse.

If I were to divide the authoritarian-stateless spectrum into quarters (state extremely powerless, state moderately powerless, state moderately powerful, state extremely powerful), then I don't think that I could place any state into even the "extremely powerful" /quarter/ of the spectrum, much less anywhere near the edge, that matches the description of Norway above. As such, it's difficult for me to agree that their aim is to get to the authleft corner; they seem to be trying to get to the hypothetical left-most point of stability that I was speculating about earlier. If even that; their most recent two elections put a coalition of non-socialist parties, led by the (by Norway's standards) centre-right [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Conservative_Party][Conservative Party]], into power, which argues against their desire to move any further left than they already are.
