For the first few examples: Yeah, the relationship between capitalism and right-wing politics does break down as you reach the extreme right end of the compass. Going back to meritocracy, capitalism provides a means to sort the "deserving" from the "undeserving," so, for most starting most states, it's a tool for creating hierarchy by its very nature.

But in a state of maximum hierarchy, those in charge /don't want/ to do any more sorting; they want to lock in the existing structure.

So, sure, in a feudal or fascist society, capitalism would (and did) represent a move towards egalitarianism, a fairly large leap to the left. But while capitalism can't get, or keep, a society to the extreme right edge of the graph, its end result (plutocratic oligarchy) is still way closer to that edge than to the political centre, and so capitalism is almost always a tool for creating, not dismantling, hierarchy.

As for the third example: there are assholes in every movement. As I said, you can't reach the far left edge of the map for any prolonged length of time because humans are, largely, dicks (or, if women, the corresponding female anatomy), and can't help themselves from forming hierarchies without an oppressive regime to prevent them from doing so (which kinda defeats the whole point). So finding groups with anti-egalitarian sentiments in even the most egalitarian of movements (which M-Lism isn't; "suppression of opposition" is /not/ an egalitarian concept) is, sadly, to be expected.
