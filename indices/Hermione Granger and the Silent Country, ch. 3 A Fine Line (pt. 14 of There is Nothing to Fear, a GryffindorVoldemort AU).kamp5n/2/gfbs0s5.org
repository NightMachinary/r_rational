I wonder how Riddle looks from a left-wing perspective. I mean having a society that discriminates to the point that certain people(/species) are cut off from schools and opportunities is a thing, but the scale of it in magical Britain, and the difference in what you can achieve with and without a wand, would people "accept" the cost of totalitarian Riddle as a net gain?

I mean current left-wing mainstream stuff has plenty of proponents of non-violence, people point to Gandhi often, but he also wanted the Jewish people in WW2 to "offer themselves to the butcher's knife" because he lacks empathy (he was a racist sexual predator btw, you don't sleep naked with your 18 yr old grandniece nearly 6 decades your junior if you're a decent person). I know this is just a singke, very dramatic, example, but there's been enough people literally fighting for their rights over history, who have only achieved something at the cost of bloodshed, that complete dismissal of those means by people without those lived situations, it seems so privileged. I mean revolutions, civil wars, less bombastic/immediate things like the Black Panther Party and some Antifa groups.

I may have gone too specifically political there, but like the sheer difference in quality of life and rights for Goblins here is so much more major than what wizards lost it seems to me. The fact that all the Riddle perspectives are from people either human or human-passing is also worth noting.

Also, re: muggleborn forced adoption, this seems a bit more grey than at first glance. Like Hermione's parents literally cannot see ghosts for example, there are huge parts of wizard culture (and ability) that they are literally incapable of teaching to their child. For example, if you lost your capability to walk in exchange for being raised by your birth parents (who themselves could not walk) instead of foster parents, would you make that choice for yourself? Would people who had spent their life able to walk make the same choice for you as a child? I've had enough issues with (birth and not) parents and had enough friends in the same boat that I'm dismissive of birth parents (or otherwise 'unverified' parents) having any special inherant merit, but probably am too bias against it here.

Loss of culture is a significantly more difficult question, but I guess it's easier to pick up muggle culture later on than wizard culture later on? Like so many muggles literally do not know wizards exist in the first place. And it's a lot easier to learn to use muggle tools as an adult than it is to learn to use a wand as an adult, as well as losing a lot less opportunities than you otherwise would have. I'd be better off as a wizard without a smart phone than a muggleborn without a wand. That said, answering in such a way is concerning, I'm Australian and our Stolen Generation stuff is Fucked Up.
