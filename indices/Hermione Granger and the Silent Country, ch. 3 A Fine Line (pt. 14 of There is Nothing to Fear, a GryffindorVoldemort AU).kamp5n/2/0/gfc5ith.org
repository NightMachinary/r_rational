One thing is certain: this Riddle is a /far/ more interesting antagonist.

I am assuming this is a one point of divergence fic, where the only difference is the Sorting Hat's successful argument to Tom Riddle that his fear of death is a weakness best purged through Gryffindor companionship. In that case, we can be certain he /is,/ in fact, a villain. He does not personally care for the people he protects, because he is entirely incapable of empathy. His concern is immortality, though of an apparently different sort. He's doing all of this solely for himself.

He appears to have traded Stalin's terminal paranoia for /something else./ He isn't purging every competent person in a position of any power for fear that they might overthrow him, and thus causing administrative disaster, famine, and military disorder. Indeed, with such a small population, who will never fear starvation due to their magic, it wouldn't have mattered much if he had been Stalin's equal on the ladder of paranoia. He could not cause a Holodomor if he tried. But Dumbledore saw a flaw in his being, something which would cause him to fall. Moreover, Dumbledore, who championed the rights of all, was fighting against the man who did the same. There is something wrong with Riddle besides psychopathy.

But I really don't think we know enough to say whether this Riddle's rule is a net positive. The upsides are obvious, and as you have said, clearly worthy. Far more magical sapients are visibly included in all walks of public life. There are no children missing from canon, implying his revolution was scrupulous in sparing their lives. He does, at least, have some sort of compelling reason to abduct muggleborns, to protect them from the consequences of uncontrolled accidental magic. The Lost Generation could not have hurt themselves or others had they simply been left alone, while an unaware magical child clearly can. He's even treating the Basilisk with dignity, which I wouldn't have thought to do.

But there are far too many questions. They teach Dark Arts to children. Maybe that means it's a defense course with real teeth, but it could also be indoctrination and the swearing of binding oaths. We haven't seen nor heard from the House Elves yet, and the Centaurs are similarly absent. The Sorting Hat has been silenced. It's pretty clear that discipline at this school involves some form of torture, though we don't know what, why, or how it is justified. And, as is likely to be further explained in the next installment, they open each term with a duel, which they are required to watch whether or not they want to.

It is, as Hermione puts it, ominous.
