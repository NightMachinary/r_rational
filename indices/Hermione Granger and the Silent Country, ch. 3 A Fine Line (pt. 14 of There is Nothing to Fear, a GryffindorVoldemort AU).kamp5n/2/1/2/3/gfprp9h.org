Between trusting arbitrary people with the power of reproduction, and trusting whichever actors are brutal enough to win the tournament with the power to control /everything/, I think the former is by far the lesser of the two evils.

Rather than controlling reproduction, I would instead advocate for the rights of children to walk away from their parents and without incurring significant costs (which involves a much better safety net than we currently have - at minimum, a basic income which is controlled primarily by the child).
