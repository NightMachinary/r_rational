Sure, it's like how animals can become better off because of human laws but it's just happenstance. For example when royalty wanted hunting grounds it was good for the animal because here was a preserved area for them.

  (So, "Riddle's regime is a net positive for muggles right now" might be true, but it's overlooking the vital point that the math could change at any moment because Riddle isn't actually trying to improve muggle welfare, and he would pose an existential risk to muggles in the moment that this seemed like something he could and ought to do.)

I'm just considering it from "intelligent life" in which case if muggles need to be sacrificed it's better than nothing surviving in the empty universe. Of course, false dichotomy

  Right now, the muggle-borns aren't getting socialized parenting, they're still being parented by specific sets of parents, just not the parents they were born to.

Yeah I was being lazy with my use of words. It's not collectivized but exchanging biological children is not a traditionalist perspective. Obviously most of the examples from our world are of attempted ethnic cleansing but you can use progressive and traditional tools to that. Breaking up the family units of aboriginals for example is not traditionalist even if it was done by traditionalists
