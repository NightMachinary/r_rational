  I don't know, are there any groups who have done that for the good of the children rather than for ethnic cleansing?

That's a difficult question to answer. Many proponents of that policy probably thought that /of course/ taking children away from a "flawed and inferior culture with no prospects of a future" was for the good of the children. They might even have considered themselves progressive for implementing a policy that elevates nurture over nature and doesn't consider aboriginal children as lesser "by blood".
