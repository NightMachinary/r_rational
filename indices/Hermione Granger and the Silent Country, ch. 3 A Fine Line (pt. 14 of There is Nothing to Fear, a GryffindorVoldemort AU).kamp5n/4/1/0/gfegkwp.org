As I've said elsewhere, the entire conversation with McGonagall made no sense given the proceeding chapters and huge amount of caution they'd taken to keep her out of Britain at all costs. It's apparently common knowledge that Riddle is a Dark Wizard who took over Britain by force and is extremely dangerous. McGonagall giving into political pressure from a country she has no loyalty to in order to put a child she cares for in danger is so far out of character as to be unrecognizable. My objections regarding the parents not knowing when Hermione is going into mortal danger is really just an extension of my strained disbelief from previous chapters.
