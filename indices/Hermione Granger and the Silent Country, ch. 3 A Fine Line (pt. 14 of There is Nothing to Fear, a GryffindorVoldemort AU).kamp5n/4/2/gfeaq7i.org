Ehhh, kid isolated socially when growing up has trouble trusting people, including family, seems fine to me. Also because the culture gap means relating to things is harder so the relationship is strained in the first place. Also also Hermione's not exactly had the same info as we've gained from the French intelligence report chapter previous, her underestimating the danger would also contribute.

There's enough factors here to support Hermione's actions imo.
