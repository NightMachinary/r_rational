Nitpick thread:

#+begin_quote
  He set the clothes on the bed. “Get dressed as soon as you're finished, it won't be long now. There are people who want an introduction.”

  They were noble's clothing.
#+end_quote

The last sentence is problematic, especially because of the intervening quotation mentioning "people". The pronoun "they" should probably be avoided. (Without so much distance, it would be fine. "I hate these clothes. They make me look fat.") "The clothes were for nobles", or anything else, would be better.

#+begin_quote
  It included
#+end_quote

Pluralization mismatch (this is still referring to "the clothes").

#+begin_quote
  The sunlight glinted off it
#+end_quote

You can often get away with eliding words (especially in speech), but "off of it" would probably sound better here, since it's narration.

#+begin_quote
  just for a send off.
#+end_quote

The phrase "send-off" is usually hyphenated.

#+begin_quote
  and otherwise wearing tan-colored clothing, with little of the accents that Dominic's own clothes had.
#+end_quote

I observe that a fair amount of space is devoted to describing clothing, but in generic terms (tan-colored clothing). Seems like something specific should be noted here.

#+begin_quote
  “It's unfortunate, I agree” Dominic nodded.
#+end_quote

Needs a comma.

#+begin_quote
  The trip to Maskoy was marvelous, seeing the minarets towering over the city and eating the black-spiced food.
#+end_quote

Sounds like the minarets were eating food.

#+begin_quote
  It was an utter relief when Vidre slipping into the circle of conversation and politely informed
#+end_quote

slipped.

#+begin_quote
  and they would have to take their leave unless they [...] the ship was finally ready to take its leave.
#+end_quote

Repetitive. Seems like the ship should depart, or cast off, or whatever it is that ships do. (It casts off later.)

#+begin_quote
  There was a bard near Grantholm, a story-teller
#+end_quote

This occurrence is hyphenated, but a later one is not. I recommend dropping the hyphen.

#+begin_quote
  The point,” he looked toward Vidre, “Is that
#+end_quote

"is" should probably not be capitalized, since it's in the middle of his sentence.

#+begin_quote
  Wealdwood stirred slowly, ineffectually strained against his bonds with his disconnected muscles.
#+end_quote

I don't know what grammar rule is involved here, but "stirred, strained" doesn't sound right. It should be "stirred" followed by "straining". I believe it's because you're further describing a single action. (If it were "stirred, then strained" then it'd be okay.)

#+begin_quote
  “Lightscour has my full authorization to kill you
#+end_quote

This is a stylistic question, but "authorization" seems like an awfully modern word. Not sure what kind of flavor you intend to have here. ("Billion" gave me pause earlier, but I looked it up and it began to be used surprisingly early.)

#+begin_quote
  She placed one of her daggers in his hand, left the room without waiting for a response.
#+end_quote

Needs "in his hand, then left" or "in his hand and left".

#+begin_quote
  I was running low on coin, and forced to work at making boats,
#+end_quote

I believe this needs "was forced", despite the presence of the first "was".

#+begin_quote
  Yet there were flaws; he had little feeling in his legs and feet, and disorders of the body.
#+end_quote

"and disorders of the body" doesn't sound right ("had" doesn't connect to it properly). Probably needs a verb like "suffered".

#+begin_quote
  who brought be back from the brink
#+end_quote

me.

#+begin_quote
  As the it went,
#+end_quote

As the what?

Fun chapter! I liked taking some time away from the main story, similarly to how I enjoyed Worm's interludes.
