Officially in love with Gaelwyn's origin story. This is some exposition I most certainly Do Not Mind.

Of course someone would try to brute-force check the domains of kids at an early age. That makes perfect sense. It's a shame that fame isn't a limitless quantity, since an army of illustrati would be /bad-ass/.

Speaking of limitless fame, population growth should be a primary goal. I wonder how that could be accomplished. Reminds me of 2YE's Neklos and his army of undead. Doesn't sound feasible, though, given the listed domains.

Anyway, those theories about all people having basic, subconscious bodily domains is ... well, it kinda feels like it makes sense. I wonder how in hell a world like this could ever possibly evolve. I kinda feel like that isn't quite within the scope of this fic, though.

And, of course, Gaelwyn's scientific pursuits. I think he's my favorite character. Last chapter, Vidre; this one, Gaelwyn. Remarkable how quickly you're selling me! Credit to you as usual, [[/u/alexanderwales]].
