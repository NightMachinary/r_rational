Basically this. It doesn't hurt that his name sounds like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen][Galen]], one of the earliest and most famous medical researchers. His texts were used for over a thousand years. Mostly wrong of course, but still well advanced for the time.

Gaelwyn seems to step into a similar role, with a popular opinion on him matching with those you'd expect coming out of a concentration camp doctor or Unit 731. Medical experimentation is unsurprisingly terrifying to the common person, and non-consensual experimentation on prisoners of war even moreso.

Gaelwyn himself seems to have some kind of greater good morality, judging by the last line of this chapter. He has some ethical boundaries, but is willing to overcome them in certain situations.
