  Anyway, those theories about all people having basic, subconscious bodily domains is ... well, it kinda feels like it makes sense. I wonder how in hell a world like this could ever possibly evolve. I kinda feel like that isn't quite within the scope of this fic, though.

I don't think that's the actual reason - it's a plausible hypotheses within the scope of the story, but given that it works just fine in the real world without the need for magic, I'm betting it's just a case of misattribution.
