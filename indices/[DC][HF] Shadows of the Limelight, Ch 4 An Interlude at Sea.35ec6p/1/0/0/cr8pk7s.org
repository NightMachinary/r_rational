I know I selfishly would prefer if there were a single primary discussion forum, rather than having conversation scattered across your website, [[/r/rational]], and [[/r/ShadowsOfTheLimelight]]. It would not bother me personally to have to click an extra time to remedy this.

I can tell you that immediately after reading your claim that reddit has an "Other discussions" link, I spent five minutes by the clock searching for this purported link and was absolutely ready to claim there was no such thing anywhere on the page before I finally spotted it. Certainly in my four years as a casual user of reddit I have never before taken notice of those tabs. Hence, at least anecdotally, I would not count on that as a reliable method for people to find cross-links. But that is kind of beside the point, since even thoroughly obvious and easy-to-find cross-linking would not mollify my main objection to fragmented discussion.
