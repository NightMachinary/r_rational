In my limited experience, player characters often develop themes and arc anyway, mostly because the players themselves choose actions consistently enough.

In any other case, if you want to enforce characterization, you could give them traits that give bonus and cons.

In PoC, there is no permanent character cast(which until recently, last only 4 updates), but there is a sense of characterization of a civilization.

The player civilization, the Ymaryn, is the best friend you could ever have, but also your worst enemy, which plays into the strategic implication of their build, since losing lands is much more costly for them, but also make them ferocious opponents in defensive wars, which also make them shit at conquest.

Combined with other values, this of course has all sort of historical and narrative implications.
