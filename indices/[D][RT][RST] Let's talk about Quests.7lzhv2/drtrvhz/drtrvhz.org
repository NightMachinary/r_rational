[[https://questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/][Polyhistor Academy]] is a rationalist quest I highly recommend, and it just started back up again for [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-year-two.6716/][Year 2]]. The quest takes place an academy of magic, with the main character specializing most heavily in Illusion and Mental magic. The twist is the top 10% of each class are awarded practically unlimited funding for their future projects. The bottom 90%... well, death is preferable. This paradigm set was forth by the school's (re)founder, Yoseph Kroll, who uses the school as a method for mass-producing extremely powerful mages. The competition between the students and the quality of the facilities creates pressure to push students far beyond what they would be capable of elsewhere.

Kroll is not an ethical man, and the horrifying aspects of the setting are played out logically.

Despite being hosted on QQ, Polyhistor Academy is definitely not a porn quest. Instead, it is there because the author wanted creative freedom. Sexuality is part of the human condition, after all.
