I've read a few. I think that a lot of the enjoyment comes from the community rather than the qualities of the work itself. When read without that community, some of the pleasure from the story is lost, because it's a dead thing rather than a living one, and there are plenty of authors offering static stories.

Writing a quest takes a lot of tools out of the writer's toolbox, and some that aren't outright removed get severely crippled. It's difficult to have a setup and payoff if there's an audience ready to step in the way of that payoff. Similarly, it's really tough to develop a theme, have a character go through a character arc, develop parallels or symmetries that reinforce the central point ... a lot of stuff gets much, much harder, and from what I've read, mostly just doesn't get done as a result. This is compounded by the fact that quests are, almost by definition, first drafts.

Now, some authors are skilled enough to be able to tie up loose ends while also working within the constraints of audience participation, and there are different levels of quest so far as that goes. Even for those authors that /aren't/ skilled enough, some readers don't actually care if there are a bunch of loose ends left around, and in any case, this isn't a big problem if the author's solution is just "continue this thing forever or abandon it when I get bored", which also works for some audiences (minus the abandonment part).

I think in general it's an interesting concept, but not one that tends to produce results that are toward my personal tastes.
