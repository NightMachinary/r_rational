/Snicker/ More like the opposite. While there is a good amount of porn, there is plenty of plot and an over-arching storyline. In fact, every single sex scene furthers the story in some way.

It is a pornographic story that is so much more and philosophically deeper than "just porn". The quotes I posted under the link for Erogamer perfectly sums up what the quest will deliver.
