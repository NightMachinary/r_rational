Cultivation quest is me making a reference to the Chinese genre of Xianxia which is about people 'cultivating' their strength, magic (qi), and martial arts to become immortal and/or to reach the pinnacle of strength (be able to beat up everyone else).

It's a very stagnant genre as once you've read one novel, you've read all of them due to how similar each of the novels are. I generally treat them as the junk food of literature. It's a very simple plot where I can feel good reading about protagonists who succeed at virtually everything (you could call them Mary-Sues). [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ab3xk/recommendations_xianxia_is_a_good_genre_and_you/d0zm9va/][Here's]] a link to a very good critique of the genre. [[http://www.wuxiaworld.com/][Wuxiaworld]] has the best collection of translated Xianxia novels if you want to read them anyway and I recommend /I Shall Seal the Heavens/ and /Desolate Era/ as the best of the lot which aren't deconstructions or subversions of the tropes.

However, Forge of Destiny is a quest where the players are controlling a disciple which has made this stagnant genre very interesting due to how there is a lot more well-thought out world-building and lack of a guaranteed success.
