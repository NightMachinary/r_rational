On the basis of the first thirty-three chapters (half-read, half-skimmed):\\
- Humor verging on crack-fic territory\\
- Protagonists (genin with no interesting techniques or abilities) about whom I don't care (and I'm not interested enough to wait for the fuuinjutsu investigations to get somewhere good)\\
- Aimlessness (It makes me realize how boring the "Orochimaru roams the elemental countries to buy/exchange/steal techniques rather than sequestering himself in hidden laboratories" idea that I had some years ago very likely would be.)
