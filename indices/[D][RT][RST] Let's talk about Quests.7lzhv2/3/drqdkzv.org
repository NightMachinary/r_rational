  What do you think of quests?
#+end_quote

In general, I dislike stories that are composed of excessively-short chapters.

However, the content of a story matters just as much as its format and its English do. After spending the past two or three hours in looking for interesting quests (in the course of writing this comment), I can't say that I've found any.

  What +good+ quests have you read or are you reading?
#+end_quote

I read /[[http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4][Problem Sleuth]]/ years ago, and currently am following /[[http://www.prequeladventure.com/category/archive/][Prequel]]/. My interest in those stories is based primarily on their pixel art. (The story of /Homestuck/ was totally insufficient to sustain me through an archive binge. Even /Problem Sleuth/ took several attempts to complete.)

In the course of writing this comment, I found that /[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/24793][Marked for Death]]/, /[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/5465][The Erogamer]]/, and /[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/1897][Twisted Pinwheel]]/ seemed somewhat interesting at first but fell flat after a few chapters, while nothing else was even worth mentioning.

  Would you read a quest?

The content of a story matters just as much as its format and its English. Quests cannot be summarily written off on the basis of lackluster experiences. Would I have stuck with fanfiction if I hadn't stumbled across /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ at the tail end of the binge on vacuous NaruHina fluff that followed my initial discovery of FanFiction.net?

tl;dr: Yes.
