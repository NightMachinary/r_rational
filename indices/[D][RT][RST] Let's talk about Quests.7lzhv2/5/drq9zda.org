  What good quests have you read/ are you reading? (I'll post my own recommendations list in the comments)
#+end_quote

Pretty boring but well known quest:

MSPA

Quests I actually like:

[[http://www.prequeladventure.com][www.prequeladventure.com]]

problem sleuth

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/no-matter-what-happens-i-still-wont-become-an-anime-character.9848/][No Matter What Happens, I Still Won't Become An Anime Character]]

There were a bunch of good ones on the MSPA forums, like one story told through colors that was pretty clever but RIP to those I guess. Some stuff survived though on the mspaint fan adventures site. [[https://mspfa.com/?s=132&p=1][A Beginner's Guide to the End of the Universe]] was pretty often recommended I think and I thought it's certainly above average.

  How can quests be designed to be both rational/ist and engaging?
#+end_quote

Per andrew hussie from MSPA, once the audience for a quest is big enough, it's pretty easy to just pick the suggestion that one thought of themselves for the story in the first place. Given that, it doesn't seem too difficult to keep a story rational despite including audience participation.

You might like [[/r/youenteradungeon]], though I don't really go on there much so can't say whether I recommend it.
