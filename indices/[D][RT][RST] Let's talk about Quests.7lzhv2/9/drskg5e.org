  What do you think of quests?
#+end_quote

They severly limit author potential to produce great story.

  How can quests be tuned to balance fluff with crunch?
#+end_quote

The best kind of game mechanic is implicit one, because it allows to bloom most spectacular and convincing ideas not the most numerically superior by some inane metric.

  How can quests be designed to be both rational/ist and engaging?
#+end_quote

I don't think that it can be done. Mob are unlike individuals it consists of is dumb, emotional and incapable of implementing any long term plans. So protagonist in quests often forced to do idiotic things without any half-decent explanation, which is really painful to watch in rational/ist world.

  What issues do many quests have?
#+end_quote

Author gives players too long leash, with which they proceed to hang themself. Big groups of people tend to be dull, so author should use every trick in the book to squeeze some forethought from the mob. Even if said tricks restrict players freedom.
