Here's my quest recommendations that involve the players being smart and dealing with a rational/well-thought out setting:

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/][Forge of Destiny]] - Cultivation Quest where the players control a street rat with above average cultivation talent.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dragon-ball-after-the-end.30940/][Dragon Ball: After the End]] - Dragon Ball Quest set centuries after the ending of the manga where a pacifistic descendant of Goku needs to learn how to rule a people who thinks she's weak for being a pacifist while enemies come to kill off the remaining Saiyans.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/][Puella Magi Adfligo Systema]] - Puella Magi Madoka Magica Quest where the players start out by wishing for their Kyuubey-granted power to be the ability to control /grief/. Yes the wish is as over-powered as it sounds to anyone who has seen the show and every last bit of Mary Sue-ness/intelligent planning/lucky dice-rolls is required to survive the quest.

[[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/][Erogamer]] - Pornographic Gamer Quest where a girl spontaneously become a game character out of an eroge with unsettling implications.
