  Is erogamer more than just porn?
#+end_quote

Most writing from Questionable Content falls into that problem--It's a site explicitly made for XXX content, as Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity don't allow them. Which means essentially all of the works on there have porn in them, usually in place of things like plot and character development.

The Erogamer is a big exception there, oddly enough. Gamer fics usually go downhill fast due to various inherent flaws, so it should be doubly cursed. However, the author managed to write a emotionally compelling story about a girl going from a hopeless castoff to a more functional member of society.

Some of the plot parts are actually pretty fantastic, which I won't spoil.
