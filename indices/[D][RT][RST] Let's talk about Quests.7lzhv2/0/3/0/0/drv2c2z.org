The reader mode is perfect thank you, sadly no computer access to use calibre.

Thanks for the explanation, it sounds similar to isekai in terms of them mostly being the same and not that high quality am I right in that?

I am enjoying forge of destiny even without awareness of the genre through I'm a bit annoyed at how quest choosers seem to always choose someone who is uncharismatic. I prefer characters who dive headstrong with confidence into unfamiliar territory, or at least attempt to be better prepared (not talking to the carriage driver for a multiple hour journey for example).

I also leafed through some of the other ones and am most interested in the pmmm one, enjoying the civ one too, it's interesting to read, kind of reminds me of alternative history. So thanks for the recommendations
