I've read a little ways in (past the imps), and this story reminds me unpleasantly of [[https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/][The Wandering Inn]], in that every action tried fails horribly, and nothing ever goes right for the protagonist. I personally call it Angst-farming, where the characters exist to be tortured.

Does it ever grow out of that? If so, how long does it take?
