Grand Strategy, Eh?

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-world-waits-on-evil-hivers-eoa-ww-a-finished-story.274791/][The World Waits on evil:]] A man from earth is body-switched with a lich, and has to lead his (partly undead) kingdom without giving away the fact that he isn't the original ruler. Not a quest, but likely the most rational fic I've read on those two forums. Features a non base ten system of math, non standard english words and phrases (he isn't speaking english in the story, some things don't translate exactly. Fuck = "love like striking", for instance.), a necromancy based industrial revolution, and magical experimentation.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deus-ex-mechanicus-reboot-archive-thread.312510/#post-15240568][Deus Ex Mechanicus:]] Control a Mechanicus Forge world. Technically controlling a ruler, but this quest is more broad strokes than most. Lots of tech development, societal changes, massive infrastructure projects, fleets sent out to fight, genetic enhancement projects...

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-geeks-guide-corporation-of-occult-research-and-extermination-complete.330378/][A Geek's Guide: Corporation of Occult Research and Extermination]] Control the head of a secret US-based organization made to defend against supernatural threats. Plenty of tech-development, and orchestrating world events from behind the scene. Actually finished, and despite it's Anime setting, has good writing and characters.

I think the sequel is just okay (too much power wanking), but it's set years later anyway, focusing on a completely different group.

Loads of tech development, conquest, infrastructure building, etc. Completely OC, as far as I can tell. Start with the second post, which has the index.
