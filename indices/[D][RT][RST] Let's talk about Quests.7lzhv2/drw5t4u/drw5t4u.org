I see a lot of people saying that Quests have shortcomings that regular stories don't, and that's true. But a point that I think many of you are missing is that a Quest isn't just a reader-driven narrative, it's a /game/. It has advantages in reader/player enjoyment/engagement that a story does not. The strengths of the two mediums coming together are admittedly balanced by weaknesses from both, but it's wrong to view them purely as a strictly-inferior version of a story, because you're missing a large part of the point.
