My first thought is that to the extent things can enter the time warp, it grows in pressure and density until it turns into a black hole. Even if only adventurers get in.

My second thought is that the easiest way to narrate that away is to make there be a limited number of transition chambers that allow people to enter the loop.

You'll need a boundary that blocks basically everything from both sides, I think.

For example, if light can only exit the bubble that makes the boundary's temperature appear to be absolute zero from the inside. Since all things with temperature emit radiation, gases would be slowly condensing on the inside. The bubble itself would be an infinite source of low-grade heat from the outside. That would be interesting but might not be what you want.

Here's an idea. You could make it so that there is a secondary pressure across the edge of the bubble, a mysterious force such that sticking things in it takes an increasing amount of energy. Say, every additional ton of mass trying to enter the bubble doubles the repulsion force. The boundary has a thickness that one must cross while overcoming the repulsion the whole way, or you just bounce out. In short order air, rain, and thrown rocks basically can't enter by accident. The protagonist enters by ramming it with their car, while the final entrant uses a crashing spaceship. Even with that a few stray energetic particles will get in--but the nice part about having a thickness to the boundary is that you can fine-tune the precision of the necessary trajectory as well as the temperature of the entering particles. The accumulation can be made slow enough that it doesn't overheat before the universe ends.

What happens to items that only make it halfway? I prefer 'severed at the boundary'. And then, what if an object collides with another that is currently entering? Mashed together, or else you can't push air out of the way as you enter. To solve the light issue, well, from the inside perhaps you just see whatever the bubble saw on its first play through. It's not consistent with how it treats matter, and the temperature problems will still be there to an extent, but at least gasses won't be condensing. (You could still use the wall as a heat sink as long as you don't mind waiting for radiation to cool whatever your hot thing is.)

There will also be a slight breeze at the beginning of the loop from the second play through, when air was able to get past the barrier. Mirrors just outside the boundary will reflect the wrong things. You can infer how much has entered the area by making a note of the fastest thing that you've seen enter--or even better, with a detector that minutely measures gamma radiation from the boundary, knowing that only high-energy particles will be able to make it after a time. The calculations for that are beyond me, though. It might not work.
