Hey, I don't disagree. That was my entire point in mentioning /The Wandering Inn./ It's leveling progression occurs when characters fulfill their narrative or self-destined roles. My entire last paragraph is about how I wish more authors who are writing LitRPG would go with a more narrative/storytelling system as it makes much more interesting stories than just killing things. The reason I think this doesn't happen, is that lots of amateur writers are lazy and throwing together an XP=killing things is dead simple compared to constructing a proper narrative.
