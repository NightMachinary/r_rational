FYI, the famous Stargate: SG-1 time loop episode "Window of Opportunity" actually mentions at the very end that the time loop was confined to Earth and a few other planets (they mention the Tok'Ra being worried they couldn't contact Earth for several months), but it has absolutely no consequences on the show and is not referenced ever again. Makes me wonder why they decided to mention it at all.
