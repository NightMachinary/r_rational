I'm not sure why you would want a bubble?

Suppose there's a Loopulation Process which causes any person or thing which undergoes the process to begin looping with a certain Duration (how long the overall looping phenomena continues from an outside perspective) and Frequency (how long between each reset of a loop). For the Duration, the loopulated entities reset to their initial state and position every Frequency. Things loop 'together' if they have a matching (or nearly matching) Frequency, but entities with a different Frequency de-synchronize just as you'd expect. Anything that has not been exposed to the Process can interact with looping entities in a normal fashion, but are not reset when the loop resets - they retain their knowledge and position independent of any loops.

As a rough story idea, let's say we have world where the Loopulation Process is well known and is included as an emergency protocol in high value targets, such as airplanes. In the midst of an airline hijacking, the captain broadcasts a distress signal to aircraft control and activates the onboard Emergency Loopulator, putting the entire plane in a Frequency 6 hours, Duration 8 weeks loop in order to make sure that the crew and passengers have the best chance possible to be rescued. Although nobody onboard retains their memories of prior loops, the people outside the loop at aircraft control instruct the Captain, crew and passengers on what to do, what's worked well in the past and what the hijackers are likely to try. An accomplice on the ground does the same thing for the hijackers, communicating via text messages.

Onboard are a set of Deloopulators, which can be used to selectively remove people, objects and portions of the aircraft from the loop early, at the obvious cost of leaving them stranded outside of the loop in whatever state they are at the time they're Deloopulated - people floating unsupported in the middle of a flight path (or on the tarmac if done while the plane is landed), removing portions of the cabin, permanently disarming the hijackers (or security) of their weapons and radio, etc. All the while, the police are trying to find the accomplice on the ground and capture them.
