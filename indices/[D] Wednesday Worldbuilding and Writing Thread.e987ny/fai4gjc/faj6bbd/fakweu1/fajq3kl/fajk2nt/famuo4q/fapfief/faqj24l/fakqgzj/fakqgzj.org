energy and matter can neither be created nor destroyed. time is a dimension of space. a time loop then is 4-dimensional array of 3-dimensional objects in a sturdy formation. the 'loop' moves things and changes their state (is the vase broken or unbroken?) and so requires an amount of energy to function.

if we add entropy to the equation, then maintaining a temporal loop has a high energy cost. and a time loop of sufficient power may be indistinguishable from an event horizon. what if some singularities are just entire solar systems stuck in time loops, and this is screwing with the rest of the universe at large?

for a story, we only need to explain the parts that the reader observes directly through the story. the rest is higher dimensional math and physics waiting for someone to earn a nobel prize.
