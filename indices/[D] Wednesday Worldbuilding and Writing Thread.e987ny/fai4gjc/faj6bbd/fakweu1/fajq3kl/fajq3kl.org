The most interesting thing I've done with a Time Loop story recently is put a role playing game in one. The players began as low level people living their lives, and then a great disaster unfolded. They had limited visibility into what was going down, and were far too insignficant to stop it.

After this, they encountered the looping mechanism, got a minor power up, got sent back to the start.

They know how many loops they have, and how much they will power up after each loop. They know the victory and loss conditions, and they have essentially complete freedom to wander around causing trouble within the loop.

It has been a lot of fun so far. The players seem really into this premise. I feel like someone ought to make a module out of it for a popular RPG system.
