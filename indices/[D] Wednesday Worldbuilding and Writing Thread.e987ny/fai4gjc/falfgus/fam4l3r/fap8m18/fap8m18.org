Well, from a storytelling/quality perspective, most litrpg stories fail (imo) because they focus too much on getting stronger through protagonists gaining levels by killing things over and over. Eventually, the reader comes to realize that the main character is functionally immortal and will always survive the next "deadly fight" to gain that next level or whatever.

Litrpgs also often have ridiculously powerful abilities for no apparent reason, just because the protagonist found some key or unique solution to an old problem (where the solution is often obvious to the reader). I find it irrational that in a world that's presumably had hundreds of generations of people living under the "system" that nobody's discovered the secret to power that the main character has when it seems so logical.

People in general underestimate the people who lived in the past, and as most litrpgs run in generic fantasy world, people assume that the medieval-feudal era people were idiots. This isn't true at all. People 500 years ago were just as smart/intelligent as we are now. They might lack knowledge or have a poor education, but that doesn't mean that they're stupid.

As for ways to munchkin or break most litrpg systems, that's easy. Often, the more "numbers" and stats there are, the easier it is to manipulate the system. For example, what prevents a character from building mechanical traps or monster funneling systems which allow the character to easily kill monsters? If the answer is that the system somehow only awards points when the character is "in danger", how do you define this level-of-danger? If you hang a sword over yourself connected to some sort of shrodinger's box cat-killing device, does that put the character in danger?

In general, the only way to write a completely rational litrpg is to only use "numbers" sparsely (if at all) or to use them in a subversive manner. For example, I'd say that /The Wandering Inn/ does this very well as (even though it's not strictly rational fiction) it avoids all sorts of numbers-based inconsistencies by basically only giving people a class, a level, and some skills. There are no strength points, no mana bars, and no status screens. The reader and the characters in the story don't know exactly how levels progress, how classes or assigned, or the mechanics of the "system". This allows the author to write an excellent story with lifelike and rational characters while avoiding any number-based traps or pitfalls.
