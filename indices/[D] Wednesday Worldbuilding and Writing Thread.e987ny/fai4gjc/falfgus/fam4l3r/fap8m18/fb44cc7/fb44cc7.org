Alternatively, you could roll with an RPG system other than D&D for once. The Chronicles of Darkness, for instance, doesn't reward XP just for killing things. It rewards XP whenever the GM feels is most appropriate and fitting, for the story they're telling.

The system also has a bunch of mechanical incentives in its various gamelines, that reward players for doing stupid, sub-optimal things that nonetheless fit the character they're playing as. If my character is Wrathful, I might lash out in anger, and hurt or insult someone important to my goals. If my character is Proud, I might try to show off in a tense encounter, only for my showboating to blow up in my face.

Because ChroD isn't about power fantasies. It's about enabling stories, about characters who bumble and fail and struggle in dramatic ways. Characters who are, quite often, their own worst enemies.
