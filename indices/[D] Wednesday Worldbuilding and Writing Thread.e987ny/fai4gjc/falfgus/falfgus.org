There was some worldbuilding and thought experimenting going on over in the litrpg subreddit: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/litrpg/comments/e9p3rg/how_do_make_love_to_a_cannibal_life_must_be_scary/]]

litrpg stories seem like they would be a good mix with the rational genre, though in practice they mostly fall short in all the normal ways that fantasy stories fall short.

I do like that most litrpg systems at least /try/ to set out a world with consistent rules and magic.

What internal problems / inconsistencies / munchkin opportunities do you see from a litrpg type world where experience / power is gained from killing things.
