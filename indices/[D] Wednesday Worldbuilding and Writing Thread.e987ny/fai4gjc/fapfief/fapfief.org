How about a mass to time ratio? Entering objects only last a limited amount of loops, with lighter objects lasting shorter. Light and other radiation will not be able to loop because they are massless, rain and air would only last one or two loops, and most importantly, people who enter have only a few dozen or however many loops to be able to figure out how to exit or subvert the loop. This adds time pressure, since you are presumably erased at the end of the last loop.
