By arranging a set of written metafictional works (fictional work referenced in other fictional works but not previously existing in reality) you can make an entrance to the library unpublished, an seemingly infinite library containing books referenced by other books.

At its close layers, the library has books referenced or heavily implied by popular works translated into English: textbooks a Hogwarts students might use, the fictional Red book of Westmarch (the book Tolkien indicated was the source material for Lord of the Rings), a translation of the Voynich manuscript etc. In the close layer magic either doesn't work or only has effects justifiable by coincidence or the placebo effect. The shelf-lined hallways are dangerously, claustrophobically narrow in the close layer, especially around entrances created with the bare minimum number of books. The geometry is only slightly non-Euclidean but is still very disorienting with slanted floors and non right angles everywhere.

In the intermediate layer, the books get more exotic: books in fictional languages, books only made up and mentioned in private writings or obscure barely read writings, books only referenced by other books in the library itself. Here you can find a guide to the library if you are munchkin enough to have made up a story describing one. In this layer, magical effects from books can slightly surpass the placebo effect and coincidence: teaching you impossibly fast speed reading, enhancing your working memory, fictional languages, bending probability, etc. The hallways are narrow but not outright claustrophobic in this layer. The geometry of this layer is better understood with graph theory than anything like Euclidean geometry: the connections and intersections of individual hallways are consistent, and the length of individual hallways are consistent, but the way they connect is arbitrary, for example: three hallways will completely ignore the triangle inequality theorem.

In the deep layers, the magic and books get unpredictable: outright magic works in so far as it doesn't effect the higher layers, books made of edible material exist, books made of volatile chemicals, books made of magical materials. Entering this layer for any extended amount of time makes it increasingly difficult to return because you can't bring magical effects “up”, you have to remove the magic from yourself before returning. In this layer even connections between hallways and individual hallways are inconsistent, a hallway might be short while traveling in one direction and impossibly long traveling in the other direction.

To be more specific: an entrance to the closest layer will require at minimum two dozen fictional works, arranged on opposite sides of a narrow hallway. Skimping on quality/quantity may make an entrance lead to dangerously narrow hallways in the closest layer.

You can exit the closest layer out of an entrance other that the one you entered, but you will need a very good understanding of the library's organization to have a chance of finding it. With good knowledge of library organization it might be under a (subjective) mile of travel even given arbitrarily large real world distance between entrances. With perfect library knowledge a willingness to briefly travel into intermediate or deep layers as a shortcut, you can get from entrance to entrance in under 5 minutes.

So you have a potential means of fast travel and a source of magic that only works in a dangerous location. Any persistent magical effects either need to be justifiable by placebo/coincidence or it the effect and whatever it exists on traps you in the location. Munchkin ideas?

- Best money making ideas? Keeping it secret? Letting it go public?

- Best (cheapest vs. fastest vs. quality) ways to get the initial two dozen works written, printed, and bound?

- How to best to use narrow cramped hallways that require around a mile of travel through to keep a moon base or Mars base supplies?

- What fictional magical effects are worth searching for and utilizing given the risks involved? (I imagine transporting weakened cancer patients to the deep layers is going to be a logistical challenge).
