No munchkin ideas from me, but I love the idea of "the magical bends" where you have to come up slowly as you purge the magic from your system.

Some questions:

1. Is there any connection between the content material of the interior of the Library and the exterior location where that entrance is located?
2. Would someone with a Library Sciences degree have any sort of advantage in the Library, or is it completely disconnected from "real" library organization sytems?
