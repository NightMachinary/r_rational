1: The connection between location in the library is subtly dictated by the type and organization of the books used in the entrance. For a overly simplified example, including in your entrance 3 Hogwarts textbooks, spaced 12 books apart on the left side of the entrance might open up to a section/hallway of the library where books existing in the Harry Potter universe (or in general magical universes) occur every 3 books and textbooks (or in general in-universe educational nonfiction) occur every 4 books. This leads to several related rules I left out...

- Removing or rearranging too many books from a single hallway/section changes the “organization” of that hallway and can change its connectivity/location in the library. It takes a lot of book taking and rearranging to do this in the closest layer (where magic is scarce), and the deepest layers are so chaotic it doesn't matter so much, but in the intermediate layers this can be a major hazard where a single critical book you need is hazardous to remove if you were naively counting on retracing your steps afterwards.

- you can't reuse books in entrances, you need new books for each entrance, but luckily it is reasonably safe to use books taken from the library in entrances.

2: I had to look up library sciences... somewhat useful? In the closest layer: a lot of the organization patterns aren't too hard to decipher: a text book sort of book every 17 books for several hallways before changing to every 19 books for several hallways before breaking down as a rule entirely, a section leaning towards magical universes, a section leaning towards science fiction, a section between them for universes that are both, a hallway leaning towards a single universe, an (in-universe) old book every 11 books. The problem is that these patterns are: overlapping and/or fractally embedded in each other: extremely spaced out (I picked smaller prime numbers as simple examples, but some patterns might only be discernible across there or four fight numbers of books), noisy/fuzzy (as to what counts as a category), and such. In the intermediate layers it starts getting easier: you can leverage books with instructions on quasi-magical techniques to find books or pathways, you can find meta-meta books describing the library itself. In the deep layers you pretty much have to be heavily leveraging magic to navigate at all.
