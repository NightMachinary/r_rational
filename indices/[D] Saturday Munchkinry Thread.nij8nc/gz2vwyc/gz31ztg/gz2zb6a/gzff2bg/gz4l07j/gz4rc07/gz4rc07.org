  There's a way to cheese this, if metafiction about new fiction published by yourself counts.
#+end_quote

Per the original story this is inspired by... self-published books work

#+begin_quote
  explicitly referencing a huge number of made up, extremely thin,\\
  single-paged books, with each "book" containing a single word inside.
#+end_quote

According to the more detailed rules I outlined for Krossfiero, this will cause your entrance to open into a less useful section of the library. For instance a bunch of books composed of single words per page, single page books would open to section of the library that followed that pattern of extremely short and extremely simple books for a large distance and might be harder to navigate without any clearer patterns to search through. The books filled with titles and nothing but lorem ipsum might be especially useless, as you might get a section of library that is full lorem ipsum for miles around. You could use lorem ipsum books as filler. Based on the typical patterns of repetition in the library... two dozen good quality books should be good and then you could use various GPT-3 auto-created and lorem-ipsum and one page books as "filler" (to adjust the organizational rules around which books are found in the section of library your entrance accesses).

  Does that mean each titled book can only be used for entrance creation once?
#+end_quote

Yes, I meant to imply this limitation, and I made it explicit in response to Krossfiero's questions. However, once you have on entrance, you can explore out from it, take a few books from each section you find near your entrance, then use those books to put together another entrance.

  That makes it difficult to use works from popular fiction since\\
  metafiction from those will likely have stopped being metafiction if\\
  other entrance users exist.
#+end_quote

That is a good point! I suppose it means you should keep the entrance creation methods secret, or at least tightly controlled, and/or form a collaborative project around avoiding creating the same metafictional work and thereby negating its usefulness.
