The source material presents multiple contradicting explanations for the library in the form of a CYOA, I took one of the more supernatural explanations and tried to come up with a simplified mechanism for accessing it.

As for the post-it note exploit... at minimum size the passages through the library are cramped, narrows hallways, but still recognizably hallways, and the entrance needs to roughly match in width, so no bag-of holding “entrance” used as storage. I guess you could fit an entrance in a larger boat or spacecraft or maybe even mobile home though and make use of the extra dimensional space that way, so good munchkin!
