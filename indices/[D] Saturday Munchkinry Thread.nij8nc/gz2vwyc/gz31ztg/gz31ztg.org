Things to do with magic:

*Magical manufacturing of mundane materials*: Depending on the specific magic, it could be very easy to rearrange some carbon atoms and walk out with a perfectly-mundane diamond the size of your head or a rope made of flawless single-walled nanotubes. Stretching the rules a bit, healing or biomodification aren't persistent magical effects either, as there's nothing magical about a person without cancer or genetic diseases.

*Decryption and Detection*: Use unlocking magic to generate the key for an encrypted harddrive, and copy that key onto a mundane medium (eg. pencil and paper). Alternatively, use advanced non-physical testing, such as testing someone's blood to see the date of their death, a picture of them to find their current location, or a table to see which documents were on it.

Ways to make it easier:

*Telescopes*: Set up a thing in the appropriately-magical zone, but only observe it remotely, from a lower-magic area using telescopes and mirrors. This may be more difficult in the shifting, inconsistent high-magic zones.
