- *Land warfare:* You can teleport over targets with ~200kg bombs. These could be air-bursting thermobaric explosives, small JDAMs, napalm, or cluster munitions which disperse smaller fragmentation explosives to handle infantry, or anti-personnel or anti-tank mines to make an area impassable. You could deploy one of these every six seconds within a range of about a kilometer and you'd be immune to anti-aircraft missiles. You could be targeted by machine guns, but your sudden appearance and downward acceleration would make you a hard target, and possibly impossible to hit if you're suddenly appearing straight above the target, especially if the sun is overhead.

- *Naval warfare:* Similar to land warfare, though engagement ranges will usually be well beyond the distance you can teleport in one shot. You might need to travel up to 300+ km if you're starting from a surface ship, which would take a good 30 minutes round-trip. If you start from a submarine instead, you could be much closer to the target. You could deploy small torpedoes or drop small naval mines directly into the path of the enemy ship.

- *Aerial warfare:* You can move at 1,200 km/h (just under the speed of sound) and could carry a pair of AIM-9 Sidewinders, and maybe a small targeting system for them. You'd be pretty much immune to enemy missiles by teleporting every three seconds, and guns wouldn't be likely to fare much better. So you'd effectively be a small, stealthy, short-range air superiority fighter.

- *Medevac:* You could do mid-air personnel transfers without needing to land. For example, a C-130 Hercules could be outfitted and staffed to serve as an airborne operating room and trauma ICU. You could teleport from the C-130 to the ground, pick up the wounded person, and then teleport with them straight back to the operating room, providing care faster, with less risk of getting shot down, and without needing to risk moving the casualty to an open clearing. A C-130 is twice as fast as a UH-60 Blackhawk, has almost eight times the range, and almost 16 times the carrying capacity allowing it to be very well stocked and staffed. When you get back to a field hospital, you can teleport casualties to the ground to avoid yet another landing, making the whole process drastically faster.

- *Hostage rescue:* If you can see where the hostages are, you can possibly extract them while the hostage-takers are distracted, or while smoke/tear gas obscures their vision. You could also pull passengers and crew off of a passenger airliner in flight, especially if an empty airliner can be sent to intercept and follow it.
