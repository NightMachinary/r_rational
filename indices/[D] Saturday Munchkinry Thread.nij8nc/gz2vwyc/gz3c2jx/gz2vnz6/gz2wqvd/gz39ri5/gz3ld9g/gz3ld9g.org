A bonus section (to cover [[/u/Valeide]] 's sci-fi setting):

*Space warfare:* Engagement ranges will be even worse than naval warfare, and engagement speeds will likely be so fast that your near-speed-of-sound teleportation won't help. However, you can still act as a surprisingly deadly weapon.

Suppose you're on one of two ships which spins up a thin ring made of boron nitride nanotubes, with a radius of about 500 m, supported by spokes made of more boron nitride nanotubes. They're spun up on a magnetically-levitated axle until the edge of the thin ring is moving at about 1% of the speed of light. A powerful laser on the ship is used as a spotlight to indicate the part of the ring you need to teleport to.

You teleport near that point on the ring with a 190 kg missile and <10 kg space suit + oxygen tank, and you immediately end up on a near-collision trajectory towards the target at about 3,000 km/s. Unfortunately, this means you can't just teleport straight back, and even if you passed by a drone which is maintaining distance relative to the launching ship, you'd still need to travel at least 9,000 km to get back which would take 7.5 hours. This is why there's a second ship of the same type.

Your trajectory will bring you within 1 km of the second ship (and several beacons in front of and behind the second ship, maintaining distance with it, so you can teleport to one of them if you miss). You'll teleport onto the second ship and then teleport near its ring at the correct point to be placed on a trajectory back towards your original ship, about 9,000 km back in the direction you came from, which will have its own beacons to help catch you if you miss the ideal timing. You teleport back onto your ship, grab another missile, and then teleport back towards your ship's ring to launch the next missile.

You could conceivably launch a missile like this every minute or so, and the missile could make fine adjustments to correct its course early on, once you're clear of it. These missiles could traverse the minimum distance between Earth and Mars in about five hours.
