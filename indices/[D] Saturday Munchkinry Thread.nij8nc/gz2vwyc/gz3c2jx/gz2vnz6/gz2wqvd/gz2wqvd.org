Break Conservation of Momentum for free? Your interplanetary spaceship just got a new drive.

1. Get a hollow capsule that bounces from end to end on the spaceship, taking at least 3 seconds for each transit (probably more for safety, or 6 seconds for doubled efficiency).

2. Teleport 200 kg into the capsule as it is moving forward. Teleport yourself out.

3. It hits the front and transfers momentum, you teleport the mass out.

4. It hits the back and /doesn't/ transfer momentum (because the 200kg is outside of it)

5. Send the empty capsule forwards, repeat from step 2.
