*The Hundred Lives of the Dolorous King*

You are Isekai'ed as Dolorous Edd into the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Your mind simply replaces his. Your goal? Become the King of the Seven Kingdoms and sit on the Iron Throne. Whatever gods decided your fate decreed that if you fail the task, you will be sent to the Seven Hells to suffer for all eternity.

By the kindness of the Gods, you get 100 lives to enact your plan. Whenever you die, your mind is sent back to the beginning to try again, with the memories of previous attempts. A tattoo indicating the number of lives left appears on your forearm.

Each life, you wake up in Edd's body on the night Waymar Royce dies.
