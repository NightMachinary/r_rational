Well, at the basic level there's the standard way a story with a premise like this would go - you use foreknowledge of canon and/or technological knowledge to get more powerful, eventually leverage that power to become king, and in the course of trial and error you lose all your extra lives by the time you reach the endgame and are about to claim the throne, so the stakes reach their peak in the final battle. Then you win, unless you fucked your karma meter or the author wants to "subvert expectations".

So, to me a specific plan involving just using foreknowledge and tech knowledge to achieve the designated goal doesn't seem all that 'munchkin' - it's basically what a generic protagonist of this kind of story would do. Probably worse, if anything, because that generic protagonist likely has an encyclopaedic knowledge of ASoIaF and some other protagonisty qualities.

Instead, well first there's the obvious angle; since this registers as more like a fanfic premise, I'm probably a protagonist in a work of fiction now. Of course, a fictional character who says "I am the protagonist, so I'm invincible" usually dies immediately. You either try to play along and try to get the benefits of protagonism without incurring that variety of negative karma; or you break the fourth wall and try to negotiate with the author; /or/ you go up a meta-level and specifically think in terms of being in the kind of story where the protagonist notices that they're in a story.

Separate, but related, is the question of what "world of ASoIaF" this is - a 'real' world in which the setting details are true and the events in the plot occur, or a fictional world with narrative causality? If the former, then the butterfly effect is in full effect and further strengthened, as unrealistic things become unstable; chaos, but chaos can be a ladder, just hope that the iron throne continues to exist as an institution. If the latter, then you've got metafiction concerns wherein you're not the protagonist and the author is George R.R Martin - verdict is, probably fucked.

Outside those, well in the spirit of not negotiating with terrorists, find some way to opt out. Maybe seek the intervention of a bigger god, I dunno.
