I assume you can't just write omnipotent benevolent planeswalking fictional characters that can fix everything in the entire omniverse, including your own plane of reality?

Then there are some questions to consider: can stories write themselves? Let's say you write a story halfway and then stop. Does the corresponding fictional reality simply pause in time until you continue? Is every fictional character ever created inevitably become stuck forever in a reality where time has stopped forever because no one is writing the story anymore? Are the characters still sapient and fully experiencing this frozen hell in a "I have no mouth but must scream" manner?

How about plot holes and contradictions and paradoxes? "This anvil weighs 1 gram. This anvil also weighs 100 kg. This anvil falls on top of character A". Now is character A in horrible pain from being crushed by a 100kg anvil, or completely fine from being hit by a 1 gram anvil? Which is it!? Or does character A not feel anything at all unless I write that character A feels something? But if characters only feel what they are written to feel and think what they are written to think, in what way can they be called as aware as the authors? What if I write "Character A is currently more happy than Character A's current happiness?" How would the fictional reality even interpret such a paradox? Would the book you are writing just catch fire to stop you from writing logical paradoxes?

What happens if you write vague statements like "and they lived happily ever after"? Does the fictional reality fill in the blanks somehow with fun activities for the characters to engage in? Or are the characters just magically happy ever after for no reason? Can I just smack a sentence "everyone lived happily ever after" at the end of every story and that fixes everything even though I didn't bother to address plot holes and paradoxes like everyone being dead or genetically incapable of happiness?

Do characters even exist off-screen? Once a character walks off-stage (like away from the narrator's POV), do they just cease to exist until they next appear in the story? Do they even need to go off-stage? What if multiple characters are having a conversation? Do the characters that aren't currently speaking exist? Do they exist but can't do anything other than watch and listen to the one character that is speaking? Can they take any off-screen actions as long as they don't interrupt the current speaker and resume their positions once its their turn to speak?
