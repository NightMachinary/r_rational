/NOTE: I am aware that this is not a classic munchkin scenario, but I still decided to post it here out of curiosity. I hope that the Sneer Club won't downvote me too much./

So, you've been contacted by magical entity which decided to reveal you some secrets about the universe. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that you have already proven beyond doubt that this entity is trustworthy, but you can't prove it to anyone else because entity already left.

The secret that has been revealed is that every fictional universe that is described well (let's say written down or animated or simulated) enough outside human imagination comes to life in some other universe and all its inhabitant are as aware as us. They feel, suffer, experience emotion, etc.

This of course already has great ramifications, because you realize that by creating a novel, or a Harry Potter story, you pop this universe into existence and make all the characters as real as you and they experience all the pleasures or suffering of the plot.

Of course, you are in our real universe and can't contact them.

/(you also realize that if that's the case, then you might be yourself made by someone's else description of munchkinry scenario!)/

So, the question now is.... *Under your current morality and utility function* (feel free to describe it), *what do you do?* Do you ignore this stuff completely, or do you try to stop creation of well, sad stories, and start creation of stories full of happy beings?
