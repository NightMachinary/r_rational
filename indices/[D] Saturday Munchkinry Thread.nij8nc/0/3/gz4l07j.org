  Best (cheapest vs. fastest vs. quality) ways to get the initial two dozen works written, printed, and bound?

How accurate do these metafictional works have to be in order to generate an entrance? Because if all I have to do is copy the titles for 30 Harry Potter potions textbooks and fill them with lorem ipsum I could probably have that done in a day.

If not, depending on the quality required some ghostwriters could be hired. Actually, maybe this might be a good application for text generation via GPT-3.

There's a way to cheese this, if metafiction about new fiction *published by yourself* counts. First, compose and publish an ebook on amazon, a simple 3-page short story about a bookshelf filled with books, explicitly referencing a huge number of made up, extremely thin, single-paged books, with each "book" containing a single word inside.

Then, make said books by just printing single words on regular paper. 30 sheets ought to do it, you can make your entrance with these "books"

Random thought: By actually creating a referenced book, does it go from metafictional to fictional? Does that mean each titled book can only be used for entrance creation /once/? That makes it difficult to use works from popular fiction since metafiction from those will likely have stopped being metafiction if other entrance users exist.
