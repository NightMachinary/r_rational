Actually even with that limitation the library is still really useful for other purposes. I haven't read the source material so I don't know how complex the entrance ritual is, but if you can get the library to recognize a stack of post-it notes with single words as a bundle of books, you've just got yourself an /instant extradimensional space/ that you can pop in and out of at will.

Portable camping tent, hiding spot, temporary storage, whatever you wish. Maybe fast travel too, I don't know.

You don't even have to /use/ the functions in the library, but hey, easy nuclear waste disposal, anyone?
