Similar idea, but a magical mass driver. Current-day centrifuges can spin with edge speeds exceeding 3 km/s. Wear a resilient suit, teleport next to the centrifuge, and get yourself and the projectile flung away at supersonic speeds. Teleport back in a few steps because you're >9 km away by the time you can react.
