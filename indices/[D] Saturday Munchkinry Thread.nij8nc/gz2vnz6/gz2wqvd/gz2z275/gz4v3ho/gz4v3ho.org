Can you use a regular rifle to +accelerate yourself+ /change your velocity/ at ~10g in space?

1. Fire a bullet at 300 m/s relative to yourself

2. Teleport next to it and match its velocity, since in space it /is/ your surroundings.

3. Fire a bullet at 300 m/s relative to yourself (600 m/s relative to step 1)

4. repeat.

With a more advanced launcher you could do even better than 300 m/s every 3 seconds, as long as you have the reaction time to jump after firing instead of needing the entire time to recover/target after shooting.

You could make an Earth-Mars transit in under an hour when they are at their closest using that method, assuming you don't have to slow down at the end.
