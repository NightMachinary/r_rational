Three options:

- *FTL:* Per [[/u/Valeide]] the setting has ships with FTL. You could have a ship with FTL intercept your course and deploy additional beacons ahead of you to give you further chances for recovery. This could also be repeated if you miss again. This is the easy solution, but if it's not an option for some reason:

- *Life support interceptor:* You could have a life support vehicle with chemical rockets and additional deployable beacons positioned about 30 minutes ahead of where you would be on the expected trajectory. With a 500 m ring, if your teleportation error is within +/- 0.5 m, your trajectory would end up being within +/- 0.23° of the goal, or +/- 6,700 km after 30 minutes. Of course, you could also move yourself about 36,000 km over this same timespan, so, conceivably you could just keep lining up with your target as needed. However, if that's not possible, the life support interceptor would only need about 3.7 km/s of ∆v to put itself on a course to intercept you. If it can complete its burn in about a minute, it could then give its beacons about 30 minutes to spread out and then match velocity with it as they intercept your course.

- *Self-rescue:* If you're being fired towards Mars (or some other planet), you could adjust your course to maintain a skimming-intercept. Basically, line up so you approach the edge of the atmosphere, such that you'd skim through the upper atmosphere if you did nothing. As you're passing through, teleport deeper into the atmosphere to nullify your speed and allow you to get to safety. Best case, you'll be a saboteur behind enemy lines, worst case, you'll become a POW. Of course, if you miss the timing on this as well, FTL is going to be the only possible way to save you.
