*Power:* You can teleport up to 1km while carrying up to 200kg of matter (not including yourself). If you completely focus you can use it ~20 times per minute.

You can only teleport places you've been before and remember or places you can see with unaided vision.

Velocity equalizes with your surroundings at your destination.

In order to bring something along, you need to be directly touching it, or be teleporting along with something that you are touching and is touching it, etc- there needs to be an unbroken chain of physical contact. You can teleport other people, but only if they consent. They notably don't get to withdraw consent whenever you choose the destination, so if you trick someone into accepting you can e.g. teleport them 1km directly upwards and kill them.

*Setting:* Generic science fiction in which teleportation is known, but rare. Being able to teleport this frequently, these distances, with this much mass, and for free, is extremely rare- this particular power is roughly one in ten million.

*Objective:* Whatever you want. I'm mostly interested in fun gimmick ideas.
