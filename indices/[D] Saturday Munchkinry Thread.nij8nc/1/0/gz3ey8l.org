Alicorn already learned about this, and this is the purpose for which Effulgence, and Glowfic in general, exists.

How do multiple versions of the story interact? How unique do the stories need to be? How much of an audience do they need? If I write down 20 fanfics of Harry Potter where meanwhile in America a middle age muggleborn has finished their just-fix-everything-forever spell are there now 20 Harry Potter universes living in post Scarcity bliss? What about continuations or sequels (both fanon and canon and AU spin-off)?

An obvious trick seems to be: take a upgraded version of GPT-3, tie it into a script with a bunch of crossover characters good at fixing universes (lets say... Zelretch, HJPEV, Shinji and the Warhammer 40k Shinji, various Bels and Maitmos from Alicorn and Lintamande's glowfics, Amaryliss from WtC, Buddha, liberal progressive Jesus, memetic Batman, a millennia old brain upload of datapacrat from Orion's Arm, and the Doctor at a relatively moral point in their character arc, just to name a few), and then churn out fanfics that end right as this team is introduced to a new universe to fix.

Then I'll take a stab and trying to fix this universe, and all stories generated within, by summoning the team from the Ultimate Finale of the Final Meta Mega Crossover. I know you said that they can't affect the real world, but I think just presenting the problem to them in a story and describing my current world would be enough... actually, I can statistically guarantee that I am in a fictional world by slamming stories about myself...
