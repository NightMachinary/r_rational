Depending on what counts as described well, this causes a lot of problems with characters and stories that are written inconsistently or extremely vague. Does the magic just fill in the blanks and correct inconsistencies?

If so, I write down the following story:

#+begin_quote
  "3 ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ 3 copies of every character ever written and every character that will ever be written live happily ever after"
#+end_quote

If that works I've just reduced all of the suffering caused by this weird magic system to an insignificant fraction of an insignificant fraction of an insignificant fraction of the total experiences of all fictional characters.

  I hope that the Sneer Club won't downvote me too much.

Just FYI, sentences like this make me immediately downvote your comment, then read the comment and /maybe/ remove the downvote if I really liked it.

If you care so much about not being downvoted that you have to include a disclaimer in your comment, either don't post it or use a dummy account.
