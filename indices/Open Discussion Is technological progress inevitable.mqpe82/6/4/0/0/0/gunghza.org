I think the Powder Mage trilogy is good non-trash. Granted, the power of guns in that setting is somewhat hampered by supernatural speed/strength/durability which mostly benefits swords, but I think the balance is otherwise pretty sound. Supernatural sword > guns > magics > supernatural swords. ...Ish. The sequel trilogy is nice too; it's a rare example of an established couple actually fighting together in a fantasy novel without any of the "will they or won't they" sexual tension.
