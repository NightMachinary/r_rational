1. Medieval Stasis: Sword fights are fun. Guns win against Swords. Gun fights aren't as fun as Sword fights. Magic sword fight is a lot funnier than magic gun fight too. That's all the reason you need. Rationally, there's no reason to be stuck specifically in the medieval-ish (tech wise) setting.
2. Regression to the past is basically impossible. Humans are a diverse bunch, with different triebs. One tribe invents sticks, kills other tribes. All tribes descend from stick tribe. All tribes have sticks. One tribe invents swords... and so on. Mostly, technology progressed as a mean to reach one end. Kill other tribes (instead of tribes, read "nations" or "religions" or "other social group which is not YOUR group"). Technological advance does happen also for other reasons, obviously, like when you get better medicines, better autos and so on. But that too, is a competition, who gets the better auto will keep earning money, the rest may go bankrupt (grossly exaggerated here). Either all humans die, or technology progresses. Or you kill all the scientists, technicians and so on, and also destroy their researches, and all books related to that. That's some carefully planned catastrophe that has no chance to ever happen. If technology progress is stopped you don't have to worry about it anymore, because chances are you're dead. With the rest of humanity.
3. Yeah that's unreasonable. Isekai single-handedly bringing about an industrial revolution? Even though he's basically from the future? Not gonna happen. I know I wouldn't be able to do it, and I know my way around some stuff...
4. Technology Singularity has a chance to happen. Many chances actually. Superintelligent AI, Selfreplicating nanorobots, brain-enhancement drugs/operations/technoshitwizardy, and who knows what else? Chances, that is. The probability of each being maybe a little low, but in many years, who knows if we won't reach one of them.\\
   Already getting people to have a life expectancy of 80+ years instead of the 40ish f 17th century should be considered a start to technological singularity imho. People can learn for 30 fucking years how to be smart and get to contribute to society, and then get something going for 50 years, instead of learning things in 15 years and having only another 15 years to put it into practice! Again, extremely oversimplified, so much that it's almost not true, although it is, but it's not :P. Got you confused? Chances are you have 50 years to figure out what did I mean, instead of 15.
5. This one depends on the rules set by the writer of the story.

- Rowling's Harry Potter simply stated that technology didn't work near magic because of some unspecified "interference", which I read as a Deus-Ex Machina in rule form, if that makes sense. (so either tech or magic, you can't have both)
- Worth the Candle (spoilers) stated that the god of the world (Dungeon Master) probably halted technological advance of the world because of not yet spoken reasons. Given this is a rational rpglit, there's going to be a reason. But it was not an inherent "technology won't go on after a while" thing, but more like a "technology would have progressed normallly, weren't for the interference of Dungeon Master"
- Mother of Learning integrated technology and magic together, and they seemed to be progressing hand in hand at times, while sometimes one or the other got a good discovery in the field that helped itself or the other. They got better magics than their ancestors, and better technology. No Golden Age. There's a bunch of divine artifacts which can not be reproduced by humans, but they're called divine for a reason. One hint: they're not made by humans. THIS is actually what I think a universe would look like if magic in one form or another existed.
- The series Final Fantasy heavily features a "Magitech" theme to it. Not exactly paragons of rationality, those games, but that they got right. If magic was in the world, people wouldn't consider it something separate from the rest of the Laws of Physics. They would incorporate it in everything. There's a floating crystal? Well, heck, let's make a ship out of it and put it in the sky! Fire stones? Get them to heat things. Steam engine? Mh... those fire stones could be useful for that, right? That's the mindset people would have. If magic existed, it wouldn't be magic anymore, it would be simply another set of rules in the universe, coherent with the rest. Just like we don't consider electromagnetism "magic", or gravity. Magic is simply something that doesn't already exist in the universe. As soon as it comes into being, it stops being magic.

In short, Magic and Tech don't cohesist in literature only when the writer already has his/her hands full with the plot and the rules of magic already and can't add another thing to juggle with (tech). Unless they add something to the rules to explain that, though, it's really just not explainable. In that regard, the Rowling did the right thing. Say at the beginning of the story (well, relatively at the beginning, it was in the fourth year that we found out... that's more or less half the story done... o.o) that magic and tech can't marry because they can't. Otherwise... plot hole, or at least "world building hole"
