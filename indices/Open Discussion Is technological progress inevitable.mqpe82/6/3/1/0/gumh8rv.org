I don't think there are any sources which suggest that China ever lost the knowledge of crop rotation. I /think/ their discovery of it was independent of Europe. (Also, I'm losing confidence in the claim about Europe.)

If the cross-oceanic containerized trade network was severely disrupted, say because Leviathan existed, we would lose the ability to produce /a lot/ of things, because our supply chains are brittle and because we couldn't get the necessary rare earths for most of our computing and other technical equipment, so replacing them would be very difficult. That would be *much* harder to endure and recover from than a mild catastrophe like the destruction of the Internet, and would probably result in a global Dark Age. A similar event once happened: the Bronze Age Collapse, where shipping around the eastern Mediterranean sea and the Black sea was disrupted, leading to the destruction of all civilizations active in the region. Advances could be made eventually, if the raw materials were available to start fresh and re-climb the tech tree, but it would be centuries at least. If fuel was too scarce to power a new Industrial Revolution, possibly millennia.
