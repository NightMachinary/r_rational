  Regression to the past is basically impossible. Humans are a diverse bunch, with different triebs. One tribe invents sticks, kills other tribes. All tribes descend from stick tribe.

Actual history contradicts this. After the Roman Empire fell, almost the entirety of Europe /did/ lose technological knowledge. They couldn't support the prerequisites for the advances which were SOP for the Roman Empire, and over the course of generations of /still/ being unable to support it, they stopped maintaining the knowledge required to rebuild it. (Rationally so, because after a couple generations it was entirely obvious there wouldn't be a replacement any time soon.) The roman roads are the most tangible example, but crop rotation was a much more impactful one; crop rotation disappeared from Europe until it was independently reinvented centuries later. (The reinvention also was the /three/-field system, instead of the /two/-field system Rome used. A superior variant, to be sure, but it was de novo, not an incremental improvement.)

There has never been a /global/ Dark Age (at least, not yet), but most stories don't cover the whole globe, so that doesn't matter.
