I vaguely remember reading 4th hand parables of China having learnt about glass, but it not having caught interest as much as in the west. Supposedly, this was because wine (in Europe) is best appreciated in a glass, whereas tea (in china) is best kept warm in ceramic pottery. This developed infrastructure for glassblowing was then instrumental in a lot of enlightenment age progress.

Just because the stuff is created doesn't imply that it will grow. Take Rome/Greece for example, they were incredibly developed, but that development was largely lost until 2 millenia later.
