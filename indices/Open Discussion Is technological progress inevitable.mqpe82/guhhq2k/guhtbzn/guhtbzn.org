War is also a factor for rapid progression into technology because it provides more avenues for applications of using stuff. The stuff invested into it can be later diversified into other research areas which repeats itself into more.

The inevitability here is actually guaranteed because there will always be problems and solutions and better solutions to those solutions.

The only conditions where I can see tech progression stopping or slowing down to a level where it doesn't seem to progress at all is when everyone has all they need, no one has greed or suffering or ambition or a sense of adventure or a willingness to want more than they have or in need of some protection against anything or wanting to impress someone or they lose intelligence and become more instinct oriented beings which in case they'll start to evolve biologically. Too many things needed to be constrained to stop it completely from progressing.

But it's still possible to take a backward enough setting which has a limited resource pool to stretch that to a ridiculous slow tech progression.

So it's inevitable yet inevitability itself is relative is what I believe.
