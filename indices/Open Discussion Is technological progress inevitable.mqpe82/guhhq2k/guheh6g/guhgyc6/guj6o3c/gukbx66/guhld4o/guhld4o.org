My understanding was that Native Americans had no land animals to pull wheeled vehicles so their use was limited. It wasn't that they were incapable of figuring it out or something like that. I don't know about the Greek steam engine. As for Rome my understanding was that when it fell the Eastern Roman Empire should have still had most if not all technologies. It outlasted the Roman Empire proper for 1000 years, and by the time it failed I don't think it particularly had any technologies over its neighbors to be lost.
