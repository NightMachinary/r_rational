Someone already commented on it, so I'll bring one small addition. The full story is, we don't know exactly how far American Indian technology got in some areas. They didn't work in metal due to an abundance of other useful materials never creating the drive to create the far more energy intensive process. (Basic rule of thumb, a society will ways use the most energy conservative path to produce the goods it needs to maintain the current momentum. Metal working takes far, far more energy and resources to develop than obsidum or flint, which means it's a net loss for your economy for a pretty decent junk of time. The steam engine you mentioned is another grand example of the same thing. The Romans never bothered to develop it because why would they? You can buy a whole cohort of slaves who don't need any special resources or caretakers to do a hundred times the labor for the same cost. Another example, we still use coal power even though Oil, Solar, and Nuclear are far more potent. The economics of cost will ALWAYS determine the path development ultimately takes).

Well, I got off track. Anyways, American Indians didn't leave behind great records of where they were and what they were doing, so it's kind of a mystery. Almost every scrap of civilization that wasn't named Aztec or Inca was decimated by the American Plagues centuries before any Westerner saw them to write them down, and the written records the contacted cultures were destroyed. We know they had advanced trade networks, highly developed math for the Era, HIGHLY developed beaucracies that we're only recently starting to match, land development techniques that in many ways exceed the ones we have now, and finally, they made bulletproof shirts. They're not a very good example of restricted technology because most of the records made of them weren't from a point of natural development.

The American Plagues were horrific. Quite possibly the largest loss of life in human history. It's not extreme at all to suggest that between 1500 to 1600 90%! Of the human populations of the American continents died. (Most recordings dating from that Era and from later contacts with groups not immune to modern diseases show a death rate of 95-98%.) Compare that to the Black Plaugue, which possibly got about 35% of Europe. When the Europeans were contacting the native populations, they were basically interacting with the survivors of century long apocalyptic comditions.
