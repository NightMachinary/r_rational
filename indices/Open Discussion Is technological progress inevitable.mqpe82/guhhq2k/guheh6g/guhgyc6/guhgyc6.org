There's a minimum population needed to maintain any given technology, let alone develop it. Isolated families or groups abandon technologies simply because they don't have the critical mass required to maintain them. Sort of like how the Swiss Family Robinson simply don't have enough people to even maintain (let alone build) all that stuff they build in the book.
