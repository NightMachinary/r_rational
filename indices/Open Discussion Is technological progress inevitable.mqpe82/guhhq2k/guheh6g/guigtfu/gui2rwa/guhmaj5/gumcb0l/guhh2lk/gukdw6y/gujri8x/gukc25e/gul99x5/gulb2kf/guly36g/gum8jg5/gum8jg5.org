So to poke holes in what I've said, I took a lot of liberties and conveniently omitted certain factors. In source #2, it discusses a "Q factor" which they find is constant per scientist. Or, the value of an individual doesn't increase over time (which kind of does reinforce that scientists don't improve the value of their research over time).

However, survivorship is a thing. Older researchers are those with a proven track record, those with a high Q factor. When you replace an older researcher with a younger one, you're rolling the dice on the young one's Q factor (and to play devil's advocate to my devil's advocate, you can find a relatively younger researcher with a high(er) Q factor and replace the older one anyhow).

Another factor is that the type of research done by older vs. younger is not clarified. The value they're measuring is citation, or basically how popular what you did is. But who's to say that the type of research a young scientist does is *the same* as what an older researcher does? Each may produce different types of work. If anything, the rule of diversity is probably good to observe if we don't know definitively.

Lastly are the abstract effects of older researchers. Older researchers are heroes who inspire the younger generation. How many younger scientists are inspired by Albert Einstein? Most of Einstein's greatest discoveries were from before he was 30. How many pictures of Einstein do you know of where he's below 50?
