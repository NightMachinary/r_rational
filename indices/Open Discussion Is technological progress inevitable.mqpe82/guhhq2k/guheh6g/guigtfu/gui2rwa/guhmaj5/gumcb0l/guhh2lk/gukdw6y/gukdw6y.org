  There's a bunch of divine artifacts which can not be reproduced by humans, but they're called divine for a reason. One hint: they're not made by humans.

Tangential, but I love how people in MoL think that divine artifacts are always extremely durable and last forever, but in reality that's just a survivorship bias where the only divine artifacts that lasted this long are the ones made to be extremely durable and long-lasting. It took the trope of 'divine artifacts are impossible to destroy' and managed to both subvert it and play it straight at the same time, in a way that looks completely natural in restrospect.

  If magic existed, it wouldn't be magic anymore, it would be simply another set of rules in the universe, coherent with the rest. Just like we don't consider electromagnetism "magic", or gravity.

Another tangent, but electricity is pretty much genuine irl magic. It's a fundamental part of our world coursing through nature up to and including violent natural phenomenon. It behaves in mysterious ways that, when properly harnessed, can do wondrous things like create light and sound, cause things to move, or allow telepathic communication. And if you look close enough you find it within every person, an inextricable part of life without which you're nothing but an empty husk. The only thing it's missing is that you can't harness it without tools, but other magic systems do that too.

The evidence that magic would be seen as a mundane technology if it existed is all around us; we already found bonafide magic and integrated it so thoroughly into our conception of science that it became /archetypical/ of science.
