There's been an explosion in technological progress in recent history (for a given value of recent), and there's an unspoken assumption that this state of affairs will continue indefinitely unless we ruin it somehow.

Sometimes though, I wonder if at some point we'll just... run out of big new things, and innovation will be limited to iterating on ideas we've already achieved.

A fairly basic and believable example of this: it's entirely possible that we never find a way to travel to planets outside our solar system. FTL is impossible, cryogenics doesn't pan out, and generation ships are just fundamentally non-viable.

We're certainly not there yet! But sometimes I wonder how much more distance there is to travel before we just... run out.
