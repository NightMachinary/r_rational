Don't knock polymaths either, you can bring in stuff like lambda calculus, turing machines, group theory, matrix algebra, calculus, non-euclidean math, set theory, and so on. hundreds to thousands of years of stumbling around math considerably shortened.

And if you're smart you know a few key technologies. Clear glass is just quartz soda and lime and it unlocks spectra, which unlocks atoms and the start of quantum mechanics. Glass also unlocks vacuum tubes, as you can make a mercury pump. Start your empire quickly through the use of moveable frame hives and packed column stills, which are both startlingly recent improvements on the production of some of history's favorite vices. Electricity's easy enough to get started in, with a static generator or a battery pile (which is two metals and a brine at it's simplest), and so on for crop breeding (mendel is the 1800's) and fertilizer and a hundred other things. Sure, getting the supply chains bootstrapped would be a pain in the ass, but there's nothing actually stopping you.
