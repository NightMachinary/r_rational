True. Still, I think my point is still kinda valid. Just as how our life expectancy is 85ish, but there's still people that get to their 95 or 100 years. Also, already from 60 to 85, that's a lot of time, more or less 40% time. Notre time to learn, more time to get things done after you've learned. And not having to waste resources on a child that is probably going to die anyway is a win in my book (technology wise). I don't think, however, that we'll reach the point of making people grow older and older, we picked the low hanging fruits, and now we're left with hoping for some kind of miracle nanotech or something...
