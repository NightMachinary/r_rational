Worth the Candle has explored the magic/technology dynamic pretty deeply. At this point its pretty clear that they actually /can/ progress further but governments are deliberately holding a lot of progress back. (See, Uniquities explaining the dangers of inventing TV)\\
That is an interesting dynamic wherein technological progress is seen as akin to deploying nuclear weapons. Everyone can, but chooses not too because of how calamitous the results would likely be. Even if it is in an individual nation's immediate interests to do so, they understand that it would eventually bite them and all of humanity in the backside.
