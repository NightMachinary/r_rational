I feel like there's an inflection point where rapid technological progress becomes possible because the right tools have been invented. The steam engine, microscopes, printing presses, those kinds of things. Reaching this point is driven by different factors, like

- Population growth necessitating agriculture refinement.
- Economic competition leading to advancements in manufacturing, or inventing new/better products.
- Trade and travel over longer distances needing better methods of travelling and shipping.
- Conflict/war driving the development of weapons.

Of course, there are factors that hamper technological development as well.

- If a people live in a climate that leads to a nomadic lifestyle, or a harsh climate, their energy and resources are spent more towards survival than R&D.
- War could also lead to shifting resources away from scientific development.
- An upper class trying and halt the rise of those under them (who would threaten their power).
- Political persecution of of the "intellectual class" like we saw in China/Cambodia.

And then there's when technology is lost, which is even rarer IMO, and depends on the destruction of a civilization, either from war, disease and/or a natural disaster.

Basically whether technology develops, stagnates or even regresses it depends on which factors align.
