Life expectancy was indeed 40ish in the 17th century. But this doesn't mean people magically started dying when they were in their 40s. People still lived to their 60s and 80s.

Life expectancy was low back then because of high infant and child mortality. Large percentages of children just didn't make it to adulthood.
