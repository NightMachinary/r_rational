I think there are reasonable possibilities of techno-regression scenarios. Arguably, this is the case in any post-polymath civilization like today's society. There is not a single person on Earth who could build a computer alone from scratch and unaided by modern technology. If there were suddenly a large-scale catastrophe like an enormous solar flare or cosmic phenomena that instantly destroyed the vast majority of electronics on Earth, production lines would instantly shatter and the world would be thrown back centuries as people struggled to adapt. Modern tools and things that are only produce-able with factories (notably things with replaceable parts) would become artifacts that can't be repaired, only patched, and are extremely valuable. Still, this world would by cyclic. Eventually, technological progress would kick off again, probably faster than last time because there are artifacts lying about to reverse engineer and learn from.

As for the Medieval Stasis, I think it's achievable without too much "contrived backstory reason" if you include beings that are immensely powerful without technology such as gods or very powerful beasts. A divine pantheon for example, who maintain their control by projecting force, would be against technology because they're wise enough to know that if left alone, the puny humans could eventually ramp up to an industrial base that shoots nuclear warheads out of a rapid-fire canon at the pillars of their pantheon--something they don't want. Similarly, it's easy to underestimate how much globalization and large-scale work an industrialized society needs. If we had large Kaiju running about or areas of the world that are extraordinarily hostile to life, it's possible that the agricultural base that enables members of a society to specialize could never form due to constant human attrition.
