You missed the most important: the process (or relatively short-term results) of working on technological development or research can give tangible benefits to things humans care about (like wealth, power, status, social acceptance, or whatever) within the lifetime of said human (and typically on much shorter timespans).

As soon as that slows down, technological progress is going to slow way down. If it's human-driven at all by then.
