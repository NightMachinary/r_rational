The Greek steam engine, or aeolipile, was useless for catapulting the ancient world into an early steam age, because you can't build a steam engine large enough for practical work out of just /anything/, and the metallurgical science required to build a steam engine that could e.g. propel a human-sized vehicle without blowing up was still more than a thousand years away.
