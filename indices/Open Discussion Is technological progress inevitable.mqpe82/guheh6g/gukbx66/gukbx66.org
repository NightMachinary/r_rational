I feel like the Sentinelese may just be a few thousand years behind the curve because they didn't hook into the global tech-sharing network, rather than because they're immune to the idea of doing things better. Sure, there's not much difference in the day to day between stone age single-tribe progress rates and 0 progress, but I wager if the rest of the world died off except for the Sentinelese we'd /eventually/ see the descendants of the Sentinelese reinvent all the stuff we have.

As for your examples for useful applications, I caution that you keep an eye out for hidden challenges that may not be evident in the design. You mention coal scarcity, but the Romans may also have faced problems with the material strength of their metals, or bulk production of the necessary metals. You can make a 'steam engine' with the weaker materials you have at the time only to find that they simply aren't up to the task for any meaningful innovation, and so it remains only an idle curiosity.
