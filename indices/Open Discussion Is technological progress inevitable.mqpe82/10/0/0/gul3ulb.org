I'm not disregarding the more theoretical advancements, it's just that people are extremely recalcitrant to let go of their current ideas and theories. I mean, most of the mathematics or science foundationals that we take for granted today took decades to become widely accepted among /academia/. It's not like Galileo dropped two balls off the Pisa tower and everyone suddenly agreed that Aristotle's old theory (heavy objects fall faster) was bunk, no it took decades if not centuries and people still believed in wild stuff (eg spontaneous generation) not too long ago despite plenty of counterfactual evidence.
