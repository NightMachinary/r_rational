You can get stable equilibria where there's no incentive or ability for people to even adopt known-better current technologies (see Bret Devereaux's posts about farming and tech equilibria in the middle ages), so I don't see why you can't get stable equilibria on the invention of new technology. You just need a setup where higher individual or group productivity doesn't result in any benefit to you or anyone you care about, and where you don't have any leisure time or energy; basically, a subsistence farming community which doesn't own its own equity.
