There are three things that, when combined, make technological progress inevitable:

- Proper application of the scientific method
- Reliable, accessible records
- Pressure

As long as you have the first two, you're not going to regress, and pressure will make you go forward.

If a group came to power which compromised one or both of those first two aspects of our society, then absolutely, we could backslide. Modern humans have been around for, what, a hundred thousand years at least? Agriculture has been around for about a tenth of that, and scientific progress didn't really start in earnest until then. If "grow food more efficiently, to free up people to do other things than hunt and gather food" didn't occur to people for tens or hundreds of thousands of years, it doesn't seem obvious to me that technological progress is some biological imperative rather than a cultural value.
