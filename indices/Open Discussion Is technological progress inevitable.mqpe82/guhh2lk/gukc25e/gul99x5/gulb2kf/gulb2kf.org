So, there's two things:

1. [[http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/age-amp-science-do-scientists-make-their-best-discoveries-during][Scientists produce their biggest discoveries and high-impact work early in their careers]]
2. [[https://www.nature.com/news/scientists-can-publish-their-best-work-at-any-age-1.20926][Scientists can produce their best work at any age]]

They don't contradict because the younger you are, the more work you produce. Or, the older you get, the less work you produce. However, the key point is that every piece of work you produce has an equal chance of being your magnus opus. Because this means that a scientist's work doesn't improve over time, or accumulated knowledge does not equate to better outcomes.

If anything we are "wasting resources" on older researchers who hold onto their positions necessarily blocking younger researchers who are able to produce the same quality of work at a faster rate. We're extending the lives of older professors and researchers who fill finite research positions in universities and labs. Increasing age is impeding progress.
