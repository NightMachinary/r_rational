i read somewhere about a theory of why technology is not advanced in magical worlds , and it went something along the line of this: technology doesn't advance much because why create (for example) fuel or chainsaws or something when you have strong men who can literally pull trees off the ground? why make advanced engineering things when you can just reinforce the materials with runes?

I don't remember the entirety of it, but basically there's some key innovations that we needed to make everything else and they probably won't get made in fantasy worlds when there's substitutes
