On the contrary, I strongly suspect that limitations on resources actually hinder technological progress instead of help.

First, less resources means less total population, since there is less food available. Fewer people naturally means fewer ideas. Not to mention shorter expected lifespans due to starvation/war.

Then there's the competition. Which pays off better? Training strength or doing science? Any time/money/effort you invest in technological research is time/money/effort not invested in making your armies stronger. That means you become weaker than your neighbours who ARE investing in becoming better at warfare, and will lose to them in the various competitions for resources and die off.

Indeed someone will always want more, and the others will need to keep up *militarily* or be eliminated. Not technologically. (Technological progress does boost military, but those boosts are neither obvious nor guaranteed. Science is about testing things, and many of those tests will just eat resources without giving any results. To focus on science in such a situation is to literally gamble with the lives of your countrymen.)

Edit: Could you explain why you disagree instead of just downvoting?
