Many scientists argue that we are in such a slump now. There are several exciting paradigm changing technologies on the horizon, but the price (in money, but also effort and resources) is tremendous.

An easy example: look at Elon Musk. He tries to push for paradigm changing technologies and adventures, but so far, his ideas are yet to bring real profit, and encounter unsurmountable hurdles. If these things were easily acheivable, we would have 100000 Musks all over the globe competing for it.
