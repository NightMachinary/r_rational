One way to stymie technological progress is to put your story on a planet which lacks the resources. We're pretty sure that humanity could not repeat the industrial revolution from scratch now because all the surface coal and oil has been burned. So unless there was some other massive energy source which could be exploited at low tech levels, you could halt tech progress in your story by just decreeing that cellulose-digesting bacteria evolved hundreds of thousands of years after cellulose-rich life did, rather than hundreds of millions of years after as it did on Earth.
