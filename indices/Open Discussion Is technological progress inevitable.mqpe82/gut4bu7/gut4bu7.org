I don't think it's inevitable, or atleast can be arbitrarily slow depending on culture and circumstance. To my limited knowledge these cultural ideas of seeking knowledge at every opportunity with the assumption a use will be found at some point is unusual in history. I remember that isolation tends to result in stagnation and experimentation requires time, resources and stability to spare. On the other hand I think invention may beget invention, the more knowledge available the more one can see the reputation to be gained in adding to it.
