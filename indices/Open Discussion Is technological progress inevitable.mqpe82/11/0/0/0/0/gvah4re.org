I think you're significantly underestimating how influential technology is on warfare. It's not just weapons either, it's better manufacturing, better agriculture, better logistics, etc.

The only reason it isn't always the major determining factor is because historically wars have mostly been fought between neighboring countries, and its fairly rare for there to be a huge tech gap between them. Most wars have both sides at a pretty similar level of technology. Whenever there HAVE been wars with a major gap in technology, the side with the tech advantage wins. The colonial era is a great example.

If a nation simply refused to allow technological advancement, they'd be screwed when war eventually broke out with significantly more advanced neighbors. Technological advancement doesn't necessarily require government investment in it at lower tech levels though, it's quite possible to remain at approximately technology parity without any investment until you start getting to the industrial age.
