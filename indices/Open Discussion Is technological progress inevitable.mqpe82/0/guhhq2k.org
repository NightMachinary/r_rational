Inevitable? No.

Inevitable given certain social conditions, like sufficient food and shelter and safety that people have time to mess about with things; sufficiently large population; sufficient communication that people can talk about the neat things that they found while messing about; sufficient education that people can understand and replicate good results (however they decide to define 'good'); and sufficient resources to spread around newly-discovered Neat Stuff? That's /probably/ yes. (There may be more conditions that I'm missing out on)
