Of course technological progress isn't inevitable. We have plenty of examples even in our current reality of how technological progress can be halted.

For example, in point 5 you bring up fictions with magical laws that interfere with technology, but there isn't even any need for magic. Just look at dolphins. They are really smart, arguably even sapient creatures. But they live underwater, and water is an extremely hostile environment for the most basic of technology: fire.

Without fire there is no boiling, no melting, no baking, no drying, and no smelting. There is no steam engine. There are no convenient large and stable energy sources to power any technology, because even though there are places that the dolphins could get oil and coal from, they can't actually burn the oil or coal underwater. The simple fact that the dolphins live underwater has pretty much completely halted technological progress for them, no magic required.

If humans had evolved to live underwater (which I imagine could happen if the sea levels\\
of the planet slowly rises until all the land creatures either re-evolve their underwater living organs or go extinct), we too would not have been able to progress technology. We would still have sticks and blades and tribal medicines and some ranged weapons (though water resistance makes them really suck), and various other basic stuff, but that would be it. The vast majority of all human technology depends on fire, and they would all be locked out to the humans of this underwater alternate reality.
