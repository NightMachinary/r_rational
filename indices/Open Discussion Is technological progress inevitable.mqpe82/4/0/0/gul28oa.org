Octopuses have the brains for it (experiments have shown that they can learn by observing the actions of others) and certainly the hands for it.

Sadly the parents don't hang around (dad leaves, mom starves to death guarding the eggs) so they don't pass on knowledge at all. Otherwise they'd have everything they needed for at least primitive technology.
