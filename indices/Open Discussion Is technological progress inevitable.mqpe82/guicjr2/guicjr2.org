I would argue it is inevitable. The human drive to create new easier, more efficient ways to do things is what brought us to where we are today, for better or worse. Other animals create tools too, but not to the same extent as humans. We're an inherently lazy species, which by nature demands that we progress technologically in some way to make our lives easier.

Whether that advancement is through magic or material tech depends on what is most available and easiest. The powerful can afford tools which are stronger and less available or harder to attain.

The book A Canticle for Liebowitz is a beautiful and haunting example of the inevitability of technology and the cyclical nature of the world. Advancement and regression or self destruction over the course of time.
