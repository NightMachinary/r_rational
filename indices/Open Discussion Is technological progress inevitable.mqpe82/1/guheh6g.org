I'd say no, technological progress is not inevitable. There are examples such as isolated human tribes which still exist today such as the Sentinelese who don't seem to have advanced their tools much. In fact, modern humans have existed for tens or hundreds of thousands of years and didn't start agriculture until the last ten thousand or so.

Sometimes useful applications for ideas aren't even thought of. Native Americans used the wheel in toys but had no wheeled vehicles, the ancient Greeks had a sort of steam engine but the train didn't arrive until thousands of years later although that's also probably due to resource scarcity since they didn't have enough coal to power their engines. I'd like the opinion of a historian, but a lot of knowledge was lost after the fall of Rome as well. One example being their formula for concrete.
