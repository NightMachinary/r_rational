Good thinking on point 5. I know several authors who tried to incorporate magitech in their works (from HPMOR and Significant Digits to Pratchett's Discworld) but the inevitable problem is the more magitech they come up with, the more it upends their setting, and makes previous magitech/magic obsolete. THey would pretty much have to write an entire civilisation from first principles for anythign to make sense, otherwise the stories tend to follow the pattern: "this new piece of magitech is invented, and flips the world upside down".
