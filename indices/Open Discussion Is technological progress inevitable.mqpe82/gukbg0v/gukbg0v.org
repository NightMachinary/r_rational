I would say that technological progress is inevitable. Don't get me wrong, there exist necessary conditions for technological progress, but those conditions inevitably come to exist over a large period of time and a large body of people.

1. I have large problems with this setting. I can accept stasis for hundreds of years or even thousands of years. But tens of thousands? Unless there is a controlling religion (and I don't think any controlling religion would be able to keep such a hold for tens of thousands of years) or divine force that actively impedes progress, technological progress is inevitable.
2. Smaller scale events have occurred in history, such as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse][late bronze age collapse]]. But from our current information age, can we regress? Sure. There's plenty of ways. As long as a large portion of the population is killed off (>99%) then a technological regression occurs. e.g. nuclear war, climate change, global pandemic (like covid but airborne and deadlier). In fiction, I wish that authors dived further into the reason why they're in the broken age. But really, I do accept that such a type of event is possible. Especially in the presence of magic.
3. This is just pure fantasy that everyone's dreamed about. Even an eidetic memory genius isekai into king of ruling country wouldn't be able to bring a nation to industrial revolution within their lifetime. Industries take time to create and the market to consume also takes time.
4. The effects of a singularity is hard to predict because there's no real life analogue to compare to. Authors trying to write it are stuck in the pattern of attempting to write a being that's infinitely more intelligent than the writer themself. I truly think of the technological singularity as a being that's, in comparison, a human whereas actual humans have the intelligence of ants.
5. Magitech is just too much work. Yes, people /should/ and /would/ combine magic and technology. But then the author would need to invent an entire society and incorporate society around said magitechs. No, it's just easier to keep them separate.
