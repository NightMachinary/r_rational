This is actually for a D&D campaign (home-brew obviously) that I am currently playing with some friends of mine.

The general premise: It's 2060, superpowers have been a thing for the last 20 years or so, the global economy is in shambles, and three main alliances (The Americas, Oceania, and Eurasia) are all on the edge of war with no one really wanting to throw the first rock.

My character is one of several thousand superpowered fellows, who was "hired" by the Oceanian government, and I am expected to grow my power while working alongside a few other heroes to protect a large city floating in the middle of the Pacific.

So, my character has the ability to animate golems. Unfortunately, the DM has nerfed me to hell and back, and that's where I need help with the cheese.

Known rules of my power(Liable to change as my character grows in power):\\
1. All golems animated must be at least vaguely humanoid. No animating random machines to do my bidding.\\
2. I can only animate a golem that I have touched with my bare hands. I can activate any golem that I have activated before as long as it is within three miles of my, and I know where it is.\\
3. I can animate golems no smaller than 1 inch in height, and no larger than 3/4 of my height. Should my golems for whatever reason be stretch beyond the height limit or compressed down to less than 1 inch in height, they will cease to function. The width of the golem doesn't seem to be a problem, but I haven't tested that out much.\\
4. My character can either consciously control his golems, or put them on autopilot and have them do simple tasks. The current range limit on my power is ~3 miles. If the distance between a golem and I crosses that limit, the golem will cease to function, autopilot or no. I can see and hear through a golem if I am controlling them.\\
5. He can consciously command two golems while maintaining full control of his own body, but more than that render him immobile. Any more than 4, and he risks going unconscious, at which point all golems cease to function.\\
6. While golems are on autopilot, the mental strain to my character is significantly reduced. I can have up to 30 one-inch golems on autopilot, or 6 max-size golems on autopilot. I can, of course, mix and match those numbers.\\
7. The material my golems are made of do not affect how well I can control them, however, only soft materials like clay allow for free movement. If I want a golem made of metal, I must include joints and such so it can move. Otherwise, a simple metal frame can move about as well as a human(adding ligaments to my golems seems to increase their capabilities).\\
8. I can incorporate biological material into my golems(only tested with insect parts stuck into small clay golems, but it is presumed I can use other animal parts. Animating dead humans is a possibility, but when I mentioned it, the DM got 'the look' in his eyes, so I am convinced that it's a bad idea.)\\
9. When I create a new golem, a random point in its body will be marked as it's "core". The core is pretty much the golem's brain, and is what allows a golem to act independently. If I make two golems that are "the same", their cores will be in the same place. A golem's core will /slowly/ optimize a golem's body (connections will form between the core and a golem's eye's, for instance).\\
10. A golem left on autopilot can be given a set of instructions that allow it to learn. After spending several in-game months on it, I have devised a way to give my golems the ability to learn on their own, the ability to reason, and the ability to "improve their own code" so to speak. Long story short, I've created a self-improving AI and am slowly endowing my golem army with sentience. Tying into point nine, a golem's core will grow larger/stronger as it learns more.\\
11. If a golem's core is removed, it can be placed into a new golem. The new golem will activate, however, the golem's AI will have a hard time adapting to the new body. I have decided that I will not be doing much with this, as my golems have expressed unease at the prospect of their cores being damaged. I feel like now that I've selfishly given my creations free will, it's only right to adhere to their requests.\\
12. Though my golems cease to function if I fall unconscious through mental/physical trauma, they can remain active while I sleep if I specifically tell them to. In the event that I am about to get knocked unconscious, I can overload my golems with power, giving them a few turns to do things even if I am taken out of the fight.

I think that's about everything, so hit me with the munchkinry!

If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer.
