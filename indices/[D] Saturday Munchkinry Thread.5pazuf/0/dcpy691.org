Scenario:

Your body is de-aged to 8 years old, and you are dropped into the middle of a dank, dark alley in Gotham city with nothing but a swiss army knife and a raggy t-shirt and shorts. It is midnight.

Powers:

1: You are immune to any and all powers that would influence or alter any and all aspect of your personality, including your moral compass and priorities. Your memory and skills can still be tampered with, you can be forced into unconsciousness, and your actual body can be puppeteered against your will, but other than that your are immune to all forms of mind control. As a side effect of this power, your core personality traits will never change naturally like those of other people, although your opinions, knowledge, and skills can still change and grow.

2: In addition, you have powerful regeneration, but it only applies to your blood and skin. This means that you could deliberately bleed yourself out as much and as fast as possible, and you'd never even lose blood pressure, let alone bleed out, and that any and all wounds would be gone in 30 seconds maximum. As a side effect of this power, you never have to worry about high blood pressure. You are also immune to any and all bloodborne diseases, toxins, and drugs; anything that "shouldn't" exist in your blood is immediately destroyed.

3: Due to mystical reasons, if 1 ml or more of your blood plasma is inside of another human body at any given time, they will be permanently put under the effects of this power. The following are the effects:

- Their primary personality traits will be overwritten, and replaced with your primary personality traits and moral compass. Secondary personality traits, memories, skills, knowledge, etc. are left untouched. They also gain immunity to any and all effects that would influence or alter any and all aspect of their new personality.

- If you have a line of sight to them, you will be able to instantly identify them as being under the effects of this power.

- If they learn of you and/or your powers, they will not attempt to harm you or hinder you in your endeavors, even if they learn that they are under its effects. (Note that this does not allow you to mind control them or force them to aid you, it simply means they will not hinder you.)

4: Lastly, You have an instinctive understanding of all your powers, and how to use and exploit them for maximum effect.

How do you go about minimizing Gotham's crime rate as fast as possible?
