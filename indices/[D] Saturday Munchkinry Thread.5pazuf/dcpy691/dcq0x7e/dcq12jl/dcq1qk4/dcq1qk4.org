I mean, you have superhuman mental capabilities, it was the natural solution.

That said, the simple solution, as right now time is a bit limited, figure out where Gotham's water supply is, bleed as much into it as possible. The lack of identity is one of the big issues, but assuming anyone who drinks it is motivated to help, or at least won't do anything to impede it then all you need is to try and get blood in. One milliliter isn't much, and spread out it won't even be noticeable.

The crazy villain strategy is dig your way under the road next to a water bottling facility and carefully set yourself up to feed your blood into their water supply at a ratio of about 1ppt. Preferrably use your swanky villain tech to first make the blood as transparent as possible. Then just wait a while, of course the problem with said crazy plan is needing fancy tech, but hey, I'm an intelligent person who is a superhuman in DC, I'd be surprised if my mind hasn't suddenly turned into a supervillain right?
