  How do you go about minimizing Gotham's crime rate as fast as possible?
#+end_quote

I'd use this.

#+begin_quote
  an instinctive understanding of all your powers, and how to use and exploit them for maximum effect.
#+end_quote

I mean, it may not be the answer you want, but if the process of getting the powers I also get an understanding of how to exploit them for maximum effect any plan I make now should be strictly inferior. Given I presumably got no warning to research Gotham before hand in comics, the clear answer is that I can't know in my current state.

I'll simply utilize my new knowledge of how to use my powers to maximum effect to utilize my powers for maximum effect in decreasing the crime rate in Gotham.
