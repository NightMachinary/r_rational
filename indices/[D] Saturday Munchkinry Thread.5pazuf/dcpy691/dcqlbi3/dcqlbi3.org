It sounds like if a person so much as grabs me by the arm, they would trigger the power -- my blood plasma is "inside" their hand, which is a part of their body. Of course, avoiding close contact would be preferable for safety's sake, but as a small orphan in a dark alley in the middle of the night I might not have a choice. If it works, putting a sample inside of a small object that criminals are likely to handle might be a good option.

It may also be possible to make a mist of the stuff. Put it in a fog maker and spread it in the dark alleys where criminals frequent. This would actually get it in their bloodstream. You'd need a plasmapheresis machine to get the red blood cells out, otherwise people would likely steer clear of the red mist. (The red blood cells could be safe to sell as a medical supply once you have removed the plasma.) This might be infeasible due to smell though.

A good question is whether the plasma can be concentrated by evaporating its water content, and whether the addition of water actually increases its volume. If the latter applies without limits, adding even a small amount to the water supply could result in instant conversion of everyone who drinks it.

The issue with water supply is that it is untargeted. That means millions of innocent people suddenly losing part of their identity once they have enough of a dose to trigger the power. So most heroes in this situation would be very hesitant to take that route. I'm not sure it's reasonable to expect to put 1ml in someone's body at a given time without affecting the taste of the water anyway though (unless the water takes on the property of being your plasma through dilution).

Never having to worry about high blood pressure is a nice bonus; perhaps you could use in conjunction with a natural stimulant like adrenaline (since you're immune to hard drugs) to accelerate your reflexes. The power doesn't protect against muscle sprains, broken bones, and so on, so this is limited in usefulness, but as an 8 year old you would tend to recover from sprains and so on more easily anyway, so it could be useful to help you adhere to a physical training regimen.

Being immune to shock, blood loss, infection, toxicity, and so on would make it more attractive to attempt cybernetic experiments on yourself using local anesthetics or by hiring a trustworthy doctor to do the surgery on you. Since they can't harm or hinder you, any competent medical professional under the power's influence should be okay for this purpose.

Having the ability to violate conservation of mass where your blood is concerned is /possibly/ worth trying to munchkin, but I'm not sure how to do so in service of the goal of reducing crime in Gotham. It could be useful as a propellant source for space travel (especially if the blood that is replaced comes pre-oxygenated, as you wouldn't need to breathe as long as you are bleeding enough).

Being able to get rid of toxic wastes by injecting them into your body is also an interesting aspect of the power (might be useful at a nuclear power plant), but hard to do at enough scale to be worth it -- imagine trying to inject a whole barrel of sludge into a person's veins. If you could somehow expand the size of what is considered to be your circulatory system, it might be useful though. If you could use your skin regeneration to form a layer of skin around a large container and hook it up to your circulatory system, that could increase your ability to create new blood and dispose of waste to a large enough scale to matter from an industrial standpoint.

Since the effect works on any human body, it might be useful on corpses. Presumably it would result in undead people with one's goals and priorities, since the power does not confer regeneration and since classically dead bodies don't have the capacity for goals and priorities. If it doesn't work on dead people, try it on brain-dead people. Even if they lack knowledge and skills from their previous life, being granted the necessary brainpower for primary personality could at least provide some measure of comfort for their loved ones.
