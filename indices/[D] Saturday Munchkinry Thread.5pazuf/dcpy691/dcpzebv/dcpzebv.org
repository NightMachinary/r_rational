I think the question to ask here is which Gotham are we talking about here? If we're in the DC universe then you will want to exploit your comics knowledge similar to parts of /This One Ring/.\\
If you are in the DC-CU then there's a lot less to exploit, but you can still do quite a lot like convincing superman to do things like help with massive infrastructure projects, etc. However in those universes a mind control scheme probably wouldn't work as easily due to having to worry about superheros stopping you. Though with a fewer number of heros in the DC_CU you might be able to convince most people in the justice league to let you do tests on them (whose actual purpose is to inject them with your blood). Once you got superman and most the other very powerful members of the justice league you can forcefully take over any remaining heros as well as many supervillains.\\
If however you are in the dark knight universe then there's no magic so you can try your scheme more easily.

Also what counts as a primary vs a secondary personality trait?\\
Either way i'm still pretty sure people given my blood would help me, as they would also be primarily concerned with fulfilling my moral compass in the most efficient possible way, /and since you can affect more change if we're secretly in control of world governments/..

As for Gotham's crime rate that's kind of an afterthought once you're in control of the world, but i'm sure if you wanted to waste money on fixing Gotham instead of much more efficient charitable causes you could probably do so. After all when you control nearly the entire world you can produce many billions of dollars probably quite easily.

PS. So I did some research and over a year you should be able to safely extract over 36,000 ml of blood a year (well about half that early on as an 8 year old). So I could affect a massive amount of people, but with some planning I can vastly exceed this number.\\
I should have around 6 liters of blood (well half as an 8 year old) so if I was routinely extracting all that blood every day and replacing it with donor blood then I could get an absurd amount, though realistically let's say about 3 liters so as not to waste too much donor blood since I will get diminishing returns as they mix in my body (how long does it need to be in my body to be considered "my" blood?). Anyway for 3 liters a day I could affect over 100,000 people a year, so I might be able to seriously affect Gotham's crime simply by affecting a massive number of it's criminals, and giving the rest cushy jobs with my nearly unlimited monetary resources.
