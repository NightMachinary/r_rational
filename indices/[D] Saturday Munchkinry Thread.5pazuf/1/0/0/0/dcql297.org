Can a person enslave themselves for unbreakable vows? (They would presumably order themselves not to override orders.) Could they still be tricked into giving themselves new orders, or do you ignore orders that you know the master didn't mean to give?

Does this override previous enslavements, or do you have to follow orders from both? If the first, this allows freeing slaves, if the second, this allows making people enslavementproof by having them vow to ignore enslavement. (Guessing the former in the same vein as younger orders overriding.)
