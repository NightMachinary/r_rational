I mostly agree with you, although I think that there is difference that's important to the whole setting expectations and then breaking them and the idea you brought up about the audience being attracted to something with a certain set of expectations.

To use GOT as an example again. For people who didn't read the books, their expectations were probably broken severely when Ned Stark dies. But it was in a good way, because the expectations that the show had already set up, was that bad things will happen to good people (e.g. Bran). However, most people still expected Ned Stark to live in some last second heroics or intervention.

That's why I would make a distinction between what expectations the show sets up (which I'm more interested in) than what expectations an audience might assume based on trailers or hearsay.

But yeah, essentially, I totally agree with you.
