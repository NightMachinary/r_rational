Me saying that conservation of detail left its fingerprints was just a way of saying that it's also relevant to how worldbuilding functions in a story. Worldbuilding that doesn't serve any purpose, I called it hollow, but it's important to note that it can and often is enjoyable in the moment. It's just detrimental to the pacing and overall focus of the story.

Some settings require more worldbuilding than others, that's something I glossed over. A setting like Worm, with many divergences from the normal world, has to have a lot of worldbuilding to prove consistency. That goes double for HPMOR, where one of the core motivations behind it is making a coherent and consistent world out of the whimsy of canon. in contrast though, a relatively normal world needs very little worldbuilding, and what worldbuilding it does need will likely be directly relevant to the plot instead of indirectly.

Worm needs to explain how organizations like the Protectorate came to exist and how they function and fit in a society full of capes, and that involves a lot of worldbuilding that isn't directly connected to the plot (though it still serves a purpose, as proving the consistency of the world makes pieces fit together for the reader). Hypothetical 'regular world' movie People Shooting Each Other In The Office only needs to explain why people started shooting each other in the office. Not only is this less worldbuilding, it's more directly intertwined with the plot.

You're right, fights and worldbuilding aren't on a pass/fail scale, but what I wanted to convey is that, for fights, laziness and general incompetence leads to boring, uninspired fight scenes that get a 'meh' response, but with worldbuilding laziness and general incompetence leads to plotholes and inconsistencies which once noticed are actively harmful to the experience. There's certainly uninspired and generally 'meh' worldbuilding too, but a lazy writer will have worldbuilding both inconsistent and uninspired but mostly only 'meh' fights. If you want to parse that as readers being less forgiving of lazy writers' worldbuilding compared to fights, go ahead, but I think it's a bit deeper than just 'less forgiving'.
