I also love world building. it is one of my favorite things, but it still feels unique in some ways to me.

I have to say though, I am kinda confused by your point of "conservation of detail also leaves fingerprints...". To me that sounds like it means: Not having certain information also leaves a clue or notice or "fingerprint". But I don't really get how that's possible? Maybe I am misinterpreting your statement, but it kinda sounds like you are saying, saying nothing about a world building element, like the price of grain, can show up in a story and be felt, but then you also say, you don't want to know the price of the grain unless it is relevant? Im struggling to understand the point, so feel free to give it to me without the metaphor or whatever. Maybe im just missing it.

I am not sure I agree with this statement either: "So you've got a push to include enough worldbuilding to prove the consistency of the plot, make all the pieces fit together snugly and all that, and you've got a push to never use more worldbuilding than necessary." I feel like it is one or the other, not a push and pull kind of thing. In my original post I talked about how I feel like you either have a ton of information where your world building gives all the answers or at least is /about/ giving the answers and that is part of the draw. Or it is more tangent to the story, where you give details to make the world seem grounded and interesting, but you're never really going to answer how things work, on practical levels, instead you are focusing on character interaction or romance or comedy. An example would be WALL-E. You get enough information in that movie to feel grounded, but it all serves the characters and the plot, rather than being a main "character" itself, unlike something like Looper (which doesn't do this well) but the world building in that is /supposed/ to be good enough that the time travel and everything is a direct part of the plot, a main "character" I would say.

I also think I disagree with you about world building being easier to fail.

So, the first thing to point out is that world building, I would say, is not a pass/fail scale. So, when you say a non-good written fight might just be a "meh fight", well, I think that can be true of world building as well.

Just like it might not make sense in a fight for someone to not use the weapon near them; something in world building might not make total sense, but you're too caught up in the other good things to really notice unless you go back and re-watch or analyze the scene.

Curious if that changes your mind on anything or if I misjudged anything you said!
