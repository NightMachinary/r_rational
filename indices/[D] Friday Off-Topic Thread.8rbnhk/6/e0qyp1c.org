Status update on the next Vampire Flower Language chapter: computer trouble has led to one of us being unable to edit the story, and the other one of us is going to be on holiday for almost a month.

It pains me to admit this but it's unlikely that we'll have any updates until August, in case anyone was wondering.

That said, we've managed to add a lot of much-needed content to the next chapter, which means we can split it at a logical point so the two new chapters each have their own thematic arc and are the appropriate length, so there'll be an extra chapter and interlude in the final story than originally planned! So I'm really pleased about that.
