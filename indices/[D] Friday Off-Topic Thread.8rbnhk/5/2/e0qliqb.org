Laws are the result of a lot of history, and a lot of compromises. Alcohol is embedded in a huge number of cultures, and thus very hard politically to outlaw it. In addition, it's extremely easy to make, and good luck policing fermentation. Marijuana is comparatively difficult to grow, and rather distinctive when seen outdoors, so it's easier to police. I don't know precisely why marijuana was first outlawed, but I suspect there was a competing industry already established that would feel threatened by marijuana becoming big.

I'm no legal scholar, but I think intent is generally a big deal, even separate from the specific crime committed, along with likelihood of commiting similar crimes in the future. Take for examples murder of a spouse because of infedility, and something like financial fraud. Unless the latter was massive in scale, the first crime caused more harm, so logically it should be punished/rehabilitated more, right? Well, murdering a spouse because of infedility is a fairly extreme circumstance. It's not praiseworthy, but I think most people could picture themselves doing the same thing under similar circumstances. The crime and motives are understandable, and importantly the crime doesn't necessarily indicate a high likelihood to commit similar crimes in the future. Someone who murdered their spouse like that is very unlikely to go on to murder other people, and unless something similar happens in the future, they could probably live a normal life even without rehabilitation. Financial fraud however, depending on the specifics, is more sinister, because it indicates a willingness to exploit people who haven't done anything to the person responsible, solely for their own gain. If you let someone like that have free reign, they're much more likely than the first person to commit the same crime again, and thus it indicates a greater character flaw. So it does make some sense to have punitive measures that don't map precisely to the result of the crime, because we are taking the character of the person into account as well, along with their probability of doing the same crime in the future. This is especially true if you believe that the criminal justice system should be used for rehabilitation rather than punitive measures, because the aim is to correct the people, not simply punish crimes that may or may not have been intended.

So, things are complex, and unintuitive answers are common. Also, I like to ramble, and I'm not sure the previous sentence actually is my overarching point. That would probably require reading what I wrote after having done so.
