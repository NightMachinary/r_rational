Dammit. I had this entire reply written out, and then it got eaten when my app froze.

To summarize the post that now will never be, no, I'm not saying that it is at all common, only that the emotions that lead to the act are at least comprehensible to a normal person. Contrast that with torturing animals, where it's horrifying because a normal person honestly doesn't comprehend the drive to inflict pain for no other reason than to see something else in pain. It's a completely alien thought process.

  Is this a testosterone thing? Would a man walking in on a friend/partner/acquaintance doing an unspeakable deed imagine themselves getting so mad they just punch the guy out and one punch can kill so fuuuuck you're a murderer now?

I wouldn't be surprised to learn that men murder their spouses more than women do in the case of infidelity, but the emotions of aggression, betrayal, and revenge are not unique to men. Testosterone may increase the likelihood of such events, but it doesn't create those emotions where they didn't exist before.
