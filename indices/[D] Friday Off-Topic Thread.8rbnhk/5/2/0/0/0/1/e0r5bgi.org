Oh, then we're kind of talking about different things. I was talking about intentional homicide in my initial post. I don't want this to get personal, but imagine that you find strong evidence that your husband not only cheated on you with someone else, flagrantly and seemingly without remorse, but also did things like attempt to turn your friends and children against you, gambled away money you had saved for something important to you, and generally completely betrayed every trust you put in him. To take an over the top and mildly unrealistic example, although I know someone where something vaguely similar happened to her. You may not agree with murder in that case, you may still find it horrifying to harm someone that you care about, but can you at least understand why someone who isn't you would murder someone in those circumstances? You can comprehend how those emotions could theoretically lead to murder? That's the kind of thing I'm talking about, and how someone who did that in those circumstances wouldn't necessarily be a risk to the people around them, because the circumstances themselves are so uncommon, while exploiting other people for personal gain indicates a much larger character flaw and would potentially require a harsher sentence.
