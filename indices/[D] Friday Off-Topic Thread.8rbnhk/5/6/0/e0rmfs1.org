I personally think that might be a bit cynical, but I wouldn't say you're wrong.

However, I think you are missing the point of my post. I am interested in a thought experiment rather than something serious. I am not sitting here genuinely wondering why the world isn't a better place, but more interested in any other laws that people see as widely inconsistent with stated social values.

In general, statements like, "Were you literally born yesterday?" don't lead to productive conversations, but maybe that isn't your goal. I'll try, in the future, to clearly and explicitly state what my question's context is.
