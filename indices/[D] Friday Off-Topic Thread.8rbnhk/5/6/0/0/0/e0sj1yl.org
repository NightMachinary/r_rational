Again, you're not wrong, but I feel like you have now double-downed on not engaging with this question in a way that is productive.

You'll also notice that I said "social values" in my response to your post, so I am not even sure why you are bringing up things that don't involve that.

I am becoming convinced you just kinda want to shit on either me, a viewpoint you think that I espouse, or just kinda wanna shit on something in general.

I'd prefer if you didn't though, thanks.
