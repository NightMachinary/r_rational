All of this is absolutely true. But honestly, I wasn't concerned with any kind of practical application or how that would work. More of just highlighting laws that seemed to go against well established social values.

It has been interesting though, the amount of responses I have gotten that instantly go to a very practical, outcome oriented take on my original question. I thought I had been kinda clear about how it wasn't really about a practical concern, but I guess a lot of the people on this subreddit are concerned about the details and concrete outcomes of such questions. Which makes sense.
