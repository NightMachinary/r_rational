Ah, I seem to not be communicating well.

"So, to rephrase your position, then, you're saying that the laws (and enforcement of those laws) should be chosen such as to have the effect that cars don't ever go beyond about 60kmh, then, in the interests of safety?"

What I mean is, if I say, "We should outlaw cars" for whatever reason. We don't need to think about the how of that. We are just talking about what we think about that proposition, e.g. outlawing cars.

But anyway, it doesn't really matter at this point : P Thanks for all the responses : D
