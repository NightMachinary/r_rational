You're not the only one for l'appel du vide. For me though it happens during my job. I work in live broadcast as a technical director, and I sit in front of a machine called a switcher that controls what is going to the feed that people watch. So at any time, with no delay, I can ruin a show just by pressing a different button than I am supposed to.

Like a show could be going on, a talk show, and I could just have it switch to black and keep it there. I never will, but the thought does sometimes cross my mind.
