  I have to say, I don't think I would drive, ever, if there was a dagger in the car attached to the steering wheel ( o.o )
#+end_quote

Part of the reason those cars would be so safe :D

  But in all seriousness, that's a neat graph

I've seen better ones during training sessions I've received on this kind of thing, but that's the best I could find on my cursory google search. Can't believe it doesn't even have a y-axis but those tics would be at 10% intervals.

  I guess if we were really worried about pedestrians, we would set the speed limit to like 30 [mph]
#+end_quote

Where I live, the speed limit is 50kmh (=30mph) in "built up areas" - which means, very approximately, streets with houses on them. It used to be 60kmh, but they changed it about 20 years ago. So we do that in Australia!

  There is something kinda beautiful about seeing 8 lanes of traffic, with hundreds of cars going 60-75MPH right next to each other, and the only thing separating them from destroying each other being painted lines; to me, it is one of the ultimate manifestations of the power of the social contract, at least in the US or other similar countries.

Agreed. I get a lot of /l'appel du vide/ in those situations, for some reason especially when I'm driving along and I see a perfect family walking past (you know, Mum, Dad, a couple of toddlers, pushing a pram). I just think, "I could totally ruin everything for these people with a twitch of my hand".

... it's not just me who thinks that, right?

  I really feel like there is going to be a kid in 2150, sitting in a class, asking a teacher why anyone was okay with thousands of people dying every year due to cars
#+end_quote

I imagine even sooner. My proverbial grandkids will crowd around me and say,

"Grandma, is it true what Daddy said? That people used to drive cars themselves?"

"Oh yes it is little Sally! I used to drive your Daddy around all the time!"

"Oh my goodness! Wasn't it dangerous?"

"Of course it was."

"Didn't people die?!"

"In their thousands! But we didn't mind. It was normal then."

Like, I mean, I think we're coming up very soon on the generation who won't learn to drive.

  I feel like there must be a ton of stuff I'm blind to that is like that.
#+end_quote

I'm sure there is, history shows us that there's so much stuff that people used to do and now we scoff and can't believe how ridiculous it is. (Trepanning, phrenology, leeches, exorcisms, etc: probably shouldn't go straight to medical but there I am)
