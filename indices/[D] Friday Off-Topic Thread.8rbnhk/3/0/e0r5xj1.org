I've only watched the first and hated the way the movie deals with its female characters. There's a scene where>! the hero stalks the heroine and tattoo her without her consent while she's asleep. He then kinda molests her and says that she should not be a warrior because she's a beautiful woman. !< It was off-putting for me and really creeped me out. I think that if you have problems with how women are represented in media, you will not particularly enjoy this movie

To be fair, it was the first movie I watched in a while so you should draw your own conclusions regarding my sensitivity. I haven't watched many movies since, so I don't really have a reference point as to how it compares to other movies. If you are able to overcome or ignore the sexism, it's an okay watch.
