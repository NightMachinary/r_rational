When I heard a recommendation to check out Bollywood from the podcast [[http://www.themixedsix.com/2018/02/18/ep-32-stout-lads/][The Mixed Six]], I was warned that the films tend to be very socially regressive. However, he didn't find it all that different from how Hollywood films have institutional prejudice.

He found the experience gave enlightening insight into pop culture he was close to, while also being psychologically distant enough from American culture that he didn't loathe himself as much as when he sees it in American culture /all the time/.
