I'm a traffic engineer who works in road safety and I agree that cars are dangerous AF, people don't take them seriously enough, etc. But you also have to remember the amount of exposure that we have to cars is HUGE, some people drive for hours a day. Whereas the alcohol exposure is relatively lower.

Also, although it kind of pisses me off (towards zero/safe systems all the way!), we do have a dollar value for death/injury as well as for congestion when we calculate the cost/benefit ratio of proposed upgrades. But in my state at least, there's a bright line between "congestion projects" and "safety projects" and "an important government official wants this to be upgraded so we're upgrading it regardless" projects, and safety projects get a hell of a lot more money.
