What I don't like is that the cost to the economy is directly added to the cost of human life when calculating whether a treatment should be used or not, so that a place where a lot of people have to wait a long time to get through the traffic lights (which costs money for peoples' time and also for extra fuel use), and I don't think the dollar values in those two contexts can just be added together because they mean different things.

Human life cost can be anything from a large figure meant to represent "emotional suffering" caused in a society when a person dies, DALY cost used in healthcare, to the cost to a company for having to train a new employee; the congestion cost is lost wages, extra fuel consumption, and lost productivity of vehicles. They are measuring very different things and I don't like that they get added together.

We use BCRs all the time, and I think it's great for congestion projects which use money that's specifically found for congestion funding, and I think it's great for safety projects because you have to measure the difference in effectiveness two safety projects have. But adding them together just skeeves me out in a way, because I don't think you're measuring anything useful at that point if you're using it as a point of comparison, because it becomes apples to oranges. Does that make sense?
