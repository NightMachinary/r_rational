Yeah, for sure, tens of thousands of people die every year from car related accidents or incidents.

I am not sure what the point about exposure leads to though? Are you saying that cars are less dangerous because people use them a lot so they are good at using them? But I don't get how that compares to alcohol; I am not sure you can get "good" at using alcohol.

And obviously, you have more expertise than me, I don't actually know if reducing the speed limit to 40MPH would actually prevent deaths, but I am more curious about the thought experiment of, "If we valued human life as the most important thing, what laws either make no sense or should be changed and maybe how?" Because for sure, we, in general, in human society certainly /say/ human life is the most important thing, but you know, our laws don't really incentives that it seems?

We don't have to go into strict details about the actual practical details, but I am curious as to what others think, theoretically, about how our society has structured itself, and what conclusions people draw from that.
