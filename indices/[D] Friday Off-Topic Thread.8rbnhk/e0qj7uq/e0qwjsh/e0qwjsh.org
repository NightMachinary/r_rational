A better comparison would be tobacco and marijuana. As [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]] says, alcohol is just too dang easy to make to be a good point of comparison.

Cars, on the other hand. They're just too useful. Would imposing a speed limit of 40mph save lives? Probably. But there are significant societal and economic costs to that, costs which can be measured in lives.

Frankly, I think you're approaching the issues from an unusual perspective. Laws don't exist to minimize death or suffering. They exist to ensure liberty. (At least, in certain free democracies, they nominally do.)
