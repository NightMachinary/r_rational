I am, in fact, trying to approach it from an unusual perspective.

In terms of cars and lives being saved. Can you give an example besides an ambulance/firetruck? I think we can agree that exceptions for those could be made.

Also, do laws exist to ensure liberty? That seems almost directly contradictory? And maybe the bigger and better question is: What should the purpose of laws be? My point with the criminal system was that there seems to be a subset of laws that said, "Human life is most important." But we have lots and lots of other subsets where that isn't the most important thing.

I also understand that the way that laws got here, as [[/u/sicutumbo][u/sicutumbo]] said have to do with history and whatnot. But I proposing more of a thought experiment rather than a "Why is it this way, practically?"

Also, feel free to get back at me with other laws that you find nonsensical based on what a culture or society values.
