I think being a polyam vegan makes my views on jealous partners vs torturing animals probably different from most in general. I have never /understood/ the "she cheated on me so I blew her head off!" trope, except insomuch as I completely accept it as logical because it's so prominent in pop culture.

Another fun thing was reading [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/8e77hh/oppositesex_friendships_when_youre_married_yes_or/][this thread]] earlier this year. I had a heck of a time parsing most of the things people were saying. Ended up linking it to the polycule group chat and everyone had a good snicker [/feeling superior to others]
