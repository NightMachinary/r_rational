  Well, murdering a spouse because of infedility is a fairly extreme circumstance. It's not praiseworthy, but I think most people could picture themselves doing the same thing under similar circumstances.

... monogamous people are terrifying, sometimes. You really, honestly think if your partner betrayed you in a serious way that you would KILL them? Someone you /love/?

Like, my husband drives me batty when he doesn't do the dishes, don't get me wrong, and I'm trying to get into the same headspace by imagining myself walking in on him assaulting a minor or something, and I still can't get into the headspace where I'd even consider killing him. Pulling him off the victim, screaming at him, calling the police, crying a lot. But murdering him? No way. And a lot of people who murder spouses do it premeditated.

Is this a testosterone thing? Would a man walking in on a friend/partner/acquaintance doing an unspeakable deed imagine themselves getting so mad they just punch the guy out and one punch can kill so fuuuuck you're a murderer now?
