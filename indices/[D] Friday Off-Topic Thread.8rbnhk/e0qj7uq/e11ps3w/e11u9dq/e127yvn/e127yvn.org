If I had to answer more in an abstract sense, then, I would say that first, I consider the prohibition against marijuana absolutely inconsistent with the way we deal usually with individual responsibility and personal choices that pose danger to one's life or limb; that is probably cultural and, I would hope, bound to end eventually. Marijuana is the exception, not cars or alcohol.

Going to cars, I would argue it falls within a tradeoff. The system that maximizes people not dying is one where everyone lives inside of a protected bubble and never takes a risk; however, many would see such a life as worthless. A number of dangerous activities are accepted because they provide more opportunities for personal development or pleasure. Human life isn't an absolute value, because if we held it as such, that would lead to societal paralysis.

With murder, there's a slightly different issue. Murder isn't just termination of one's life. It's termination of one's life out of someone else's choice, and with malicious intent. That matters. We may have debate about suicide or euthanasia, but we generally accept that if it is your choice to put your own life at risk, that is up to you. Some people don't think like this but I'd argue that's a dangerously illiberal slippery slope. In other words, when it comes to maximising one's utility function, we must assume people know what's best for them, because from outside we sure can't. If drinking alcohol makes your life shorter but far more pleasurable, it may be sensible to drink alcohol.

Another question is of course that cars don't just kill irresponsible or unlucky users, but bystanders too. And in that sense, yes, they should be limited - which they are. We have driving licenses and road laws. However cars also greatly increase our productivity as a society; and more productivity means more wealth, more resources, more technology. Which translates into longer and better lives (ideally). So ultimately there's a cost to be paid for restricting cars too much; dismissing speed or efficiency as pointless is just ignoring the way those things impact society. And of course, cars give people freedom of movement, which increases freedom and individual happiness, which, again, tend to be good things. So it's a quality over quantity kind of thing, statistically; though sucks to be you if you're that unlucky pedestrian who just happens to be killed in a road accident, and all that stuff won't do you much good.

Is the balance we have right now optimal? Probably not. Would the optimal balance be wildly more restrictive of cars? Also no. You may argue for tighter speed limits or different laws, you'd probably be right. I'm convinced not quite as many people as they get one deserve a driving license, for example. Some are too irresponsible or too plain lacking in basic spatial perception to be granted one (I place myself squarely in the second category, and since my home country has been so careless as to still give me a license, I fixed that mistake by never using it any more after it became apparent I didn't deserve it and would end up killing either myself, someone else, or both).
