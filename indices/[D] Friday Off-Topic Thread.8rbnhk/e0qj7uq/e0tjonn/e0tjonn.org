I read the driving thread which was pree interesting and I agree that there are a lot of laws which are not optimized at all. And a lot to improve on. but as to the question of /why/ i think western countries laws are fairly easily explained.

I believe that laws are designed to optimize the "functioning of society". This is because laws are created by societies, and through the process of evolution, the societies which are the most successful are those which function best. So laws have evolved to prioritize the functioning of societies. and at least from where i'm from (Australia) they work wonderfully.

So to elaborate onto what that means:

People instinctually like fairness. So laws should and do treat everyone equally, if they dont you get revolutions. (of course in society in general people are greedy, so this is subverted sometimes)

Death is the final end for a human. Killing someone isnt just the worst thing you can do to them its in a whole nother league. Because you cant recover from it. this is why murder is the greatest crime. But accidental deaths aren't as important because there is no intensive to kill people accidentally. Scociety still functions of people willingly dangerous things.

also people have a instinctive desire for freedom. hence y laws are responsibility based. not outcome based.

Then note that laws are slowly being created and shifting. alcohol kills people, but it wasn't made illegal until the prohibition, and as seen then ot showed us that its already too late. society functions better (and leaves more people alive in this case) if alcohol stays legalized. (and imo this is true for most soft dugs).

With all that said, laws are contioisly edited by us. and tend to be moving towards the safety side.
