Can confirm. This is my experience with Cultist Simulator as well. Writing is great and it's a cool idea, but the gameplay is just the designer(s?) shitting on you. It's like they don't actually play their own game or something, because these sorts of issues, /especially/ the collect all cards thing, are just extremely stupid and awful.

It shares the Sunless Sea trait that there's all sorts of things that can theoretically end a game run and put you back to the start, and the best way to do a bunch of things is basically either "play super conservatively" or "wreck the game's sense of exploration by looking everything up ahead of time." For me, this translates to playing extremely slowly, exacerbating the issues with the repetitive game cycle. The lack of save/load functionality in Cultist Simulator means that you very much will be losing hours and hours of extremely tedious work if you experiment with more than one thing at a time, so you explore new things as minimally and slowly as possible to avoid the random loss conditions, which exacerbates the slow pace of the game.

For example, you can lose permanent vital personnel if you send them on missions for you and you fail the mission, so for every mission you are incentivized to first use renewable mercenary personel to scope out the problem and also almost certainly fail the mission, before doing the mission a second time with actual personnel, basically doubling the mission time, except you must also add in the time spent recruiting these mercenary personnel so it's more like 2.5x or more... And then eventually you might transition to sending summoned personnel who are more renewable, but on the other hand these summons have to be maintained because they constantly expire and you have to therefore resummon constantly by sacrificing them to themselves, which adds a whole 'nother grind and is also extremely stupid...

There are a bunch of things that the game could do to make it less tedious and stupid. The fact that they weren't already done before the official release is a terrible sign. As it stands now I don't recommend people play it.

10/10 ideas and flavour text, though. But that's all that is there.
