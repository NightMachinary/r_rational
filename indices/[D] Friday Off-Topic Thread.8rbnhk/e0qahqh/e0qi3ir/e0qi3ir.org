Hello!

So I recently watched a video that was very sad about how "Darling in the FanXX" (an anime) ruined their world building in episode 19. Here is the video in question if you are curious: [[https://youtu.be/IbSKXMFlOMY]]

Note: All of this only applies if world building is part of the story, something that only focuses on human experience or emotion or heroic flaws might not apply to my thoughts on this.

World building to me is a very weird craft because it seems to only be good in either the extreme, where you really know everything and that is very, very, very planned out and figured out, a la Worm and HPMOR or it is very carefully parceled out and is contingent on masterfully dropping hints and little pieces that then lets the audience fill in the gaps.

What I find weird about that is if you were to plot world building on a line, one end might say, "No information" the other end would say, "All of the information" and then if you marked areas where it was, widely considered, good writing then you might have a dot in the middle and a dot near the end that says "All of the information".

One, I think it is weird that how it feels, at least to me, that world building is kinda narrow when you define what is good. (It feels weird enough that I wonder if I am just wrong, and if someone can provide some examples of great world building that totally contradicts what I'm saying please do)

Two, that world building is something that seems, to me, to be intensely cumulative, a lot like suspension of disbelief.

To expound, there is the semi-famous example of people being in disbelief about Samwell Tarly (from Game of Thrones) staying fat despite his adventuring, and how that broke suspension of disbelief but dragons don't. Now, I fully agree with those making the "it breaks my suspension of disbelief" argument, but the why of it is interesting to me.

Essentially, the cumulative effect of the Game of Thrones universe has set it up to be "realistic" in the terms of its universe. This means you end up creating expectations in the audience, and the lack of believable consequences assigned to Samwell means you lose peoples' suspension of disbelief, because of those expectations.

However, if you watch something like Supernatural and a character suddenly shows up with a piece of equipment that mystically controls ghosts and Sam and Dean don't then steal that piece of equipment to create an indestructible army of ghosts to defeat their foes but instead treat the mystical object as a minor inconvenience, well, expectations had already been set, so no one, except me, gets unreasonably mad.

What I am trying to get at is that world building, like, suspension of disbelief, is more tied to expectations than most other things, in my opinion, and is part of a subset of story telling devices or descriptions that suffer from a total lack of forgiveness. What I mean by forgiveness is that in a lot of media/stories if 99% of the a thing is great, like the action, but one fight isn't great, people, I think, don't really harp on it or put that one bad fight on display, instead I think they are more likely to forgive that bad fight by focusing on all the great fights.

However, for something like world building or suspension of disbelief by having all those "great fights" first, when you then have that "bad fight" (fights are standing in for pieces of information that inform the world building or suspension of disbelief) then you end up with people only focusing on that bad thing.

I feel like the two examples I provided support this, both Samwell Tarly and the video by Mother's Basement (MB made a video before the one I linked that applauded the world building in Darling in the FranXX). Now, regardless of whether you like either of the stories, I hope you understand my point about how world building and suspension of disbelief seem to lack "forgiveness" by an audience.

So, all that being said, I am curious as to 1. Am I just wrong about anything? 2. Why do you think suspension of disbelief, world building, or something else is treated differently? 3. How you, if you produce stories, approach world building and how you navigate something that seems rife with difficulties.

Thanks!
