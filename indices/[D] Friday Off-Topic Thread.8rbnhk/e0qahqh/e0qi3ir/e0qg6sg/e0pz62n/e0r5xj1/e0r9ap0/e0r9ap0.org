So, I agree with you, the movie definitely has a weird kind of sexism. But, I think it works out in this case, because there are /many/ other times when female characters are given /amazing/ moments which at least as striking as the actions taken by the male characters. The Queen Mother in particular lives up to her title in spectacular fashion.

As for the tattoo scenes and makeover-fight-scene, I watched this film with my SO and our jaws were on the floor at how absurd and amazing they were, but it's not any more absurd than him climbing a mountain higher than the clouds motivated by a beautiful face which he has only seen in the reverse image of a wooden mask. The story is more fantastical and mythic than even something like the Lord of the Rings, and maybe I should be more upset at tattooing your true love before introducing yourself but I'm really not.
