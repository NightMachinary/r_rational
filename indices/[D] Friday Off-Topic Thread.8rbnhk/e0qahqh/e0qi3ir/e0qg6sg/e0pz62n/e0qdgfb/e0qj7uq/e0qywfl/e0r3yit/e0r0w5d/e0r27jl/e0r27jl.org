  I am not sure what the point about exposure leads to though? Are you saying that cars are less dangerous because people use them a lot so they are good at using them? But I don't get how that compares to alcohol; I am not sure you can get "good" at using alcohol.

No, I'm saying that the more you drive, the more likely you are to die in a car accident; the more you drink, the more likely you are to die from alcohol-related diseases (anything from increased cancer drink to, appropriately enough, drunk driving). So every kilometre you drive, on average you lose X minutes of life proportional to your odds of getting in an accident (look up quality adjusted life years); for every glass of alcohol you have, you lose X minutes of your life proportional of your odds of getting one of those diseases.

My intuition is the reason more people die on the roads (and I don't think that's true - I think more people die of alcohol related illnesses), it's because people spend more kilometres on the roads than the amount of alcohol they drink. Does that make sense? I feel like I haven't explained it very well.

  I don't actually know if reducing the speed limit to 40MPH would actually prevent deaths
#+end_quote

Absolutely. We have a saying in road safety; "the safest car is a car with a dagger taped to the steering wheel aimed directly at the driver's heart". People would drive at walking pace in those conditions, and deaths would be vanishingly rare.

More scientifically, there are graphs showing types of crashes, speeds, and the probability of death. Here's one for pedestrians getting hit by cars:

It's a typical shape; they tend to have a slow start, a sudden jump, and then a slow demise.

It's interesting you say "reducing the speed limit", because a reduction in speed limit by 10kmh from my recollection slows people down only by 4kmh. A nationwide speed limit reduction would probably have little effect except for reduced compliance with speed limits, unless enforcement was guaranteed.

We tend to force people to go slower by putting in roundabouts, which often have "predeflection" which forces people to slow down on the way. That has an actual ability to slow people down because people like it when their cars stay on the road instead of going onto the verge.

  "If we valued human life as the most important thing, what laws either make no sense or should be changed and maybe how?"
#+end_quote

Yeah, I absolutely agree that if we valued human life, we'd do something major about roads. I think it would be funding-related, though. There's plenty of ways to make it almost impossible for someone to die on the road, they're just all fabulously expensive.
