It's not upper body strength at all that's the issue here. Most of the strength behind a single punch doesn't come from upper body strength, it comes from pivoting into the punch. While it's true that males have /an/ advantage, it's not the be all end all -- two untrained people, one male, and one female, that both pivot into a punch instead of throwing a straight jab, are both fully capable of ending someone's life with a punch to the head or neck.

(Moreso if they're married: a ring to the right part of the skull will crush it. :P)
