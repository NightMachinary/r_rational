Someone talked about being swingers in that thread, I think. They used very dehumanising language if I recall (you know, "my lady can play with any toys she wants" or some such; I think maybe a one penis policy may have been alluded to).

I also think the bubbles of [[/r/rational]] and [[/r/marriage]] don't overlap very much.
