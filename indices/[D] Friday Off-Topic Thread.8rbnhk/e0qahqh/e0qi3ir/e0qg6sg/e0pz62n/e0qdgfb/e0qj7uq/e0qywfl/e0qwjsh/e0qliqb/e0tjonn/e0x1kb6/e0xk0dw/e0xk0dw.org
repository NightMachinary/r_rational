You're totally right, but my post was aligned with it being a thought experiment, hence, I don't feel any need to worry about how to enforce or how practical it would be.

But like I said, you're right; it's just not a thing I was interested in exploring (the practical means of enforcing a change to the laws).

However, I do feel like your last line makes it sound like if ever a majority of people decide to ignore something you should just give up on it. But, you know, that sounds silly to me. It might just take time before people start realizing they shouldn't ignore it.
