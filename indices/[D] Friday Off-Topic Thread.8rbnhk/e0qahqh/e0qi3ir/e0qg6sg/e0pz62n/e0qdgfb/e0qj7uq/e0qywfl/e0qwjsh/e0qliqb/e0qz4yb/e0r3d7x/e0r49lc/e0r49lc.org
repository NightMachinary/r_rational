The testosterone thing was more... I can imagine myself punching my husband to get him off a child he's assaulting, and being a woman with average upper body strength (i.e. poor compared with a man's), there's effectively 0 chance a punch from me would kill someone, whereas the average man's punch is going to have a small but nonzero chance.
