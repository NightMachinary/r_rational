So, to rephrase your position, then, you're saying that the laws (and enforcement of those laws) should be chosen such as to have the /effect/ that cars don't ever go beyond about 60kmh, then, in the interests of safety?

Insofar as that goes, I do think that you have an excellent point. I think that, with proper care, attention, and the total elimination of anything like a long, straight road, such a position could be taken and enforced. (For the purposes of argument, let us assume that such enforcement can be made to work). There will be a cost, naturally. More traffic jams, more time spent in traffic. Nothing that a total rework of most road networks couldn't mitigate.

Hmmm. I don't really know enough about traffic to argue against your stance, at this point.

  However, I do feel like your last line makes it sound like if ever a majority of people decide to ignore something you should just give up on it.

That was not what I intended to communicate. The intention was more to suggest that a partial solution which works might be preferable to a full 'solution' which doesn't.
