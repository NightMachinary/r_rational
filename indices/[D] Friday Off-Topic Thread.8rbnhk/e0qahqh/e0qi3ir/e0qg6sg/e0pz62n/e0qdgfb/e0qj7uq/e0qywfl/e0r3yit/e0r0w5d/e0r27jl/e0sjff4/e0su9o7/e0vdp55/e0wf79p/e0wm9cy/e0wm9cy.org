I can't speak 100% for others, but almost every show has the TD accidentally go to the wrong camera, especially if the show is long and you are covering action. You get used to a rhythm and stuff, and you try to anticipate sometimes, and sometimes the director thinks the action is going somewhere and calls it wrong, sometimes the TD fat fingers it and just presses the wrong button, sometimes the communication to cameras wasnt crisp. It all depends, but yeah, it happens : P
