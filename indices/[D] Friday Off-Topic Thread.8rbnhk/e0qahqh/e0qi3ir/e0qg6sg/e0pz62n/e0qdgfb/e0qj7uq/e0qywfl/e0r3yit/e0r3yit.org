  Also, although it kind of pisses me off (towards zero/safe systems all the way!), we do have a dollar value for death/injury

I mean, you have to put human lives at some finite value, and it only makes sense to translate that into dollars. If you had human lives set at infinite value, then nothing could ever get approved unless it was completely impossible for it to fail lethally. Bridges would be multiple times larger in order to have vastly higher margins of safety, and even a small project IRL would be a massive undertaking.

You may think that the value given to human life is too small, or something similar, but I don't see how you could argue that human lives shouldn't have a finite value associated with them at all.
