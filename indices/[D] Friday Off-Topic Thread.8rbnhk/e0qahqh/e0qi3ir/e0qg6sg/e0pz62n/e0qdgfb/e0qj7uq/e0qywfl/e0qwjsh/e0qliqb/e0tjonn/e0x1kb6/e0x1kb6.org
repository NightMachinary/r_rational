  Why are cars allowed to go over, like, 40 MPH / 64 KMH?

How would you enforce that?

--------------

There's a highway near to where I live. Now, highways in this country have a default speed limit of 120km/h. Nowhere have I seen a speed limit higher than 120km/h. (Urban driving generally has a speed limit of 60km/h).

On this particular highway, there was once some construction - I think they were adding a lane or something. For a long stretch of highway, there was a temporary speed limit (marked specifically as 'temporary') of 60km/h. No lanes were closed.

I think I only once saw a car travelling at 60km/h (not counting when traffic did not permit faster travel).

A lower speed limit might well save lives. But only if people are going to listen to it.

And people [[https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2011-12-12-taxi-driver-guilty-of-murdering-10-school-kids/][aren't always going to listen]].

So, I put to you the proposal that it is better to have higher speed limits which people listen to, than lower speed limits which people ignore.
