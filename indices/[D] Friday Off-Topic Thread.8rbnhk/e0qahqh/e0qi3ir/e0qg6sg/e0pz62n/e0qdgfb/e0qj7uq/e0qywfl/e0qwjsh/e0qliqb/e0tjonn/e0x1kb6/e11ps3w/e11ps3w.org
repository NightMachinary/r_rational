I think there's a number of factors. 64 KMH is too low as a hard cap because people go faster than that on highways. But 120 KMH could definitely be, because there's no place where you're supposed to go faster than that anyway. However, the problem is, how do you implement that? You got two possible ways: build cars that literally can't go faster than that, and build cars as now, but put inside them some kind of limiter that simply stops you from accelerating beyond that.

Method 1 would require a full rework of our current engineering for cars, and possibly lead to a loss of efficiency. In a moment in which we're already supposed to be transitioning to higher efficiency transportation we couldn't really afford that.\\
Method 2 would be a joke, because people would just hack that limiter away, the way people used to convert a PlayStation to be able to play pirated games.

Then of course there's the fact that people /like/ cars that go fast, and that in fact a lot of the absolutely bullshit marketing of cars relies on them making you feel more manly/powerful/whatever, so the faster the better. And that's definitely something that I despise but it also means your hypothetical anti-fast-cars prohibition would meet a lot of resistance.

The one thing I can see, though, is that if we start switching to self-driving cars, those will enforce the speed limits by default. And if they become common enough, and reduce the accidents enough, then people might actually begin to develop a stigma towards obstinate manual drivers, and ultimately manual driving could even be banned on public roads. Which would basically lead to what you are discussing becoming reality.
