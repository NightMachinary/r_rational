I watch MMA PPVs and I sometimes get annoyed by the angle they decide to show, but I also have been wondering if the person in charge of the broadcast booth has ever fucked up and played the wrong angle / been tempted to show a bad one. I am glad that that person is human with horrible urges like the rest of us.
