Yep. I totally didn't understand what you were getting at in terms of the drive vs alcohol exposure thing. Thanks for clarifying; I agree with what you said.

I have to say, I don't think I would drive, ever, if there was a dagger in the car attached to the steering wheel ( o.o )

But in all seriousness, that's a neat graph. I guess if we were really worried about pedestrians, we would set the speed limit to like 30, if not on the highway (assuming people followed the speed limit, which is a big assumption).

There is something kinda beautiful about seeing 8 lanes of traffic, with hundreds of cars going 60-75MPH right next to each other, and the only thing separating them from destroying each other being painted lines; to me, it is one of the ultimate manifestations of the power of the social contract, at least in the US or other similar countries.

However, as neato bandito as it looks, I really feel like there is going to be a kid in 2150, sitting in a class, asking a teacher why anyone was okay with thousands of people dying every year due to cars and the teacher just shrugging and being like, "We'll never know. Americans and others were just fucking crazy."

I feel like there must be a ton of stuff I'm blind to that is like that.
