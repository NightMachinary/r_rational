Does anyone else not really understand how certain things are not outlawed or how certain laws aren't different?

I think a lot of people, recently, have applied this to Marijuana and Alcohol, where, and I think rightfully so, people point out Alcohol kills a lot of people - [[https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics]]. So it follows that either Alcohol should also be outlawed or Marijuana should definitely be legal.

But for me, I always think about cars. Why are cars allowed to go over, like, 40 MPH / 64 KMH? Car related accidents kill a lot more people than Alcohol, or really, almost anything else - [[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/02/15/national-safety-council-traffic-deaths/340012002/]]

It is weird to think that we repeatedly opt into these systems that clearly aren't maximized for people to not die, but instead for, uh, speed? Efficiency? I am not sure.

But our criminal laws don't reflect this, for those we consider murder to be the greatest crime, only overshadowed by murders. And from that you might then assume that we hold human life to be the most important thing, but then you look at some of our other laws, and it is clear that that isn't the case or at least it isn't something strongly considered?

Thoughts?
