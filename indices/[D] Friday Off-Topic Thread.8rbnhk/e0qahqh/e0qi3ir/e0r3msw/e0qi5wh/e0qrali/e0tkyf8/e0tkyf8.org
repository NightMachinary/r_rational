Very interesting. and i think you are largely correct only; Have you thought that rather than breaking expectations because it set them, it instead breaks expectations of the /audience/ it attracts? For example, in supernatural, it from the start isn't particularly rational. So the kind of audience who is watching it doesn't particularly care if the characters act stupid and dont use an op relic like they could. While in GOT, it was incredibly well thought out at the start. so the type of person who watched it were those who liked well thought out shows. so when it isnt they complain.

both this and your reason would have the same symptoms you pointed out. a,d would explain also why things like world building are on two extremes. (ppl either care for it or dont)

I don't think your dragon example is completely accurate. this is because the premise of GOT is "A fantasy medieval world with some cryptic magic and dragons" not "A fantasy med... ...and dragons AND where fat people exercising doesn't make them thinner". Dragons is part of the premise, while tarly is an inconsistency with the premise.

A personal experience to support this is that i enjoyed GOT until it deviated from the books. Then instead of complaining i just dropped it because it lost its rationality. rather than not enjoying it because it broke expectations, i didnt enjoy it because it stopped being rational. and i wouldn't have enjoyed any show as rational as post-books GoT, irrespective of expectations.
