  (It feels weird enough that I wonder if I am just wrong, and if someone can provide some examples of great world building that totally contradicts what I'm saying please do)

World building with minimal information about the world being built is going to be hard to spot - because the information needed to recognise the world being built isn't there.

Nonetheless, where would you put /Alice In Wonderland/ or /Alice Through The Looking Glass/? Both have pretty minimal information revealed on the underlying natures of the world being built...
