Worldbuilding is something I generally have positive associations with, and like seeing in stories, and I think the reason for that is good worldbuilding assists good plots. A good plot is (among other things) consistent from start to end, and you can't see that in full unless you know the context of the situation.

If the evil empire is invading through a strategically vital choke point, then saying that the rest of the border is impassible mountains is worldbuilding that helps make the pitched battle at the choke point feel more consistent.

Conservation of detail also leaves fingerprints too. We don't care about the price of grain in the kingdom, so telling us would be a waste of precious information-space unless the price of grain is relevant to the consistency of the plot (such as sparking a rebellion). Worldbuilding that isn't focused, that isn't relevant to the plot (and relevant can be even just setting tone or building attachment) is an idle timewaste.

So you've got a push to include enough worldbuilding to prove the consistency of the plot, make all the pieces fit together snugly and all that, and you've got a push to never use more worldbuilding than necessary. Good worldbuilding always serves a purpose, and the rest is aesthetics. Worldbuilding that's got great aesthetics (something something "great towering edifices of shimmering crystal where the Serene Lords conduct their business" or something like that) but doesn't do anything for the plot, doesn't give you pieces of the puzzle, doesn't set the tone or guide you to forming opinions and immersing yourself in the story, will seem hollow in retrospect.

On what you said about worldbuilding suffering from a lack of forgiveness, I would say that's the result of worldbuilding being easier to /fail/. It can be hard to right a good fight, but a failed attempt at a good fight is usually just a meh fight. Truly /bad/ fights do exist, they're ones that fly in the face of everything you expected out of it, throw away established rules and characteristics and don't even reach a satisfying conclusion, but that kind of mess-up is hard to achieve. Harder, certainly, than leaving an inconsistency in your worldbuilding.
