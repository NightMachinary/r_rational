Re: pattern-matching

I'm talking more elemental. If you get a description like ...

#+begin_quote
  His heels dragged as he walked down the hallway. He loosened his tie with one hand while the other gripped the handle of a battered suitcase.
#+end_quote

... you start to build up a loose model of them in your head. Readers do this without being told to; if no information is given about skin color, hair color, age, demeanor, etc., they'll fill in the gaps on their own, and the stuff that was filled in becomes a part of that model.

For example, that description /doesn't/ say that the man was wearing a suit, but it's /likely/ that if you pictured him, the suit was a part of that picture. The innate modeling ability of the brain decides that, rather than it being a /conscious/ process of "oh, he's wearing a tie, which usually goes with a suit, and therefore that's likely what he's wearing with probability 70%".

I'm not saying that you can't break from the models that the brain generates, just that /when you do it, it must be done deliberately and for effect./ And this isn't just writing advice of "do things deliberately and for effect", it's specifically "you have to be more careful when going contrary to what people will bake into their models of the world/characters you create". Anything that reinforces those models and patterns gets (more of) a pass from the reader and therefore needs less time and attention.
