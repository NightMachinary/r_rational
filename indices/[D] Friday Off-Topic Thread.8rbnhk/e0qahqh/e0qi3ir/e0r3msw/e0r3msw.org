  So, all that being said, I am curious as to 1. Am I just wrong about anything? 2. Why do you think suspension of disbelief, world building, or something else is treated differently? 3. How you, if you produce stories, approach world building and how you navigate something that seems rife with difficulties.

1. I think the primary thing you're talking about is how to execute worldbuilding properly, and the two approaches are "show things that are evocative but don't necessarily have answers" and "show things that fit as parts of a complex whole whose majesty is only slowly revealed over time". I don't think that the big difference between these two is in how much worldbuilding is revealed to the reader (or done by the author), and I think there are other approaches to worldbuilding that also work, outside of those two. I'll grant that the more you show, the more solid it has to be, but that's true of almost anything (including, for example, characterization).

2. I think there's a zen state to media consumption, and interrupting that zen state for whatever reason essentially throws a wrench in the gears, which really ruins enjoyment. Setting (and meeting) expectations is really important for that reason, since what most people are doing is pattern-matching as they go, developing models of the world and characters that become more complicated and deep as the work goes on. Changing those models needs to be done really carefully and deliberately, lest you wreck the flow state and ruin a person's investment.

3. My approach to worldbuilding is to give as much thought to things as I can before hitting the limits of diminishing marginal utility, with special emphasis to those bits that are part of the plot, characterization, etc. /(ex. if the main character is a former vicar who has been shunned by his church, you better believe that I'm going to spend a lot more time making sure that I understand the church he worked in and was exiled from)/

   For /showing/ worldbuilding, I think there are a few general approaches, which can be combined. The first is being evocative and economical, using as few words as possible to paint the broadest and most impactful possible picture. Part of this is just "show, don't tell" at work, but you can only get so far on that, and showing takes way more words/attention/effort than slipping in the occasional tell. Second, you can infodump, which there are various ways to soften or dress up, like characters talking to each other and infodumping through conversation about a side topic, including a fish out of water, etc. And third, there's including worldbuilding through storytelling; you don't give a dry history of the world, instead you tell a story about someone who was a part of that history and all exposition is by way of explaining elements of that story and their impact on this narrative, rather than parceling out bits of worldbuilding, because "my father was fired after the bots took over his plant" is a lot more compelling than "by 2038, 90% of the workforce was replaced by robots".
