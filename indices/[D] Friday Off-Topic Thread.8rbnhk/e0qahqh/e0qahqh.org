I really wanted to like Cultist Simulator. It's from some of the same people that did Fallen London (which I liked well enough) and Sunless Sea (which I really enjoyed), and has the same evocative, shrouded quality to the writing.

The actual gameplay though ... it consists of nouns, represented by cards, and verbs, represented by boxes. To do things, you put a noun in a verb, and stuff happens as time passes. As a basic gameplay mechanism, this is neat enough, especially since there's lots of lore/text to read that accompanies every action you take.

There's no tutorial of any kind, only occasional "tips" that don't reveal much, and much of the early gameplay is in fitting nouns with verbs and discovering new nouns, new verbs, and advancing in that way.

My problem comes from three basic issues:

- There's a /ton/ of repetition, which isn't at all fun, because the actual mechanic is just "drag card to box", and once you've read the text and know the outcome, it's just rote, which wouldn't be a problem if you didn't have to keep doing the same fucking thing every sixty seconds (thirty seconds at double speed). I have no idea whether it's a grind by intent, but it's an /absolute/ grind. A "repeat this ad nauseum" button would immediately fix this problem, as would "double click this box to auto-fill with an appropriate card", which I don't think would spoil much, because the game already highlights which cards go in which slots, if you have one open.
- Cards go all over the place. You hit the "collect all" button and they sometimes return to where they were, and sometimes go other places, and sometimes push other cards out of the way, and sometimes completely overlap with other cards so you can't see all the cards. I kind of get this as a design choice, but it's absolutely horrible for usability, and it means that a lot of "gameplay" is just "rearrange cards that the game has strewn all over the place", which is obnoxious.
- Once you've learned a lot and are in the loops of (not hugely fun) gameplay, you're left grinding for what feels like a long time. I can't do X because I don't have Y, and the only way to get Y is to do Z until I get lucky with the random outputs. It seems like what gates a lot of the game is just that it's utterly tedious to do some things, which is a bad gate (IMO).

I don't know, the early part of exploration and understanding with a game that doesn't hold your hand was a lot of fun, and gave me that sense of Science where I was trying different things and making little notes about how it all fit together ... and then it morphed into this pretty tedious thing, rather than becoming a different beast. In a lot of ways, it reminds me of an incremental game, but instead of getting upgrades that automate away aspects of the early game, it just makes you keep doing everything manually until you're sick of it and quit.
