I hear what you're saying, but maybe its just my own personal experience overwhelming me, but I don't think I've heard people ever be like, "That fight was so bad it took me out of the movie, let's discuss it for an hour" but I have had people who were like, "Why didn't they use the Magic Crystal to do /insert action/! Let's discuss this for an hour!"

It seems like a common qualitative difference to me in how people react to that sort of thing. But maybe I'm just surrounded by people who are more into world building than fight scenes.

I don't know.
