Wait, I feel confused.

My original point is that there is something unique about world building that sets it apart from other aspects of storytelling that causes people to react more vehemently to it when its not done well.

Then you brought up your theory that it is due to the fact that world building is easier to fail.

But then you say: "Worldbuilding, when done lazily, leaves gaping, irritating holes in the fabric of the story in addition to the forgettable meh elements."

Which to me, if both that fight and world building are done in the same "quality" which you described as "lazily" and your reaction to one is harsher than the other, is that because world building is easier to fail or some other reason? To put it another way, I think maybe "easier to fail" isn't descriptive enough.

Maybe it is because of what [[/u/alexanderwales][u/alexanderwales]] brought up in pattern matching. We have a good idea of how systems work, but very few of us know how a fight works. So it becomes more irritating when the thing we understand better doesn't work very well?

Maybe at this point this is just an annoying conversation, but I feel like there is a nugget of interest in here somewhere.
