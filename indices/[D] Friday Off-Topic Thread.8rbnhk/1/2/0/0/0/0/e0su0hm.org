You could just be surrounded by pedantic worldbuilders, yeah, but your experience does fit with what I've said. A fight, when done lazily, is not compelling or entertaining, but nothing to particularly complain about. It's meh, and you forget about it. Worldbuilding, when done lazily, leaves gaping, irritating holes in the fabric of the story /in addition to/ the forgettable meh elements.

The differing property of these two story elements isn't that people care about bad worldbuilding more than bad fights, but that fights need to be more than lazy or low-quality to prick the same mental irritations that lazy and low quality worldbuilding easily manages to prick.
