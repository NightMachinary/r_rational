I'd be interested in knowing what other ways you were referencing here:

"and I think there are other approaches to worldbuilding that also work, outside of those two."

Also, I totally agree with you in regards to execution, but I feel if we talk about execution we will get very mired in details, because lots of things that might be "bad" if executed well are great, and vice versa.

I'd rather stick to the kinda of meta about world building and suspension of disbelief, but, like I said, I think you nailed what you said about execution, types of execution, etc.

For your number 2. Based on how you explained it, I think I disagree. I feel like "good writing" or maybe it is just writing I enjoy, has to throw a wrench in the pattern matching / zen consumption of media. If you aren't jolted out of "Buddy Cop Comedy" with something that breaks the mold or challenges you, then I feel like you are, maybe by definition, encountering "bad writing".

However, I realize that when you say pattern matching, you might be talking about something more meta or distant like "Man vs Nature", which, uh, well, that and archetypes like it (Man vs Man, Man vs Self, etc) are the basis of pretty much every story, and we probably won't ever get away from that.
