Yeah sure try to brigade some random idiot by posting lies to people who don't really care, most people here have never heard about this book or person, but looking at your post history it sounds like you support them just so you can turn around to discredit your own claim, this isn't about rational fiction it is just you trying to get attention, your actions are effecting a handful of people who don't care so stop being annoying and if you actually care then take it somewhere else like the papers that run the ads, send them an email or something useful
