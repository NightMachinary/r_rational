Hypothesis: Any wish can be arbitrarily evil since while a finite set of specific details can be guaranteed by the wish, the wish-granter can take any method to achieve them.

Is it possible to produce what is effectively an infinite set of criteria? An example that comes to mind is: Grant me the wish that will maximise my utility function. This runs into the pitfall that the method used to confirm that outcome (our senses and brain) are easily satisfied with things that weren't our original intent, or worse, were our original intent but had side effects that we now dislike.
