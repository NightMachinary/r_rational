I expect that paring it down also removed limitations. We've seen a few good heroes with some nasty limits. Though it likely wasn't all that limited in the first place - Names seem to alter a bit with the relative power of whatever bears them. A little. Hell, the Pilgrim has some real bullshit aspects and he's an old man. A Horned Lord Named? Yeech.

Though capture would probably involve something like the foundling gambit crossed with the DK's way to avoid the bard. Enough ordinance that there are no options but death.
