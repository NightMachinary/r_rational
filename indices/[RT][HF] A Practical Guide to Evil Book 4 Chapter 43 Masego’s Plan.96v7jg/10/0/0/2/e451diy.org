  As for the powerset, tell me YOUR interpretation of how Spool works. :p

There's no need for interpretations, the chapter spells it out pretty clearly.

  “Interesting,” Hierophant said. “You did not break the march of time so much as sever causality. Prune away events from a sequence that still theoretically exists.”
#+end_quote

*Spool* messes with causality. It removes the consequences of actions that harmed the Skein.

Since the ice skeleton dragon it has destroyed still remained so, it's clear that he doesn't reset everything. Cat and co. still having their memories further proves this. I don't see how you could achieve this effect with timeline manipulation.
