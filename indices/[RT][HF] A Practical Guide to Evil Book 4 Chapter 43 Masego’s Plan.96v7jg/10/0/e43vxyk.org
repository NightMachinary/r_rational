I think that's bullshit - they have main characters with a similar approach to violence and morality, who go through a similar arc of losing themselves to power and reacting to that change in themselves. And that's pretty much where the similarities end. No other character's powerset maps to anything from Worm, except insofar as they draw on similar sources. I guess you could say that Warlock's power is similar to Labyrinth, if you squint? And I can't think of any more, beyond stuff like "Black Kaze and the Saint of Swords are both crazy old women with anime sword powers". Or "Nilbog and the Dead King are both megalomaniacal rulers of their constructed kingdoms populated with creatures and cultures they have crafted to focus obsessively on them." I can't really think of anything else. Even the major setting elements are nothing alike. The Gods map vaguely to the Entities, I guess? There are no Endbringer analogues.
