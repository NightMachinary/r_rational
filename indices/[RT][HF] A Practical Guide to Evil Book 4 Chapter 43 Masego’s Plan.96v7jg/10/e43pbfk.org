This work has enough similarities to Worm (the original, not the silly sequel) that, when it comes to powersets, I think it's fairly safe to say:

/Skein/ == /Coil/

It seems like that the creature's power has a similar limitation: He can only *Spool* back to the point where he started its use. He may be able to do it multiple times, or run multiple 'timelines' concurrently, /but/ his reset can only go back so far.

In other words, the trick to beating him is to put him in a situation where he *thinks* he has won and lets the power 'reset' over time instead of actively using it to backtrack... and then murder him in such a way that even if he tries to Spool it back he's in the same position each time with no way out.

I think this little cliffhangar is him making that mistake.
