Yeah, I thought as much. That makes sense. I'm not sure where I was getting the time loop/Groundhog Day idea, now that I think of it.

And it really makes you think: if this is a lesser version of Spool, limited only to one area and presumably neutered to some degree, what was it like when the Skein still lived? What kind of buttfuckery did the Heavens/the Dead King have to pull out to kill a seer on this level?
