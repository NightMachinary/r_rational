Right. I think the site ate my comment so I'll just put it here.

--------------

Dammit. These chapters feel way too short.

So I assume that whenever the Woe got too close to Malicia or the Skein, the ratling would just Spool and send them back to square one? I wonder what the limitations are. Why couldn't he just Spool them back to the palace when they started fighting? Or is the aspect usable like that only in this particular part of Keter? Regardless, I'm sure you can chalk this all up to 'stupid seer bullshit.'

The narrative hasn't yet abandoned the Woe (they're far too entertaining), and we see yet another example of the self-balancing scales: the Skein pulls out some nonsense, and Masego produces a brand-spanking-new Aspect out of Namespace to fight back. Nothing so blatant as a perfect counter to Spool, of course, because that fuckery is the provenance of Heroes only, but a weapon nonetheless.

And, while having Akua as a sort of 'magical collar Adjutant' is nice, I can't help but feel that Catherine is damning herself more and more with every inch of leeway she offers Diabolist - and in this chapter she gave her a goddamned country mile. (Cat deciding to take Akua's hand last chapter - even in spite of the circumstances - was definitely alarming.) She's setting a dangerous prescedent by allowing Akua to draw on Winter like she is in this chapter, and as we all know, Catherine is Winter and Winter is Catherine. Though, I suppose she really should have seen it coming when Cat made the decision to bind instead of destroying her. At the very least, if she was really keen on keeping Akua around, she should have blackboxed her /a la/ Voldy in Significant Digits.

Regardless, when it finally comes time for Cat to kill Akua as per her binding agreement with Viv - signed in spit, which is better than blood or ink - I'd be lying if I didn't say I would feel bad.
