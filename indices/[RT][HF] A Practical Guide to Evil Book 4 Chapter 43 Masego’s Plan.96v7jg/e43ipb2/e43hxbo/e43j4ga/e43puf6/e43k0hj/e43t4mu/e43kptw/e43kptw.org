  I glanced to the side, dragging the artefact further over the ledge, and froze when I saw myself standing near the gate, utterly furious. And again, in another shard, getting crushed by the Skein's clawed hands as he seized the wheels.

Between the choice of words, Skein's time resets being linked to his room and Aspect's triggering influencing its shape, I suspect Ruin breaks Creation in shards similar to what Masego saw in Arcadia, with Witness giving him the advantage in choosing who's interacting with what part. Whether or not the alternate realities are a consequence of each shard's course of events proceeding independently, Skein's Spool or Masego's covering of real Catherine's trajectory is to be determined.
