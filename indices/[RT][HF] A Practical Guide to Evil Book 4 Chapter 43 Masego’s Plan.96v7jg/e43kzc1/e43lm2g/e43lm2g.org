I dunno. I could see an argument being made for it actually being his style. Even Catherine had to take a mental moment to note that *Ruin* says worrisome things about Masego and where he's headed. He's always stated that he intends to vivisect Creation itself so that he can build a home that can't be taken away from him (or prevent the Gods fron dismissing Creation). I could see him leaving Creation ruined as he squeezes it for every secret he can, and then discard the tattered remains to make room for his own.
