Aspects are often a miniature story in themselves - 'Learn, Perfect, Transcend', 'Take, Break, Fall', 'Lead, Conquer, Destroy', etc.

So I expect the third of Hierophant's aspects to be something similar to 'Rebuild'. He /sees/ a miracle, he /takes it to pieces/, then /refashions/ it in his own image.
