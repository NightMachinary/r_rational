I think I found the White Knight, folks.

  "they have main characters with a similar approach to violence and morality, who go through a similar arc of losing themselves to power and reacting to that change in themselves"

What, that's not enough for you? I said /similarities/, not "It's an exact copy with the serial numbers filed off". What you listed is the /key/ similarity, but OK, sure, you want more?

Sufficiently powerful people, whether evil or "good", both flagrantly violate the rules but the latter expect everyone else to play by them, and get full off self-righteous fury when they don't. Especially at the main character, who is treated as some sort of madwoman or monster for daring to violate the oppressive status quo.

The main character starts with an objectively weak powerset, leveraging it through creativity and determination to defeat foes far above her 'power level' repeatedly and thus gaining more confidence, power, and prestige. Over time, she becomes something both far more and far less than human, accepting an increase in power at the sacrifice of her /self/ out of necessity in order to protect what she cares about.

Both struggle against a narrative imposed on them from godlike beings (literally Gods, in the case of Cat), seeking to escape an endless cycle that has consumed worlds, and in so doing have to find some way to break the cycle permanently or be destroyed in the process?

As for the powerset, tell me YOUR interpretation of how Spool works. :p
