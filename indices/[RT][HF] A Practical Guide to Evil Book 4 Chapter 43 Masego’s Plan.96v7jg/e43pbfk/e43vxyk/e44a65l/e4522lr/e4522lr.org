These sound less like PG copying from Worm and more like both works containing normal narrative structure and tropes. What makes PG specifically a copy of Worm as opposed to simply being a normal maturation story with a normal fantasy setting?

Worm gets credited and referenced a lot, probably in part because it's so long that there's very likely to be /something/ in there that can be seen as similar to whatever you want to compare it to. That doesn't mean that Worm was the source, or even the inspiration, for the similarity you are seeing.
