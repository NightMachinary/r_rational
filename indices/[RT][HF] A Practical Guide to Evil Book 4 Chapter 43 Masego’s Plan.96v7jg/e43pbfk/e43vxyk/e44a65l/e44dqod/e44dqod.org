There's the same basic arc there, thank you for explaining that so verbosely. That's a stupid reason, as you just pointed out, for saying it's the same thing with the serial numbers filed off. I think equating antagonists one-to-one falls under that. Hence, my original point: Saying "this is similar to Worm, therefore the powers are the same" is bullshit with no precedent in the story.
