This is a good point. I'm assuming that there are entads or magical means to readily discern lying or compel truth, and I'm sure Amaryllis would be worried about being forced to admit to having tampered with Joon's soul if she were to carry out such a plan. However, since memories are stored in the soul, and she now has the ability to tamper with her own soul through essentialism, she could conceivably take some time to locate and remove the memory of having done so. She could even write herself a note with some vague explanation relating the memory editing to some other justifiable self-modification, and then remove that memory, see the note and bluff herself into thinking that she's modified her own memory just as a test or something.
