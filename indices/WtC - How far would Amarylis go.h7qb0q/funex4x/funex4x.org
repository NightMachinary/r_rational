I feel like this is kind of in the same category as 'what if the DM adjusted his mind!'. Like, presumably anybody who does the mind control gig will adjust the value of 'do I mind if I get mind controlled' such that even if anyone finds out it'll be no big deal.

If the protag isn't original flavor Juniper, but is in fact DM flavored, or Mary flavored, or Bethel flavored or whatever else...I kind of don't care? Like, the updates since these hypothetical events haven't seemed worse, to me, than those before. So...I'm alright with it?
