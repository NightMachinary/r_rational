I don't give the idea of free will and conscious autonomy that much weight.

Our conscience experience is just the act of observing ourselves make decisions based on our values. Those values can shift (hormones, inebriation, persuasion) and it's still "us". Consciousness doesn't just flick off.

What I was imagining happen was that she tweaked his values for "doing the right thing" up by just one notch, that pushed him over the edge to acting on those feelings. It wouldn't be a different person, just a tweaked version of himself
