I'm basing it on d&d play. Players can role play through anything, and his character is just a character controled by a player.

If he is a player trapped in a VR then it is posible for VR to influence his brain slightly, but if VR completely takes over his character then hes not a player anymore.

Other than that, its possible for a person to increase intelect, its posible to override and overrite memory for a short while to make it seem he is controled for a short time. Its not posible to "alter soul database". Level of suspension of disbelief for for that is too high for this fenomenal story.
