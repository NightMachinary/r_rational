changes to the soul do take reinforcing to maintain - but what if it's a value the person had anyway, and that is being reinforced in non-magical ways? what if it's just a small tip at a balance point to help the person have a realization or thought that becomes self-reinforcing? it wouldn't require constant intervention if it's something he actually does want, but isn't acting on yet.
