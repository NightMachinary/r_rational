This has been discussed quite a few times. I personally feel that Amaryllis did not and would not do this simply because she understands narrative better than anyone on the team, and doing this would - by story rules - not only /absolutely/ result in an inevitable shocking reveal, but it also would happen at the worst possible time in a trust-shattering revelation that would end in disaster.
