I don't like arguing on a narrative level, but yes Amaryllis does think that way. That's just more reason why she wouldn't bother with even subtle modifications. A narrative hates secrets and from a narrative perspective the moment she transgresses it is destined to come out at the worst time. She has argued multiple times against secret keeping using this exact logic in the story.
