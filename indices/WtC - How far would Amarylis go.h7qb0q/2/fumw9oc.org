Juniper checks his soul and spirit a couple chapters later when he fights Harold and finds no changes. She definitely didn't meddle with his soul. Even from a purely utilitarian perspective this would be a terrible move anyway. If she actually was going to do this she should just make him a Fallatehr style slave as that would be more effective and unlikely to backfire.

Besides in this same scene she gets hit by the meme. She never had the opportunity anyway.
