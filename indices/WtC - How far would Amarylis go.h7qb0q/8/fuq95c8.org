Most compeling question here is if Juniper soul CAN be affected.

In d&d if your character gets mind controled he effectively gets and NPC status.

Any long term mind control on a character and a player stops playing it. So it is possible for DM to npc his character on short term mind control situation but any long term situation means he is NOT REAL. Just another database entry, nothing else.
