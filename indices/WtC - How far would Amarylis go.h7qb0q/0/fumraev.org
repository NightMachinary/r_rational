The theory that Amaryllis manipulated his soul there is as old as the chapter, and has been pretty extensively discussed. The fact that so many people seemingly independently have had the idea is, in fairness, a point in its favour.

There's much to say on the subject on whether she /would/ do it, given the opportunity. Equally important, however, is the question of whether she /could/ do it, and as it stands, the answer is no, because that's exactly the sort of thing the meme protects against, a fact which has been reinforced in later chapters.
