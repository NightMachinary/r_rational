I like that background, but I think what the show depicts is really malicious ignorance, much the same way we ignore that our society rests upon slave labour re:, just a few off the cuff examples, chocolate, cellphones (a la rare earths) and many basic manufactured items (via forced prison labor); the pampered citizens of the federation choose not to examine what is right in front of their faces

Evidence, all the chocolate companies had to roll back their slavery free pledges, and the people making that yuppie slavery free cellphone had to roll it back to a reduced slavery cellphone.
