As for Windows 9x... they absolutely could have predicted that fixed timing loops would screw them up in 1995, or even in 1985. Timing loop problems were notorious back in the early '80s when the PC/AT came out and broke a bunch of badly written software that assumed it would be running on a 4.77 MHz clock and broke at the 6/8 MHz clocks on the AT. That's what the turbo switch was for, to let you slow your computer down to 4.77 MHz to run broken games and even a few productivity programs.

Windows 9x was just an awful hack.
