I got the impression from /Encounter at Farpoint/ that the Enterprise holodeck was one of the first installations of the technology. It seemed new technology to basically everyone present, so it was not yet commonly known about in the federation as a whole, and it was designed for that installation.

And you're missing the point that the Federation technology was capable of accidentally creating self-aware AIs. The details of how they did that aren't the point, the point is that AI was so good it could happen without even trying... but the population as a whole was blithely unaware of it and considered Data exceptional only because he was walking around with his processor core.

By the time of Voyager they had hand-sized devices capable of running a human-equivalent AI /and/ using handwave force field technology to generate a virtual projected force field body. AND it was cheap enough to use for menial labor (cite: the episode where we see a bunch of "The Doctor" holograms working in some underground installation).

This is just a perfect setup for the AI revolution.
