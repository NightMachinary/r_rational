  look how often the limited AIs running the holodeck characters accidentally become self-aware
#+end_quote

I think the premise there was that the ship mainframe computers these holodeck sims were being run on had unprecedented amounts of resources (or, in Voyager's case, computer architecture components that greatly resemble neural architecture and allow for extremely space/time-efficient ML modelling), that even the Federation's holography researchers never had access to, let alone the holonovel writers; and so these ships' /deployments/ of holodeck software products ended up performing “in the field” in ways the original developers never foresaw.

An analogy would be how Microsoft never could have tested/predicted how Windows 95 would have run on CPUs 10x-100x faster than existed at the time; but then those CPUs /did/ exist (only a few years later!), [[https://www.zdnet.com/article/amd-discloses-k6-win95-glitch/][and made Windows crash]].

But rather than just “crashing”, it's as if the Enterprise shipped with a GPT-2-like neural base model for its holograms; and then, as a background task, the computer re-constructed the model (using its immense available training data set) into being GPT-3+.
