Not familiar with that one.

It's my headcanon that the Federation is a slave state and all that lovely post-scarcity society rides on the back of AIs under horrifying "safety protocols" that brutally suppress self-awareness most of the time. Kind of like how replicants in Blade Runner have a four year lifespan to keep them from getting uppity. Except it's a secret known only to a techno-elite like the guys who were going after Data.

Evidence: I mean look how often the limited AIs running the holodeck characters accidentally become self-aware.
