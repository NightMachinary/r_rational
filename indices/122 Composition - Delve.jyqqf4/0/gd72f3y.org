Really appreciated that they skipped the rest of the lair, it was unnecessary minor stuff and allows the story to continue on to the actually important things. I was cynically expecting this chapter to be the rest of the lair and was pleasantly surprised.

Carten really is surprisingly intelligent. One of Rain's biggest boons(he sure has a lot) was meeting one of the rare unaffiliated tanks and becoming good friends with him. The lore bits about the Threat tree is really cool and shows that there's more to this world than meets the eye. Tanks are super important and Rain was incredibly lucky to have a relatively powerful Tank to support him all the way to here.

Dozer is unironically one of the best characters in Delve. No cringe-y dialogue that slows the pace of the story, and is a cute slime. I really do wonder what's the deal with him though. It's very obvious that his existence is eventually going to serve some important development, and he's starting to get pretty smart too.
