I'm confused how the party for the blue is only 7 but for the core it's 8. Shouldn't it be the reverse? 8 mundanes could easily murder a tied up dog but I don't think 8 mundanes could safely get to the core even with the Dungeon at 0-1%. Remember that long cold stretch, I'd think Rain would need to play escort there.
