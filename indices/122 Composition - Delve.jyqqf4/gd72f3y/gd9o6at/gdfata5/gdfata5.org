I don't think that currently Carten is all that different from the dime-a-dozen 'dead-end' defenders. To date, he's been solely focused on upping survivability, just like the rest of them. His /future/ plans to branch out into Taunting would set him apart, but he hasn't started on those yet for lack of levels.
