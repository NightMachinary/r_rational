How about a trader of books and instruments comes through the town, for a festival. Eragon, also in town for the festival, meets him, and over a discussion we have Eragon learn about the ancient language (dudes really a front for the varden, and looking to acquire as many books of magic and such - - powerful objects, something to hoard before a war) and he is given a "starter kit" pamphlet/short book of the history of the Empire. The dude scribbles a couple phonetics of the ancient language aside their ancient language character, fire, water, force. He gives him a terse instruction on magic and a mantra/chant for meditations to focus himself. He charges Eragon's festival allowance for the book but the rest is on the house, so to speak, in hopes he works it out and comes to fight for the varden.

Obviously the dudes here to talk to brom (I'm a fan of having brom there from the beginning for a number of reasons) and convey the news that the egg is traveling and that he is their backup, as he is in a permanent location to send the egg to, so they can prepare part of the spell beforehand.

I have more ideas tbh.
