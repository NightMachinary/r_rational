Haven't read the chapter yet, but early feedback: I feel that "it's like [franchise], except rational" is kind of an unappealing description for a fanfic, especially on this subreddit where every story is supposed to be rational so you're not really distinguishing yourself much (except by, you know, not making a fanfic of Naruto or HP:MoR).

I would recommend describing the challenges the protagonists face or how scary the villain is, or how the ambient rationality changed the setting, or something other than "everyone is kind of smart". The generic Eragon title doesn't help.

EDIT: Okay, read the prologue. Random thoughts before I read chapter one:

The writing is okay. Not incredible, but kind of good.

The main problem I immediately have is that's it's completely indistinguishable from Eragon's original prologue. I read canon a long long time ago, so I don't remember the details very well, but it's kind of a problem that I have no idea what's the same as canon, and what's different. The setting is basically the same (Shadow hunting Elves with Urgals to steal the egg), the outcome is exactly the same, so the difference in execution feels cosmetic.

If you look at the beginning of "Animorphs: The Reckoning", which is probably the best-written "the same but everyone is rational" fic, the difference with canon is obvious from the second paragraph. In canon, the protagonists immediately trust Elfangor and listen to his story. In the Reckoning, they hesitate to trust a potentially hostile alien, they question its motives, they try to consider their options, etc. The difference in tone is obvious even if you haven't read the original for a long time. Here, as far as I can tell, it's the same except with more bear traps.

EDit: And, read chapter one.

The writing in this chapter is bad. Not horribly bad, but noticeably less fluid and more awkward than in the prologue, especially during the dialogues, which feel super stilted and unnatural. For instance: (please post on aoo too, by the way, copy-pasting from ff.net is a bitch)

#+begin_quote
  "Eragon," his uncle asked panting, "what are you doing here? What happened? We heard an explosion, what is all this burned grass around you? And where the heck have you been until now?!"
#+end_quote

This is not a realistic sentence. If I'm the uncle, and I haven't had news of my nephew for hours, and it's way past curfew and FUCK I heard an explosion and OHMYGODS he's here, and there's a strange glowing rock next to him... Well, first off, I'm probably way too excited and anxious to form four complete, coherent sentences in a row, and second, the first question I'm going to ask is "Are you alright?" Worrying about where Eragon has been and what is going on with the burned grass can wait. Jeod's only concern should be Eragon's safety.

Otherwise, there is way, way too much rationality-dropping in this chapter. It feels unnatural, and it lacks subtlety. For instance, Eragon's musing about how he doesn't like to lie about his (absence of) faith feels like the narrator is shaking my shoulder and saying "Look, he's rationality-driven and kinda-socially awkward, LIKE YOU!". I think the reason it feels so jarring is that the rationality is mostly told, not shown, and the only part where Eragon shows agency in his judgement in when considering the pirate thing, which...

Look, pirates are a big deal. Eragon should not think about them nearly so calmly, and Jeod should not be nearly so cool about the whole situation. Like, pirates. Killing your associates, destroying your business. If someone really is hiring them, then it's not a competitor's dick move, *it's a terrible crime*. Again, pirate activity is a big deal. If pirates target Jeod's business exclusively, people should have noticed, and notified the authorities, which are really really not found of people messing with trade routes. Jeod should be acting super super worried about the fact that someone is trying to take out his business, and ready to kill his associates in the process, which means *his life is probably in danger*. He should *not* be acting all business as usual, and he should *not* let Eragon wander off in the wilderness without protection.

The seriousness of it aside, Eragon solving the pirate puzzle feels kind of flat. First off, because it's not exactly a difficult one (if you're being attacked by pirates, but no one else is being attacked by pirates, it doesn't take a lot of acumen to deduce that the pirates are specifically targeting you); and second, because the solution is laid out at the same time as the problem, which makes it very apparent that it's a problem that was created by you, the author, and resolved by, well, you, in the same breath, which doesn't feel like an accomplishment at all.

Finally, regarding the egg scene... touching an object of an unknown nature less than ten seconds after it appeared in a mysterious flash of light, with no protection, magical skill or any knowledge of the situation strikes me as neither wise nor rational. The story seems to "assume" that both Eragon and Jeod+Brom immediately guess at its plot-relevant nature, instead of wondering what the hell is up with the rock that appeared with a flash of light, /then/ making guesses with the information at hand.
