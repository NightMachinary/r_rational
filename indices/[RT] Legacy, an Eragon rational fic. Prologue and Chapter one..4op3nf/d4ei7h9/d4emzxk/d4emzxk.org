Well, I guess I'll drop it here then, but thank you for the feedback anyway. I never supposed to be making a masterpiece, but in all honesty these many problems were not apparent to be as I was writing. I will comment os some points though, because I feel like they've been misinterpreted (my fault, no doubt)

#+begin_quote
  The generic Eragon title doesn't help.
#+end_quote

The title is just /Legacy/, I put the Eragon here because there was a previous thread in which I requested rational Eragon fics and raised the possibility of writing one, eventually, and got many requests, so it was just to signal to previous commenters.

#+begin_quote
  it's completely indistinguishable from Eragon's original prologue
#+end_quote

I understand how this might be unappealing. The concept was to progressively reveal setting differences and different motivations for the same stuff, but I guess it doesn't work.

#+begin_quote
  Look, he's rationality-driven and kinda-socially awkward, LIKE YOU!
#+end_quote

Strange that you say that, because I din't mean to make him socially awkward. I guess I failed...

#+begin_quote
  and Jeod should not be nearly so cool about the whole situation.
#+end_quote

Jeod knows it's not pirates.

#+begin_quote
  because the solution is laid out at the same time as the problem
#+end_quote

I guess in my rush to get to the real plot I wrote bad stuff.

#+begin_quote
  which means his life is probably in danger. He should not be acting all business as usual, and he should not let Eragon wander off in the wilderness without protection.
#+end_quote

Only he's not in danger in that way. I was thinking about my background though, and realized it didn't click at all.

#+begin_quote
  touching an object of an unknown nature less than ten seconds after it appeared in a mysterious flash of light, with no protection, magical skill or any knowledge of the situation strikes me as neither wise nor rational
#+end_quote

Considering that magic is extremely far from your everyday life in this setting, that Eragon is a teenager and that he supposed he knew what the rock was, can you blame him?

#+begin_quote
  Jeod+Brom immediately guess at its plot-relevant nature
#+end_quote

they do because they've seen that same egg already in the past, and are aware of the implications.

I'm not looking for excuses, but I imagine I still have to defend my unfortunate creation. Oh well, c'est la vie.
