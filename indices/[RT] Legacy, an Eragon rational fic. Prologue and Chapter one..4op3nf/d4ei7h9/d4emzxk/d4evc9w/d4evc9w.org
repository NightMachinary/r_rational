Just start writing the scenes you like to write. Don't waste your time and energy on the parts you find boring. Very often if you're bored by what you write, so will the readers. If you only write the parts you like, then it's very likely that the entire story can be done purely through such scenes.

I may not be explaining myself clearly enough but to use an example, Brian Pratt decided to write the [[https://www.amazon.com/Unsuspecting-Mage-Morcyth-Saga-Book-ebook/dp/B001A40H0I][Morcyth Saga]] in a way that he would only write the 'fun' parts first and then fill in all of the boring parts later. Once he finished the exciting parts, he looked back and realized that he didn't need to add anything more to the story. It worked well as it was.

Granted that this story is in the swords and sorcery genre so I don't know how well this might translate to other stories, but I will be surprised if this same technique doesn't help to some extent in other genres.
