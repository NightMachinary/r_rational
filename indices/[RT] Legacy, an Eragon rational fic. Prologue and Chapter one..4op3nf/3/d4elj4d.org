Yuck.

1. Prologue is a blatant rehash, nothing different occurs except the prose choice. Waste of time to read it.

2. Sending him to live with Angela triggers my Sue alarms.

3. Rehashing the canon conversation about frogs is anti-creative. You've got a quirky person who can say anything!

4. Figuring out that something fishy is going on with the shipping so quickly triggers more Sue alarms.

The part immediately following that, describing his reasoning process as he tries to diagnose the cause of the shipping problems, was slightly better. You should make almost all his realizations work like that. Paragraphs, multiple pieces of evidence, justifications, lines of thought abandoned as false or counterproductive, mistakes that get glossed over or ignored entirely. Not one sentence insights by author fiat. The average kid wouldn't know much about the shipping business. You need to establish that he knows about it and is interested in it. somehow, before you do anything with the topic.

You also need to provide motivation for the reader to continue reading, to care about the protagonist and their problems. I was bored the whole time because I already knew the puzzle and its answer from canon, and the analysis given was not interesting or original or insightful.
