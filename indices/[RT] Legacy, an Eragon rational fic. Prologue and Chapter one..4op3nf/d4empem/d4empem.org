To put a bit more constructive in our collective constructive criticism, a word about following the stations of the canon: don't. The original Eragon wasn't rational, so I would strongly advise against even paying lip service to its plot. The essence of drama is conflict, and there's no conflict in being handed magical powers on a silver platter. Wherever possible, make things harder for him than they were in canon; don't have the dragon hand herself over to him, put Brom halfway around the world, and so on.

I'd recommend starting with the magic system and going from there. Suppose he's always been fascinated by the Ancient Language. He learned his first word from a peddler (maybe make it "fire" for thematic reasons), and, since he only had the one, spent weeks experimenting with it, squeezing as much out of that one word as he could. Have him do that with /every/ word he gets, and you have an interesting protagonist who doesn't even need to be a dragon rider for the first 30,000 words.
