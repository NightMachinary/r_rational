If you are going to try it again, here is a few things about magic system.

Magic in Eragon is language-based, everything you say in a special language is a spell. I though it was good, until I attended a few liguistics lectures, and learned that natural languages are always, inherently not mono-defined (sorry, don't know proper english terms). Meaning that a huge amount of sentences can and will have two or more meanings, wrecking spell constructs. So you'll have to either bring in a healthy dose of intent-based magic, which will make it possible to outright lie in elvish with some training and quick wits and will ultimately make it possible to replace words with intent, or make elvish an artificial language designed to make commands - a programming language.
