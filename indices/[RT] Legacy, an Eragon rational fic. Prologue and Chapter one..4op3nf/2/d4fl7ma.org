Glad to see you taking feedback well, just to re-iterate the general point that you shouldn't be discouraged! Only way to get better is by writing more and having people tell you what you did well and what you did poorly. Otherwise writing (fanfics especially) is just an exercise in masturbation.

I do hope to one day read a great rational fic in the Eragon universe /magic system.
