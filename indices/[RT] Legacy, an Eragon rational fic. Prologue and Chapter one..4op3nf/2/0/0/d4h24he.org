Good thinking :)

And yeah, getting that amount of negative feed back probably hurt a lot. If it helps, I thought the prologue was okay, aside from its lack of originality, it read pretty well and it got its point across (evil creature, brutish minions, trying to capture the payload, everyone is competent and trained and prepared), so it's not like you need to throw /everything/ out and restart.

If you're interested in the advice of someone who has never written anything more than fanfic omakes and, well, amateur literary criticism, here's my two cents: you should probably try to concentrate on your number one quality/message/goal. As other people have already said, you're probably going to need a lot of experience before writing well comes easily to you, but as you pointed out, when trial and error is mostly people telling you your work sucks, accumulating this experience is no fun.

So you should concentrate on what you think is your biggest comparative advantage, be it a message you want to pass, a story you want to tell, something compelling enough to at least make up somewhat for the errors you make initially. Wildbow's early (mostly unpublished) stories were shitty to read because there was no compelling plot, no drive to see what happens next in the story. Early Worm is still badly written (or so I'm told), but the narrative about a bullied girl with no hope of being left alone going out in the streets to save people and escape her shitty life makes up for the work's weaknesses.

I'm not sure how you'd find or even define this compelling core, but it must be something other than "like X, except better". Making a rational fic can be a good premise in itself, but the rationality must be more than a theme or an aura the main character has, it must be something that shines through every character's action. Which is of course super hard because making a character /implicitly/ rational -the way alexanderwales does it, for instance- is way harder than saying "he is very smart", especially if you want to show the rationality in a way that doesn't feel heavy handed or like a re-hash of Methods of Rationality (and by harder, I mean I have no idea how to do it).
