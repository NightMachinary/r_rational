Honestly, I really got discouraged. I had no presumptions that my first fanfiction would be /magical/, but I hoped passable it would have been, at least.

But after taking it down, I'm thinking that maybe the bad reviews discouraged more than they should have, since my project was to learn to write with feedback, anyway.

New idea is to write it from scratch, a little more thoughtfully, and then post it again and see if there's a gem to be found in the guts of the previous concept. Even a modest one.
