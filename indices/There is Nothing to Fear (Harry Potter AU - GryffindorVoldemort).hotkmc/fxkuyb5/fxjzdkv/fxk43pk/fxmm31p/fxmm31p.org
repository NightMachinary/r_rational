I'm looking at how Having The Right Enemies also intersects with Other Faces and wondering whether you're going to make this story multilinear? It just occurred to me that AO3's system means it's possible to have several possible narrative threads each represented as a series, with particular works being the point of intersection. Anyway I'm up to the third work and I'm loving it so far!
