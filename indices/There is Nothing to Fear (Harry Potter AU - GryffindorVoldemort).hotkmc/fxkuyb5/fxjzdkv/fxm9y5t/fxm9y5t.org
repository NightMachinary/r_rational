I was enjoying this quite readily as I went on, until I got to Remus' segment, and holy shit, that is fucking excellent.

It's a fantastic premise, really. I was intrigued by your whole "riddle in other houses" shtick, so I went and read your ravenclaw story and Insurgere before hand, and I also enjoyed both of those. Until I got to this chapter, however, I didn't /really/ see why Gryffinidor!Tom is the one that you've decided to craft this whole universe for. Gryffindor is the house most primed to /do/ something, and a corruption of it's values is a... potent thing.

And what better way to highlight that than the story of the Marauders, for who is more Gryffindor?

" When the cards were down, Peter wasn't the only follower. They were all, in their own way, caught up in James' wake, and if Sirius and Remus hadn't held their own reasons for falling in with that crowd then they would have done it just to go where James was going.

Loyalty was a Hufflepuff virtue. Perhaps it was also a Gryffindor vice."

Goddamn.
