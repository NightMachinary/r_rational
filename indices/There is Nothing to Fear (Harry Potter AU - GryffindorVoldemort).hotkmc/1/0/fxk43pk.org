It lets people know whether a given episode or arc or what-have-you is complete, allows me to better define each unit of the story, gives me more flexibility (I can rearrange the order without any issues), and scales very easily.

I can't say that I've seen anyone write the sort of story that I'm writing and /not/ use the Series function the way that I am, though, so there's also a certain amount of "this is aesthetically pleasing to me."
