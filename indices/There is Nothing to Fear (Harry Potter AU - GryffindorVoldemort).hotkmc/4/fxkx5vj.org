It's an interesting concept and fun read so far. My main feedback would be that, for the dueling chapters, just giving the names of the spells and no descriptions of their effect, except occasionally through footnotes, leaves me often reading nonsense and unable to envision what's happening. A bit more description of the action would go a long way, as it's clear there's lots of thought behind what spells would be cast and their interactions.
