  My main feedback would be that, for the dueling chapters, just giving the names of the spells and no descriptions of their effect, except occasionally through footnotes, leaves me often reading nonsense and unable to envision what's happening.

100%.

I'm trying to handle spells more dynamically this time, but it'll be a few more updates before I can say for sure whether my current approach is an improvement. If it is, then I'm definitely going to rewrite the dueling chapters during my next hiatus (which won't be as long as the first hiatus, hopefully, but I've got a 10-20 chapter story coming down the pipeline and I want to make sure that it's outlined front and back before I release anything).

Thank you very much for your feedback!
