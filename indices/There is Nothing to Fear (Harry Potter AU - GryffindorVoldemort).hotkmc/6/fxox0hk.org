Finished up to the current chapters. This version of Riddle is frankly terrifying, and feels quite relevant to our current era. A villain who understands and can manipulate the political and social sphere and is using Gryffindor style radical activism to promote their own agenda is so much more scary than a brute terrorist. Really well constructed!
