Genin Days 6, then 7, then the next chapter that I'm writing at the minute, then Acceleration.

The narrative is not going to stay non-linear, it is simply the case that I had to add in a couple more chapters before finishing Acceleration, or it would fall flat. But if I do not put Genin Days 7 at the end now, then people who have the story on Follow will miss it and be confused when I reference events that they missed. So, in two days once they've presumably finished reading I'll re-arrange the chapters back into linear order.

Honestly it's a bit of a mess, but that seemed like the best way to do it.

Edit: for now I'll put a time stamp in, so that it makes more sense.
