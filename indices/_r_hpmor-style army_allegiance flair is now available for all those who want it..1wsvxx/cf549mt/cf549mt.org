Something Vinge-based would be good. He more-or-less invented serious transhumanist fiction.

Aggravatingly, he didn't name most of his factions, just his leaders. Hmm...

"Erythrina's Apprentice" / "Mailman's Lieutenant"

"Peace Authority" / "Tinker Alliance" / "Ndelante Ali"

"Woodcarverist" / "Flenserite" / "Vrimini Org" / "Alliance for Defense" / "Straumli Blight"

Anybody else have thoughts on this?
