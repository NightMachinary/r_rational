I'd be hesitant to use Royal Society (even though I really appreciated Quicksilver) on account of it being a real thing. But that's just me.

For the people who liked Anathem, here are some potential flairs to use:

- Concent of Saunt Muncoster
- Concent of Saunt Edhar
- Ringing Vale
- Concent of Saunt Rambalf
- Concent of Saunt Baritoe
- Procian
- Halikaarnian
- Rhetor
- Incanters
- Lorite

I wouldn't recommend these all being added to the default options. To its own idiosyncrasies (mostly the con-langs) Anathem provides a lot of stuff to identify with.

For the Snow Crash people:

- Cosa Nostra Pizza
- Mr. Lee Greater Hong Kong
- Neuro-linguistic Hacker
- Kourier
