There's some pretty good optimization in [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]], and it's another free thing you can read online.

I'll second the suggestions for Sanderson, although you should be aware that not all of his characters are optimizers, and that his prose is very direct.

If you don't mind a little self-promotion, there's some of what you're looking for in my own book, [[http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/][Forging Divinity]].

None of the characters are perfectly rational - each of them has one or more flaws that causes them to behave irrationally under certain circumstances - but they're all at least reasonably intelligent and pretty good at utilizing their own personal skill sets (better than most of Sanderson's characters, but not as optimal as someone like Milo who is aware he runs on game mechanics). There's a sample up on the Amazon page if you want to see if you like the style.
