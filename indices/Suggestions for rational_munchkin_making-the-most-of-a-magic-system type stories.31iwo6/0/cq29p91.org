I hate that people now think that that's what 'rational' means. Rational stories are not about munchkins breaking their systems, they're about a set of characters who all behave like real people and make rational decisions from their /own/ perspectives.

Your second word ('munchkin') is a /much/ better name for that class of stories. Stories in which one character actually thinks about the system and tries to figure things out, and the rest of the characters are essentially part of the backdrop onto which the protagonist can reflect the GLORY OF THEIR POWERFUL BRAIN make me feel ill.
