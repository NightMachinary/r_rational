Try [[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/][The Waves Arisen]] by Wertifloke. The pacing is really quick and some people complained about how Naruto is so meticulous with management of his chakra, but that's how scientific investigation works and seems to be what you're looking for. This isn't a spoiler, since this is revealed in the first chapter.

There's [[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/][Saga of Soul]] by Sun Tzu which starts with using the magic system to help advance science and very early on, [[#s][Soul learns to]]

[[http://qntm.org/ra][Ra]] has magic as an unholy fusion of particle physics, fluid dynamics, and bizarre programming languages. I don't want to say anymore because it would spoil things, but it's a very long read.
