Agreement to everything written above, with the additional comment that the fact that most of Sanderson's characters are somewhat irrational is only a good thing! There's really only so many ways you can do 'rational' characters, and Sanderson's writing is so prolific that it'd be dull if every single character was the same sort of perfectly self-controlled optimizer.
