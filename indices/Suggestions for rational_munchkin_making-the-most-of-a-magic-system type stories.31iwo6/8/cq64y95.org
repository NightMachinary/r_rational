Lots of books by Lawrence Watt-Evans in the Ethshar series have this. They aren't as over the top as some on here, but they definitely have some munchkin tendencies. I do find they're great relaxing reading with a theme along those lines. The nice thing is all the characters seem somewhat competent and intelligent and will exploit opportunities. "With a single spell" is a good starting book for the series. Pretty much "How to munchkinize a fireball: The Book."
