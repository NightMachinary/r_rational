Great chapter!

So Bulma and Goku did not go back to the castle, Mai attacked them instead. That makes Goku going along with the hostage thing a lot more plausible.

I am wondering what Pilaf and co are hoping to accomplish with the camera, given that if Bulma is planning some kind of double cross at this point they are too far away to stop it.
