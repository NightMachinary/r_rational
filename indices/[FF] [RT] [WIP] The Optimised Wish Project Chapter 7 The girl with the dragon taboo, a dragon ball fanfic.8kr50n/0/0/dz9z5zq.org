Well, to be fair, the original meeting between Goku and the Ox King was resolved in quite a similar way. A bit of a scuffle that ended when Ox King recognised Goku as Gohan's pupil (it was because of the Kintoun there). Original Dragon Ball was more about adventure and less about straight up fighting, especially early on, before the King Piccolo arc.
