/Starfish/, also by Peter Watts, is not exactly rationalist fiction but it does deal with rationalist themes. For instance, the "shut up and multiply" utilitarian approach to ethics and its consequences; the difficulty of getting a powerful optimizer to Do What You Mean, not what you literally said; and factions "defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values."
