A "munchkin" is someone who treats everything (or at least one thing they shouldn't by social convention) as an optimization problem.

â€‹

Its roots in tabletop RPGs refer to players who apply that attitude to the game. Often resulting in things like the "commoner railgun" from D&D that clearly make no sense, but obey the rules as written, or characters who are specialized beyond plausible levels (usually for combat).

In fiction it will usually mean finding novel McGuiver-esque uses for some system in the fiction (magic, economics, etc.).
