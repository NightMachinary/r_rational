Munchkinning as a verb has a more positive connotation than Munchkin as a noun.

People cite various origins for Munchkin. One of them is that it comes the 'munchkin', read as younger, players that joined the Tabletop Roleplaying hobby /after/ it had become such a big influence in videogames and brought with them a kind of feedback loop effect, applying videogame logic to the more narrative/social game, exploiting its more numerical systems. It's not the only origin but the idea is the same for all of them.

Munchkinning is now a looser, softer verb that refers to exploitation and optimization, but without the negative connotation of undermining the spirit of the game that munchkin would have, probably because it's not applied in those contexts any more (it has been replaced by powergaming and powergamer in the hobby's slang).
