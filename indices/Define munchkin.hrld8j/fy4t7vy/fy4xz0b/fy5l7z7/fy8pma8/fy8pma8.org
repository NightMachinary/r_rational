Online, people saying "Define <foo>." are almost /always/ engaged in semantic quibbling rather than trying to actually poll people's opinions on what the term <foo> means. The (based on lots of experience with internet arguments) assumption was that the OP already had a very specific, rhetorically-useful-to-them definition in mind and was going to start a series of tedious arguments with any top level commenters who supplied a contrary definition. Possibly to try to shape the community's conception of <foo>, but also possibly to use [[/r/rational]] as an faux-authoritative source to win some outside argument by attributing the rhetorically-preferred definition to us.

That assumption didn't pan out, despite OP's unfortunate choice of title. Once it became clear that OP was not using this thread to drag people into tedious arguments over semantics and that there was going to be actually good content to be had (again despite the unfortunate title), the downvote train reversed and now this thread has modestly positive upvotes.
