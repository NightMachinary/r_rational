Munchkin is the player that ignores story and roleplay for gameplay and mechanics.

I'm not sure if a character in a fictional world can be a munchkin, in my mind munchkinism is a meta property that means nothing in-universe.

If your character grinds dexterity and gold crafting candles 16h 7days a week for a year and then once he hits level 20 goes to kill the final boss - you're the munchkin, the character is just excentric :)
