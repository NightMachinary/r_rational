This is basically one of the secondary subjects that was popular on 2011-2014 Lesswrong. I have a hard time telling how well that has worked out, having not moved to Silicon Valley to become a programmer living in a group house with a dozen roommates. Everyone who talks about it from the inside sounds like they really like it, even though from where I'm sitting, it sounds super awful.

So far as min-maxing is concerned, I think of things like meal replacement/optimization, extreme frugality and budgeting, optimizing for income, having a diverse investment portfolio consisting primarily of Vanguard and getting into Bitcoin early, nootropics, carefully picking the optimal workout routine, etc.

When I think about how I would min-max, if it didn't feel like it was way too late a long time ago (so, if I woke up tomorrow to find myself somewhere between 1990 and 2012)... I'd probably still be hamstrung by ADAHD and crippling anxiety, but assuming I actually had enough AP to somehow obtain an AP recovery ability... I'd probably try to focus on doing the SV programmer thing for the shortest timeframe possible, then when I can afford to retire to the Ozarks, do so. I don't do this now because ... ... ... ... hey, look, a bee!

(Also "eat right" and exercise. There is the category of sociality, but I haven't the faintest idea how to go about improving that, never mind optimizing. That's probably the only path toward useful AP boosts, which is probably why this never actually happens when I do something resembling try.)
