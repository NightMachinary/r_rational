A munchkin is someone who min-maxes for some aspect (usually power) in a way that others have not (usually due to the "spirit of the game").

Classically, the munchkin took the "short" disadvantage in exchange for an advantage (better eyesight?), with the assumption that the GM would not punish them for being short often, but that the advantage would be useful in combat situations, as a +1 to hit with a crossbow or something. The idea is to take penalties in exchange for benefits, but to have the penalties be something that does not come up often (generally for narrative reasons) and the benefit be in terms of combat.

If your penalty is you need to eat twice as much, but your GM thinks that keeping track of food and hunger is boring, then that "disadvantage" doesn't matter.

Even outside of such exchanges, you might build a character who gets lots of powerful abilities that can be used once per rest, taking advantage of the fact that your GM rarely attacks player characters in their sleep. This means that for every fight, all of your once-per-day powers are available, so they never run out, whereas the players with many-times-per-day powers just seem weak.

Outside of TTRPGs, it might be taking advantage of a quirk in the rules system. For instance, let's say we have a system with health, mana, stamina. Spells use mana, skills use stamina. Now, you take a perk that turns your mana into health, another perk that lets you turn stamina into health, and a perk that let's you cast spells/skills using health. Call it a bloodmage or something. Then you use a perk that doubles your health pool. Ordinarily, not that big a deal, but for you, that means 6x a normal health pool. Munchkins often try to stack multipliers.

As to "canonical", what does that mean in this context? There is not an "author" writing the English language and deciding the meaning of words. They mean what we think they mean. Within the game community, munchkin's definition is understood, but there isn't an authority who defines gaming terms
