re: what "canonical" means... in the online writing community, especially fanfiction and litrpg, "munchkin" is often used to refer to characters who are like the munchkin players you describe - sometimes, in the case of litrpgs, quite literally. Except the rules being exploited are those laid out, explicitly or implicitly, in the canon material (the original work), in the case of fanfic, or in the work itself, for original works.

Few things in fiction make me roll my eyes harder than authors inventing rules, specifically for their character to exploit, then writing smug dialogue where their character pats themselves on the back for being so brilliant as to immediately figure out the exploit that literally nobody else in the history of that world had ever thought of. Often they squeeze in some meta-self-pats by having the character talk about how well-thought-out the rules are before effortlessly exploiting the hell out of them. That said, munchkiny characters can be done well - many call Taylor in Worm a munchkin, because of the creative ways she leverages her bug powers.
