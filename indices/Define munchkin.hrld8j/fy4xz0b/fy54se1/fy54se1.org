  Within the game community, munchkin's definition is understood, but there isn't an authority who defines gaming terms

I see at least 3 definitions of Munchkin. In plain English it means "child or short person", then there is the game community one which you gave, and then there is the way it is used in this subreddit, e.g. in the "Saturday Munchkinry Thread". I was looking for the last one.

I would also say that Naruto in "The Waves Arisen" by Wertifloke ([[https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/]]) is a munchkin.
