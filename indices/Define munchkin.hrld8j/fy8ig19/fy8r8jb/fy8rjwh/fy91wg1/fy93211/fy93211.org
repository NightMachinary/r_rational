Min-maxing is the character-building strategy of maximizing a specific desirable ability, skill, or other power of a character and minimizing everything else, seen as undesirable. The result is a character who is excessively powerful in one particular way (or few chosen ways), but exceedingly weak in others (which are assumed non-essential).
