I think that the ultimate goal would be omnipotence, but failing that, the most obvious goals would be empowerment, life extension, and enjoyment of life, with neither of these 3 goals preventing the others.

So in game terms IMHO the build to look for would be a tank with insane HP and resistances, perma-protected against negative mental buffs, and high enough in various ranks/guilds so that wealth and items purchase would be trivial.
