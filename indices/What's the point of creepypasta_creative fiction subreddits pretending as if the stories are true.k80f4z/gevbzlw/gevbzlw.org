Because humans don't naturally have separate concepts of "fictional" and "truth", the concept of "canon" is a fairly recent invention, and humans dont on a hardware level actually make a distinction between metaphorical and literal reality. All of these things are things that need to be /invented/ and /learned/, and the distinctions lapse if you don't pay attention or the context is even slightly ambiguous. Even questioning this only makes sense to a certain kind of highly trained mind.
