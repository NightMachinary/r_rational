I have always just assumed that it was an integral part of that specific sub-genre of horror. part of the enjoyment seems to come from the idea that, while you are reading, you can convince yourself that it is real. sort of like with professional wrestling: it isn't important if a fan knows or doesn't that it is fictional; the important part is that they can convince their brain that it is real for the duration of the performance. viewed from that perspective, it isn't really that surprising that some amount of people are actually unaware of the fictional nature of those subs.

you've got to remember that, for people who don't have a concrete grasp of the limitations of human memory, semi-magical things like an entire restaurant appearing or disappearing overnight do seem to occur. it's the same principle by which deliberate gaslighting works. you make a suggestions about the nature of reality, and people will reflexively search their memory for things which would make that statement true. it is pretty easy to match memory failure artifacts with a whole bunch of spooky or just plain magical happenings.
