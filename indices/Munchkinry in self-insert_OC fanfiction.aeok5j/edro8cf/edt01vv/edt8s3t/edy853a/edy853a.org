I'm afraid that right now there are no physical copies to be had. Could I suggest giving your friend the zip file that I link to from my Patreon? It's got all the original HTML, the cover, and more. They can read the files in any browser.

EDIT: The version on Patreon is the original one, not the de-IP'd version that's on Amazon. It shouldn't matter, but I figured I'd mention it.
