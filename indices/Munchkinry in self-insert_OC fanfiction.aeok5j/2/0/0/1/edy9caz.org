I always felt [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/life-ore-death-young-justice-crossover.489535/][Life Ore Death]] was the better of the Young Justice fics that did a good job of allowing other characters to be independent actors within their own personalities. Plus, I got a soft spot the Mistborn crossover elements.
