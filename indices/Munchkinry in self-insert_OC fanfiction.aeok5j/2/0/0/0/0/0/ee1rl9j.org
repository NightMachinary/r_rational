That's good to hear, but it's still lazy. It's not hard to hint at the existence of behind-the-scenes reasons so that the reader knows they are there but won't be explained until the time comes. Here's a trivial example, that could be seriously improved if I put more than two seconds thought in:

"Sir," I said, "why are you letting this stand?! Nabu refuses to let Mr Zatara take off the Helmet of Fate. That is kidnapping, forced confinement, and /slavery/. Mr Zatara is your friend; you can't possibly be okay with this."

The Bat-glare had broken plenty of criminals without Batman needing to lay a finger on them, and was arguably one of the reasons he was a leader in an organization comprised of superhumans. Ordinarily I wouldn't have dared be so accusatory, but right now I was buoyed up by outrage. And, strangely, the wattage on the glare was lower than usual. Lower than expected, too, given the nature of the conversation.

"The League polices its own," Batman said after a few seconds. "This is not an issue for the team."

"But, sir...!"

"No." The glare was back to full strength and the finality in his voice closed my mouth without me intending it. I couldn't match his gaze but every line of my body shouted rebellion and I was happy to let him read it.

"Paul," he said warningly. "Do not pursue this."

"Is that an order, sir? Because I am bound to obey your orders and faithfully serve the League for another two hundred and thirteen days." I forced myself to meet his eyes for the last words, making my intent clear.

Batman...hesitated? What???

"We have spoken to Nabu about the issue," he said at last. "For now, he is unpersuadable. The League /must/ not alienate someone of Doctor Fate's credentials at this time. We will continue to discuss the issue with him and try to find compromise. Until you are told otherwise, you are not to approach Fate about this issue, nor are you to make any attempt to remove the Helmet by force. Do you fully understand these orders?"

I forced myself not to react to the planet-sized loopholes that Batman had very clearly left open for me. Even here, in the privacy of the Hall, there could be watchers.

"Yes, sir," I said, forcing myself to sound resentful. "I understand and will comply."

"Good. Dismissed."
