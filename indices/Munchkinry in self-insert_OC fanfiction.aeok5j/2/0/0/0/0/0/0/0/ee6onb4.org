  But it may be unrealistic.

I have yet to find a scenario where I could not slip some hint of some kind into the first part of the story. It doesn't have to be in the first ten pages, but the first 20,000 words is not a big ask. If nothing else, just have the SI say to himself "Okay, I refuse to believe that everyone in the world is this stupid. Something must be going on, so let me ask around and see if I can get some hints." Boom, you've given nothing away but you've lampshaded the issue for the audience so that they know you aren't just being a bad writer. Problem solved.

If you don't like that idea, set a clock for fine minutes and actually try to come up with something that you do like. I suspect you will succeed.

As to not approaching Batman: Yes, I know. I did say "This could be substantially improved if I actually thought about it." As one trivial example, Diana (Wonder Woman) might be a better choice. She is something like a demigoddess of Truth. She generally does not lie and I'm not sure if she's supposed to be capable of it. Go to her and say, "Sir, [because Zoat insists on calling both men and women 'sir'] there is some information I feel that I really need, but it would be exceptionally bad if the wrong person heard that I was asking. If you are comfortable keeping this conversation a secret from absolutely everyone, including the League, then I would like to ask you some things. If you are not comfortable with it, I won't ask, and I hope you will trust me enough to not press me on the issue."

Or, if you still think that's still too risky, then spend five minutes thinking about how to get the info. Maybe recruit M'gann (strongest telepath around), and have her do memory surgery on a consenting interlocutor? Maybe call up Etrigan -- he's a very old demon and has information about the magical world, so he might well have info on Fate, but Fate is unlikely to voluntarily interact with a random demon.

The point is that Paul doesn't even try, he just snags John Constantine and goes off to invent a Fate-stopping ritual from now or less whole cloth.
