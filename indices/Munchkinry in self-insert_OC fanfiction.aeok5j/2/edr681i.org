I'm a big fan of With this Ring. The SI isn't content to just be the best lantern in the DC Comics universe he finds himself in, but is undertaking a technological and magic-based revolution to bring Earth up to the level of the other galactic empires.

And conquer death itself, for everyone, everywhere.

The author (Mr Zoat) is amazing as well. He puts out 1K words a day, every day, and has been doing it for years. It is crazy and awesome.
