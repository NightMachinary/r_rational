Those have been dropped lately. As for the dialogue thing, well, he's pretty responsive to reader feedback, so when a chapter legitimately confuses a bunch of people, there's a reasonable chance he can be persuaded to adjust it. And the new punctuation and invisitext are explained in the FAQ (FAQ rule #1: Don't talk about the FAQ; FAQ Rule #2: Don't read the FAQ). Yeah, invisitext can be annoying, especially on mobile, but for me, it also adds to the expressiveness of the story.

  All the bad/implausible/OOC decisions that (eg) the Justice League make in canon Young Justice are still there,

I think you've identified the root cause right here. Mr Zoat attempts to largely preserve canon. The only way that canon events are supposed to change is if his SI changes something.

But as [[/u/Flashbunny][u/Flashbunny]] mentioned, there is actually an in-story reason for the weird attitude to schizotech. It's just that the SI wasn't going to stumble across it in his first five minutes, or even his first year. As it is, it's been a year and a half in-story, which is still pretty fast for discovering something like that. Probably because he's been disrupting the status quo and thus gained the personal attention of the entity responsible.

  Then he finally did and got really interesting... Only for all of that character development to be thrown away and status quo restored.

I'm not sure what you're referring to here. He hasn't really been the same since his personal visit from Darkseid. How much of that is because of Darkseid, and how much is because he's trying to be a good father to Lynne, mentor to Sunset Shimmer, etc, is hard to say, but he's definitely softened from where he used to be.
