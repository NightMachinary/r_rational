  There are plenty of things that Paul could have done, none of which he did, and the one he did do seemed weirdly out of character.

If you're referring to what he did about Nabu, then I'd argue that it was /extremely/ in character for an Orange Lantern.

His initial approach to managing the orange light was to deliberately build relationships with his team mates with the goal of identifying them as his in-group, so that his brain would be able to use avarice on their behalf.

One of those team mates is Zatanna Zatara. He deliberately reached out to add her to the team because he /wanted/ her skills and involvement.

And then Nabu reached out and /took her father away from her/. Naturally, the SI took that rather personally.

"THESE PEOPLE ARE MINE! AND NO ONE TAKES WHAT IS MINE FROM ME!"
