But it may be unrealistic. A competent and powerful antagonist can't be expected to leave clues ([[http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html][Evil Overlord list]] #11). A force that has been able to invisibly influence billions of people over thousands of years will not necessarily be noticed in the first five minutes. Frankly, the fact that the protagonist has made such a discovery in just a year and a half is already pretty impressive.

Bear in mind that this is all written in first-person present tense. If the SI doesn't see something, the readers don't see it either. Which is great for immersion, not so great for the author to drop clues that only the readers will understand. Except, of course, in the accompanying discussion threads, which do indeed contain many answers and spoilers.

(Also, there are Watsonian reasons why the SI didn't approach Batman about dealing with Nabu, primarily his concern that Nabu would find out and retaliate.)
