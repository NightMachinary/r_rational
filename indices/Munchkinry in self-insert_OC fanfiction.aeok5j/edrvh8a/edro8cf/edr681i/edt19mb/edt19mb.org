I really enjoyed the start of WTR, but I eventually dropped it, for several reasons:

First, I couldn't stand Zoat's special snowflake writing style (capitalized species names, including "Ivy" and "Tiger"; no dialogue tags even if it made things confusing; random new punctuation; plot-significant text in invisitext; etc)

Second, the Renegade sections were infuriating. He was a smug, poorly-behaved Mary Sue who always succeeded at everything and never got called out on his bad behavior. Then he finally did and got really interesting... Only for all of that character development to be thrown away and status quo restored.

Finally, the story suffers from the normal problem of poorly-written ratfic: the protagonist is the only one allowed to be rational or munchinly. All the bad/implausible/OOC decisions that (eg) the Justice League make in canon Young Justice are still there, but Paul gets to ride in and save the day. No one commercialized schizotech before this, including Lex Luthor, who is canonically a billionaire genius inventor.

I absolutely grant, however, that the premise is fascinating and a lot of the story is very engaging.
