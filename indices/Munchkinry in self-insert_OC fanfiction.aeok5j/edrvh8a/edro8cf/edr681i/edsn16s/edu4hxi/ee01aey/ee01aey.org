Worth the candle has both of those things. The main character doesn't know all of the rules though, because they are based on a custom rule set designed by his local world alter ego.

IDK if you'd call the character's group a harem or not. It's kind of a deconstruction of the harem trope where everyone recognizes a bad dynamic, and most of them end up pairing up with different characters.
