  And then we got the Renegade story arc Stars, Crossed, part 1, which was one of the best story arcs in the entire series. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it was epic and awesome.

Yep, I remember that. He did a good job with it. It was, as you say, a great arc.

  I think that was a desire to not change the story universe much.

Sure. But when that's what you want, you've got a few options:

1. Write it as a parody
2. Add something that explains why people are being oblivious
3. Be a bad and/or lazy writer

Zoat chose option #3. He could have taken #2 -- maybe there's an alien threat hanging over humanity, where the galactic powers have identified Earth's schizotech and supers as a potential threat. There's multiple factions -- one wants to nuke the place from orbit because it's the only way to be sure. Another wants to ally with humans in order to systematize and industrialize all of it. Another feels that humanity is too young and violent a culture to be in control of such powers and wants to take it all away and put us into the civilization-level equivalent of Child Protective Services. Yet another has brokered a deal with all sides that keeps everything stable; for now, Earth is left alone to do its own thing as long as they don't develop their tech too quickly, leave the solar system, or communicate with other races. There is an actual group whose job it is to enforce the agreement; it consists of the Justice League, various intergovernmental bodies, and representatives from various alien species. They quash schizotech wherever they can and prevent it from going to market -- indeed, Wayne Enterprises has an entire department whose sole purpose is to buy up new companies or inventions that walk too close to the line of allowable tech, then sit on them. (Bonus: This nicely answers the question, "Where does [Batman] get all those wonderful toys?")

There. All the issues wrapped up in a way that can sit quietly in the background most of the time, and offers lots of new plot threads and an entire metaarc for when you want them. And it took me more time to type it up than to think of it; if I actually put some time in, I could probably find a better answer.

Zoat was lazy and WTR, although very engaging, is fundamentally poorly written.
