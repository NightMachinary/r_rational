  First, I couldn't stand Zoat's special snowflake writing style (capitalized species names, including "Ivy" and "Tiger"; no dialogue tags even if it made things confusing; random new punctuation; plot-significant text in invisitext; etc)

The god-speech is annoying (doubly so on mobile), but usually only when New Gods are around.

  Second, the Renegade sections were infuriating. He was a smug, poorly-behaved Mary Sue who always succeeded at everything and never got called out on his bad behavior. Then he finally did and got really interesting... Only for all of that character development to be thrown away and status quo restored.

I strongly disliked the Renegade sections, and though he was an asshole with no redeeming qualities.

And then we got the Renegade story arc [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/page-34#post-6150225][Stars, Crossed, part 1]], which was one of the best story arcs in the entire series. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it was epic and awesome.

And again, not to spoil anything, but later on (after the above), Renegade does get to experience some severe consequences for his previous actions and arrogance.

  Finally, the story suffers from the normal problem of poorly-written ratfic: the protagonist is the only one allowed to be rational or munchinly. All the bad/implausible/OOC decisions that (eg) the Justice League make in canon Young Justice are still there, but Paul gets to ride in and save the day. No one commercialized schizotech before this, including Lex Luthor, who is canonically a billionaire genius inventor.

I think that was a desire to not change the story universe much. The whole setting doesn't make much sense. They have had AI for decades, nanotechnology, genetic technology, unlimited power generation, etc., yet the world doesn't look much different than ours (baseline humans walking around, driving to work, and so on). There's definitely an adapt-or-die thing going on with the villians, and survivors like Lex are stepping up their game.
