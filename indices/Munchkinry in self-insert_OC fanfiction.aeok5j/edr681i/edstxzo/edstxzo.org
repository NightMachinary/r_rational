Plus all the versions of the character (although mostly the Renegade, from what I can see) don't put their faith purely in their power ring, but also stock up on holdouts. Not to mention their tendency to appropriate and replicate any schizo-technology they can lay their hands on - and in a DC continuity, that's a /lot/. And perhaps more interesting, their similar tendency to build and maintain personal networks amongst both the empowered and the mundane. That last one, possibly more than anything else, provides massive force-multiplication and autonomy for the SI's drive to uplift Earth.
