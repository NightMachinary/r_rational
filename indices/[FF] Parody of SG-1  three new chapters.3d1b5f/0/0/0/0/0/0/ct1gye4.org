I dunno, he still ignored the 'Shooting is /not/ too good for my enemies' rule.

And he put his torturey prison world right next to his main production world, and allowed there to ever be a way out of its gravity well at all.

Plus, he buys his own hype.

At least he did some R&D - the Roshna addicted merc with the zat-proof armor was working for him.

Still, wait until you meet Ba'al. Then you'll see the true Genre Savvy Go'auld. That won't be for a few more seasons however.
