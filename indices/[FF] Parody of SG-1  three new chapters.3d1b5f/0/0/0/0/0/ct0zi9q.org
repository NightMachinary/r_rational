Two parter, [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0709111/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl][Jolinar's Memories]] and [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0709184/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl][The Devil You Know]] Those are IMDB links that contain significant plot summaries/spoilers. If you like, you can [[http://watchseries.ag/episode/stargate_sg-1_s3_e12.html][watch the episodes]].

These are the best episodes I've seen yet. (I'm up to the start of Season 4.) Sokar is the only intelligent villain the show has had to date, and he is both smart and genre savvy.
