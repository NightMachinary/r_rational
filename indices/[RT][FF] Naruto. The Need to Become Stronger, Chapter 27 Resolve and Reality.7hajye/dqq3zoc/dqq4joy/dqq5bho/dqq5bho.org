Shikamaru is decent in single combat. Not great, and it's not his specialty, but his shadow is flexible enough and he's clever enough to make it work. He still shows his skills even if he loses. Medics don't, and controlling the battlefield is difficult when there is essentially no terrain to speak of, and only two contestants.

Basically, the tournament should be team vs team combat, because that's what ninja actually do as their job.

Presumably ranks mean /something/ when you aren't the main characters. Otherwise why would people risk death or severe injury for the chance of promotion?
