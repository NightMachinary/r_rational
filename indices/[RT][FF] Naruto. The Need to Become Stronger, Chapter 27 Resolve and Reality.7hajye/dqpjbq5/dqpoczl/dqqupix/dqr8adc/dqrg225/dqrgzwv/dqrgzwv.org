So you think that Kakashi or the other ninja of Konoha who follow similar belief systems would find it acceptable to harm a comrade and otherwise do anything to win on the grounds that victory will provide a promotion? Even beyond the specific ideology encompassed by the "Will of Fire" and the high level of focus on bonds I would expect that disrespecting the service of a high ranking veteran in order to gain a psychological advantage against a peer is exactly the type of behavior that would alienate other members of the military or the military community in general.

In real life how comfortable would you be working with someone who is willing to publicly humiliate a peer by using his personal information against him in order to achieve a promotion?

Competition between comrades is necessary but simple common sense dictates that it has to be limited in order to enable cooperation and efficiency. A civilization that makes regular use of child soldiers may not be considered particularly moral by the standards of modern society but that does not mean it does not possess its own code of behavior.
