Giving a lasting trauma by showing a mangled body of someone who she has a crush on compared to talking shit about a teacher.

Now in that world the first one is important lesson, as they are child soldiers and are going to see a lot of death, but that could come with a warning too, like saying you gotta brace yourself for seeing dead bodies and showing them then as a lesson. That would be a lot nicer.
