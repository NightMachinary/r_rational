I definitely did read the post. I'm not sure what points you mean, but I don't really see the relevance as I don't see Naruto doing anything wrong. Yes, Kakashi is their leader and a teacher and is probably allowed to whack them around and do a lot of things. The genjutsu thing was in my opinion a very not nice way to give that lesson, but it's from the canon and they of course wanted to show something else than her getting beat up too.

Konoha doesn't seem to be a samurai like honor society. I can't see how he did practically any harm with his little speech. It's not like everyone doesn't already think Gai is a weirdo and Lee clearly shows Naruto was wrong about the technique bit. Everyone who know anything also knows that Gai is world class fighter and knows all about his achievements and that he really deserves his rank. If some people in other nations don't know him and think less of him now, then he will be underestimated and it's just to his advantage.

Anyway, the rules are very broad and you are expected to use that space. If they wanted no psychological manipulation, they would have banned it before. That would of course extend to lot of genjutsu and other stuff and would make things harder for people who specialize in other things than fighting.

Naruto probably went overboard in the end, though I'm not sure if the fight would have ended without the knockout. He definitely got frustrated and got kinda played by Lee that way himself so maybe he doesn't have that big higher ground there.

So my argument is that Naruto did not behave in an inappropriate manner for Konoha Shinobi and Chunin with the mental manipulation. Being able to do that in a fight would be an asset. Konoha is also not a laalaa-land where everything is nice and rosy. They have torturers and seducers and mind-rapists and everything. Konoha is not "nice", it does what they think is necessary. Is their torture and interrogation force leader Morino Ibiki inappropriate?

It talks about Naruto's niceness, though that he apologized even before the end and all. This fic was in pause for a while and I've read so much other things so I can't talk about how nice Naruto is in the fic overall, only this act.

Naruto doesn't seem to be like in canon, though. Shounen guys are all about not listening to reason and acting like Lee here and naruto specifically seems to hate that. I expect he is gonna eat those words.
