In the canon Kakashi used genjutsu to make Sakura believe Sasuke was dead.

Anyway, it's not real world. I'm very much willing to believe that in this bloody ninja war it's ok to win by all means necessary. It's about the stakes, not just the promotion. If you lose, you might get whacked so bad you might not even be a ninja anymore. Like Lee in canon. People /die/ in this test.

Our simple common sense is different than what common sense would be for people living in a world with battle wizards.
