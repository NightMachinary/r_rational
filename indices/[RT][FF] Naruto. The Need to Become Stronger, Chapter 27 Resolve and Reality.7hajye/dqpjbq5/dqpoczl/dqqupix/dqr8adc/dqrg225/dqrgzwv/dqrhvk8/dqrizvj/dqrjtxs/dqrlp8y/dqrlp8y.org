I think that you should read the rest of my post. Even putting aside the question of comparative psychological trauma I have recognized some other significant distinctions between the behavior of Kakashi and Naruto.

I would also like to add that I do believe Lee falling for the psychological manipulations of Naruto is an argument against him becoming a Chunin. My primary argument is not that Lee is a superior Chunin candidate but rather that Naruto had behaved in an inappropriate manner for a Konohan Shinobi and prospective Chunin.
