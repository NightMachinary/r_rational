So if you are debating a fellow student in front of your school it would be okay to start insulting their parents and mocking them for their dyslexia? Would it okay for one soldier sparring with another in a exhibition match before their shared community and superior officers to mock the military career and service of his opponents mentor?

Lee is a ninja of Konoha and a comrade to Naruto. The fact that he is currently competing with Naruto does not change that. A certain minimum standard of behavior should always be maintained. The idea that anything is acceptable in the pursuit of victory is counter to the underpinnings of any civilized society but is particularly opposed to the ideology of Kakashi and his belief that "Those that would disregard their comrades so easily are even worse than trash. And those who don't have the decency to respect the memories of their comrades are the worst."
