YES! YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!

I've been following this fic for a while (maybe you remember some of my early comments), and the entire time my main gripe with it was that, even though the writing style, world-building, and characterisation was excellent, Naruto didn't feel smart enough to be the protagonist of a rational fic. Either he was being overshadowed by Sakura's keen analytical mind and epic memory, or Sasuke's own genius; to me, the Naruto shown earlier in this fic just didn't seem clever enough to be the protagonist, an honor that I thought Sakura deserved more.

But this chapter... man this chapter was awesome. It was like it took all my gripes about Naruto and shoved them back at me in a climax of tricks and tactics. You managed to take one of Naruto's core personality traits from the first series, his unpredictability, and make it rational. You've managed to justify why Naruto is the main character.

Sakura may be able to better analyze and dissect the techniques of her opponents, and Sasuke may be more skilled. But Naruto will do stuff that's new. Naruto will invent new techniques, or re-purpose old ones; Naruto will trick his opponents, not just beat them, and earn his name as Konoha's Number One Most Unpredictable Ninja through wit and guile. I like it. I like it a lot.

And even my critique about Naruto not seeming clever has been answered. Naruto is Naruto; his first instinct isn't to be tricky, or witty, but nice. Naruto wouldn't be Naruto if he wasn't always trying to be nice. And because of that people underestimate him. But here's he's shown that Good is Not Stupid, and I can't wait to see how the other characters react to what I think has definitely been the most straight-up in-universe demonstration of Naruo's intelligence since the fic began.

All in all, keep up the good work!
