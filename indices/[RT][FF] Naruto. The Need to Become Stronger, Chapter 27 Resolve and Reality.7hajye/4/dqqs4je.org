I really can't wait to see what justifications the author comes up with for why "Madara" doesn't just teleport in to Konoha (Like he did in the prologue), take Kakashi's eye and using said OP abilities to kidnap Naruto and the other Jinchuriki.

Edit:He could solve the plot in less than 10 minutes.

He already awakened his Mangekyo. He already has Hashirama's cells. As soon as he would take back the eye he would manifest his own Rinnegan. Then he doesn't need Pain or the Akatsuki at all.

Yeah, I really wanna see how you handle this one author.
