Hah, I do remember you eddyeko: It's actually very rewarding to read this from you. Even though, like I said in my other post, this chapter was actually one of the first ones I wrote! I've been working back from here, deliberately making Naruto /less/ awesome to fit with his age so he would have more room to grow. Seeing the reaction to this chapter, it seems like you're not the only one who's been waiting for this payoff. :)

(also to be clear: Since I wrote this stuff first, any instances of Naruto calling people idiots for thinking he's dumb are /not/ veiled references to you :p )
