woah that is actually a pretty concise and analytical character interpretation. I'm going to have to reread the fic and think about that some more.

Maybe my previous experience with Naruto has colored my view, making me assume things that aren't actually shown, but does Naruto not work hard in this fic? I read this chapter after having not looked at the fic during its long hiatus and, honestly, after having stopped reading it a while before that, so I may have forgotten. Is this Naruto just talented, rather than the hardworker he is in canon? I mean from this chapter and, what I can remember, this Naruto is always thinking about how to get ahead/thinking of new ideas for techniques or seals, and he seems pretty good at seals. Is he just talented at seals/techniques, or has he actually put in a serious amount of time studying? I do remember him going over to Sakura's for help studying way back in the first chapter, and thinking about how Haku could use his powers of teleportation for good back in Wave, but that's all.

But even so, I have to dispute that in this fic Naruto is not a good person. Maybe it's because it's one of the first scenes I really liked in this fic, but in the Wave Arc he was very, very upset about how he lived in a world where people could do things like teleport and raise massive stone walls instantly, and yet people only seemed to use those powers for killing rather than using them in the hundreds of mundane ways that could do a lot to improve the world. This Naruto still seems to have retained canon Naruto's innate desire for peace, so I would argue that he is still a good person.

And like he said in this chapter, he didn't actually believe anything he told Lee about his teammates, or Gai (he only really believed his spiel about accepting reality in order to overcome it; the one belief I think every rational protagonist has by default). He was just trying to goad Lee into doing something stupid.

And here lies what I think is the first true divergence of this Naruto from canon Naruto (except for the fact that this Naruto lives in a rational universe and so is smarter and was raised differently). This Naruto is still the same good person, with the same goals at heart (and I would argue still works hard; all of those tricks and new techniques and tactics don't come from nowhere; sitting down and thinking for an hour may not look as strenuous as doing push ups for the same amount of time, but it's still hard work), but has started to give up on being nice, and just started focusing on winning. And we can see this in the chapter. Naruto watched a bunch of fights were the blatant unfairness of what was going on made him feel ill and angry; even protesting about how such fights could be a valid demonstration of skill. And then proceeded to fight Lee in the most unfair way possible, by hiding underground and totally removing Lee's skill from the equation, all in order to win.

So while I would argue that Naruto at this point is still a good person, but I do agree that your ideas have a lot of merit. The way this is going, and the way this fic is progressing, could eventually lead to Naruto not being a good person. He's a clever kid with big dreams who wants to become stronger, likes inventing new techniques, and wants recognition; this is the first fic (except for Like Me) that could actually sell Naruto as the next Orichimaru and have me genuinely believe it. He's willing to humilate Lee (even I still believe he didn't truly believe what he was sayig) just to win a Chunnin Exam preliminary fight; already he's starting to slip away from Canon Naruto's morals. What he'd be willing to rationalize himself into doing in a real fight, with real stakes (like in the Invasion, if that happens in this fic), could be a big turning point in his character.

So essentially, I disagree with Naruto not being hardworking and not being a good person, but do think that with the way he's behaving he could quickly become a sort of Orochimaru-esque anti-hero obsessed with The Need to Become Stronger.
