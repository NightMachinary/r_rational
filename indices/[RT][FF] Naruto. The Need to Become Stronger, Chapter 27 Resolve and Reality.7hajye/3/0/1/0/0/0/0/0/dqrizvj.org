I would consider the example of Kakashi using genjutsu on Sakura to be more acceptable as it is both a lesser form of taking advantage of psychological weaknesses, was administered by a superior officer as part of a test, and was not in a public setting. Kakashi may have slightly harmed Sakura but he was operating within his capacity as her teacher with her best interests and the interests of Konoha in mind rather than his self benefit. This seems like a relatively clear case of necessary harm delivered by a legitimate authority figure as part of a training exercise.

On the other hand I do admit that you may have a point regarding the differing standards of behavior in our society and the more intrinsically violent Konoha. I still think that Naruto went way overboard particularly in regard to his comments about Guy and his lacking significant accomplishments. While the "bloody" nature of ninja war may allow for a greater degree of harm in competition between comrades that same nature should lead to high ranking veterans and their accomplishments to be held in higher esteem. Even the people willing to accept a Konoha ninja taking advantage of his comrade's psychological weakness to achieve victory and pursue promotion would probably be highly offended by the manner in which the career of a high ranking veteran was disrespected.

I would also like to use the Neji vs Hinata fight as an example from canon that demonstrates that taking advantage of psychological weakness to crush the will of your opponent or otherwise humiliate them publicly can lead to public outrage. In this particular fight Naruto can be considered a stand-in for Canon!Neji while Lee replaces Canon!Hinata. It will be interesting to see if someone replaces Canon! Naruto and tries to take revenge for the mistreatment of Lee.
