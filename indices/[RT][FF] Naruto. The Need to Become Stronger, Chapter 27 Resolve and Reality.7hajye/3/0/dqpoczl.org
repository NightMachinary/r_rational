I agree with your main points regarding the demonstration of Naruto's intelligence but I am not sure what you are talking about regarding him showing "Good is not Stupid". This seemed more like an overpowered prodigy using the darkest elements of manipulation against a comrade to secure victory in a conflict that is ultimately insignificant.

The willingness of Naruto to mock the accomplishments of a respected Jounin and the hard work of a peer in order to prove some kind of point seems more like an indicator that Naruto is not a good person rather than that he is an intelligent good person who is not nice.

I think that Naruto's drive to humiliate and crush the drive of Lee in this fanfic is a mirror of his drive to support Lee and defeat Neji in Canon. In Canon Naruto supported Lee and opposed the determinism of Neji as he considered himself to be similar to Lee in that he was a hard working underdog who was competing with prodigies. In this Fanfic the exact opposite is true as Naruto considers himself to be a unrecognized Genius and is offended by the fact that his peers who work harder than him are held in higher esteem. This seems most demonstrated in the Naruto-Sasuke dynamic but I believe hints of it are seen throughout the fanfic.

Naruto's behavior to me in this fight seems less like a desire to educate and more an expression of his inner demons. His disrespect for his peer and superior are ultimately driven by desire to be recognized as special due to his position of a unique intelligence and perspective directly conflicts with Lee's strident support for the power of hard work.
