You are assuming a Naruto - verse social institution is in some way fit for purpose. This is not a well founded assumption. When time-braid had the fanon that the entire planet had been fucked with by the forces of hell, that made all the sense. Canon - and most fanfic, describe a world in which just about every single thing that has some extra sucky local equilibrium it can get stuck in, is in that extra sucky place.
