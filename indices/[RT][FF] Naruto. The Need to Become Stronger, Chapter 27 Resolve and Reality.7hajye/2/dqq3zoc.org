Support ninja kind of get shafted by the tournament fighting setup, don't they? Sakura, for example, is a medic, who can also use some water jutsu and genjutsu if she's forced to fight, along with basic throwing weapons and such. On a team with Sasuke and Naruto, she's a fantastic asset, as she can act as a force multiplier by healing and using general battlefield control. Similarly with Ino and her clan jutsu. But in a one on one fight, a majority of their skills are either useless or nearly so. Sakura vs Sasuke or Lee is a joke, even when Sakura has a skill set much more suited to what ninja do as their role. Any medic that is even more specialized for support is even more screwed, because the tournament style test makes their abilities irrelevant.

It's not really as relevant, but Temari is kind of the same. Her ability to control a battlefield is insane, she can deflect any number of brown weapons, and she generally forces every ninja that isn't allied with her in a large fight to keep what she can do in mind. That she is rather specialized is mostly irrelevant because Kankuro can have puppets to defend her while she forces enemies to get behind cover. She lost against Shikamaru in canon because one on one is a terrible use for her skill set.

Also, what is up with team Guy? You have 2 melee specialists, and instead of rounding that out with a medic or ninjutsu specialist, they throw in the most limited range specialist available? If any of them gets injured on a mission, they're just /fucked/. Similarly if they have to fight someone like Temari or Gaara who focus on aoe ninjutsu, as seen by Lee vs Gaara. They're overspecialized, extremely so.
