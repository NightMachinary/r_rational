There's an enormous difference between breaking down a hastily constructed (hollow) fortification, and punching straight down through solid rock or even just regular earth. With a wrecking ball you can easily smash down a building, but it's 100% useless when it comes to digging into the ground. For that you need a drill, as otherwise you just spread your force out over the entire surface of the ground.
