I'm starting to get back on track, huzah!

+This is actually one of those chapters that I wrote ages ago, I think even before chapters 1-5, but which I edited over a dozen times. You can still tell the style is more anime-esque though, with countless perspective-jumps, even after I deleted several segments. Sometimes I think it would have been better to just throw out these old chapters and write them again from scratch, as I'm worried that they feel too chaotic and disjointed right now in a way I can't easily fix.+

NEVERMIND I CLEARLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LIKE. I'LL JUST SHUT UP NOW.
