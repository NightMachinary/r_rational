/Disagree?/

Who said we disagreed?

/Bickering is a comedy routine, you know./

We're still two aspects of the same exact person.

/That person had a problem: life often hurts, and that seemed to be pretty normal./

The actual childhood traumas didn't help form lasting emotional stability either.

/Some kind of actual response was needed. And no, splitting into two or three pseudo-different people isn't the response. Treating us as separate came well into adulthood./

The response was: waaaaaaaagh. If the world hits you, hit it right fucking back.

/Of course, people expect children to be docile and obedient, and adults more so, so that was 15 years of counterproductive./

Ten. Ten years of counterproductive.

/No, 15. Ten to actually be showing an outer personality composed mostly of chip-on-the-damned-shoulder, and five more to repair the after-effects on your life. Actually, more like 18. You didn't develop anything like me until into your 20s./

Typical self-serving pseudo-measurements.

/Typical psychotic adolescent-persona wanting to remain psychotic his whole damned life. We don't disagree that much because fundamentally, the quiet little voice from the last post is the real us, and you're the somewhat crazy casual youth who presents himself in casual social contexts, and I'm the well-spoken but able-to-keep-my-mouth-shut mature adult who we have to act like in Real Life./

Actually, you know, I've toned myself down a lot over the years. I can usually get through Real Life pretty well without you.

/You still use me for long-term planning./

Fair enough. But of course, if we really want a laugh at you, I should just tell everyone what you look like.

/But that doesn't accomplish anything useful for us. So you won't./

Ok, but no more we-pretend-to-hate-each-other comedy routine.

/Fair enough. I do all the Mature Adult things you, and the core real-us, finds utterly alienating. Like lying, or lying by pretending to consider inevitability a real thing, or nodding along when all the other Mature Adults in the room have decided it's time to contemplate the inevitability of pain, misery, and death./

Yeah. You show and tell the world what it expects to see and hear from someone of our station, and I work up the guts and spirit to make what you said a lie. I also supply the raw chutzpah to move forward in life.

/While I hide away and keep safe a lot of our softer side that motivates us in the first place./

That's remarkably un-adult of you.

/Well, I also decide when to show that stuff. Adults don't pander to adolescent preconceptions of absolute confidence or lack of emotion. That would be robots. Also douchebros./

And we're both responsible for keeping standards up. I was pretty proud of you for being appalled at those few remarks Nate and Jessica were offhandedly making. You know, about how we'd only need to destroy one or two human souls to activate and direct the thing we've mentally labelled a Super Spiral Engine.

/Well, when you spend half your time getting ranted-at about Spiral Power and your whole motivation is to make the best life you can conceive instead of the one the world tells you is feasible, you learn to ask for a physical law before accepting someone else's idea of a necessary trade-off./

Particularly when what's being traded-off is people.

/Damn right! Those are our people! No taking them, and no wasting them!/

Though we really should have formulated that idea better before tossing it out to those two.

/How was I supposed to know they'd chomp down a bullet we'd consider Truly Evil?/

Because unfortunately, other people continually and constantly keep trying to bite bullets about real things and people we care about - that they ostensibly care about - while nom-nom-noming bullets about Truths of This Universe that always add up to "SPIRAL BAD." And Platonism. I don't get everyone else's fascination with Platonism.

/Like that time our roommate said "Instrumentality did nothing wrong"?/

Yeah, like that, which we thought of because we've got /Cruel Angel's Thesis/ playing on YouTube.

/WHY DID HE DO THAT!?/

Ignorance. Also Buddhism. Also, the fact that what we consider the True Way Through Life has never been systematized as a religion instead of a giant-mecha anime, so it gets no respect.

/Also, people just luuuurves their grimdark. I'm fairly sure I could make a real religion out of Warhammer 40k if I was actually trying, just because it accords well with people's sense that everything must always be terrible./

Actually, that's just a pretension of irritating Western intelligentsia.

/True. Mizrahit singers don't think that at all. They're much more sensible./

Wow, the Mature Adult just said Mizrahit singers are sensible.

/I'm not precisely the mature adult here. We have to combine for that./

DID SOMEONE SAY GATTAI!?

/No. But you know... oh dear me, I actually used the word "combine" that way. We're bleeding into each-other./

We're the same person, so /duh/.
