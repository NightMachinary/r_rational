*"Wow. Relay most of that back to me in small words."*

"Well, you see....wait. Shut up. You understood exactly as much as I did."

*"Did I, though?"*

"Yes. It's part of the package in being not crazy enough to have completely dissociative identities."

*"Hmm...Maybe I should look into it. Being intertwined with you can get annoying."*

"YOU'RE ANNOYED?! HOW THE ACTUAL FUCK DO YOU THINK I FEEL AB....No. I refuse to take the bait. Plus there's no way in the seven hells I'd let you run around so unfettered."

*"Oh boo hoo, why not? It's not like I'm really going anywhere..."*

"There's not a comment box large enough for that list of 'why nots' I have for the idea of you being free."

*"Whatever. Let's get back to making fun of the fairy adult and his whimsical hanger on."*

"Really. You're calling the main persona the hanger on?"

*"Yes. As most of you main personas tend to be."*

"...I really just walked into that one."

*"Idiotic forebrain says what?"*

"Fuck off is what he says."

*"Not to be technical but...you DID say what. I never said what had to be the only word you said. So I win."*

"Yes, you win. Congratulations. Now get back inside my head."

*"Oh, how rich. Telling me to get back inside the place I'm always in. Go back to Earth, hippie. And I didn't mean residing on the planet, I meant inside the actual earth."*

"Are you saying you want me to go die?"

*"I'm sorry, was I too vague? Fine. Go die. There, short and sweet."*

"If I die, we both go. Where's your self preservation instinct?"

*"It's trumped by the utility function I have that's geared towards wanting you to suffer, especially at my hand. With a sidenote of snarky amusement, to make the days shorter. Plus you're not going to actually do it, so I'm hoping that the very fact that a part of yourself is literally WILLING your death will make you suffer all the more."*

"If that's the case, then wasn't explaining that counter intuitive? Now it's clearly just a tactic."

*"Oh no. The feeling is quite real. Go ahead. Check."*

"....I don't wanna..."

*"Ha. Check mate.*
