As a villain/hero, some sort of really trippy psychadelic sounds like a really good idea here. If you aren't aware enough of what's going on to notice when someone brandishes a gun in your face, you can't be shot. The only difficulty becomes figuring out how to actually do things while on the trip (presumably some combination of muscle memory and hypnosis/suggestion).
