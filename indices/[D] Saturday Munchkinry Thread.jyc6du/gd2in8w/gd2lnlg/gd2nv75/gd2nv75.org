The moment you're aware that someone is aiming a gun at you (with the intention of shooting), you become vulnerable to gunshots from that particular weapon.

Closing your eyes to fight won't work either because you'll be expecting to get hit.

Drugs won't work unless you have a basic idea of how they'll affect your body. So the anesthesia won't affect you unless you know it's anesthesia.
