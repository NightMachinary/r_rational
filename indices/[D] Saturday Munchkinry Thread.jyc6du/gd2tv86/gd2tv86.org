You are a Tolkienesque Elf (as expanded upon by Lintamande: list of abilities [[https://lintamande.tumblr.com/post/104138086138/canonical-supernatural-abilities-of-tolkiens][here]], Some Glowfic that is a bit more readable as a story than standard Glowfic [[https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18][here]] with further interpolations)

To summarize your abilities:

- You can mind read thoughts of people they aren't trying to keep private. Among humans unaware of Elves, most leave most of their thoughts unconcealed.
- You can telepathically communicate on the order of hundred of meters, on the order of kilometers for those you are intimately familiar with.
- You have supernatural control of your body.
- Your hearing is supernaturally keen. With enough practice and the right lore, you can learn to hear abstract/immaterial things.
- Your eyesight is supernaturally keen (able to make out hair color and count individual people from tens of miles). With concentration you can see (with lower acuity) near infared and ultraviolet.
- With technical skill, artistic effort, and willpower, songs can perform magical functions. Common ones include minor healing, minor illusions, minor and subtle local manipulation of weather, and subtle mental effects (morale, motivation). Rare/difficult effects include major illusions, tearing down or constructing buildings, major manipulation of local weather, minor manipulation of regional weather, and major healing. Basic common songs might require years to decades (depending on artistic skill) to compose right and require skill and a few minutes to adjust to a given situation. Rare/difficult songs might require immense artistic skill and decades to compose and require hours to adjust to a situation or complete artistic mastery and minutes to adjust. Recording don't work well as the cannot be easily dynamically adjusted.
- If you are very in touch with nature you might develop the ability to talk with animals and plants. This ability can be also be learned on a per animal from others that have it. This ability gradually increases the ability to communicate and articulate themselves on animals it is used on. This can also be bootstrapped into sapient/sentient talking animals with generations of selective breeding and a existing intelligent species.
- Items you craft that you put artistic effort and technical skill into can perform their functions supernaturally well: a camouflage cloak that actively adjusts its camouflage, bread that is tasty and filling, a clasp that holds tightly until you need it to come undone and then it comes undone easily, a rope that practically tie and unties itself with a touch, etc.
- Iterating on improving your technical skill and lore with making and using these items over decades or centuries can push their function up to the outright supernatural: the cloak can grant outright invisibility if you are still, the bread is as filling and nutritious as a full meal with a single granola bar sized portion, the rope can move on its own
- Among the established crafts: Ring Lore can make rings of invisibility, rings of luck, rings that glow, rings that grant enhanced telepathic communication (10 to 100 times longer range). However rings on the power level of the 3 or the 9 might take decades to centuries of research, immense willpower/focus, thousands of hours to actually cast the enchantments, and might permanently spend a portion of your strength/willpower leaving your weakened after.

Weaknesses:

- Long term exposure to ugly environments as the same mental effects on you as a severe case of seasonal effective disorder in humans. Imprisonment in an ugly environment for a few years might outright kill you. Generally, nature is beautiful and most human cities are a bit too ugly. New Jersey might outright kill you over a few decades. Aesthetics can vary or be learned, giving you a bit of leeway if yo can learn to appreciate an otherwise too ugly environment.
- You can die of grief/lack of motivation.
- Although control over your body means in the short term (over several months, up to a year) you can get by with less food than humans, over the long term you might need 1.5x to 3x the calories, protein, and nutrients (depending on how heavily our exert yourself).
- Giving your word can have a direct supernatural effect, giving you bad luck, lack of motivation, and weakened supernatural abilities if you break it. Swearing an Oath to God can literally compel you and severely weaken your motivation and abilities if you try to break it (and if God finds the Oath offensive, cause fate to work against you even if you do try to fulfill).

Some scenarios to Optimize for:

- You have just established yourself in Beleriand. Morgoth's Orcs have been pushed back, and his Balrogs are dangerous but limited in numbers. You have several centuries before he breeds more powerful monsters. Morgoth is basically a demigod, especially in his fortress.
- Sauron has just been defeated by Isildur, but your abilities are destined to gradually fade with each passing century. Your existence itself will gradually fade with the passing millennia.
- You have been released in Canada, 1534. Almost all the other Elves are in Valinor, a separate pocket dimension. You have reason to believe your abilities will gradually fade over the passing centuries.
- You are a modern human and spontaneously gain the above abilities and weaknesses.
