You are an average normal person in the real world. *How would you go about becoming a masked vigilante low-level superhero?*

*Some rules:*

1.you need to become a true masked hero, like the ones in comic books. You must achieve the objectives of superheorism via traditionally superheroic efforts, not trough using your options otherwise, even if it would be more rational or ethical.

1. Your goal is to become a classic superhero: someone who utilizes gadgets and his own athleticism to defeat criminals in combat, and hopefully bring them to justice. Gadgets, gizmos and martial arts are allowed, guns are not allowed, and explosives must be used non-lethally against humans.

2. You have a weak 'NO KILLING" rule: you should only kill a criminal if there is no other option, and if abstaining from killing them would immediately cause the death of at least 1 innocent person.

3. You must maintain a secret identity. You are allowed to disclose your identity to max 3 people: one of your loved ones, one government official/cop, and one assistant.

4. You must consciously conform to stereotypical superhero tropes if possible. You are only allowed to break the tropes if it would put some innocent person in direct danger, if it would be 100% suicidal, or if it would be physically impossible to perform the trope in real life.

5. You must have a gimmick or a theme. Witty one-liners are optional but encouraged.

6. You must perform in a way, that if your adventures were later televised, they would make an entertaining show. Being rational is allowed, being boringly practical means failure.

For the sake of the argument, Average Person here is a healthy but not overly fit Middle Class person, 30 years old, with pretty non-descriptive/forgettable face, $11,700 in savings , small suburban house with a tiny windowless garage, and no people dependent on you. No spouse or kids, no house-mates. Assume your martial arts skills start as that of someone who took some casual Jiujitsu lessons in college, your technical skills are of someone who can fix simple things around the house and car.

You are also as strongly motivated to become a vigilante (within stated rules) as possible for a mentally functional person.

You live in an average sized American city with average crime rate. No super-villain exist, but there is about a dozen of hardened criminals who would not hesitate to take a life, and about 500 casual thugs who could dish out violence, but are not bad enough to be on FBI lists. Atop of that, lets say 2000 people who break the law, but are not career criminals. The Police are neither particularly straight or crooked, /might/ look the other way when they catch you superheroing, but only if you keep it clean and nice (more friendly neighborhood Superheroman, less Frank Castle).
