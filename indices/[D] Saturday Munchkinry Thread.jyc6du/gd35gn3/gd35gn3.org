I was thinking about dropping Pact/Pale Practitioners into a Fantasy setting and it occurred to me that they might end up as Lord/Ladies/Kings/Queens in a Feudal system.

How would you optimize a Pact/Pale style of Oath that a ruler takes to ensure they are a good ruler? These Oaths can be broken, but it instantly and permanently takes away the Practitioner's powers and leaves them vulnerable. Even just pushing the line against the letter vs. spirit of the law might be bad karma: draining the practitioner's power and giving them bad luck. As a ruler of a country, this could be disastrous, with the Practitioner-Ruler's bad karma adversely effecting the entire country as a Fisher-King effect. This might discourage people within the country from gainsaying their Ruler or present a vulnerability that enemies might try to exploit by gainsaying or forswearing the Practitioner-Ruler or finding loopholes catch clauses to ensnare the Ruler

Thus the Oaths need to have carefully constructed conditions, escape clauses, and penalty clauses to avoid dragging the country down if the Practitioner-Ruler does break or bend them while still enforcing the ideals of a good ruler in a useful way.

Ideas for Oaths?
