Watched [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3118452/][Circle]] last night on the basis of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/jv88dx/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/gci3r1r/][the Monday Recommendation]] and am curious as to what people here would do in such a scenario to 1) maximize their own chances of survival, 2) maximize the satisfaction of their own values, and 3) maximize humanities chances of survival, given foreknowledge of plausible interpretations of the final scene, i.e. a 98% culling of humanity. What strategies would you use to sway the crowd to your desires? Assuming similar but not identical crowd composition as that seen in the movie.

I think I would personally, 1) try to identify the appropriate series of nested majorities / pluralities to which I belong, and try to form voting coalitions along those blocks, progressively whittling down the crowd while not annoying enough minority blocks before capturing the majority (I think the latter is where most misstepped in the movie -- they appealed to majority inclinations, like homophobia or racism, but lacked unity among that majority and so were able to be picked off by the minority plurality), 2) accept my "death" with equanimity and grace -- either the eccentric alien billionaires are "evil", in which case you're screwed regardless, or they're "good", in which case self-sacrifice might be rewarded (they've already demonstrated arbitrary command of knock-out tech, maybe that and not death is what's happening, so I should sit down and roll backwards to make sure I don't concuss myself falling), and 3) try to persuade my fellow contestants of this premise, and probably prioritize medical doctors? over, say, survivalists, since they'd have the most immediately relevant skills and could pick up e.g. engineering know-how in the coming apocalypse.
