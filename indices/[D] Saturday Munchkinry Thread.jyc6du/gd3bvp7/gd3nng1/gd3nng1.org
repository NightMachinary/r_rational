Would survival really be an issue? How much of the world would really be trying to kill you in this scenario? And you don't really need to worry about captivity since they won't be able to hold you for long.

Anyway, there are still probably parts of the world that it would take a week or more to find you in, maybe remote mountainous parts of Afghanistan?

Alternately, what form will their knowledge that arrives in one week take? Do people learn your name? Your appearance? Just a vague notion that is confusing unless they already know you or interact with you after being alerted? These all demand slightly different responses.
