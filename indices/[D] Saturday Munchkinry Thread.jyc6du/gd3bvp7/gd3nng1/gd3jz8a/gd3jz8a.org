Get a false identity, then get a boat with no electronics of any kind on and no identifying marks, then travel straight out into the pacific somewhere far enough north that bundling up and covering your face isn't suspicious while randomizing your course, then find and iceberg and burry into it far enough to maximize your chances of surviving if they decide to carpet-nuke the entire reachable northern pacific.

Note that you can survive for two weeks with zero food easily, only small amounts of water you can carry under your clothes, etc. And stuff like sleeping in your own waste or staying completely immobile trapped under rubble/snow take more than 2 weeks to kill you, and with the stakes and the face you can restore yourself to perfect health instantly once you get the powers makes being near death by starving, dehydration, and a dozen other things at once doesn't matter. So collapse that iceberg tunnel behind you, make it so narrow it'll be impossible to reverse back out, etc. if it helps you hide or prevent a larger scale collapse if the iceberg shifts at all.
