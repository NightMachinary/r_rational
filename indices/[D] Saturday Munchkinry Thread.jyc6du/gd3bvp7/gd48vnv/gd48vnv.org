If they only get my name and face, I'd just take a bus somewhere very rural without any tech with me then change my hair and get contacts/different glasses after the deadline. I'd check if there's a way for me to get a firearm without it being attached to my identity on short notice. Masks being normal right now means I might not be identified even if I'm out in public, so that helps while prepping.
