I have a hypothetical situation, I do not know if it's "munchkin" per see, but it's close enough I think :\\
In two weeks, you will obtain actionable omnipotence (no omniscience, no real time-travel, but complete control of causality)\\
In one week, everyone (from the old multi-billionaire to your nice grandma) will know for certain that you will obtain actionable omnipotence.

How do you survive one week with a "isekai-normal" body (no injury, better than average physical capability, less than average view of one-self, wealthy family)?
