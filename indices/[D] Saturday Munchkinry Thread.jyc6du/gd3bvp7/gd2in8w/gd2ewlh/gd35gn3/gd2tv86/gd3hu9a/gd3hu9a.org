Are you sure the mind reading and telepathy doesn't also require significant training and skill? I'd also suspect that a lot of these are powers humans can in theory learn if they only lived long enough in the setting, and found in elves only because elves can practice these skills for many centuries, rather than being linked to biological hardware. A few of these, like the superhuman artistic skill and control of your body, would be weird if someone that lived long enough /didn't/ develop.
