Hmm. Suppose I blindfold myself, and get a friend to flip a coin: if heads, hands me a bowl of food. If tails, hands me a bowl of poisoned food.

I eat the bowl of possibly poisoned food, well aware that there is a 50% chance of this food being poisoned. But since the chance is only 50% instead of 100%, technically, would I be considered aware that I am being targeted by poison at that moment?

Taking things further, what if I am put to sleep, then when I wake up, I am told that I have been put inside a virtual simulation or a lucid dream? Then, even if I am attacked by any means, would I be immune to the attack since I believe the attack is fake and so am not aware of being targeted by any real attack? (For that matter, do I actually need to be put to sleep? It is possible our world is a simulation anyway, what if I just believe in that?)

Essentially, the key to exploiting this power seems to be to get a trusted ally to deceive you.

Edit: So to be a hero, just team up with another hero (or get a sidekick). Then in combat, wear a helmet that blocks all light and sound, except for a communicator to let your ally command your body to move in whatever specific manner they believe is best. Just make sure the ally never ever lets you know whether you are currently in danger.
