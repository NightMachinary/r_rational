How does the ability interact with altered states of consciousness? For instance, really heavy self-hypnosis? Hypnotize yourself to be unable to perceive threats.

In real life, a lot of accidents happen before you can react, so for example you would have less to be worried about with car accidents blindsiding, but an accident you can see coming is still a hazard.

For superheroing... develop a counter intuitive fighting style that puts opponents and threats in your blind spot and lets you hit in the direction of your blind spot. Wear a mask and gear that limits your senses. Then don't claim to be invulnerable, pretend to be a street-level hand-to-hand hero that just seems unusually good in fights with a weird fighting style and stubbornly wears an awareness restricting costume. With any luck, your weird fighting style may make opponents think you actually have Daredevilesque sensory awareness and not realize it is an extremely contextual invulnerability.

What about allied super heroes with mind altering powers? Have BrainReprogrammer (who was having a really hard time finding a suitably heroic application for his powers) make you automatically become unaware of a list of threatening things. It would require a trusted ally to direct you but it would be a tough form of invulnerability. Keep your invulnerability secret so that Villain don't know how it works and don't try to work around it.
