Yeah, modifying your own beliefs seems to be the way to go. If you have access to the ability to modify your memories, excising your knowledge of how your ability works and instead inserting a belief that your power consists of being completely invulnerable to all forms of harm seems like it'd work.

I think this state of affairs would be roughly equivalent to the immunity you state would be conferred by a complete lack of knowledge of the harmful function and purposes of guns. In this case it would instead be a complete lack of knowledge of the harmful functions or consequences of anything that exists.
