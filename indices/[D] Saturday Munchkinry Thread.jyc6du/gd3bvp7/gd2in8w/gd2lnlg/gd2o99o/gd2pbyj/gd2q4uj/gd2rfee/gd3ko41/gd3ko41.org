I think the mechanics of immunity still haven't been examined carefully enough. What does immunity to harm mean here? Like what does immunity to a toxin mean? In the normal course of things, a toxin will collect somewhere in the body (bloodstream, liver, cerebrospinal fluids, etc.) and have some biochemical effect (binding to a chemical receptor site to disrupt ordinary function, affecting concentrations to accelerate/alter/prevent other necessary reactions in process, reacting with cells/tissues in a directly destructive way, lots of others and actually complex interactions of several of these). What exactly, does the immunity do? Does it prevent things from happening exactly at the point they would become "harmful"? In that case some agency has to be deciding how harmful is defined and munchkining is a process of hacking that agency's decision making in detail. Do all the ordinarily physically harmful things happen, but causality is somehow interrupted to keep your status completely divorced from physical reality? Then it becomes necessary to start hacking these divergences.
