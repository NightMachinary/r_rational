We can still work around that!

You know what I.V. is? I could get something like I.V. (a little needle/tube inserted into my vein) with full knowledge about it during day, but agree with my partner that he can draw any amount (or none) of my blood during my sleep.

That way he would certainly have access to my blood, and I still wouldn't know about a blood loss.
