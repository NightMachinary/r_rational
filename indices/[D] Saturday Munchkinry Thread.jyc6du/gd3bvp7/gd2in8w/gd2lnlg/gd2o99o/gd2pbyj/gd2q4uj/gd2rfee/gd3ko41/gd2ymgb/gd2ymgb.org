SO if someone were to secretly pump out 50% of my blood every night, and I wouldn't realize it (especially because I really have no medical knowledge and I don't know what is the sympton of blood loss), then.... then WHAT?

because, you know, after 4 nights I am left with 0.5*0.5*0.5*0.5=0.0625 of my original blood... and I still live?

so, basically, I am .... what? human living without blood? or endless source of blood (so I have also regeneration?)

â€‹

Or to bring it to another level... how many of my internal organs can be removed during night without me knowing before I die?!
