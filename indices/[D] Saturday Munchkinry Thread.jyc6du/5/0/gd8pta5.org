Understanding the world is an interesting phrase. You're not going to achieve a top-level understanding of any scientific discipline without a decade of academic study, so a lot of interpretations of that phrase are ruled out. You're not going to do mad-science super-villainy without knowing enough high-energy physics to build your death laser, you know what I mean? You're basically limited to the power that comes from money, the power that comes from social connections, and the power that comes from prior success at changing the world.

So my three-phase plan for you to gain ultimate power looks something like:

- Find a set of low-cost-of-intervention political spheres. This probably means relatively populated sub-entities in under-populated political entities (so the one town in a rural county, or the one metro area in Idaho/some party of Wales, or whatever). Decide on a theory of political engagement and activism. Raise money and run experiments in those spheres. (Be sure you're always working with, not against, the people already on the ground.)

- Find a circle of friends who strongly take ethical positions you agree with and want to continue agreeing with. Surround yourself socially with these people. Use this as a way to inoculate yourself against the sociopathologies of the rich and powerful, whose ranks you hope to soon be joining.

- Leverage your successes in phase 1 to run more experiments, building on the previous ones. Keep doing this to bootstrap your way into a position of influence with the political party whose work you're supporting. Remember that you are always working with, never against, institutions; if you disagree with them, that's fine, just avoid engaging with them in the dimension of your disagreement and find ways to work with them that validate your worth in the other dimensions.

You're not going to get immediately super wealthy doing this, but your political action organization pays you a decent salary to start out with (don't get greedy here! even just taking a few grand per year for expenses vastly increases your personal runway) and if you prove yourself successful you're looking at the usual run of speech fees, book deals, and consulting gigs.
