Faramir apparently has some minor telepathic ability (I can dig up the quote if you are interested) so it might be learnable? Or that might be a result of his inherited Numenor's blessing? The elves' level of ability is also confounded by elves that have seen the trees and/or elves that had rings of power. For the purposes of this munchkin post, which was already long and wordy, I just picked a higher end interpretation and left it at that.
