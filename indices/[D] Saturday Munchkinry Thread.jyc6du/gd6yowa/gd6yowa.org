You find yourself being a gifted 22 year old with $50k in the bank. Talents and skills include research, forecasting, programming, and poetry, and you have career capital for the first three. You can pick up concepts and programming languages easily, your mathematical maturity is generally high but nowhere near Terence Tao levels (your probability theory is great, though) and you speak several languages. You don't have a college degree nor particularly want to get one. Social skills are mediocre, but you have a few solid friends, and acquaintances all around the world. You don't keep in contact with your family. You spend around $700/month.

Your goals are to become stronger, gain power, understand the world, and optimize it. What do you do?
