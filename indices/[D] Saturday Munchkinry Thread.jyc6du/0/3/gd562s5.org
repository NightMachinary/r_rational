What exactly does everyone know in one week?

Like, say a complete stranger suddenly learns in one week, that you will obtain actionable omnipotence in another week. What exactly does he learn? Does he know your face? Your name? Your location? Does he know that killing you would prevent this?

If people only learn that someone will gain omnipotence, but do not magically gain any additional knowledge on who that someone is, then surviving is super easy since you don't really need to do anything. Just don't stupidly shout that you will become god in two weeks or something similar.

Every additional piece of information they gain will make things harder. A first name isn't too bad unless you have a very unique name. A face can be changed. A full name would be annoying. A location? Now you are in deep shit, since they could just nuke your location immediately, so you better be in some really fast transportation in exactly one week to get out of the blast radius ASAP.

Otherwise, if the information gained is very limited, the main problem would be people you are close to. Friends, relatives, etc. People who could realistically identify you from few clues. But if you are in an "isekai-normal" body, presumably you are the standard school dropout NEET with no friends anyway... so really the only problem is your parents, and whether they would trust you with actionable omnipotence. But, seeing as your parents love you enough to put up with your NEET dropout-ness, I would guess they would love you enough to not kill you to stop you from gaining actionable omnipotence.
