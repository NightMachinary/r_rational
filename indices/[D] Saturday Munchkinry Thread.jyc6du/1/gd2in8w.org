You're completely invulnerable to any attack or anything at all that you're not aware of. So all forms of surprise attacks don't work on you -- whether it's a sniper's bullet or a sudden knife attack, you'll be completely unharmed.

Poisons, mental attacks, magic spells etc won't work either if you aren't aware you are being targeted at that exact moment. You are also immune to their effects if you don't know or at least have a good idea of what they are.

This ability is active at all times and there's no upper limit to what it can shield you from. You could even survive a nuclear explosion if you were asleep when it went off.

Basically you can't get hurt by anything you don't know about. If you get hit by someone with super strength (and you're aware you're getting hit), you'll receive the full damage only if you're aware that they possess super strength. If not, you'll only receive around the amount of damage you'd expect from someone of their physique and level of skill.

The obvious downside to this ability is it's basically useless when you know when you're being targeted and how.

How would you use this power effectively as a villain/hero in a typical superhero world? How would you use it if you suddenly got it in real life?
