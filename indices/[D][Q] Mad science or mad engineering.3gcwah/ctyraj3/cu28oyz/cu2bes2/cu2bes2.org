Eh, electricians still do that today, with the backs of their hands. The strength of the muscle reaction will tell you roughly how much power is in the lines. You do not try it on lines capable of carrying enough to fry you, or if you are well-grounded. Don't try this at home, kids. Just because I've known a few electricians that did it when I worked in a steel mill doesn't mean they were entirely sane.
