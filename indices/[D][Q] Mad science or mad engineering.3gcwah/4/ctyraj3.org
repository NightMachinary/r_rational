Most science outside of classrooms these days is difficult to comprehend without a whole can of alphabet soup behind your name.

If you want to have an interesting rational story with lots of action and real science in it, science with meat on it's bones, then back things up a couple centuries and explore the science of the early industrial revolution. There was plenty of adventure in science then.

You can do it with modern science too, but it's easier if you go back to a time when people were trying to define the most basic principles.
