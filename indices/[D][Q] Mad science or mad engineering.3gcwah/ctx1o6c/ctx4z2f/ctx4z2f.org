That is indeed science-in-the-small (empirical investigation), but not quite "Science"-as-we-know-it. "Science" (the academic institution) usually implies large studies that you can extract statistically-significant trends from, for one thing. ("Science" also implies replications by disinterested third parties, but that's more of a fault-tolerance mechanism, which can be discarded if you just need suggestive correlations to e.g. point an R&D department toward promising directions.)

I might point to Orochimaru in Team Anko as an actual example of a "mad Scientist."
