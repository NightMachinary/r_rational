No, Worm isn't /really/ rational fiction. That's because it was never intended to be. And you can look at how Worm was constructed to see why it would be really hard for it to qualify.

Worm's world was built backwards. Wildbow had an end result - superheroes in costume, fighting each other on the streets, with almost all of the tropes that you would expect if you had been exposed to superheroes through comic books. Everything else was built with this end result in mind, and if anything contradicted that end result, it needed to get massaged.

So you get the Tinkers, who can make the cool tech, since that's a superhero trope. But there are a ton of problems with that from a worldbuilding standpoint, so instead of pushing the world to its logical conclusion, or scrapping the Tinkers, patches get applied until you might believe that all the stated conditions would lead to the desired end result.

But you can see the rough edges where this patching process wasn't perfect, and Worm has flaws if you're checking it over for logic. That wasn't really the point of Worm though.
