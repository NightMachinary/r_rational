No. I'm not aware of a single piece of rational fiction that /wasn't/ constructed in that way. Before you can ask how some state of affairs aught to collapse under rational treatment, you have to find a self-consistent model of how this magical set of conditions could stand in the first place, that is pure post hoc rationalization, and it's integral to the genre.

You're asserting that there are inconsistencies in the construction, but I'm yet to see that inarguably demonstrated here.
