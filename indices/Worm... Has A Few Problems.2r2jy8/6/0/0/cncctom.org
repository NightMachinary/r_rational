I generally agree that Wildbow did a good job with the patching - and it's fairly easy to miss the seams in the patch job while you're reading along. I suspect that will be even more true once The Edit is done. The majority of the time, my disbelief was properly suspended, with Cauldron's actions being the biggest sticking point.

Point number one is actually the biggest thing that irks me - it feels like such a cop out, in part because it weakens the character study aspect of the piece. You have all this wonderful psychological stuff going on, and then you explain away a lot of it with alien brain slugs. It stops being a commentary on how people can't cooperate with each other, and how institutions fail, and how conflicts naturally arise between people with differing viewpoints ... and becomes about the brain slugs. I liked Armsmaster as a character /so much better/ when he was just off-putting, solitary, and egotistical by his nature, instead of being that way (at least in part) because of the brain slug. But that's a question of artistic choice rather than plausibility.
