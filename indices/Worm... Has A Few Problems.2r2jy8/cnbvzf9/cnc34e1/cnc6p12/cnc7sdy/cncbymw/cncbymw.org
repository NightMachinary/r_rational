Leviathan sank Kyushu, which is a big chunk of Japan, but not the entire island. He also sank Newfoundland without an equivalent fight, which is considerably larger than Kyushu.

I'm not sure where you guys are getting the idea that his fight caused the massive destruction that occurred. You think if they ignored him he would killed the city and left? That's not what happens in any of his other fights. That's not how the heros discuss fighting him.

Maybe he didn't drive off Leviathan, but he certainly occupied his attention for the entire fight. I'm betting most of the damage was caused by his background wave activity instead of active targeting by Leviathan.
