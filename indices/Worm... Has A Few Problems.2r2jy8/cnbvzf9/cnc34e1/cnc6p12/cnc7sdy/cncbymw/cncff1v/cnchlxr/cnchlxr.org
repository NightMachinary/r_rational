If I remember correctly, he's in the Birdcage during the attack on BB.

I'm not sure how willing villains are to participate in Endbringer fights in other cities. Mostly it seems to be heroes shipping around for those fights and the villains just defend locally. What are the chances that he'd be in 3 (counting Kyushu and BB) potential targets?

Also consider his POV after fighting (and nearly loosing) in Kyushu. He's an egotistical asshole, I'm not sure he'd be eager to be in that position again.
