True, but we have the benefit of hindsight. For all the characters in the story knew, Lung was one of the very few capes who could fight an Endbringer one-on-one. Plus the fact that Lung only gets stronger as he fights should leave anyone to think that he might be a very good chance at killing an Endbringer.
