I understand the points you bring up, but the constraints of the genre mean that there are moderately valid reasons for them not working.

#+begin_quote
  Consider Armsmaster. He invents a weapon capable of physically dismantling Leviathan.
#+end_quote

Leviathan dismantled /him./ The weapon wouldn't have been capable of killing it because of space time shenanigans with the Endbringers having infinite density cores(Badly worded, but you'll get the point).

He doesn't need to be physically present for it's operation, no. He /does/ need to be there to /repair/ it. Besides, the shards are promoting conflict. If you're a parahuman, your brain is automatically wired to always go for the Big Damn Hero response to /everything/.

As for constructing unconventional weaponry to take out the Simurgh? Yes, that would /work./ But the Simurgh is also /targeting/ the people or groups that are trying to actually /do/ that sort of thing. Take Mannequin, for instance. He was designing Moon colonies for people to get away from Earth and be safe(probably safe).

I do believe you have raised valid points on the subjects of villains, though. I blame Cauldron.
