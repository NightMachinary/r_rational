Worm starts off with the premise that people who "break" and suddenly develop shards of superpowers will decide to dress up in costume and either A) fight crime or B) commit crimes (for the most part.)

Thusly, heroes and villains alike treat the Endbringer truce, Cape Disguise and 'Assassination while you sleep' scenarios very delicately. It's a similar philosophy to nuclear proliferation and mutually assured destruction -- I won't do it if you won't do it, because let's be honest -- if we did, the world would end.

Tinkers are broken. The only nerf they have is time and resources (which happen off-screen) so story-wise, creativity is the main-limiting factor. All devices require upkeep by the tinker and the reason why Dragon is so successful has to do with her ability to multitask like mad, given her background. The nanotech-monofilaments that Defiant uses can get jammed with the dust they generate -- he could theoretically mass-produce them, but a lot of PRT people would lose limbs (and the PRT uses non-lethal force for reasons above.)

Worm is a rationalization of the Superhero comics. But it proceeds in a rational way from this premise... although the story gets rushed and a little sloppy and abrupt at times towards the end (although the ending itself is something I find to be very satisfactory.)
