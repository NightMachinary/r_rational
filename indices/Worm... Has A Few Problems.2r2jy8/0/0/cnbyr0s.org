Yeah, I noticed a number of problems as well. For one thing, the S9 did have a kill order on them. Anyone who wanted to could claim a huge reward for the kill on them and walk out without being molested, regardless of their past. Wildbow had a post about this, and even said Bakuda had a kill order on her when she was brought down, although it wasn't mentioned in story.

In regards to the Simurgh, she has telekinesis. Any weapons they launch at her would be pretty easily redirected by her. Plus, she has the ability to see the future. She doesnt need to be anywhere near where the weapons will be, and any weapon powerful enough to really hurt the end bringers would be most likely be targeted by them. Capes are really the only ones strong enough to actually get near her without being thrown out. The rest of the end bringers are out of reach when they are regenerating.

In regards to Lung and the prospect of killing him: you mean one of the handful of capes on the planet who can 1v1 an end bringer for an extended period of time, something Alexandria can't do, then come out alive, and only operates a fairly small time gang in a single city? Kill him? Sure.

I do agree that Worm could use a very large edit to clarify a variety of things, and resolve some inconsistencies, but these criticisms generally were founded on incorrect premises or didn't really think through the problems better than the author.
