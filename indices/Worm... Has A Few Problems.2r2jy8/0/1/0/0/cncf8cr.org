I wasn't referring to the sustainability of their strategy, but the sustainability of having regular Endbringer attacks. There have been at least 80 cities destroyed, with an accompanying number of capes. The capes in particular don't come by easily enough that you'd think this could go on for over twenty years.

The best think Armsmaster could have done, bar nothing else, was to create more nanothorn weapons. Even helping Dragon could come after making at least one more. Still, I was thinking from the perspective of some government official: aside from Scion, the halberd is the only thing that's ever worked particularly well. So let's get more! Give the plans to Dragon, by all means, and then start manufacturing them! Even a one-time-use nanothorn weapon could be used as artillery against Behemoth.
