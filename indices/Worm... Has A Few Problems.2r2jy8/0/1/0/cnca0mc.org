armsmaster shared the nanothorn tech with dragon before he even learned she was an AI. Since armsmaster's specialty does /not/ include mass-production or low-maintenance tech, this was by far the most effective way to scale up applications of the technology.

Endbringer fights end one of two ways; sometimes the heroes, primarily eidolon, drive them off. Sometimes they achieve their objectives and just wander off.

And of course it wasn't a sustainable strategy, everyone knew that. It was still the best strategy they had managed to come up with. Trying to take the fight to the endbringers wouldn't change the fact that their attacks were largely ineffective; it would just eliminate the down-time they normally get to recoup between attacks, speeding up humanity's destruction and giving them less time to hopefully come up with a better solution.

Dragon produced the containment foam, and the other tech the prt used, including the collars and the version of armsmaster's tactical combat system being deployed in the mid-late series. Reverse-engineering other tinkers technology was dragon's specialty, and it seemed that in some important ways she actually understood their tech better than they did, or at least was better able to mass-produce it - her main constraint there being the shackles her creator had left her with. So as I said first, the best thing armsmaster could do was give the tech to dragon, and then help unshackle dragon so she could be even more effective at what she was already the best at doing.
