You know I always had an issue with the loss rates cited by Endbringer fights, it was something stupidly large for very little gain. I'm not sure anyone is paying attention to the value of Brockton Bay versus the value of the capes who could die and only then have a net "win".

Seems to me that they would have better chances if they didn't lose 1000s of capes and fought all at once, ignoring all the other things that came about Endbringer attacks (including not using any conventional weapons, where are the supersonic jets?)
