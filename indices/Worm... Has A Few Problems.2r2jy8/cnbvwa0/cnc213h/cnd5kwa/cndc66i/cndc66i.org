Just usual "stay out of the line of fire", I guess. Building tiny parachutes in spear handles or setting up magnetic fields to slow down spears by neodim magnets inside seems a little too complex to be practical. Assigning teleporter to Ballistic to position him away from causing unnecessary damage is more feasible. But that's just from top of my head.
