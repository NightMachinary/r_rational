If your explanation is going to be "Because people are stupid," then you've made my point.

I didn't mean "all the Tinkers combined". Sorry, I should have been clearer. I meant that out of all Tinkers, Thinkers, and so forth, you'd expect to have one or two that would be effective against Bonesaw. In Real Life, the NSA and the FBI and so forth aren't perfect because they do not have superpowers. If your job is to solve problems, I expect that any comparable organization with superpowerful advantages will do better than you.
