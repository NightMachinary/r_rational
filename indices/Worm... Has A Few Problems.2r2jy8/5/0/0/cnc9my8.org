You have incredibly smart people in the real world who believe and do stupid things. I imagine this is an even bigger issue for the thinkers in worm since the passengers tend to buff only a very specific area.

Imagine how many brilliant people there are in all the US 3 letter government agencies, they also have the backing of the most powerful government in the world. Yet lots of things still get past them. You can't just take "all the tinkers" and add their powers together.
