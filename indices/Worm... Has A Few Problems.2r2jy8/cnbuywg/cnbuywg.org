Won't do a lengthy point-by-point, but to throw out a few obvious things...

the "useless" software armsmaster was working on was unchaining dragon, which is what made it possible for dragon to operate multiple suits at once, which you cited before that as a game-breaker.

They don't just leave it to scion; it was said that scion actually didn't even show up for most endbringer fights, because at that point he was mindlessly addressing whatever problems happened to be closest, with no sense of scale or priority.

Your assertion that tinkers can "optionally reduce their own effectiveness in exchange for allowing their designs to be understood by the unwashed masses" doesn't seem to have any basis in canon. They are not prodigies who are able to work from known technology through to super-advanced tech, they are being directly fed top-level understanding without having worked through the underlying science. They are engineers, not scientists, and they work intuitively, not from a solid theoretical backing, which is probably why their tech ends up being fiddly and requires so much maintenance.

I'm not saying your premise is wrong; there are certainly flaws in the conception of the universe of Worm. Some of those flaws are deliberate design choices, however, necessary conceits based on the premise and goals of the story, notably the truce with villains. Others are just plain flaws. I'm just saying that you ought to take more care to avoid flaws in your analysis of other works' flaws.

:edit: trimmed and reworded a bit of redundant and potentially confusing language.
