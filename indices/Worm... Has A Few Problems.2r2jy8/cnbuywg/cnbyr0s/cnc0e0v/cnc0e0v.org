The issue with Lung operating a small time gang was addressed though. He has several problems that prevented him from being bigger.

1. His power takes a long time to charge up. He can take Alexandria in a fight, but only if that fight goes on for 15 minutes. In the first few seconds of a fight, any mid-level hero could probably beat him to a pulp. Especially if they knew who they were up against.

2. He sees things in the small scale. He'd rather vett a few close associates than build an organization that is self sustaining. I can see him having to "clean house" of anyone moderately disloyal pretty often.

3. He has an average intelligence at best. He probably doesn't even realize point #2 about himself.
