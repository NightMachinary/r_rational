I just wanted to point out stuff like, "For someone whose power is Winning, Contessa doesn't really accomplish that," and "Lung is only invincible after a few minutes of fighting, so why not shoot him immediately?" (His use against the Endbringers isn't worth the resk of letting him loose, in my opinion.)

The Simurgh is a bit of a problem, but Leviathan and Behemoth and the others? Not so much. You could even, with optimal use of guys like Vista, Clockblocker, Myrddin, and Eidolon, neutralize them without killing them.
