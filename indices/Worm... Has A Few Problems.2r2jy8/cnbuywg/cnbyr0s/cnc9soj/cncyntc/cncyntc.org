Cauldron accomplished a *huge* amount of worldbuilding behind the scenes. That this is not obvious is kinda the point. [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wormverse-ideas-recs-and-fic-discussion-thread-38.309181/page-35#post-15024820][Wildbow's commented on that matter rather directly.]]

Clearly the PRT and perhaps Cauldron disagree on the usefulness of Lung (it is worth mentioning he succeeded in tanking against /Scion/ for a double digit number of seconds). Notably, both parties have Thinkers that can confirm that Lung isn't likely to go on an extended rampage, so it isn't much of a gamble.

There's a recurring theme in Endbringer fights that whenever you figure out a way to beat them they escalate and pull out some new trick. Maybe you manage to levitate Leviathan away from a water source while neutralizing his echo... and then half your defending capes explode into pink mist. Oops, so much for the Manton effect. I think you can imagine even worse outcomes with a little effort.
