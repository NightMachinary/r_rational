I think that, from Armsmaster's perspective, producing more of the anti-Endbringer weapons should have been the highest priority by far.

If Scion /doesn't/ end most Endbringer fights, what usually happens? Do the heroes drive the Endbringer off? Or do the Endbringers cause the requisite amount of carnage? See, four major cities pwned per year since at least some time in the 1990s, with 1/4 of the defending capes going down as well, doesn't sound very sustainable. There have to have been /some/ advances in Kaiju-fighting since then.

Tinkers can, in fact, produce sensible technology when the situation requires it. The PRT containment foam, for instance. Bakuda comments on the design of the restraining collars in the Canary Interlude, to this effect. I put the links... somewhere else in the thread, I guess.

My analysis of /Worm/ is that it is not Rationalist nor Rational, because of the high number of amazingly stupid things that happen. It is indeed a fantastic work of fiction, I just felt that the characters in it were deconstructed!Superheroes, not rational!Superheroes. Does that work better?
