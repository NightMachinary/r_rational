You are misremembering. The nano-thorns /didn't/ work. They cut easily through the "flesh", which the Endbringers gave precisely zero fucks about. They couldn't cut through the skeletal frame. Doing significant amounts of superficial damage is nice and all, but it's not the game-winner you seem to think it is.
