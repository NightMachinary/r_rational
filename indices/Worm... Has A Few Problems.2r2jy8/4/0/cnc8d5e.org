- Tinkertech /is/ extremely expensive to make, but is it more expensive than having to rebuild a major city once every three months?

- Dragon may have limits on the number of bodies she can control directly, but there are tonnes of drones monitoring the exterior of the Birdcage. If she's doing that, via loophole or programming error or whatever, then she should be able to build her own army. I don't know how much Saint is interfering, though, so I'll let that one go.

- You wouldn't /need/ to mass-produce the Armsmaster weapon, you'd only need three: one for Eidolon, one for Alexandria, one for Armsmaster.

- The sort of unconventional weaponry I'm imagining is demonstrably invented by Dragon, in the form of everything she has equipped her armour with, ever. Even so, your resources for dealing with the Simurgh would be /all/ of the Tinkers.

- So why does this united force not exist? I'm not saying it has to be all capes; even the armed forces would suffice.

- Not only does he not fight Leviathan when he shows up /in the same city/, he also gets arrested and escapes. He's clearly really fucking dangerous, why does than not justify using elephant tranquilizers at the very least?

- Not amount of durability will save you from Flechette, but firearms exist that can go through concrete, so until proven otherwise I'll go with the "More Gun" philosophy. Jack's capacity to deal with unexpected threats looks like an informed ability. If Bonesaw has plagues on her person, it's time to bust out the parahumans with force fields. If they're hidden around the world, time to bust out the Thinkers before you kill her.

- Butcher /should/ have a kill order, because turning heroes into successively more powerful villains sounds like the sort of thing you'd want off your plate... Okay, maybe not a "kill" order, but something to that effect. Crawler would have to be dealt with last, along with the Siberian and so forth. It wouldn't be easy, but it would be doable.

- So maybe not an actual bomb. But if the Thinkers foresaw his death negatively affecting the world, why didn't they foresee his role in the apocalypse? Or everything else, for that matter?

- Tinkertech is /totally/ reproducible. Bakuda [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/interlude-6/][says something to that effect here]], and the PRT containment foam is Tinker-made. Aside from that, it doesn't answer the question of why anti-cape/anti-Endbringer weaponry isn't ubiquitous like the containment foam.
