I greatly disagree with all of your priors. There are no threats that equal the Slaughterhouse 9 or the Endbringers in scale, so all available Thinkers and resources of that nature should be devoted to those problems. You've made a whole bunch of assumptions about the nature of Tinker powers and the availability of resources. For instance, it doesn't matter if there's only one Flechette, you only need to kill a half-dozen invincible monsters. Dismissing the use of the nanoweapon on the Endbringer core because it "Probably would have failed" is equally stupid from the perspective of the PRT and the Protectorate. Cherish can indeed sense emotions, which is why you send Dragon after her. Or Weld (I can't remember if he actually feels emotions or not.) If killing Jack takes strong Tinkertech, then you /get strong Tinkertech/. It doesn't matter how twisty the assassination plot has to get, because getting it done is the greatest priority.

What bothers me most is-

Where the fuck did you get that from? Butcher's odds of saving 10,000,000 people by intervention are so close to nil that the distinction doesn't matter. Similarly, you stand to lose not only civilians, but also the heroes that eventually kill Butcher, with the added problem of continued escalation. Bayesian reasoning is not useful here.

Is your point that the PRT et al. aren't actually interested in containing villains if they aren't a widespread danger? Because that seems like a policy that wouldn't last long in the real world. If the objective of capture is eventually the Birdcage (after the obligatory three strikes), they are, in fact, working to do as good as killing them, for all the good Birdcage prisoners do against Endbringers.

Nobody knows /how/ invulnerable the Siberian is.

Dinah Alcot is a really good Thinker. But you could probably get results with an acceptable level of accuracy (in the case of locating the source of an Armageddon) from Tattletale or Coil. Just saying that all the other Thinkers are inferior doesn't explain why.

I did, in fact, read Dragon's interlude. While she might desire to be able to make her own choices, nothing there indicates that she would prefer that over killing the Endbringers.
