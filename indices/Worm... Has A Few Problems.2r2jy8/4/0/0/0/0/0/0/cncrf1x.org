  There are no threats that equal the Slaughterhouse 9 or the Endbringers in scale, so all available Thinkers and resources of that nature should be devoted to those problems.
#+end_quote

Most of the time the Endbringers are asleep and fairly tricky to do anything about, the S9 are tricky to do anything about due to their sheer power and I don't know of any capes that can actually track people. There are diminishing returns from resource investment, if they did this they probably wouldn't accomplish much more.

#+begin_quote
  For instance, it doesn't matter if there's only one Flechette, you only need to kill a half-dozen invincible monsters.
#+end_quote

The monsters are going to fight back, Simurgh is going to prophesize what Fletchette is up to and send guidance and aid to her siblings. They can try a lot of things but there's a high chance of death whenever they do. Rationality only goes so far, you need resources to accomplish your goals and their resources are limited.

  Dismissing the use of the nanoweapon on the Endbringer core because it "Probably would have failed" is equally stupid from the perspective of the PRT and the Protectorate.
#+end_quote

Dragon had them for a while, she probably tried them out on the Endbringers. They either found a way to negate them or were resistant. The likely answer is that they tried them out, they didn't work well.

#+begin_quote
  Cherish can indeed sense emotions, which is why you send Dragon after her.
#+end_quote

It's not widely known knowledge that Dragon is an AI, Cauldron, the group that knows all, doesn't want to kill the S9. She didn't get a decent bot army till Defiant's modifications as well, after that she did go after the S9.

He's a case 53, not a robot.

  If killing Jack takes strong Tinkertech, then you get strong Tinkertech. It doesn't matter how twisty the assassination plot has to get, because getting it done is the greatest priority.
#+end_quote

You were arguing that they should use the army to kill Jack. They can't get strong tinkertech to every soldier due to it not being possible to mass produce it. The average soldier will just have a gun which will be far less effective against them. If you use capes he can outwit them. He is not easy to defeat and will try to counter any plan of yours and if it fails then that's a massive investment of resources lost or subverted.

  Where the fuck did you get that from? Butcher's
#+end_quote

Sorry, mixed it up with Lung.

Butcher is a fairly small scale criminal with a not hugely potent power. You're only likely to win against her with a cape which compounds the issue. If she started mass murdering people you might try to do something about her but she's not a high priority. You wanted to make the Endbringers and the S9 the top priority- why do something about a minor criminal?

#+begin_quote
  Is your point that the PRT et al. aren't actually interested in containing villains if they aren't a widespread danger?
#+end_quote

My point is that the PRT has extremely limited resources and are heavily outnumbered, they can't deal with all the villains with extreme aggression, and yes they need the aid of the Villains to deal with more serious threats.

  Nobody knows how invulnerable the Siberian is.
#+end_quote

Legend, Alexandria and Eidelon have gone up against her and lost. They know she's really really tough.

#+begin_quote
  Dinah Alcot is a really good Thinker. But you could probably get results with an acceptable level of accuracy (in the case of locating the source of an Armageddon) from Tattletale or Coil.
#+end_quote

Tattletale is only effective if she has a lot of information on the situation and Cauldron don't really need more information, others don't have it, Coil is no use, all he can do is experience two simulations. Both are unable to do much to help.

#+begin_quote
  I did, in fact, read Dragon's interlude. While she might desire to be able to make her own choices, nothing there indicates that she would prefer that over killing the Endbringers.
#+end_quote

She spend most of her time talking about the birdcage and talking with her lover, her priorities are obvious.
