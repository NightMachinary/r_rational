  It's not an either or thing. Endbringers can survive an unbelievable amount of abuse. You might make some incredibly expensive tinkertech, try to kill them, and fail. People probably have. They can tank nukes. So, you spend billions of dollars making this tinkertech, exhaust your country's supply of rare metals, call in every favor to get extra tinker tech and boosts then throw it at the Endbringer. They survive it, smash up all your stuff. What do you do now? You don't have cash to repair your city, you're out of favors, you can't repeat this.
#+end_quote

Tinkertech is /demonstrably/ capable of harming Endbringers. Furthermore, you don't need to spend personal resources on destroying them, since it's in everyone's best interests to kill them.

#+begin_quote
  Dumb expensive drones. You can use them but then you can't stop major criminals. If you make more, see above.
#+end_quote

Why can't Dragon make more, exactly? She has a personal budget great enough to finance an inescapable prison, for one.

#+begin_quote
  Probably a bad idea, if they manage to subvert the weapons you've lost your big three heroes. But even if it works then the endbringers just have to smash the machines to stop the threat. Eidelon and Alexandria are so useful because they're invulnerable, tinker tech isn't.
#+end_quote

I apologize, I worded this badly. But how would Behemoth or Leviathan 'subvert' Armsmaster's weapon, which needs to be maintained by him personally? (I would not advocate using it against the Simurgh). You can't smash the halberd, because it instantly vapourizes everything it touches. As I said, it's demonstrably effective against Endbringers.

You, however, have opened a can of worms. If Eidolon et al. are too valuable to lose fighting Endbringers, why do they do it anyways?

#+begin_quote
  Skitter beat her armor, it's not that effective. Not endbringer level.
#+end_quote

I can only assume that that version was a 'law & order' model, meant to bring in criminals alive. Dragon even confirms that, deliberately not harming Taylor. Against Leviathan, she's [[http://parahumans.wordpress.com/category/stories-arcs-1-10/arc-8-extermination/8-3/][a little tougher]].

#+begin_quote
  Capes become capes via traumatic trigger events making them all a bit insane, and their passengers encourage them to fight so they're bad at unity. Notably in story the E88 Nazis have more firepower than the PRT. Armed responses can't defeat endbringers and are more expensive than capes.
#+end_quote

They seem pretty unified in the story. And non-cape forces could defeat Endbringers with judicious use of Armsmaster's weapon. Furthermore, the army would be more useful against threats like the Slaughterhouse 9 than Endbringers.

#+begin_quote
  If he's fucking dangerous once to an endbringer he could save millions of lives. Him beating up a few people and fighting some capes isn't a major concern.
#+end_quote

He didn't save any lives when he fought Leviathan the first time, he never fought Leviathan again, he was eventually locked in the Birdcage (so was never going to happen anyways), and that still doesn't explain why he wasn't seriously sedated when they arrested him with his eyeballs clawed out.

#+begin_quote
  No, or strong tinkertech or blasters, but this just means that conventional weapons aren't very effective at stopping them. You can bring tanks and planes and such but shatterbird and siberian and crawler can probably take them.
#+end_quote

Tanks and planes are for use against Bonesaw and the like, capes are for use against the Siberian and Crawler and the like. If you aren't somehow immune to being shot by the biggest rifle in existence (counting Tinkertech) from some distance away, or if you're not Bonesaw, that's what should happen. Then you use Flechette against the Siberian, and so on.

#+begin_quote
  It's very explicitly stated in the text, he has a thinker ability to deal with parahumans. He often uses it, in text.
#+end_quote

Okay, he does have that. I wasn't referring to his Thinker ability though, I was referring to his (perfectly ordinary) /planning/ ability. As I said, Jack Slash could be shot from really far away by a non-parahuman, and there's nothing he can really do about it. He may be a moderating influence on the Siberian, which is why Flechette or Armsmaster would be brought in to deal with her, in such a way that Jack Slash is already dead by the time they're informed of the plan.

#+begin_quote
  You can try and make a really big effort to kill them all, but they've always slipped through. Siberian is the big issue. You can send all the forces you like but they can just hide and let Siberian slowly destroy them while any long ranged ones slice up your forces. Tinkers and forcefield capes often have limitations.
#+end_quote

I wasn't talking about the Siberian, I was talking about a young girl who happens to be able to make plagues. I assume you meant to type Thinkers and not Tinkers, and yes, they do have disadvantages. But what would prevent them from being useful here? Ditto for force-field capes (and even if none existed to this specification, Dragon or another Tinker could assuredly arrange for her to die in a secluded vacuum, I think.)

#+begin_quote
  You don't get a kill order for that. You get a kill order when everyone, villains included, thinks someone has gone off the rails and really needs to die. You get it when Billy the Biker psycho thinks whoever went too far. You get a kill order when you want the villains to help you. If you use them lightly the villains (who outnumber the heroes) won't comply with anti S9 or endbringer efforts or kill orders.
#+end_quote

Fair point. But you should also be put under arrest for breaking the law, and there should be serious repercussions for killing people at all. What makes the Slaughterhouse 9 worse than Butcher, scale? They both kill people, everyone knows they both kill people, so all ten of them are equally guilty of murder (different body counts, but still).

#+begin_quote
  Most tinker powers are limited, they can't foresee everything. They might scan him and get a red if you attack, not a clear message that if you do that something will happen. You know from experience red means over a million deaths and is bad, but you don't know what exactly it means.
#+end_quote

Are you saying that every Thinker offscreen only gets vague warnings about outcomes? Can they foresee /anything/? What about Jack Slash, why did only Dinah Alcot predict that he would try and end the world? That immediately makes him as terrible a threat as the Endbringers, and the Slaughterhouse 9 are emminently more squishy targets than Behemoth.

/As far as Tinkertech goes.../

I didn't mean to imply that the nanothorn weapon had to be mass-reproducible, just that Armsmaster needed to make at least one more (or repair the first one), and then use it immediately on the next attack. Or give it to Eidolon, who would then use it with super-speed. Or Alexandria, who would be invincible and therefore use it fearlessly. Or a teleporter, etc. So why didn't he?

#+begin_quote
  It's a fairly low tech bit of tinker tech made by dragon. She can make a lot of stuff, being an AI. She has many other priorities and isn't as good at tinkertech as specialists in particular subjects.
#+end_quote

WHAT PRIORITIES DOES DRAGON HAVE THAT OUTRANK KILLING THE ENDBRINGERS???
