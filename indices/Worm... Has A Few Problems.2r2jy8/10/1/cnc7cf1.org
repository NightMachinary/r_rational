  You can excuse quite a lot with "shards be making people crazy!"

That always annoyed me. It's such a narrative cheat -- "my characters are all uncooperative idiots? The shards did it!"

The basic problem was that, as is pointed out in other comments, Wildbow was writing backwards instead of forwards -- attempting to produce a justification of a genre (superhero comics) instead of starting with preconditions and going from there. That's totally cool and can produce great stories, but the genre he was trying to justify cannot be justified. At a high level, people in comics do not act like real people, so you can't write real world stories about them.
