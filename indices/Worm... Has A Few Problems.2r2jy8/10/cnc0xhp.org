You can excuse quite a lot with "shards be making people crazy!" which resolves a lot of problems here. There's a couple of veiled references to the idea that the Birdcage exists as a resource to be tapped when necessary (also some individuals in it are close to unkillable).

spoilers below!

As logic problems go, you've failed to hit on the one that bugs me the most, which is that Cauldron is bloody terrible at its job. Again and again, the problem that is hammered home are co-ordination problems. Cauldron's one goal is to kill Scion, yet they happily watch as heroes who could do it die. I still don't quite know why they decided to let the Slaughter House 9 wonder around making the world worse, a decision which leads to the world ending much earlier than it needed to.

But urgh, that's the story. It's not a rational fic, and not one that is essentially rooted in plausibility. Wildbow has spoken about how he constructs stories, and as I understand it he basically puts his heroes in almost unwinnable situations and then works out how they can win. But this leads to Taylor surviving multiple times when she really, really shouldn't! Countless times she should actually come out worse and yet at the last minute she manages to turn it around!
