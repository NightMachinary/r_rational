I agree with you, but Wildbow IMO does a /really good job/ patching over.

Take Star Trek. Ships couldn't accelerate that fast without turning the crew to chunky salsa and tearing apart, so we get the Inertial Dampening Field and the Structural Integrity Field. Do those make sense? No, but it makes us stop asking questions, it's a non-answer that /sounds/ like an answer, so we can continue our suspension of disbelief and enjoy the story.

Unfortunately, Trek fails a lot in providing even that.

Worm does a similar thing. A lot of the issues boil down to:

1. Capes are influenced by their shards. They gravitate to conflict and fighting.

2. They are already all messed up from their trigger events, so not acting particularly rational, and many capes are low-level idiot scumbags that just happen to have powers...

3. Cauldron has an end-game about defeating Scion, and they really have no idea how to do it, since he seems unstoppable (and virtually is). One of their goals is "maximize the number of capes." And since they covertly are running the entire parahuman organization of North America, a lot of the stupid cops-and-robbers stuff like the Birdcage etc. makes sense. In this situation, they just need to have enough plausibility to fool the North American population and not the reader!

4. Escalation... not always a good idea. Nilbog is contained. Lung is a small time guy. If you push, things could get much worse. North Korea once sank a US ship and tortured the crew... we negotiated for the release of the crew and apologized, rather than invade them. Sometimes maintaining the status quo makes sense, even if it sucks.

5. The unwritten rules. Again based on the idea that escalation and fear-of-reprisal keeps people in check... no one wants Total War with parahumans.

6. Tinker tech - again, they want to fight, shard shenanigans, and their tech needs maintenance, and they are messed up people...

Worm wouldn't exist in a world that didn't already have superhero fiction. If you are reading Worm, it's assumed you already know something about Batman and Spider-Man and such.

So the patching over ridiculous superhero conventions just has to look good compared to the mainstream... and it does! The Flash should be able to solve so many problems in the DC universe... and I don't recall getting much in the way of satisfactory reasons why he doesn't...

I had tons of issues with the Wormverse while reading... but the "reasons" why everything is the way it is... they totally worked for me. By which I mean they made me stop digging too deep, they sounded just plausible enough that I could accept them and move on with the story.

Wildbow gave his characters real weaknesses. Mainstream superheroes tend to get awesome powers and then hold the idiot ball and forget to use them. Wildbow gives them real weaknesses, even if they are psychological ones, and explores them. That makes it so much more believable to me that they don't just solve all their problems.

And lastly...

Despair. I mean they are called Endbringers. Conventional weapons don't hurt them. Nuclear weapons, the best we have... doesn't help. All we can rely on is capes, and they are fighting a losing battle. I think humanity knows it is a war of attrition and they will lose. Regular humans feel powerless and have sort of given up... they just rely on the capes to save them. The capes themselves are all screwed up because of triggers and shard stuff. All according to the Entities' plans.
