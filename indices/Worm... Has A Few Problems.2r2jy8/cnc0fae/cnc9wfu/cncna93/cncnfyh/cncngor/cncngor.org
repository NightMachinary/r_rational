  *USS /Pueblo/ (AGER-2)* is an American [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_intelligence][electronic intelligence]] (ELINT) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence][signals intelligence]] (SIGINT) ship attached to Navy intelligence, which was boarded and captured by North Korean forces on 23 January, 1968, in what is known as the */Pueblo/ incident* or alternatively as the */Pueblo/ crisis*. The capture came less than a week after 36th President [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson][Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union_address]["State of the Union" address]] to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress][United States Congress]] (and broadcast nation-wide on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television][television]]/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio][radio]]), only a week before the start of the famous "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive][Tet Offensive]]" in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam][South Vietnam]] during the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War][Vietnam War]] and three days after 31 men of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea][North Korea's]] "KPA Unit 12" had infiltrated across the Korea DMZ (De-militarized Zone, Armistice Demarcation Line from Truce of July 1953, ending [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War][Korean War]]) in an attempt to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_House_Raid][attack the South Korean "Blue House" executive mansion]] in the capital [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul][Seoul]]. The subsequent 11-month prisoner drama was a major incident in the continuing half-century long [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War][Cold War]] between the "West" of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist][capitalist]] democracies and the "East" of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist][Communist]] states led by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Soviet_Socialist_Republics][Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Republic_of_China][Peoples' Republic of China]] ("Communist China" or "Red China").
