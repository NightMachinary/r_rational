  No, Worm isn't really rational fiction. That's because it was never intended to be. And you can look at how Worm was constructed to see why it would be really hard for it to qualify.

  Worm's world was built backwards. Wildbow had an end result - superheroes in costume, fighting each other on the streets, with almost all of the tropes that you would expect if you had been exposed to superheroes through comic books. Everything else was built with this end result in mind, and if anything contradicted that end result, it needed to get massaged.

I think you might need to check your definition of 'rational fiction', it's less about the setting's construction and more about character actions within that setting. Hell, you just disqualified HPMoR.
