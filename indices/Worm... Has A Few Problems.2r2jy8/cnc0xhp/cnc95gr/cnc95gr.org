Agreed, Cauldron annoyed me as well. There's so much munchkin you can do with their powers and resources and knowledge, and they squander it away by doing the stupidest shit ever. They are a giant plot device used to justify the crazy crazy world and society.

From a narrative point of view, I think they were given too much power for them to act the way they are. They should have been nerfed pretty significantly to make the story more believable. Particularly Contessa with her win button is atrocious as a character. To have someone like her in a story begs for the readers to cry "bullshit", however you write the plot. It would be a lot more interesting if they were just a group of regular parahumans with mostly physical powers, with access to more knowledge about how the powers etc work than anyone, trying to manipulate the world into stopping the end of the world scenario, in my opinion.
