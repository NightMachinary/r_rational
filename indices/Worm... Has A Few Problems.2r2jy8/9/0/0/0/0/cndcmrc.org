True, true. We'll need to evac the solar system to have a chance. And only travel in small groups. Get a big propaganda 'Arc Program' for like a million people each, and then /we'll/ leave in groups of 3-5 in order for them to concentrate fire on the Arcs and leave us alone. Hopefully, there will still be cities on Terra, and we'll be far enough away that they can't have us as a valid target to reach within their cycling Endbringer timetable.

Though, how good is Behemoth at math and physics? I mean, the Simurgh is probably going to get annoyed if she has to catch him floating through space often enough.
