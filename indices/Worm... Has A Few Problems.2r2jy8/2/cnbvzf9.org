I agree that Worm isn't exactly what I would call Rational fiction, but it is more self-consistent than you give it credit for.

Regarding endbringers:

Eliminating them isn't really a solution. In fact, eliminating them may be a net loss to humanity. For example, consider the events [[#s][spoiler]]. Things get worse because [[#s][spoiler]] There is ample reason to believe that the people really in power might have known this could happen.

Regarding villains:

You bring up Lung, saying you'd have him assassinated. Are you forgetting that he single-handedly fought off Leviathan in Tokyo? The truce exists to ensure that the powerful villians can stick around to fight Endbringers when they show up.
