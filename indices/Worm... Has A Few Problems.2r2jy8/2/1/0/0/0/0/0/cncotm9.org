Based on your comments I've concluded that you believe everyone in the world of Worm is a moron.

Compared to you and me, there are many people smarter, more experienced, and skilled in the relevant fields necessary to make this decision which exist in the real world.

There is no reason to believe equivalent people do not exist in Worm. There are also people supernaturally empowered to make these decisions.

I don't need to know the values for X, Y, and Z. I assume people who know those values exist. I assume people who can evaluate those values exist. I assume people who can make mostly rational decisions based on those values exist. I'm confident that those assumptions are reasonable based on evidence in the source material.

If you disagree with those assumptions, I don't know what to tell you.
