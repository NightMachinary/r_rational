Depends on if you think Endbringers can really be killed, and for most of the story (and 10+ years of history in-story) it seems pretty unlikely. Even when [[#s][spoiler]]

If you go out of your way to attack them and you don't succeed, you just threw away a lot of cape lives. If they don't alter their attack schedule it's a complete waste.

The people really in power know there are probably more Endbringers waiting in the wings. Even if they're successful at killing one, if another replaces it, it's a net loss. They have humanity fighting a delaying action as they prep for [[#s][spoiler]], so they're conserving cape lives and resources in general.
