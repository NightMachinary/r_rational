Wasn't Simurgh like 300 km over some country when first introduced? Not exactly inaccessible. Hard to reach for most capes, but not for tinker weaponry. Ocean floor could totally be bombarded with nuclear weapons. Reaching core is a problem, but no way that Behemoths movement is unnoticed by seismographs and we could just have Foil standing over him and dropping arrows on the ground (wiki doesn't say anything about her effective range).
