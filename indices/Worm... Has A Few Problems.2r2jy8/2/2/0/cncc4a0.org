I certainly believe they didn't use Clockblocker to his full potential. They should have paired him with some invincibility granting capes to get him close enough to strike.

I suspect the reason they don't continuously lock down using Clockblocker (they do tag him during the fight) is that they anticipate that in the extremely short moment between becoming unfrozen and being refrozen, he can escape/kill Clockblocker.
