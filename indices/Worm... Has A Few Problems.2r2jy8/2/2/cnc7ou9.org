So, if Endbringers dying is bad, then I propose the following plan of attack for Leviathan:

1. Apply Clockblocker.

2. Acquire Flechette/Foil and Armsmaster.

3. Restrain Leviathan as much as possible without impeding yourself.

4. When he resumes behaving causally, remove his limbs: legs, arms, and tail; in that order.

5. More Clockblocker.

6. Build him into a new Hoover Dam, /Attack On Titan/-style.
