No, but for smaller groups I can say, "Well, Cauldron suffers from groupthink," and "Taylor is so mystefying to me in every way that I cannot adequately analyze her motives." For the Endbringers/Villains, you have the resources of people who are /supernaturally smart/ and can make /supernaturally powerful weapons/. Bonesaw is dangerous, but Bonesaw vs. every other Tinker? Jack Slash is dangerous, but Jack Slash vs. Alexandria (or Weld)?

Rinse and repeat for every hostile parahuman.
