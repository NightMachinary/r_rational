I know the birdcage is specifically kept "just in case." There's hundreds of supremely powerful villains in it, any number of which could potentially be utilized in extreme situations.

And remember, Cauldron is machinating most of the shenanigans.

And Cauldron uses Contessa.

And Contessa uses a Shard.

And Shards are compromised hardware.

It all comes down to evil super-power granting space whale amoebas messing with peoples heads.
