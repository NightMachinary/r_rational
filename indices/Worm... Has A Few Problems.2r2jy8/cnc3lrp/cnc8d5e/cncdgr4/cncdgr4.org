  Tinkertech is extremely expensive to make, but is it more expensive than having to rebuild a major city once every three months?
#+end_quote

It's not an either or thing. Endbringers can survive an unbelievable amount of abuse. You might make some incredibly expensive tinkertech, try to kill them, and fail. People probably have. They can tank nukes. So, you spend billions of dollars making this tinkertech, exhaust your country's supply of rare metals, call in every favor to get extra tinker tech and boosts then throw it at the Endbringer. They survive it, smash up all your stuff. What do you do now? You don't have cash to repair your city, you're out of favors, you can't repeat this.

  Dragon may have limits on the number of bodies she can control directly, but there are tonnes of drones monitoring the exterior of the Birdcage.
#+end_quote

Dumb expensive drones. You can use them but then you can't stop major criminals. If you make more, see above.

  You wouldn't need to mass-produce the Armsmaster weapon, you'd only need three: one for Eidolon, one for Alexandria, one for Armsmaster.
#+end_quote

Probably a bad idea, if they manage to subvert the weapons you've lost your big three heroes. But even if it works then the endbringers just have to smash the machines to stop the threat. Eidelon and Alexandria are so useful because they're invulnerable, tinker tech isn't.

#+begin_quote
  The sort of unconventional weaponry I'm imagining is demonstrably invented by Dragon, in the form of everything she has equipped her armour with, ever. Even so, your resources for dealing with the Simurgh would be all of the Tinkers.
#+end_quote

Skitter beat her armor, it's not that effective. Not endbringer level.

#+begin_quote
  So why does this united force not exist? I'm not saying it has to be all capes; even the armed forces would suffice.
#+end_quote

Capes become capes via traumatic trigger events making them all a bit insane, and their passengers encourage them to fight so they're bad at unity. Notably in story the E88 Nazis have more firepower than the PRT. Armed responses can't defeat endbringers and are more expensive than capes.

#+begin_quote
  Not only does he not fight Leviathan when he shows up in the same city, he also gets arrested and escapes. He's clearly really fucking dangerous, why does than not justify using elephant tranquilizers at the very least?
#+end_quote

If he's fucking dangerous once to an endbringer he could save millions of lives. Him beating up a few people and fighting some capes isn't a major concern.

#+begin_quote
  Not amount of durability will save you from Flechette,
#+end_quote

No, or strong tinkertech or blasters, but this just means that conventional weapons aren't very effective at stopping them. You can bring tanks and planes and such but shatterbird and siberian and crawler can probably take them.

#+begin_quote
  Jack's capacity to deal with unexpected threats looks like an informed ability.
#+end_quote

It's very explicitly stated in the text, he has a thinker ability to deal with parahumans. He often uses it, in text.

#+begin_quote
  If Bonesaw has plagues on her person, it's time to bust out the parahumans with force fields. If they're hidden around the world, time to bust out the Thinkers before you kill her.
#+end_quote

You can try and make a really big effort to kill them all, but they've always slipped through. Siberian is the big issue. You can send all the forces you like but they can just hide and let Siberian slowly destroy them while any long ranged ones slice up your forces. Tinkers and forcefield capes often have limitations.

#+begin_quote
  Butcher should have a kill order, because turning heroes into successively more powerful villains sounds like the sort of thing you'd want off your plate.
#+end_quote

You don't get a kill order for that. You get a kill order when everyone, villains included, thinks someone has gone off the rails and really needs to die. You get it when Billy the Biker psycho thinks whoever went too far. You get a kill order when you want the villains to help you. If you use them lightly the villains (who outnumber the heroes) won't comply with anti S9 or endbringer efforts or kill orders.

#+begin_quote
  So maybe not an actual bomb. But if the Thinkers foresaw his death negatively affecting the world, why didn't they foresee his role in the apocalypse? Or everything else, for that matter?
#+end_quote

Most tinker powers are limited, they can't foresee everything. They might scan him and get a red if you attack, not a clear message that if you do that something will happen. You know from experience red means over a million deaths and is bad, but you don't know what exactly it means.

#+begin_quote
  “Tragic,” Bakuda spoke, on her next rest. “This is beautiful work. Not the actual assembly, that's crap. It's obvious the tinker that designed this intended it to be put together by regular schmoes. Wouldn't have screws and shit, otherwise. But the way it's designed, the way everything fits together... makes a scientist proud. Hate to butcher it.”
#+end_quote

She's saying that this particular piece of tinkertech was made in parts to be assembled, not that people can generally reproduce it.

#+begin_quote
  PRT containment foam is Tinker-made.
#+end_quote

It's a fairly low tech bit of tinker tech made by dragon. She can make a lot of stuff, being an AI. She has many other priorities and isn't as good at tinkertech as specialists in particular subjects.
