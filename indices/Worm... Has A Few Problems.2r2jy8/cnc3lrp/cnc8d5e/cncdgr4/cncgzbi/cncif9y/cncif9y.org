  Tinkertech is demonstrably capable of harming Endbringers. Furthermore, you don't need to spend personal resources on destroying them, since it's in everyone's best interests to kill them.
#+end_quote

It's demonstrably capable of peeling off the outer layers. Not harming the core.

#+begin_quote
  Why can't Dragon make more, exactly? She has a personal budget great enough to finance an inescapable prison, for one.
#+end_quote

She can make more but the endbringers are pretty tough and making a major effort to destroy them means bringing a lot of firepower. Plus she's a tinker, her drones aren't, her personal attention may be needed for items.

#+begin_quote
  But how would Behemoth or Leviathan 'subvert' Armsmaster's weapon, which needs to be maintained by him personally?
#+end_quote

Knock Legend or Eidelon or Alexandria into them. If it can hurt Endbringers maybe it can hurt them.

#+begin_quote
  You, however, have opened a can of worms. If Eidolon et al. are too valuable to lose fighting Endbringers, why do they do it anyways?
#+end_quote

They're invulnerable and can't be harmed by most things.

#+begin_quote
  Leviathan found a point to get a solid grip on Dragon's armor, and tore off a plate. His next swipe took off another, and it careened a good twenty feet before landing with a heavy splash, close enough to me that I was caught in the spray.
#+end_quote

Whilst playing around he can destroy the suits easily enough, and they did negligible damage in story. If he went all out he could do a lot more damage.

#+begin_quote
  They seem pretty unified in the story. And non-cape forces could defeat Endbringers with judicious use of Armsmaster's weapon. Furthermore, the army would be more useful against threats like the Slaughterhouse 9 than Endbringers.
#+end_quote

Tinkertech still isn't mass producible, I don't think they tried the nanothorns on the Endbringer's core which can negate powers. Probably would have failed.

They have a master cape, they can subvert the army. They can control glass en masse, they can probably take out the army from afar.

#+begin_quote
  He didn't save any lives when he fought Leviathan the first time
#+end_quote

I'm not sure you're getting my point. They don't care if capes kill a few people much, especially if it's just cape on cape battles and gang members. He's a very low priority, and a small chance of him helping makes him a low priority.

#+begin_quote
  Tanks and planes are for use against Bonesaw and the like, capes are for use against the Siberian and Crawler and the like. If you aren't somehow immune to being shot by the biggest rifle in existence (counting Tinkertech) from some distance away, or if you're not Bonesaw, that's what should happen. Then you use Flechette against the Siberian, and so on.
#+end_quote

They have a limited number of super monster killers like Flechette and don't really know she can stop Siberian till late in the story. It doesn't take anyway, Siberian pops up again in a bit. Crawler probably is immune to most tinkertech, Siberian definitely is. They literally have nothing that can defeat Siberian.

#+begin_quote
  As I said, Jack Slash could be shot from really far away by a non-parahuman, and there's nothing he can really do about it.
#+end_quote

Cherish can sense emotions, she can locate and destroy anyone who does this, plus shatterbird can destroy anything with electronics in it. Jack isn't going to die easily bar strong tinkertech so it's easy for this to fail. Plus you can't easily locate him.

#+begin_quote
  He may be a moderating influence on the Siberian, which is why Flechette or Armsmaster would be brought in to deal with her, in such a way that Jack Slash is already dead by the time they're informed of the plan.
#+end_quote

They can't deal with her, she's invulnerable. Do you know her power?

#+begin_quote
  But what would prevent them from being useful here?
#+end_quote

Their usefulness is against Bonesaw's creativity to get her plague out. If they mess up millions or billions die.

#+begin_quote
  But you should also be put under arrest for breaking the law, and there should be serious repercussions for killing people at all.
#+end_quote

This is [[/r/rational]] not [[/r/protectandserve]] . A 1/100 chance of saving 10 million is better than a 1/2 chance of saving 50 people.

#+begin_quote
  Are you saying that every Thinker offscreen only gets vague warnings about outcomes? Can they foresee anything? What about Jack Slash, why did only Dinah Alcot predict that he would try and end the world?
#+end_quote

Dinah is at the very top tier of thinkers. Most are vastly inferior. They have many threats and a limited pool of thinkers.

#+begin_quote
  I didn't mean to imply that the nanothorn weapon had to be mass-reproducible, just that Armsmaster needed to make at least one more (or repair the first one), and then use it immediately on the next attack.
#+end_quote

He did, and gave one to Dragon. He (obviously) doesn't like or trust the PRT much.

#+begin_quote
  WHAT PRIORITIES DOES DRAGON HAVE THAT OUTRANK KILLING THE ENDBRINGERS???
#+end_quote

Have you read her interlude?
