  Consider Dragon. Her general limits do not include a cap on the number of individual robots controlled, so why not create thousands of Dragons, each optimally suited to fighting en masse?
#+end_quote

Tinkertech is extremely expensive, tricky to make, Dragon is heavily limited by her AI controls on how many robots she can make, Defiant aids her with that.

#+begin_quote
  you'd think that he'd be put to work mass-producing more of those anti-Endbringer things, right?
#+end_quote

Tinker shards are heavily limited, in particular Scion's shards aren't good at mass production. Eden's tinker shards are more suited for mass production. As seen in the serial tinkers always want to focus on new ideas. Plus it's less effective against Behomoth, who has an energy aura that destroys things like tinker weapons, and Simurgh who has telekinesis to destroy things.

#+begin_quote
  Consider the Simurgh[2] in an interlude, where Dragon describes her as being 315km above Spain, docile, "beyond the limits of conventonal weapons." Putting aside whether that's actually outside the range of conventional weaponry, the solution here is to build unconventional weapons, because you are a Tinker and an AI.

This only works if you have the missile tinker tech line or laser tinker tech line.

  Supervillains in general are apparently tolerated for their usefulness in Endbringer fights, but what about capes like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse 9?
#+end_quote

They have kill on sight orders and substantial bounties. You can't put a kill on sight order on everyone though or capes will not comply with them. You need a united force to stop endbringers and the S9.

  Speaking of Lung, why is he never just shot by the police? Or the National Guard? Or the Army? He may be immune to small-arms fire even at the beginning of a fight, but why not assassinate him from a block away, while he's asleep, with a bullet calibre suitable for anti-tank weaponry?
#+end_quote

Because in his final form he can stop endbringers and he generally mostly attacks other gangs and capes. He's not a major threat.

#+begin_quote
  If the sort of highly-trained professionals who evidently do not exist in Worm were to try to kill Shatterbird, or Burnscar, or Bonesaw, or Jack Slash, or Cherish, knowing all the relevant details (and they would, because Wikipedia is a powerful force for good), there would be no contest.
#+end_quote

They have durability boosts from Bonesaw and Jack is pretty smart at dealing with threats. That said, they do have a high death rate. If Bonesaw goes all out she can release plagues that mass kill humans which means killing her is a dangerous activity.

#+begin_quote
  For Crawler and Butcher
#+end_quote

Butcher doesn't have a kill order because she mostly attacks other capes, Crawler has the protection of the S9 and will resist any attempts to launch him into space.

#+begin_quote
  Nilbog might actually warrant thermonuclear attention.
#+end_quote

They got thinkers to check on that, the result was that this would result in mass death of humans due to a bioplague he created. He's not doing anything, better to just ignore him, check on him regularly.

#+begin_quote
  There are five Tinkers in Brockton Bay alone, which accounts for who-even-knows how many worldwide, and the world doesn't look appreciably different for having supernatural technological insight in any way.
#+end_quote

Their main advantage is in personal combat tinkertech isn't reproducible despite what you say.
