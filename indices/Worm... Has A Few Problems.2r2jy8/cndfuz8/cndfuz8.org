  Nilbog might actually warrant thermonuclear attention.

Possibly, but I think you'd want sustained attention more than a burst. You nuke a site, you can't really have air traffic in the area. I'd just carpet bomb. Start with incendiaries, then after a couple hours mix high explosives with bunker busters.

I think the problem is that the author wanted, very badly, to tell a story that was mainly capes vs capes. The PRT's non-cape personnel exist to make the story not entirely about capes, to make normal people seem a little less powerless, but still, general and effective solutions that limit the amount of direct cape involvement get in the way of that story.

It would take an exceedingly clever author to come up with powers that were mostly immune to clever use of the laws of physics.
