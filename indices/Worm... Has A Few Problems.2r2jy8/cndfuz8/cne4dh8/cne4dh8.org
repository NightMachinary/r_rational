I wrote a fanfic of Worm where an original character named Murphy was entirely immune to any harm attempted against him. His power would predict events that might cause him harm, and alter reality as needed to prevent that harm. It only failed him when Scion ran his shard out of power.

The problem with his power was that it was completely out of his control, and seemed to use the least energy possible to guarantee a 100% success rate. The more upset he got, the more reactive the power got, going off at even the slightest provocation if he was extremely upset.

In other words, if you attacked Murphy with the intent to do him harm, anything that could go wrong would go wrong, and save him from the harm you tried to inflict on him.
