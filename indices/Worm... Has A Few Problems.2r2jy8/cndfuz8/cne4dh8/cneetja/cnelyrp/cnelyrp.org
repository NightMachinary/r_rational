Umm, OK. The story is called 'Arc' It can be found at the link below, after the warning. Murphy is not the main character, but he appears in several scenes.

WARNING: This is the first fiction I wrote since college. I went back through and cleaned it up a few times, but I haven't touched it recently, and I know there are verb tense errors, amongst other things.

That being said, a lot of people seemed to enjoy it, based on the reviews. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9523770/1/Arc]]

*Edit Add* Ouch. I just briefly scanned through it for the first time in many months. It's painful to read. I should rewrite it but I write so much differently now that I'd probably have to devote a whole day to each chapter.
