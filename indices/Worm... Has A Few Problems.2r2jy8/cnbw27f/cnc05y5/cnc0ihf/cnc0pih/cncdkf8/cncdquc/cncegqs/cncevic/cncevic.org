In her interlude, she thinks about how she was saving her family with knowledge she didn't have earlier that night, and also that she had been patching up her family for hours. Technically it is possible that the S9 showed up after she triggered, but it seems more likely that they went into her house, cut up her family, then realized that the child had triggered from the event. Or at least something similar. I find it hard to believe that she triggered first, and then the S9 showed up there within a few hours completely unrelated to her trigger
