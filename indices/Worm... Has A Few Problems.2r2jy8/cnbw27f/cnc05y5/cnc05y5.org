I like your comment for a variety of reasons, and would like to disagree on some points and expand upon others.

First, I think that Worm should be classified as a rational work, though certainly not rationalist which we both agree on, because generally the characters act according to clear goals and believe able personalities, and very rarely if ever do characters hold the idiot ball when their previous characterization would suggest that they should be intelligent. There are certainly plenty of instances where groups or individuals act irrationally, but this is often explicitly acknowledged by some other group or person.

Panacea has one of the most useful powers of any hero, but doesn't use her power except for healing. Why? Because she simply is not creative and sets hard rules for herself that limit what she can do. This is rather irrational and ineffective, as was acknowledged by Skitter and I think Bonesaw.

Why does humanity not band together to fight the End bringers more effectively? Well, in case you missed half of what skitter says, it was repeatedly drilled into the reader that capes simply do not work as effectively in groups, and have massive issues cooperating on even a moderately large scale. There are only a few thousand or so capes in the world(iirc), and there are nearly as many competing factions. Just in Brockton Bay we have the Undersiders, wards/protectorate, ABB, E88, New Wave, Coil, and probably more that I'm forgetting, as well as any number of rogues like Parian. The only cohesive group with more than a dozen capes are the protectorate and wards, and they aren't exceeding that number by much and have plenty of issues internally.

More about the rational side of things: the characters aren't divided into good or evil, with the main character starting off as a relatable villain who transitions into an absolute monster, and we know just about every step of her way there. Sure, there are heroes and villains, but the heroes are nearly as often as not as bad as the villains, and a few factions firmly say that they are eneither heroes nor villains.

Second, I want to expand on the S-class threat designation.

So Nilbog and the S9 are two threats that have been mentioned here. Nilbog, although designated a class S threat, is relatively stable walled in his town. Yes, if he ever broke out he warrants an immediate show of absolute force, but until that happens he is of little threat. The suggested H-bomb could work, true. But given how durable capes can potentially be, and since not a huge amount is known about Nilbog, there is little reason to strike when there is the chance he could survive and retaliate. He has self replicating monstrosities, and any way to avoid those becoming loose is worth leaving one latent threat content to sleep.

The S9 are another story. Like any class S threat, they are kill on sight. However, it isn't necessarily a good idea to seek them out, because of the Siberian. She, to the PRT's knowledge, is completely invincible, and can make anyone she is touching invincible as well. Bonesaw and Jack are one of the few things keeping her from doing more damage than she currently does. Bonesaw as well is explicitly said to have plagues stored within her body to be released if she dies. Jack keeps them two in line, to follow his rules and only do selective damage. Every other member of the 9 is expendable, and most of them do die. In conclusion, there is little point in going on the offensive towards them until the nature of the Siberian was revealed. Cauldron did not target them, and therefore the PRT as well, because they caused trigger events, which lead to more capes.
