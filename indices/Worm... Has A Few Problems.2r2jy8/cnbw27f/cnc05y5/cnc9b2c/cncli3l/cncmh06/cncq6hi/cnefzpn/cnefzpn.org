I don't recall -- was it ever stated that the cores are capable of anything other than regeneration? If you nanothorned all the exterior layers and were just left with an ultradense ball'o'core sitting there, could it move? Could it use any powers to hurt you? If not, maybe just strip the excess layers off and then just build a nanothorn cabinet around it that disintegrates the new flesh as fast as it regenerates.

If there canon on this either way?
