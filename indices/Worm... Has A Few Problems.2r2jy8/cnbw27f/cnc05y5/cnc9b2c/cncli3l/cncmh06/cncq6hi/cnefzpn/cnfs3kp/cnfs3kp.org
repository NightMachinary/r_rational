That is an interesting concept. I would imagine the cores would be able to use powers, being the core of the things (Beings? Creatures? Shardlings?) but if Levi can't move, he can't make water-shadows, and he would be pretty easy to contain after that. I think Behemoth can't be contained or harmed by the thorns at any level, due to their susceptibility to fire, but I could be wrong. Although if you want to take those things anywhere near the Smurf, I will be on another continent. Or another reality, if I can barter a door from Cauldron. That thing is by far the scariest of them.

Although an Endbringer containment chamber does seem like a pretty big target for an Endbringer to try a jailbreak. Two for the price of one, either way. You either have two Endbringers in one location, killing everybody for the lulz, or you've just bagged yourself a second Endbringer.
