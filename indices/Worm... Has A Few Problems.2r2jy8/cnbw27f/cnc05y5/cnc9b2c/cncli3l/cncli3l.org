  Then... don't use capes? Endbringers could be killed by an army with Contessa at the helm, or Dragon, or Tattletale. Or Eidolon, with the power to Shoot Really Accurately, armed with a Tinker weapon that can kill Endbringers. I could go on for another paragraph, but you get the idea.

I don't agree with this statement at all. No amount of conventional force can kill an Endbringer, that's the whole point. If nanomolecular thorns and nukes can't deal damage to the physics-breaking cores, then no amount of soldiers hunkering down with guns, bombs, or whatever is going to do anything. And in order for there to be a Tinker weapon to kill Endbringers, there would need to be a Tinker capable of building such a weapon, which we see no evidence of in-story. It's easy to say "Contessa should just win," and yet much harder to plan out exactly how she could do this with only the resources she has, not the ones you can make up for her to use. For instance, I would've thought a worldwide network of alert stations to tell Scion when an Endbringer attack was occurring would be a fairly effective weapon, but it would also reduce the amount of parahumans created during Endbringer attacks, which is contrary to Cauldron's purpose.

  But you must admit that Shatterbird, Jack Slash, and Burnscar could easily be taken out from two kilometers away by a sniper without any powers.

So could Osama bin Laden. That only took just shy of ten years, and he didn't have access to the worlds best surgeon. And I'm pretty sure it's stated in story that Bonesaw upgraded the S9 fairly heavily.
