  Why does humanity not band together to fight the End bringers more effectively? Well, in case you missed half of what skitter says, it was repeatedly drilled into the reader that capes simply do not work as effectively in groups, and have massive issues cooperating on even a moderately large scale.

Then... don't use capes? Endbringers could be killed by an army with Contessa at the helm, or Dragon, or Tattletale. Or Eidolon, with the power to Shoot Really Accurately, armed with a Tinker weapon that can kill Endbringers. I could go on for another paragraph, but you get the idea.

Nilbog is a bad example here, so instead let's say Mannequin. We don't need to use conventional weapons of mass destruction because of Tinkers. It could just as easily be a force field with no atmosphere inside, or a beam weapon that converts phospholipids into arsenic, or a telefrag device that switches your brain with your liver, or any cape like Cherish who can make you self-destruct, or or or or...

But you must admit that Shatterbird, Jack Slash, and Burnscar could easily be taken out from two kilometers away by a sniper without any powers.
