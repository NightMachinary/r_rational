Some of my previous comments on Worm and general plot holes, in case you need more evidence on lack of rationality in the story.

And why bother trying to destroy EB's when so far they have been able to regenerate all the damage done to them and are definitely not unique biological creatures, and therefore if you destroy one, the enemy can always make more, just bide your time until a Tinker makes an end all superpowers device and then use conventional warfare, or something like that.
