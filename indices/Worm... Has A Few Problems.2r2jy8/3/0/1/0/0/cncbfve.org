There are a number of things that you'd do the moment you realized that people were gaining powers from triggering. For /most/ of them, Wildbow realized that this was the case and then declared that they don't work, but here's what I think you'd try, in roughly the order I think you'd try them:

1. Try to induce triggers through medical/chemical means in laboratory conditions.
2. Try to induce triggers through psychological means in laboratory conditions.
3. Try to induce triggers through actual trauma in laboratory conditions using unwilling subjects.
4. Try to induce triggers out in the real world using any of the above methods with agents (or a team) under your control.
5. Allow triggers to happen through non-intervention in terrible events.

Even if I accept the dubious proposition that the Slaughterhouse Nine are creating more useful capes than they're killing, the whole thing is entirely uncontrolled and unobserved. Bonesaw gets triggered /and then immediately gets inducted into the Slaughterhouse Nine/ for a period of what, ten years or so? I can't really put that in the plus column for Cauldron.

Of course, they have Contessa on their side, so it's possible that the answer is just a cop out "this method was chosen because that's what Contessa's power said to do, and it is therefore correct". But I obviously dislike that answer.
