I think it was mentioned somewhere that up to 1 in 5 people could manifest powers, but trigger events were too rare (hence the Africa situation). I'll assume this means that, genetically or otherwise, Cauldron can identify that 20%. Then get your hands on a parahuman who can manipulate your worst fears, or create nightmares, or Bonesaw, etc. and design trigger events that'll work either very quickly, or on a room full of the people who can trigger. Repeat until you have a few Eidolons and you're good to go.

Obviously not a perfect plan, but potentially better than what Cauldron was doing.
