  In Worm, however, there are people with powers that can locate people, solving that problem

I cannot recall anyone in canon who had the power to locate people. Can you provide evidence that a locator cape exists? I fully grant that it seems obvious that somebody should have something that works like that, but I don't remember anyone who does...

I also don't remember if there's a reason stated why Dinah didn't find them (beyond her age, since she wasn't manifested through most of S9's career. But after, she should be able to find the futures where they get caught and killed)
