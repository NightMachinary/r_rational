That's what I was noting. Armsmaster thought he came close, but Levi was literally playing wounded, and people died for nothing.

The bomb went off, and Behemoth freaked the fuck out and went into overdrive, charging not at Phir Se, but at the hospital holding all of the wounded capes before Scion killed him.

When Scion was about to kill him, he want nuclear and everyone was lucky that Scion lifted his body out of the area before then.

They tended to do that; let people come up with attacks, pretend to fall for them and then shit on everyone as they got a little hope.
