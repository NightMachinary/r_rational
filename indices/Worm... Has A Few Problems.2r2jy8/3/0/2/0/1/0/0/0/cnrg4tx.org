All backfired, and none showed any promise at delivering an actual kill. Hell, none of the three listed even resulting in driving off the Endbringer and /did/ trigger bursts of escalation. Every reader seems to have a clever plan to kill one, but far fewer consider that the current engagement policy might be the direct result of a few too many catastrophic backfires - and with all of the attacks unseen the the backstory, there's plenty of room for such a history.
