  The main thing I have is that nobody tries. If you're just going to say that it's impossible, so we give up without giving it a shot, you're not being rational. Even if the cores are totally indestructible, there's at least a chance that you could dispose of them (mass driver, Chicago overcoat, etc.)

Rule of thumb for conventionally possible solutions to Endbringers is "They tried that. It... didn't go well." By the time the story starts, there have already been roughly 50 Endbringer attacks with only three (Marun Field, Kyushu, Lausanne) being described in any detail. Assuming that absolutely nothing interesting happened off-screen is silly.
