The main thing I have is that /nobody tries/. If you're just going to say that it's impossible, so we give up without giving it a shot, you're not being rational. Even if the cores are totally indestructible, there's at least a chance that you could dispose of them (mass driver, Chicago overcoat, etc.)

Osama bin Laden wasn't a prolific serial killer. Also, it's specified in the Alaska thing that you have to be minimum Brute 5 to ignore small-arms fire. In which case I stand by the "More Gun" idea.

The Tinker weapon I was referring to was Armsmaster's nanothorn halberd. Maybe it can't kill Endbringers, but it mutilated Leviathan pretty badly. It seems to me that this effectiveness would prompt the superhero community to request more of them, to at least /test/ whether they're capable of killing Endbringers.

They can be killed. But saying they can only be killed by Scion uses knowledge that we, as readers, can only infer from events that they don't know about at the time.
