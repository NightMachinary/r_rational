The Endbringer's have been around for awhile in story. I find it rather unbelievable that nobody tried the mass-fire approach, especially off the start before the problem was fully understood. As I recall, the first Endbringer to appear was Behemoth. Sending in waves of normals against him would pretty much be like trying to wear out a cliff by blowing on it. So people figure only parahumans can really stand up to him, and anybody without powers strops throwing their lives away. I don't think it says anywhere nobody tried; it's much more likely that everybody who tried is dead (to me, at least).

We don't know to what level Bonesaw upgraded them. I grant you a sniper round to the head would probably do it, but the real problem is finding the shot in the first place. S9 have a history of bugging out and discouraging pursuit, then going to ground and not surfacing for some time. Hell, I imagine that if they were found in an isolated enough region, the nuclear option might be put on the table. But finding them is a real problem, especially given Bonesaw's ability to rework physical features. Best way would be Thinkers, I don't recall if there was a specific reason given for why the S9 weren't tracked that way.

Mutilation is not victory. Damage to the core is all that matters - anything less, and they regenerate. It's stated that they target certain objectives - if you can;t stop them from getting what they want, it doesn't matter that Leviathan has lost the first however many layers of skin. He's still won. Though your right that this would be reader knowledge. As for an in-story reason, they wont work at all against Behemoth, since he's all about the fire. Taking a tinker weapon like that up against the Simurgh is begging to have all of your constituent molecules go their separate ways, since they do know in story she can make use of Tinkertech in her area. Leviathan is the only real option for the nanothorns, and they didn't do that much good against him.

I never said killed. The primary strategy for Endbringer fights was to hold out until Scion shows up to chase them off. Victory is achieved by denying them their objectives, and having Scion show up sooner does that. I would say, with reader knowledge, Scion killing them is a net negative.
