Contessa doesn't want to kill Endbringers, she wants to kill Scion.

'Tinker weapon that can kill Endbringers' is a pretty huge thing. Do we know of any that exist?

H-Bombs are tended to not be dropped on occupied cities. And all of these Tinker items /don't exist in canon/. It seems to me that it can be rational if they don't use items that don't exist.

But how do you learn where they are with enough time to get snipers out and set up before they move on?
