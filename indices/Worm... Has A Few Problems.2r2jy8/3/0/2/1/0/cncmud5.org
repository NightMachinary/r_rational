Contessa's plan for dealing with Scion boils down to "make more capes", which as [[/u/Alexanderwales]] explains elsewhere, she doesn't do it very optimally.

The Tinker weapon I was thinking of is Armsmaster's nanoweapon. It may not be able to destroy the core, but not only do they not know that, it was actually effective.

I didn't suggest dropping an H-bomb on an occupied city.

You learn where they are using Thinkers, Dragon, and the trail of bloody murders they leave in their wake. Also, Crawler seems pretty damn hard to hide.
