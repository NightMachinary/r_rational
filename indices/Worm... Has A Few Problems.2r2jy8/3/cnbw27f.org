I'd like to preface this by saying spoilers for Worm all the way up to the conclusion. Look away all ye who haven't finished it.

Before I address individual points, let me first say that I agree that Worm isn't a "Rationalist" work, nor was it intended as one. It is a deconstructionist Superhero work, with the baggage and tropes that come with it. Having said that, its deconstruction is gritty, makes an attempt at realism and realistic consequences, and the main characters act more rationally than a stereotypical comic book villain (with the exception of the Slaughterhouse 9, which is ironically what makes them so deadly).

An oft repeated mantra of Tinkers is that they can't just hand out their gear or inventions or mass produce them because they require upkeep, be that because the gear is cobbled together by an excited person fueled more by excitement and ingenuity than rational methodical design or because the stuff is at least partially held together by magic or psychic powers or whatever you want to call the hero powers. This isn't a rule, but more of an excuse for why inventors would constantly take the field with their inventions to beat up doods rather than mass produce stuff to advance humanity.

And this leads to a core principle of Worm as a fictional work: it isn't designed to be a rational deconstruction of superhero fiction, or rationality applied perfectly to the genre. The author took a typical "superhero world" and asked "What rules would have to be in place for that behavior to be reasonable? What society and structure would have to spring up to support a typical superhero world? What consequences would that have?"

Tinker equipment can't be mass produced easily and often requires a Tinker in field. Dragon has a massive set of rules and principles constraining her behavior and prohibiting her from participating in self replication past a certain point.

The Endbringers are a difficult issue because there's a few things going on there, all centered around the issue that the heroes aren't supposed to fight the Endbringers except when a city is being attacked. You can make up rules about it, like there's no point in aggravating the Endbringers when they're asleep or Smurgh is controlling people to act that way or there's a shard interaction that makes it all behave that way, and it's all stupid because why would you deal with a problem like that reactively instead of proactively but the answer is because that's the rule that makes the superhero genre work. A massive monster that can't be stopped, only pushed away, and it takes all the heroes and villains together. That's the way the Endbringers were designed, in universe and by the author.

The villains are the same deal. The Birdcage exists for three reasons: 1. Because it's a tangible, believable, possibly worse than death threat that the good guys can use as a deterrent and not feel bad about it. 2. Because there's evidence that it was planned all along as a place to store guys for Cauldron to use in an end of the world scenario, people who would play along if the world was at stake, exactly like they were, and 3. Because the superhero universe says good guys can't kill unless the person is an unredeemable monster and even if the Birdcage isn't that different from death, the universe says that's an okay thing for GOOD GUYS to do.

And why haven't they killed the S9 or other class S threats by the time we, the readers, reach the universe? Because then we wouldn't have those guys to read about, or nobody with the incentive to figure it out has, or because the consequences of messing with Class S threats is worse than leaving them be (Bonesaw bioplagues, Nilbog contingencies, advancing the Endbringer attack timetable).

Ultimately, it isn't rational, it isn't rationalist, and it's not even plausible using in universe rules, but that doesn't make it a bad work or a worthless work. It's just that that universe has a strange, senseless, contradictory set of rules that require the tenants of the "superhero genre" to work.

But that doesn't make it not a useful work to explore creativity or rational thinking, and it certainly doesn't make it a bad piece of fiction. It's just that the universe is written with the constraints of superhero fiction, and that means that sometimes stuff happens for the plot and people go irredeemably mad and everything can be blamed on a telepathic sky bird. That may be unsatisfying and it's certainly not rational or rationalist literature, but it wasn't written intended in that way.

TL;DR: Worm isn't a rational work, it's a deconstruction of the superhero genre that operates with a set of laws and with a set of characters which are inherently irrational in order to create a superhero universe. Having said that it's a great fictional work and a lot of fun, with tons of clever thinking, acting, and rationality in it, it just doesn't fit the bar for "rationalist literature" and that's okay.
