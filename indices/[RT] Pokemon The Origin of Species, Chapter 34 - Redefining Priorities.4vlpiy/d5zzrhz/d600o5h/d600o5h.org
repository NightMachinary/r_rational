  We also saw a bit of a timeskip during their journey, which was carried off well, and I hope there will be more of this sort of thing in the future, if only to speed up the development of the characters a bit.

Absolutely. Now that the majority of the groundwork for the characters and world's establishment is done, I'm planning more plot focused chapters.

Glad you're enjoying the story so much :) It still has a long way to go, but it's good to see that people are still enjoying it for what it is!
