One question I have about Red's plan is how they will set up the whole trap. It will be in an area containing wild Pok√©mon that might interfere, so setting up the speakers and getting ready in the centre would both run the risk of battles. In order to avoid scaring the Abras off before they start the experiment, they'd have to either deal with any other encounters quietly and discreetly, or set up and wait for the Abras to return. Neither of these options seem particularly practical. Looking forward to seeing how Red deals with this, and the other difficulties that will doubtless beset the experiment!
