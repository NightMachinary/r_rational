It's too bad that Red's plan for getting Abra didn't work out right away, but I liked it a lot. It's been a while since we've seen him come up with something like this. His plans are consistently clever and also carry a sort of signature of taking advantage of pokemon's instincts in various ways: they're very /him/ and very Ratfic, imo. It also makes me happy to see the faith that Blue and Green have in him.

Generally, I am quite happy with the developments in this chapter. The slow update pace, the high level of detail and large world, and [[/u/DaystarEld]]'s commitment to reasonable-ish rates of success make for a story that is sometimes a bit slow. In this chapter though, Red has finally started to devote some time to developing his abilities, and I am looking forward to future progress in this area. We also saw a bit of a timeskip during their journey, which was carried off well, and I hope there will be more of this sort of thing in the future, if only to speed up the development of the characters a bit. The more I think about this story, the more potential I think it has, and I can't wait to see these three start to act on a larger scale. Some of Daystar's comments on the podcast have caused me to revise upwards my estimation of where Red's ambitions will take him, and given his repeated references to Legendaries in and out of the text, I'm sure we'll see great things there.
