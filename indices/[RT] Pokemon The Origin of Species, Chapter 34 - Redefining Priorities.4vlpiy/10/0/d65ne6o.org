Thanks for the questions, first person to ask this :) It's a sort of mix of both. There are three major factors to psychic powers:

1) Inborn ability. The way people in the world conceptualize it, you either have it or you don't. If you put a scale on it, 1-10, those in the 1-2 range would be sensitives, and humans don't generally go above 5-6, which is where psychic pokemon start. Alakazam would be a 10. Mewtwo isn't a known entity yet, so his abilities are off the scale.

This scale effects everything you do as a psychic. It's like a "general intelligence" score, your ability to comprehend new ideas, retain information, and think critically.

2) Your abilities. Telepathic Reading (reception),Telepathic Communication (projection), telekinesis, hypnosis, healing (pokemon only), teleportation (pokemon only), etc.

These aren't binary, so technically everyone might have access to all of them. But as far as humans can tell, there are some that no human has been able to accomplish, the ones labeled "pokemon only," and some people are so bad at some common ones that they effectively don't have the power. Which leads to:

3) Your training. People can improve their skills by instruction and practice, though there seem to be hard limits on individuals.

So combining all three, if we were to make a "beginner" character sheet of a psychic human, it might look like this:

Psychic (can't be improved by any known means)

Level: 4 / 10

Psychic Abilities (can be improved)

T. Reception: 1 / 4

T. Projection: 1 / 4

Telekinesis: 0 / 3

Hypnosis: 2 / 5
