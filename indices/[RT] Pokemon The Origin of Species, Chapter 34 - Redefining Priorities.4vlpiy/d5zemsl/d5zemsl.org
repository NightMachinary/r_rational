Hey everyone, welcome back! A couple quick notes: First, I hope those of you who've been listening to my podcast have been enjoying it, and I'm sorry if you've tried to download it without being able to. The current limit is 100 per episode, which apparently gets hit really quick after uploading each. Thanks to the continued support of my patrons, starting next week we'll likely go for the monthly paid account, which should allow for more downloads to be available!

Second, I hope everyone who's playing Pokemon GO's been having a blast with it. I haven't been able to play it as much as I'd like, and it's definitely not everything I wanted out of a pokemon AR game, but I've been enjoying playing it with friends here and there. What I do want to say is thanks to any readers who've been spreading the word about my story while you're out and about to fellow pokefans: after one of my readers admitted to doing so, I noticed that fanfiction's traffic graph is showing a steady upward tick ever since GO came out, beyond the usual, occasional spikes from it being linked somewhere on the web. until the average views to has nearly doubled from its usual mid-month resting point. It's humbling to know how much you guys enjoy the story, and I hope others have enjoyed it too.

Recent loss of the tracking aside, happy hunting to all! (Especially Team Instinct!)
