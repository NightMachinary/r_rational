Soundcloud is what we're using now, and it's only free for the first ~150 minutes of uploaded files :) That's the cap we've just about reached with this episode.

As far as I can tell from some quick googling, vocaroo is just a voice recording site, not a hosting one? Is there something I'm missing?

And Youtube is a great service for videos, but not quite as good for podcasts, as it doesn't allow many people to play them conveniently while driving or from mp3 players and so on.
