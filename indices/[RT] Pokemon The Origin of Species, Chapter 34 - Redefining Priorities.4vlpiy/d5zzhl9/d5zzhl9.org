Nice chapter! I'm looking forward to Red working more with his psychic powers, and his plan's also pretty neat if they can get enough people. That "predator/prey pokedex cry" trick seems to be quickly becoming his trademark, doesn't it. ;p

Also, in light of today's Sun/Moon info, I was wondering if you're thinking of incorporating Pokemon regional subspecies into the story? Considering that this is the first overt use of real evolution in Pokemon, not to mention that Alola is basically the Galapokegos Islands, it seems like that could be relevant.
