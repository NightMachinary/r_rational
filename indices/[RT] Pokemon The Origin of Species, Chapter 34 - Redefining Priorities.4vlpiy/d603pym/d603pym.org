I think the psychic/sensitive/dark trichotomy is interesting. Perhaps each is on its own spectrum, rather than all lying on the same one.

Possible line of inquiry: is there any degree of variability with being dark? For example, are there some people that are /hard/ to read, but not impossible?

If so, it's possible that it reflects a separate skill in its own right, and perhaps one that could be trained like psychic ability if it had an organised group of practitioners. The story has set up the fact that they really don't organise, due to stigma and the fact that the psychics dominate the scientific and popular narratives.

If not, why? What do dark people have/lack that results in a complete inability to interact with psychics and sensitives? It must either be something they have/lack or do/don't, and that something could provide the key to unravelling psychic phenomena in general.

My hypothesis is that the "dark spectrum" could have its own gradations that haven't been adequately explored because of the society they live in. If the narrative is "psychic > sensitive > normal >> dark", then people who are merely "slightly dark" will mentally put themselves in the "normal" bucket.

In this hypothesis, "dark" would mean "aptitude with mental defences". The stereotypical dark person would be both skilled in this area and unable to modulate it (much like Red can't modulate his psychic powers, if indeed he is psychic and not sensitive as a separate category).
