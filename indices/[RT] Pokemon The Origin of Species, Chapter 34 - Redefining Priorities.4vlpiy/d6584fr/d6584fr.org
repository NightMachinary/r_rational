And another question; in this story you've established that psychic power is genetic. However, is it genetic in the way muscle building is in real life, or how intelligence is defined in real life? To elaborate, if you're born an ectomorph in today's world, you're never going to win the strongman competition, but you can still get pretty damn strong. Do psychic powers work like that, with people able to make definite, concrete gains, or is it more nebulous like intelligence, with some psychics simply not being able to do some advanced skills and no one really knows why?
