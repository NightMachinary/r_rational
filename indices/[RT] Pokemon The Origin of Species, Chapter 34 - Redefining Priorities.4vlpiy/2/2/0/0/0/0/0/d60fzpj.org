Hmm. That's one I haven't encountered before, but looks promising. Only issue I can see so far is it has no RSS feed (no albums or branding in general, each file is treated as its own individual thing), so it can only be shared through direct links, embeds, and downloads.

Which might not be a dealbreaker, since I don't know how important things like itunes availability is to our listeners. I'll look into things like sound quality and potential bandwidth issues when I can.

Thanks!
