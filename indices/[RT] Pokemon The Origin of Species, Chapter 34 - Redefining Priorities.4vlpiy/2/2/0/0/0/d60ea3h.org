Yeah, it's still not a hosting site: the uploads are temporary :)

Yes, I've researched this before quite a bit, believe it or not. The only stable free sound hosting site that I found was archive.org, and from what I read it often has issues with lag and doesn't do rss feeds well.

Thanks for trying to help though! If you find an established and reliable service that's free, let me know!
