The loaded save state would also be good for people reading it later, since they see what pokemon there are at the time instead of eventually. Although I do think it would be interesting to have it use cookies to track how far they are into it when reading it on your website, and have it show whatever's current for that. I wrote a basic javascript program for that a while ago if you want it.
