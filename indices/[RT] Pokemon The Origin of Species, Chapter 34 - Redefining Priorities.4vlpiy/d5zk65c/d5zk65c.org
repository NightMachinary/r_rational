Nice work as always :)

  "Is Kemuri your lead, or your trump?" Red asks as he watches Blue run through drills with the shiftry during one of their rest stops.

  "If I can sweep with him, I will," Blue says. "But I know they're going to throw some bulk at me, and I'll have to wear that down with Gon and Maturin first. Ion will be the trump; if I don't reveal an Electric Type right away they might think I don't have one. Thanks again for him, Leaf."

When I'm reading this, I don't know what these Pokemon are. I don't doubt they were well introduced earlier in the story, but with all the time between chapters being released, and spending some chapters focused on different characters and locations, I just don't remember anything about these minor pokemon characters (Gon, Maturin, Ion, etc) - the key thing I'd like to know is what Pokemon they are.

One way to handle this is to make a point of /always/ doing what you did for Kemuri, mentioning that it is a Shiftry in very close proximity to where you first use it's name in this chapter (at least the first, more uses probably better). Having to work this in everywhere might get annoying for you.

Alternatively, you could just put the Pokemon in brackets after it..

That might feel a little inelegant. I don't think so, it gets the job done and we know to ignore it for the general flow.

I did find [[http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-team-roster/]] but TBH I only bothered searching for the purpose of writing this post (and having the pokemon names in the above example). Another option would be to provide this information more easily/prominently at the start of the chapter. I have a further suggestion for this option; tie in to your source material - the games. At the start of each chapter involving Red/Blue/Leaf, add something like this at the start:

  ** Loading Save State **

  Red:

  Charmander { Scratch, Tail Whip, Ember, Smokescreen }

  Spinarak { Poison Sting, Night Shade, Sticky Web, Bug Bite }

  Caterpie { Tackle, String Shot }

  Pichu { Thundershock, Quick Attack }

  Nidoran { Poison Sting, Horn Attack, Double Kick }

  Blue (Earth Badge):

  Squirtle "Maturin" { Water Gun, Bubblebeam, Rapid Spin, Withdraw }

  Pidgey "Zephyr" { Gust, Peck, Wing Attack, Quick Attack }

  Shroomish "Gon" { Absorb, Leech Seed, Poison Powder, Stun Spore, Headbutt }

  Shiftry "Kemuri" { Razor Leaf, Extrasensory, Feint Attack, Leaf Tornado }

  Ekans { Poison Sting, Bite, Acid, Wrap }

  Rattata "Joey" { Tackle, Bite, Quick Attack, Tail Whip }

  Zubat { Wing Attack, Leech Life, Poison Sting, Supersonic }

  Leaf:

  Rattata "Scamp" { Tackle, Bite, Quick Attack, Tail Whip }

  Pidgey "Crimson" { Gust, Peck, Wing Attack, Quick Attack }

  Ledyba { Comet Punch, Supersonic, Silver Wind }

  Beedrill { Poison Jab, Twinneedle, Fury Attack }

  Wigglytuff { Sing, Pound, Disable, Round }

Maybe that brings the feel away from being a story too much? Or maybe throw in some stats like days "played" for the characters for the extra game feel :)

The other advantage doing something like this would have is that unlike [[http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-team-roster/]] which is up to date, and potentially includes spoilers, this list at the start of the chapter would be specific to that point in time and spoiler free.
