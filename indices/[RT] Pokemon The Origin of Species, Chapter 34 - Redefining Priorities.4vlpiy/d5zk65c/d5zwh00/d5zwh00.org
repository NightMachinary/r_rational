Thanks, glad you enjoyed it!

I added a reference to Ion being the shinx, since he's a pretty new pokemon, but am still working on the best way to add in Maturin and Gon's species in the current dialogue. I really like the "loading save data" idea, that's pretty clever :) Ultimately it still feels like too bulky an opening to each chapter though. I'll think it over!
