Including something like "Kemuri, my Shiftry..," whenever a named pokemon appears for the first time would somewhat defeat the point of giving them names. The names are an intentional way of seperating them from the generic shiftry. If this was a story about literal pet dogs, cats, etc. I would imagine it would feel more natural to call them by character names, and more "important" in the readers mind to remember them.\\
I think that this problem might be helped a little if when names are introduced for the first time, there is a bit more of an explanations why those names were chosen, to solidify the sort of, metaphorical leap the name conveys between the generic shroomish and the specific Gon.

However, to completely contradict my whole point, I think it would actually be useful after story breaks like interludes to reintroduce the names of Pokemon, especially if they haven't been seen for awhile.
