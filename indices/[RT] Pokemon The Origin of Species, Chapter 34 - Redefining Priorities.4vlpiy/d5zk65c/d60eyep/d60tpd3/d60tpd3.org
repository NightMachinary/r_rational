It would certainly be unnatural for the characters to do that in dialogue. Red/Blue/Leaf would know their pokemon by name.

But if you look at the shiftry example, it is not in dialogue. It reads quite nicely and adds information. This is what I meant by "Having to work this in", it will take time and effort to find fresh ways to fit it in naturally in so many places.
