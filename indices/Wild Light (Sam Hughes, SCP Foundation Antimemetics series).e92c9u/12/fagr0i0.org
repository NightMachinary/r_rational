Perhaps I would have found myself more entertained had I read more than the first page, but as it stands, my first impressions of this book are poor. Where the book failed to meet my expectations:

1. The opening paragraphs were detailed, but wordy, and there was no context relative to the overall plot (In other words, the book tested my patience).

2. The book did not begin by providing background information about where/when it took place beforehand.

3. Why was the character visiting a place only to have his memories wiped? Again, my questions were not answered in what I consider to be a timely fashion.
