I dislike it. At this point, every chapter ends the same place it started. No progress, no real exposition, even. Just extraneous details which are unlikely to go anywhere, piling up the grim.

Antimemetics has been grimdark more or less from the start, but the last few updates have pushed it solidly to "grimderp"; grimdarkness which doesn't actually accomplish anything in either a Watsonian frame or a Doylist one.
