In reality, antimemetic effects are extremely limited and flimsy, mostly they work by stimulating the kind of pathways that biobrains use to pre-process visual input more quickly - the same pathways that optical illusions toy with. It's a kind of "invisibility through inconspicuousness". And the conscious slow-circuit thought completely bypasses it so it's immune to such effects by default. So not only do the anti-memes only work mostly 'by accident' they fail as soon as you are aware they exist.

As for retro-active deletion, like affecting your memories of having been consciously aware of something, it's nearly infeasible AFAIK because the brain stores memories along the processing circuits in a distributed way, and not in separate neurons dedicated to the task. It means you'd have to suppress the processing of the signal to make the memory of the specific signal go away, and as I understand it the only working method for such suppression is to create an encapsulating memory that actively reminds you you should avoid remembering. That's typically how [[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160125-the-blessing-and-curse-of-the-people-who-never-forget][people with eidetic memory]] manage to "forget" things: by remembering they ought to to not remember that thing. It requires conscious effort, and cannot be done unwillingly.

Aside from these considerations, one can teach their own brain to purposefully ignore or emphasize a specific signal, through auto-hypnosis. I've been toying with this, experimentally I can consciously skew or outright reverse the result in those "subconscious/implicit bias tests" that were popular around last year. By willingly hijacking your emotional responses you can literally train your brain into memetic immunity or extra-sensitivity for /anything/.

The autohypnosis thing is temporary (it lasts for as long as you maintain the conscious effort to divert), but if you repeat it often enough it can become permanent - e.g. I trained myself to un-notice Youtube adverts and click-bait titles, it's pretty trivial to do. Now my eyes glaze them over reflexively and after they're gone I cannot remember fnord their content even if I try. I know I can reverse the effect by consciously placing special emphasis on those things, a couple weeks of this and I would be seeing them again.

Any computerized systems that mimick / simulates accurately those biological systems would also be affected by those same features and quirks.
