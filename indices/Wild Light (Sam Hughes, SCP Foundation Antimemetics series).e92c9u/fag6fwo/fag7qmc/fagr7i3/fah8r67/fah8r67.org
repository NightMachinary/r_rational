Great chapter. I love all the buildup we've had until now that led to how important this one is, and the ending maintains that tension wonderfully.

My only criticism is that I wish SCP-3125 solely manifested through compromised human agents. The "arachnoform" attacks are a great bit of horror, but they cheapen the threat for me.
