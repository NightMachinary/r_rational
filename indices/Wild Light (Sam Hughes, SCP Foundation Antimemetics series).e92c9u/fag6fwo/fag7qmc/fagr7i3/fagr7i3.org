  "Bart Hughes wrote the file. He's dead," Marion says.

  "What happened to him?"

  "You don't want to know."

  There is a very long pause while both O5-8 and his assistant react to this. In fact, they pass through a long, discrete sequence of reactions. Indignation at the seeming rudeness; confusion at Wheeler's incaution in front of sinister superiors; surprise at the magnitude of the claim; pure disbelief; comprehension; and finally, horror.

  "What..." O5-8 asks carefully, "would happen if we did know?"

  "It would happen to you as well," Marion says, levelly.

Marion forgets what happens after the fact, so she just assumes that Bart died in some unspeakably horrible way instead of being shot by an ordinary gun.
