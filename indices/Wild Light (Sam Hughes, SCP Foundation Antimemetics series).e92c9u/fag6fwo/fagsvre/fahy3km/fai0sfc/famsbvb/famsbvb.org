  I've seen fictional descriptions of memetic weaponry and deadly memeplexes, but recognizing them IRL always includes thinking of “memetics” as a fictional field.

I think of it as a real field, albeit one not often studied under the name "memetics". But engineering ideas specifically to spread, get inside people's heads and affect them a certain way isn't anything new or fictional; it's what advertisers are paid to do. As memetics slowly becomes more widely accepted to exist, I expect we'll slowly edge closer to genuinely dangerous memetic hazards, though I doubt we'll see anything on the level of the stuff on SCP wiki.

Antimemes are probably also technically real, but only very weak ones. Antimemes by their very definition inhibit their own spread, and so they work towards their own destruction. Thus, any significantly effective antimeme would be too short lived to notice even if we COULD work around its antimemetic effect in order to realize it's worth paying attention to. But technically, all you have to do to make a weak antimeme is just be boring. If I post hundreds upon hundreds of random characters here, that text is probably less likely to spread than other "ideas" because there's no meaning to it and no reason for anyone to talk about it or bother remembering it. We are more likely to remember things that interest us, and less likely to remember things that don't.

This is why none of the antimemetic SCPs are pure antimemes, they're real objects (or mostly-non-antimemetic memeplexes, etc.) that have antimemetic properties. Because if they exist outside of just being ideas, they don't have this same restriction; destroying all knowledge of an idea kills the idea, but destroying all knowledge of an object leaves the object extant.
