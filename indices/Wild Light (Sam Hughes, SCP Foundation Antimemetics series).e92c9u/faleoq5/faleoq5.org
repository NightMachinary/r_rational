I have three sets of thoughts on this, and one is so long that I'm going to make it its own post (can I do that here? Is there a better place?). The other two are:

· My reaction and few nitpicks about this specific story

Really enjoyed it! I love the spooky but very on-theme backdrop of the SCP remains as the containment chamber. It follows the broad structure that makes SCP entries so satisfying: the lead up of paranoid containment procedures to produce suspense, the reveal of the situation (in this case where this story falls on the antimemetics timeline, and a chilling example of how fragile the counteroperations are), and additional flavor and twists. Very solidly executed.

The main thing which bugged me was the timing of Li's assassination attempt. If he had access to a "thick report" authored by Hughes himself saying that he's the only one who can do this, he wouldn't need to confirm it with him in person. He could have done it more easily and without blowing cover any number of other times and ways (as Hughes's direct superior). Having it happen "onscreen" was very cinematic, but I think a few details could be mentioned/changed to make it more logically consistent.

· My thoughts about the merit of the antimemetics stories in general and responses to a number of the comments here

I saw some criticisms about how grimdark it is and the lack of progress (go easy on the "diegetic", juniper), but personally that doesn't bother me, at least so far. A story can have merit and be interesting without promising or offering hope of a resolution. There are plenty of tragedies structured around the audience knowing it won't end well and just seeing the process, or watching the characters struggle and fail due to circumstance or their own flaws. There can also be smaller victories which make interesting stories within greater losses - I think this is particularly common with stories like this one where it's essentially a prequel. We already know that Anakin will become Darth Vader. The amount that a prequel or side story can "progress" the main narrative is necessarily bounded.

For my part, I enjoy the mental contortions involved in combating antimemetic threats, the types of dramatic reveals the setting almost uniquely allows, and the sense of slowly getting more pieces of the puzzle over the course of multiple works.
