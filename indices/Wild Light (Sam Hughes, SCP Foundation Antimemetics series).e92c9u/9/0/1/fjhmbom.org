  This study was able to model 2.6B neurons in real-time on a Stratix V FPGA. A cluster of 32 of those would just about get you to the number of neurons in a human brain, and a cluster of 64 would just about double the number of neurons.

Is fully replicating the functionality of a human neuron as easy as "modeling" one?
