This chapter of this story really helped me today. I read it during lunch and was inspired to write an email to myself: "Something that you can't do, but something that you must do, a mission whose failure would destroy you."

Later, and not for the first time, I read something devastating in a book I had turned to for help. It felt very much as if I had opened the door to my sealed bunker, and exposed myself to the monstrous oppression breeding outside. It shouldn't bother me so much, but it does.

I hope this story ends well. I hope that I can live out here with the monster. What good can I do if I'm trapped in a bunker?
