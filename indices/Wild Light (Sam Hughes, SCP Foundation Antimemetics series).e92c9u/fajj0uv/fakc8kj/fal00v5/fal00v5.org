Agreed. Many of the Antimemetics stories follow the "maybe there's a chance - haha no fuck you" without much deviation, but a few (including this one and Ara Orun/Unthreaded, following Adam Wheeler) and with a hope spot. Bart Hughes and Adam Wheeler both survive their encounters with SCP-3125, and they're each uniquely qualified to play a role in killing the thing.
