You'll not have to worry about that with this one. They are his biological children and the MC isn't a pervert. Even when people are trying to set him up for a new wife he's rationally considering what is the best choice, should he do it? How would it affect the kids? What kind of woman would be appropriate for his situation? That kind of thing..

He's not very 'loving' either, he's a proper asian dad. He works he pays the bills, tells his kids to study, is kind of distant, and expects to be supported by them after they get married and he gets old. So more of a chinese family structure than japanese.

It's korean, not japanese, and that might make it less likely. This is anecdotal but I've never seen any broadly incestuous stories come out of korea, I'm sure they exist but the rate is probably lower.
