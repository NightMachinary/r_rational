Lost my ability to read father-child manga/lightnovels after the third story which at first appeares to be a great and innocent and soulfull fluff, only to came out later as incest degeneracy. I just don't. fucking. understand. why that corner of media space just keep producing stories with that trop?!

Fucking Usagi Drop, you sneaked into my heart so much love, only to poison it all with author's revolting incest fantasies.
