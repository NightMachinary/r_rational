I just looked up the anime, and saw a glowing review for it that mentioned they were worried because "direction the manga took didn't sit well with me", but that they loved the anime nevertheless. Another one says that it stays true to the essence of the manga "before the timeskip". Maybe you can watch that, and pretend the manga was just a crappy fanfic?
