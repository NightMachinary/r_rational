I'm going to recommend the book /[[https://www.amazon.com/This-How-You-Lose-Time/dp/1534431004][This is How you Lose the Time War]]/ by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone.

The story is about two rival agents from different utopian(ish) futures fighting across time to make sure their future is the one that actual happens, or arguably is more likely to happen. It focuses on their letters and the relationship they develop over space and time. I'm recommending it for two reasons. One, it's very well written. The prose is some of the most beautiful I've read recently and the imagery is frequently striking. Two, the mechanics of time travel, though never explicitly discussed, are internally consistent and result in a brilliant conclusion that makes everything fall into place in a very satisfying way.

That said, it's not particularly rational in that it focuses more on the characters feel than on what they think. I can think of at least one time when a character makes a blatantly stupid decision, though in their defense they make the choice fully aware of the impending negative outcomes.

It's also fairly short, so if you're looking for something sweet to pass the time, give this one a try!
