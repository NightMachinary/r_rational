I cannot recommend this highly enough; it's a novella so it won't take you long. The letters from both agents were written by different authors so you get a very strong difference in voice, and the story and writing is excellent. I'd argue that it is rational, though not rationalist- at every point, the characters are thinking about the potential and likely consequences of their choices before they make them, and even the "stupid" choice referenced above is taken with the explicit acknowledgement of the likely consequences for both options and the information they do and don't have about the causes leading to the choice- that emotions heavily play into the choice doesn't make it not a rational decision, in my opinion.
