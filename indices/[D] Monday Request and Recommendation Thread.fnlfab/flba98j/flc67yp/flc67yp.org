I like Blue Core a lot, although I should warn people that it's only half rational.

The Protagonist actually has /two/ out of context ability sets. One that is great with his inventing that's mentioned above. But his other is probably an order of magnitude more powerful and doesn't really get maximized at all.

As a result it feels like there's two modes of the story sorta sandwiched together. There's a hard science-fantasy setting trying to apply physics to create paradigms of magic and exploring all combinatorial interactions between spells ... and then there's waifu time where abilities are never explored and some abilities pop up and never show up again in the story.

I like all parts of the story. It's a great read. But be prepared to activate selective rationality filters when you read it.
