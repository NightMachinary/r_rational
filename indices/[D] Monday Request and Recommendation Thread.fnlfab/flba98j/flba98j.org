I'd like to thank [[/u/ViceroyChobani]] for their recommendation of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][*Blue Core*]]. A very enjoyable dungeon core story, with an especially interesting view of applying modern science to a world of magic. Like some kingdom-building novels (Release That Witch, etc) the main character attempts to integrate technological advancements into the world they have found themselves. However unlike most other characters the dungeon core Blue has godlike control and power within his domain, able to create with a thought.

Because of this the development of technologies within the dungeon are limited solely on Blue's creativity (and access to raw materials.) Personally I find it much more interesting to have the limitation be a cognitive one rather than a material one, especially since the powers are not exclusive to Blue. This allows him to engage in fascinating battles where the parties each throw out new and creative weapons and tactics to adapt to each other.

Besides the magitech, the writing itself is very good, with a wide variety of characters and power levels that all feel fleshed out and have their own personalities. As a fair warning there are some distinctly NSFW scenes in the series, but the chapters are well-marked and the content is, at least at the time of writing, entirely consensual.

Overall, if you enjoy dungeon core stories or stories that combine magic and technology I would definitely recommend checking it out, and even if those things aren't specifically what you are looking for it's still an excellent fantasy story.
