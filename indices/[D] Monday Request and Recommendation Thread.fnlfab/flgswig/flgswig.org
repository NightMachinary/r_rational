With [[https://www.doofmedia.com/deep-in-pact/][Deep in Pact]] having finished, the two hosts Elliot and Reuben are now looking for their next podcasting topic. Currently they're trying out several series, doing an episode on the first x installments each. Their first pilot episode, [[https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/fopugj/on_the_lamb_arc_1_taking_root/][On the Lamb]], covering Wildbow's third work [[https://twigserial.wordpress.com/][Twig]], has just launched. This is the one I'm looking forward to the most, to be honest, you just don't get protagonists like Sylvester very often. Also the world just pretty fascinating.

Other topics in coming weeks will include the Expanse, Dresden Files, Stand Still Stay Silent, and Sandman.
