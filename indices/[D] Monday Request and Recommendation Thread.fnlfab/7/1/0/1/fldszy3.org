Pokemon: The Origin Of Species does a lot of what HPMoR does, and I think it does it better. Rational remix of what the Pokemon world is like, journey of three smart people pursuing different goals, with full agency. Strong plotting, well-developed characters, internal consistency, exploration of the mechanics of the world it's in.

Worm is an original superhero story that's strongly plotted, has well-developed characters, does good things with point of view bias, has great prose, and has sharply defined consistent superpowers (but analyzing these is not the point). There's also a great literary analysis podcast dedicated to it.

A Practical Guide To Evil is a medieval fantasy tropes thing that's strongly plotted, incredibly fast-paced, and does cool things with powers and narrative tropes. The prose quality is bad.

Mother Of Learning is a medieval/renaissance fantasy story where a mage gets stuck in a month-long time loop. It's well-paced, internally consistent, has an engaging magic system and world, and has moderately well-developed characters (they have internality, but they're all kind of the same person). Low-stakes though.

Worth The Candle is an original medieval fantasy / game mechanics story with self-consistent and extremely unique magic, strong plotting, well-developed characters, and an extremely well-executed point of view bias. The latter is so well done that it'd probably be better to first read Metropolitan Man, a rational Superman fanfic by the same author, to establish that the author is capable of some of this.
