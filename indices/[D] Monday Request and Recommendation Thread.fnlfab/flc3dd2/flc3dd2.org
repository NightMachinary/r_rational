Recommending Peerless Dad. This has been my favorite manga/ manhwa ever since I found it last year.

​

Brief summary: The story follows the life of a powerful martial artist after his wife dies in labor and leaves him with 3 kids and no family support or stable job.

At it's root, it's a martial arts story but it's very different from the norm. The MC isn't a teenager murder hobo causing trouble and picking fights. He's just an adult man, with responsibilities doing the best he thinks he can for his family.

​

Not necessarily rationalistic but likely rational adjacent, the MC is a likable, reasonable and cautious person. It's a different, more mature take on slice of life that's good and enjoyable even though I'm not normally into that genre. There's plenty of action but less than you'd expect in a martial arts story.

​

The pacing is wonderful with time passing, his kids are around 10 yo by chapter 100 and have their own personalities and are proper characters in and off themselves.

​

It's a very feel good story that has become one of the main highlights of my week.
