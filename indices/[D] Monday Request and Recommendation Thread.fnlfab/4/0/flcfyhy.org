I can add links later but:

Cenotaph (and the rest of the Memorials series) by Notes. Early Canon divergence where Taylor takes on the gangs and sets out to fix Brockton as a solo rogue/vigilante. Very good. 2 "books" completed with a third on indefinite hiatus.

Weaver Nine. Jack Slash and Taylor switch places. Jack is a manipulative young sociopath entering the cape scene in Brockton and Taylor is the leader of the Society, an organization determined to kill the endbringers. Probably dead.

Fling a Light by Redwavespectrum (or similar). A great, short, take on Taylor with powers similar to doormaker. Emphasis on non-combat applications of powers. Dead, undergoing a rewrite.

Seed by TheAnt. Taylor with Blasto's power. Focused on Taylor as she gains power and becomes a warlord of Brockton Bay. Great worldbuilding.
