If you're in the mood for something kinda Good Omens-y, I'll recommend [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work][Doing God's Work]].

I haven't read far enough to see if it's especially rational, but it /does/ seem to have a rationalistic deconstruction of religion along similar lines to Good Omens, but from a more contemporary "hey religion is basically a business these days right? What if Providence was literally a public stock?"
