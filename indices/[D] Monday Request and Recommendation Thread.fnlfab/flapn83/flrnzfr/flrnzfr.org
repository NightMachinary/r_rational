I'm in the Bobiverse-Vorkosigan-Tchaikovsky triangle, so these books should also tickle your fancy as they tickled mine:

A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge

Semiosis by Sue Burke

Lockstep by Karl Schroeder

(Greg Egan has been recommended on this forum so many times, it feels silly to do so again, but here I go anyway)

(I am also trying to reread one of the Uplift books right now and I'm finding it hard going. Those books haven't aged well. Vinge, on the other hand, is even better now)
