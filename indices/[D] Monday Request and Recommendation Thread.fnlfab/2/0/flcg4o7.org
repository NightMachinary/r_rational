Pact by Wildblow might count, the MC is thrust into urban fantasy and has to learn magic, but he's always behind the curve on raw power/technique and needs to use non-magic cleverness to skate by.

The Gods are Bastards may count too, it's a fantasy book with a lot of different MCs, some of them mages.
