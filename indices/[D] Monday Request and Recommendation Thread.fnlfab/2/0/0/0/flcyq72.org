No, it's urban fantasy. Similar genre to Dresden Files or Harry Potter where there's a hidden magic society in the modern world. It's pretty dark, if you have read Worm by Wildblow the themes/depressingness is similar.

Also if you haven't read Dresden Files, they're a pretty good book series too. About a mage who's a private detective who uses magic to solve his cases, but usually gets pulled into larger plots of evil wizards when he starts investigating whatever the novel's plot is.
