yup, Lawrence Watt-Evans is one of my favorite authors. it is a lot harder to find some of his newer stuff, you basically need to order it off amazon.

Ethshar is a series of books about magic, from the perspective of a spellcaster, and explore the mechanics of how magic works. 'with a single spell' is an apprentice wizard who shows up in later books. 'the misenchanted sword' is earlier in the timeline. other books cover warlocks, witches, and even sorcerers from the far north with their devices, and demonologists.
