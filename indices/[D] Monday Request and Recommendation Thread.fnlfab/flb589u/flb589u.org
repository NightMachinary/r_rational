So, I just finished a re-read of HPMoR... it'd be interesting to find something in the same vein. I've checked out a few lists of fics, but a lot of them are fanfics based on works I either never read, or didn't really like.

If anybody would care to recommend me something, that'd be great - I'm not extremely into sci-fi (although it isn't a turn-off, either), and I would prefer something "original" (ie not fanfic) though I guess the Harry Potter universe is fine. I'll be taking a look at Significant Digits.
