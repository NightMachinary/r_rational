If you are a fan of plotting I would highly recommend A Practical Guide to Evil. If you haven't heard of it, its essentially characters that live in a world where storybook narrative exists, and they seek to use it to further their own goals. For example, why bother trying to slit someone's throat when you can manipulate them into basically wiping thenselves out of existance. Plus it's got treasonous , man-eating tapirs.
