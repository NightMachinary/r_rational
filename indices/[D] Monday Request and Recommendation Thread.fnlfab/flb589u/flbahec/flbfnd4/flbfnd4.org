The "analysis" was good, but the plotting is where I feel MoR really shines. I'm a sucker for magic in general, though - particularly when the systems are well thought out and [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA][Magic A is Magic A]].

I find it really hard explaining exactly what itches MoR scratches, I guess it just feels... mentally stimulating somehow, when it's in its stride?
