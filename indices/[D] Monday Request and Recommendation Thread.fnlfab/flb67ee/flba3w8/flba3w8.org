I've recently reread a bit of Problem Sleuth, and am again amazed by how it can take completely ridiculous premises and use them to make a consistent and predictable 'magic' system and also a coherent story.

Are there any other stories where the world or its mechanics are weird and whacky but the story and systems are completely coherent? Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett come to mind, though their plots aren't all that consistent either.
