Most of Brandon Sanderson's cosmere stories fit the bill.

/Warbreaker/ is free to read (available on his website). Of the four viewpoint characters I remember (Siri, Vivenna, Vasher, Lightsong) one is a mage from the start, one gets magic midway through the book, one is sort of made of magic but can't use it for much.

The main magic system in /Mistborn/ is "burning" metals for some magical effect, like limited telekinesis or enhanced senses. All protagonists and many side viewpoint characters have access to some form of that magic.

/Stormlight Archive/'s three main viewpoint characters all end up with magic, but only one of them has it from the start (and she doesn't know right away).

/Elantris/ is a bit of an outlier; nobody does any overt magic until the end, unless you count "being a zombie" as magic.

The /Arcanum Unbounded/ is a collection of short stories and novellas. All but two of them (a side story of a few pages, and a slightly longer story) have mage protagonists.
