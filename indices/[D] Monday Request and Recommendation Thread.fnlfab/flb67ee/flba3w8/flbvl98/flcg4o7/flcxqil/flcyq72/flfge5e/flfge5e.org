  About a mage who's a private detective who uses to solve his cases, but usually gets pulled into larger plots of evil wizards when he starts investigating whatever the novel's plot is.

Although, as the series goes on, there's less of that and more of him immediately being pulled into the plots of evil wizards at the start of the book, as a consequence of something that happened in a previous book.
