Luminosity: yes, it's Twilight fanfic, but I'm mostly unfamiliar with the source material and I gobbled it up. Rational characters acting in their rational interests, you love them, and there's all sorts of cool power stuff that does not exist in the original story AND is really, really well examined and munchkined. I wish it was an original story and not twilight fanfic because I think everyone gets turned away by the twilight aspect and doesn't give it a chance.
