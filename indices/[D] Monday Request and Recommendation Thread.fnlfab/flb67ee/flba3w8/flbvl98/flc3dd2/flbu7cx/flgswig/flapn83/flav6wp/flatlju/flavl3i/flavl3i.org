I was reading that for the past few days. I quit it the day before yesterday at around 40%. The word building is great, but I struggled with making progress with it. I might give it another shot at some point.

I'm reading Ethan of Anthos now from the Vorkosigan Saga, which is fun. It's the last work in the series I haven't read yet, save for Gentleman Jole and the Red Queen which I was recommended not to read.
