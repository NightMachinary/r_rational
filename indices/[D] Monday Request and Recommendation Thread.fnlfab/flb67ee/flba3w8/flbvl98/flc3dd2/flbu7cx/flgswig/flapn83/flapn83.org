I'm looking for space exploration related books. Preferable uplifting in tone, and moderately hard-scifi.

Some books like this I really enjoyed:

- Bobiverse trilogy by Dennis E. Taylor

- Post Human by J. P. Koenig

- House of Suns by Alastair Reynolds

- Perilous Waif by E. William Brown

- Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold

- Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky

- 2312 by Kim Stanley Robinson
