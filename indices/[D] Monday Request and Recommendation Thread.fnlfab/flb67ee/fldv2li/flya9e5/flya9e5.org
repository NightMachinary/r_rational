To me, it seemed to work like:

#+begin_quote
  all of the strands were different ways that history could go, like different streams of water all making up a river, and both sides were trying to make the river end up combined into a single stream in one of two places- right now it's forked into 2 equally likely possibilities. Each strand was like a probability more than a solid past- that's why they all exist simultaneously. The agents were trying to change strands to flow into another and combine- so if you make it so that strand 1 in 1400AD and strand 2 in 1400AD ended up being the same by 1500AD, then they "crossed". You can't directly revert the actions of another agent - the physical presence of an agent seems to over time make a given stand more "stuck" while they're there, and moreso the more they are 'embedded' in the history of that strand - but just because they crossed doesn't mean that another agent can't find a way to make strand 1 go a different direction instead in 1450AD. Actions can break off into multiple possibilities, so maybe you can't make all of strand 1 go into strand 2, but you can split it into 11 and 12 and have 12 go into strand 2. You can't jump between strands that are too far apart- it's part of why the two sides can't directly attack each other without first going upriver to the past and then back down the major streams/strands leading to the other side. You also don't want to change things too close in time to the endpoints, because it starts to break down the "attractors" of the endpoints and then changes stop being able to be predictable.<

  At the end, Red and Blue decide that, as the best agents of either side, together they can make a 3rd endpoint just for them.<
