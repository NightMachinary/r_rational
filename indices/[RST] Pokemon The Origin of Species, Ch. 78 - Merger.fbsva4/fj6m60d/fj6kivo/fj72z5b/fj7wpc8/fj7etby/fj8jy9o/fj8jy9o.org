Great chapter! I love the power of planning as evidenced here - Red has had some form of the partitions since the opening chapters, and Mewtwo has had a need to hide his true intentions since pretty much the beginning as well. That some twelve year old kid would happen to be the one to uncover the seed of Mewtwo's answer to his dilemma of the tulpamancy trick would be a tall order if you wrote it down from the outside, but its an extremely organic development within the story itself - we have all been waiting for it for months at this point after all. Definitely an object lesson in the value of outlining critical story beats at the outset, a lesson a lot of popular media these days seems to have forgotten...

Unless our author didn't actually plan this all out ahead of time, in which case props for the major improv skills!

(I would agree with some who implied below that Rei's plan seemed pretty reckless, unless Red did something concrete to make sure the finger was pointed at her. But Rei is not that important of a character in the end, people make mistakes and minor characters don't get the screen time to fully spec out the causes of those mistakes. Thus is the way of narrative.)

Edit: Also just wanted to note that the Worth The Candle & P:OoS timelines have converged a little more with the official introduction of multithreading for our protagonist here. Where should Red allocate those skill points from his obvious level up??
