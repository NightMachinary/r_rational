That was /awesome./ I love the progress Red is making with his partition and the intrigue around Saffron gym, though I was a bit slow to warm up to that. By the way the scene a few chapters ago where Red encounters some Ghost-types was fantastic.

I could just feel my stomach drop when the implication of a Renegade accusation came into things, mostly because I remember the discussion on (to paraphrase) "Better for 10 innocents to die than a Renegade go free". That /really/ hammered home how seriously that kind of thing is taken and how she must've felt when she realised how much trouble she could well be in.

On an unrelated note: I'm late to the party on this fic so I didn't get to comment on the original thread for it, but I wanted to say how much I enjoyed an early chapters depiction of pop culture/cartoons in this world. Crobatman and Supermon, that was brilliant. Did the former lose his parents to a renegade by any chance?
