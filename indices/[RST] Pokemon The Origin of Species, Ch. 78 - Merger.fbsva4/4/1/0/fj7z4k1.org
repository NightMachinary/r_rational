No, Giovanni would already know that, if he's behind the attempt, since Rei would have told him that they're trying to figure out that question. It's not that big a secret. The question is why Sabrina thinks that Mewto can lie perfectly in the first place.

Giovanni is strongly considering to kill Mewto, since he can't trust him and he's an existential risk much worse than the Stormbringers.Giovani can't monitor Sabrina's and Mewto's conversations either, since they're psychically communicating.

Sabrina loves Mewto as a friend, and she doesn't know about the artificial disease (unless she's already a perfect liar, but that's really stupid). She (rightly) thinks he's holding something back and wants to know if that's possible.She probably has picked up on Giovani's attitude enough to know that she thinks she must protect Mewto from him, even (or especially) if she's right.

Tetsuo is her second and probably knows all what Sabrina is up to. She prizes loyalty and so would trust him with that info; also he needs to excuse a lot of her absences, so it's not like she can feed him some bs for years on end, and psychics can't easily hide things from one another, so he probably knows a lot, if not everything.

If you spend a lot of time with a dark, inscrutable, rationalist puppetmaster and a telekinetic, highly intelligent, dangerous kangaroo, you'd want a loyal friend, too. Tetsuo being confided in isn't a breach of loyalty. They're both gym leaders, she's very powerful in her own right and doesn't owe him any loyalty. They're more like partners, I figure.

I just think that Giovanni found out about Sabrina's not-so-secret project and would like to know her very-secret reasons.
