  Cyr probably can't believe how lucky he got, that instead of detaining him for having provided "Tetsuo" with the memory seed, he was sent out, because it was an "internal matter".

  Since that's a lethally criminal plan, he's probably one of Giovanni's hired executees.

Hold on. I'm having trouble understanding your comment. You mean that Tetsuo had the memory seed, so the seed would remember what Tetsuo knew about Sabrina? And then Giovanni would know (because Cyr would tell him) that Sabrina told her students to investigate whether a "psychic can lie", which counts as telling them about Mewtwo, which is disloyal to Giovanni?
