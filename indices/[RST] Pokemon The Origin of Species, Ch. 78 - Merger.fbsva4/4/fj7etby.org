Question of the day:

Is Rei guilty of attempting to execute an executable offense against a gym executive using an executee's exeggcute?

Yup :)

Cyr probably can't believe how lucky he got, that instead of detaining him for having provided "Tetsuo" with the memory seed, he was sent out, because it was an "internal matter".

Since that's a lethally criminal plan, he's probably one of Giovanni's hired executees.

The whole pretense of trust between Sabrina, Mewto and Giovanni will crumble rapidly and I somehow doubt, they can hug it out. Question is now, who'll strike first?
