I agree fully she did not expect the renegade accusation. I just think the odds that she was going to be identified as the source of the "Sabrina" thought appeared to be very high (or at least unknown to her) particularly with Red in the room, and the reward would be probably quite low - this technique would get impressions, hints, not full breakdowns. Its a desperate move from someone who didn't present herself as feeling on-the-clock about this mystery.
