Love it! Wonderful direction it took, I've been loving the buildup to his partitions becoming more like mewtwos, and oh the payoff is sweet. It felt very natural for the direction of the story and situation. Hope Rei isn't labelled as a renegade in the end with outside pressure (hello Giovanni) to be recruited. That would be rather devastating to Red I'd guess after his recent self revelations.

Also glad that he started spending more time with Leaf too! And that he knew he could trust her for help when he needed it. I'm very excited to see how the next few chapters will play out!

Thanks for the chapter! Looking forward to the next!
