Hey everyone, doing an unusual PSA: For those that haven't been paying much attention to the coronavirus, I think it's worth mentally preparing for a chance that you or someone in your friends/family will get badly sick sometime in the next couple months, and physically preparing for society to slow down for a bit. If even 15% of people are too sick to leave the house at the same time, that's entering Great Depression levels of unemployment. Many aspects of "normal life" will be disrupted even for those who are not sick.

That doesn't mean panic, or prepare for an apocalypse. I still plan on going about my normal life in that time, assuming things don't take a sudden turn for the worst.

But at the very least, if you can afford to buy some extra necessities up front, I think it's worth doing. Get an extra month's supply of non-perishable food, toilet paper, laundry detergent, various basic medications, etc. Don't take any PTO for the next few weeks in case you need to take it later while sick or to help a sick family member. Make a habit of regular, thorough hand-washing while in public and before meals.

I don't tend to be alarmist, in general. Living in the hurricane capital of the US means I have a practice balancing on the tightrope of preparing for potential disasters that often end up being no big deal, and what I've learned is that being reasonably prepared is often worth more than just the peace of mind it provides.

Hope you all enjoy the chapter, and many more to come.
