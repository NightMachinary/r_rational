At this point I would be surprised if it manages to get contained; I think it's going to spread to most of the US. Not everyone will get it, but enough will that I expect it to cause some notable civil disruption (people not showing up to work, maybe supply chain disruptions).

On top of that, while it seems like most people will be fine after getting it, anyone above 60 is at a fairly serious risk, particularly men, people with heart conditions, and/or smokers. That is a large chunk of the country that are likely to need hospitalization, and the mortality rate for them may go even higher if our hospitals get overwhelmed.

Like I said, I don't think it's time to panic yet (if there's ever a right time to "panic.") But I definitely worry about what April and March will look like, and particularly worry about my dad, who's over 65, male, heart condition, /and/ smokes.

There's more I can say on this, but the basic gist is that I think people should be prepared. Maybe it'll blow over without serious consequences, but at this point it is worth a few hundred dollars of food and medical supplies that you'll end up using anyway if you can afford it, just in case you or a loved one get sick while there's a run on grocery stores and pharmacies.
