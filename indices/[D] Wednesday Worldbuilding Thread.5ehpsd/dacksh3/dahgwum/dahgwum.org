  Time travel takes time; you can't just return to the instant after you left. In fact, if you go back ten years and spend five hours in 2006, you have to return exactly five hours after you left.

Can I time travel to 2006, spend five hours there, return to the present (five hours after I left) and then /immediately/ time travel five hours into the past?

  You can't go back to a time where you already existed.

Having done the above, what happens if I then sit around and wait for six hours without doing any more time travelling?

  When someone time travels you have a limited amount of time to stop them before history changes.

When someone travels to the past to change something, would it make more sense for me to go back immediately to stop them, or hang around, wait for the world to change, read a few history books to pinpoint exactly /why/ it changed, and then go back, armed with a better knowledge of what they did to change the past, and simply change it back?
