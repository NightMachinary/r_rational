It hasn't been fully revealed yet, but my impression of what the "full" story will be is that there are time travelers that predate the first instance of time travel that we see in the pilot episode and that this is all part of their design. They're not shitting themselves over any of this because they have foreknowledge of everything that Lucy/Wyatt/Rufus are doing. How that's possible in a world where history undergoes a number of changes based on time travel ... might have something to do with these changes being cyclical?

But it's definitely been implied that Rittenhouse is an organization which was created by time travelers sometime in the 18th century in order to either ensure that history happens as they know it did, or to ensure that history follows a path of their own design. And the primary bad guy has information from either the future or a parallel future that gives a guide to the past/present. (And if Rittenhouse has at least partial leverage over not-Elon Musk, then it's entirely possible that they're the entire reason that the time machine was built in the first place, via ontological paradox.)

But none of that explains why the /government/ seems to be okay with any of this.

I don't know. It seems on the edge of making sense somehow, but I don't actually have faith in the writers.
