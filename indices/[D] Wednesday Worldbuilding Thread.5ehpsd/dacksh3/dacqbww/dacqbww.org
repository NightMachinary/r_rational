Sounds like you've got it worked out pretty well, and I do like that you decided to go with In Spite of a Nail. It's just my personal view that history is caused by collective social forces rather than the actions of individuals. The rules of time travel are a little fuzzy, like in the show, but the important part of the story isn't how time travel works but what you use it for and I really like your plan for it.

The part of the show I find most irrational is the government's response to time travel. Not-Elon Musk builds a pair of time machines and either doesn't tell the government or they let him keep it at his company. When one machine is stolen they throw a special forces soldier, a history professor, and one of the nerds who built it who've never met into the past with vague orders. Even considering the limitations of the machine and short deadline, they couldn't do any better?

Then there's the fact that when the team comes back it becomes clear that history has been altered and they don't know anything new about their enemy, so they send the same guys again with just as much preparation. Shouldn't their boss be shitting themselves with fear at their complete lack of control over this situation? Three people you found in an hour have to fight an existential threat with no oversight or accountability.

It's not that I object to the silliness of the premise, I love pulpy stories where heroes are just thrown at a problem and have to improvise a solution, it's just that the story needs to be aware of its own absurdity. My favorites pull it off by making the characters take goofy situations seriously, so we still feel the emotional weight of the story. Unfortunately, I found the characters in Timeless too bland to empathize with.
