I wonder if organized religion would have a tendency to co-opt the magic from more stage magician like folks, with church being the institutionalized method of gathering crowds, preaching being the patter, and the religion designed to make the crowd have faith in and not doubt the sleight of hand the preacher performs to make the items and perform miracles on members of the crowd.

I suspect the system is inherently unstable, with a tendency to mutate into something completely different from my idea of sleight of hand magicians who can do real magic, unless I keep the number of people who can do magic really low and rare.

Hilariously, one could almost argue that the present form of reality is a result of a super weak version of this system, with the placebo effect and various mental effects on people being the only things the magic can accomplish, magic items being very hard to create but existing in the form of the various religious icons that their followers believe will heal them or make them feel better, and organized religion having mostly taken over the practice just as I wrote above.
