Good catch. Looks like magic items would need to have strong limitations on them. Possibly some kind of time decay after they are created, perhaps a fixed number of charges depending on the size of the audience used for creation, and perhaps limits on the kinds of effects, with more amazing effects requiring a larger and/or more gullible audience for creation. And something I haven't thought of yet to curtail compounding.
