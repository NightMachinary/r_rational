I bet that /was/ where I get the convincing reality part from. I read that a long time ago, but didn't consciously remember the details.

What I was thinking of consciously was alexanderwales' [[http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/][Shadows of the Limelight]]. He has a nifty system in that where people acquire more magic power the more famous they are, and that was what also turned me on to the idea of a system of magic that can directly interact with the narrative/plot. The magic itself in alexanderwales' setting wasn't related to what people believed about the characters, though -- instead fame just activated the character's inherent school of magic, giving things like shadow control or light control and so on.
