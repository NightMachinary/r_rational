Moderately related, but The Emporer's Soul by Brandon Sanderson has a somewhat similar magic system. It works by having "stamps" which contain encoded information on an object's history (some true, and some changed to make an effect.)

This magic works better the likelier it is to be true, such as "this wood was eaten by termites" working in a prison but not a palace, but "water damage from the renovation of the room two years ago seeped into the wood, causing it to rot. The rot is possible because the maintenance crew dislike their new boss and are skiving out of work" would work very well, if the renovation, boss, and crew were all correct.
