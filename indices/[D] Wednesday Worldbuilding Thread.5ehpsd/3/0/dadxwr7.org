Let's look at question 2 first. Any real vehicle would require things like power supplies and structural elements and so forth that would slow it down, but lets say that we use magic to get rid of all of that mass. So we have a magic ship that is made of one of these thrusters in space, at rest, at a temperature of 40 kelvin or so, the same temperature as local space within the solar system. It's nearly invisible at this point, unless someone sees it occulting stars. It turns on its thruster for one second, applying a force of 750 N to its own 80,000 kg mass, accelerating at 0.009 m/s^{2}, to reach a final speed of 0.009 m/s. Its kinetic energy, 0.5mv^{2}, is now about 4 joules. But it dumped 60,000,000 joules of energy into the thruster to get that. As long as conservation of energy holds, the rest of that energy is lost as heat. Your thruster will heat up until it reaches a stable point where it is emitting all 59,999,996 watts of that, hopefully before it melts.

For comparison, Pioneer 10's communication antennas broadcast with a combined power of 16 watts, and we didn't lose contact until it was 80 AU away, twice as far out as Pluto. Granted, these were directional antennas and we mostly knew where to look, but... six orders of magnitude.

Back to question 1. One kiloton of TNT is 4.184*10^{12} joules. In order to have that much kinetic energy, an 80,000 kg mass has to be traveling at about 10,000 m/s. First, let's look at just an inert 80,000 kg mass being accelerated only by gravity. Earth's escape velocity is 11,200 m/s, which is a bit higher than the 10,000 m/s we need. This is also the speed that any object will reach if falls towards the Earth from rest at infinity. We don't have infinite distance to fall, but gravitational force falls off so sharply that most of that acceleration happens up close. I don't feel like doing the calculus to get the exact number, but you can expect to get around 1 kiloton worth of boom just from gravity, if you start any decent distance away. If you're going faster as you approach Earth, then its gravity has less time to accelerate you... but then the faster you go, the more bang you get for every m/s you gain. I'd expect it to fall off real quick the faster you go, so saying you get 1 bonus kiloton from gravity no matter what is probably reasonable-ish.

And you're going to have to start from a decent distance away, if you want your thruster to help at all. With acceleration around 0.009 m/s^{2}, adding another 10,000 m/s would take 1,000,000 seconds (12 days), and a runway 5.6*10^{9} meters long - 15 times the distance to the Moon. In order to get that far away to start, the thruster would need to accelerate away for 770,000 seconds (9 days), then turn around and brake for another 9 days, before starting its final 12 day return trip, for a total start-to-impact time of 2,600,000 seconds, or 30 days. It would spend most of this time brighter than most stars, giving everyone plenty of warning to shoot it down.

As it happens, the bang you get is exactly linear with the distance you accelerate. You get one more kiloton for every 5.6*10^{9} meters you go, excluding gravitational acceleration - which is fine to exclude since almost all of that acceleration will be far away from Earth. And it still takes a month just to get the first extra kiloton, and that's plenty long enough to get shot down.

Question 3. My favorite problem with reactionless drives! In my first paragraph, I said that accelerating for 1 second from 0 m/s to 0.009 m/s results in 4 joules of kinetic energy and 59,999,996 joules of waste energy. And after all, from the thruster's own perspective, every second is the first second of acceleration from rest. But what happens if it accelerates for 1 second from 80,000 m/s to 80,000.009 m/s? It starts with 0.5 * 80,000 * 80,000^{2} = 256,000,000,000,000 joules of kinetic energy, and it ends up with 0.5 * 80,000 * 80,000.009^{2} = 256,000,060,000,004 joules of kinetic energy. It has pumped 60,000,000 joules in and gotten 60,000,004 joules out, with a waste of, uh, -4? Not only is this a different number, it's over unity! Reactionless drives don't just violate /Einsteinian/ relativity, they violate /Galilean/ relativity! I don't know how to fix this without throwing out conservation of energy. And if you're doing that, then you can just say that there's never any waste heat and let it be as invisible as you want. But that also means that you can deliver free energy into any external mechanism that slows it down.
