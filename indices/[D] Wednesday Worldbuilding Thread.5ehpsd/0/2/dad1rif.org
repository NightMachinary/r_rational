  6. Time travel takes time; you can't just return to the instant after you left. In fact, if you go back ten years and spend five hours in 2006, you have to return exactly five hours after you left.

Is this because you can only return to the present (i.e. 2016 -> 1939 -> 2016, not 2016 -> 1939 -> 2006), or because time travel operates on a discrete level?

If the former, you could spin it as a need for time to adjust before more travel occurred. That might come with its own problems, however (especially with multiple travellers).

In the latter case, could you travel to the hour/day/month/year before you left? If you can't, can you travel to a precise time in the past, or only at multiples of the "unit time" (so you have launch windows for expeditions back in time)?

I just thought of a third possibility: while displaced in time you're using up some aspect of your present. So if you use 5 hours you should return to T+5h, because if you return to T then you'll have 5 hours of whatever negative reaction (e.g. being catatonic, being "removed from the flow of time" and reappearing at the end, cluster headaches, intangibility, or retrograde amnesia).
