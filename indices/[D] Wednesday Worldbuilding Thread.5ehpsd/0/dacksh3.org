Still idly planning out my /Timeless/ fanfic. Here are the rules of the world as presented:

1. You can't go back to a time where you already existed.
2. You can detect when someone time travels, along with what time they went to, and where.
3. You cannot detect time travel unless you catch it in the act; you don't know when someone is /about/ to time travel.
4. When someone time travels you have a limited amount of time to stop them before history changes.
5. When history changes, only the travelers remember how the world was, while getting no knowledge of how the world actually is.
6. Time travel takes time; you can't just return to the instant after you left. In fact, if you go back ten years and spend five hours in 2006, you have to return exactly five hours after you left.
7. Time travel does not appear to recurse at all.

Some of these are probably just good advice, not actually rules per se, while others might come from technical limitations.

Rule 7 is giving me the most problems. Let's say that you go back in time to the Hindenburg, due to plot reasons it ends up blowing up on the tarmac at night instead of by the mooring tower during the day. When you return to the present, everyone will think that was how it always happened (see rule 5), all records save those you took with you will have changed ... but everyone will remember /you/ thinking that was always how it happened. They might even have you on camera saying that you need to ensure the Black Cross Anarchists blow up the Hinderburg. So what the hell happened to that time traveler they all remember sending back?

I feel like [[/u/sam512]]'s [[https://qntm.org/hypertime][Hypertime]] might be up for the job, given some extremely specific stipulations about what directions the time machine is moving on the temporal sheet. That is, time travel to the past is "down" in hypertime, while time travel to the "present" is to the "right" in normal time (with no universe switching).

And then maybe patch the whole thing together with "also, it's really, really, ridiculously hard to change history".
