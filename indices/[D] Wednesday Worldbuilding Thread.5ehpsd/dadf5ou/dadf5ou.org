Scifi Worldbuilding: If a reactionless thruster exists...

Am trying to think my way through some basics of a scifi setting, and could use some help on details.

Assumption 1: The theory of "quantized inertia", as described at [[http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.com/]] , is at least roughly correct.

Consequence 1: Reactionless thrusters similar to what's currently called the "em drive" can be built.

Consequence 2: Anyone with the tech to lob a package into LEO can create city-destroying WMDs, by simply accelerating an object into deep space and back at arbitrary speeds.

Question 1: Assuming that a standard reactionless thruster weighs around 80,000 kg, takes 60 MW of power, and produces 750 Newtons of thrust (plus or minus whatever fudge-factors make the math easier), what timescales would be required for how large a kiloton-equivalent impact?

Question 2: "There Ain't No Stealth In Space", for any object near room temperature... but could a reactionless city-killer be kept cold enough to evade detection, until it was approaching Earth too fast and too close for any significant response?

Questions 3+: All the questions. :)
