You're such a champion for reading this for me and for giving me such an awesome critique! I will definitely be giving it a second pass with your input.

I'll give you some clarification for the reasons for some things being the way they are, though, as I have made the error of presenting something stand-alone that very much isn't.

Firstly, this is a scene in a longer story, so hopefully people will already be invested in Jack by now. That doesn't help you at all, and ideally every scene should be gripping, but hopefully that makes you feel a bit better.

  A policewoman wearing /purple/ contact lenses to her job

This has two functions: the character of Jack was originally conceived when I was 14, and in true "character you create when you're 14" fashion she had purple eyes. So the /purple/ contacts are a little bit of a nod to that - which I know has literally no meaning to anyone else. Also, now I think about it, if she was reamed for wearing the contacts, would she put them back in immediately upon getting on her bike to go home? Probably not.

The /important/ reason for the contacts is that vampires can give you orders by making eye contact with you, and if Jack is vulnerable to that this story doesn't happen. So Jack needs contacts or glasses. Your pointing it out has made me realize that I should give her a slight vision impairment requiring eyeglasses or contact lenses and stop trying to be cute.

(There's two points in the passage where Mavis tries to give Jack an order and is surprised when it doesn't work.)

    That wasn't the disturbing thing; Jack had seen her fair share of mangled bodies. No, the passenger was not lying prone, not in shock. Instead, she had her head nestled in her unconscious companion's neck, her hands wrapped around his head, pulling him even closer to her than the impact had.
  #+end_quote

  Jack shouldn't be more disturbed by how Mavis reacts to the trauma than the sight of a ruined arm or a potentially dead guy.
#+end_quote

Thankyou for that. I meant the narration to describe that she didn't comprehend that it was a vampire feeding, and thought it was a wife mourning her husband or similar. But the writing is not clear at all that that's what I'm going for.

    Jack felt a primal fear in her, something profound, like nothing she'd ever felt before. Quick reflexes - hard won through years of martial arts - ended with her pushing the wooden stake through the woman's heart, its passage made easy by the previously broken ribs and torn flesh.
  #+end_quote

  This doesn't feel realistic to me at all. (Also, aren't the splints described as 'two thin sticks'? That doesn't sound consistent with a stake that pierces through to the heart.) Jack's character isn't super consistent so far (is she super invested in acting professionally and following rules, or not?) but going from 'let me splint you' to 'I'm gonna stab you for freaking out and backing away' in a split second seems unrealistic, especially if she's under some sort of magical fear effect, and doubly so if she's learned martial arts. Usually they teach you to drop back and raise your guard if you feel threatened, not to stab whoever's nearby with whatever weapon is in reach.
#+end_quote

Yeah, I'm bad at action scenes and the concept behind this is very weak. I need to give her a stake so she doesn't just get eaten, and I need her to use the stake when she gets attacked. Otherwise, she gets eaten and there's no story. I tried to handwave this a bit by saying the car accident had injured the vampire, made its chest more squishy and its heart more stab-able.

Maybe I should come from another angle. Conceptually, I wanted her to rock up to her house with a vampire and panic about what the hell to do with it. But perhaps she just sees Mavis, manages to escape without getting eaten, and now is wondering about vampires. Perhaps it's an experience that happens to her, sans the staking, that gets her curious.

Maybe I should re-write it so she revives the man after Mavis runs off, he informs her that Mavis is a vampire, and Jack hears all about it while she waits for an ambulance (that she will decide to call) to arrive? That's a more realistic, conservative chain of events, Jack can obsess about tracking this guy down to get more information out of him, trying to find out about Mavis, talk to Gwyn about the whole thing, and only come home with a staked vampire /later/, after she knows that a stake will be needed.

    Canines that were about an inch apart.
  #+end_quote

  I feel like that's too short of a distance, but I could be wrong. It seems like an easy thing to double check though (for you, at least - to get an estimate of the distance between a woman's canines, you can measure your own mouth).
#+end_quote

I got three cm when I did it, which is why I went for an inch. [[http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t08/i2/jbct08i2p6.pdf][Someone's actually done a study and it looks like 2.5cm is average for a woman]]. Clearly I either have a /really big/ mouth (their SD was 1.5mm!) or sticking my fingers in a mouth then sticking my ruler on my fingers is not as accurate as what the scientists did.

    All at once, she realised that either she was going crazy, or Mavis was an actual vampire.
  #+end_quote

  You should probably try to establish Jack's character a bit more, so that her jumping to conclusions like this doesn't come across as much as authorial fiat.
#+end_quote

You're right about this, too. I think the "waiting for the ambulance" version of the scene will hit this note.

#+begin_quote
  I don't really know if Jack's behaviour is normal (for her) or not. It's consistent with some parts of her actions, and inconsistent with others.
#+end_quote

If I edit it as discussed, do you think the inconsistencies are improved? The inconsistencies I get from your review are the purple contacts and her attacking Mavis, but I'd be very, very keen on hearing about more. I feel like Jack is well-developed in my head (such that I had a knee-jerk reaction that she would absolutely /not/ be interested in "all that folklore shit" as she'd put it) so I'd really like to be challenged on that, too, since at the moment I am like "Jack is the one thing I know for sure", and if that's not true I need to work hard on her. As it is I kind of think of her as a quasi-Tulpa though I never tried to make her so.

Thanks again for your comments, they are exactly what I needed. I think I am trying to make everything happen all at once, when there'd actually be more of a buildup, you know, a little bit of the veil lifting at a time. Why rush things?
