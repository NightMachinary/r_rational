Most of the issues I had with it were based on the (mistaken) idea that it was the opening of a story. If there's some background to Jack, and the reader is already invested, then the scene is fine (if a little quick to get to the action, maybe). Whenever I've tried to write, properly pacing things has been the one thing I completely suck at - either I write exposition dumps or super-concentrated plot, and neither of them work well on their own - so I can't give you any advice on that.

The edits you've mentioned would get rid of pretty much everything else I'd consider an issue with it. It looks really good, and I wish you good luck with writing/publishing it!
