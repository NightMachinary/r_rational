Here's a neat little trick / datum you might want to use:

  There is still more space in the baseband to insert a few more narrow band mono audio programs. You would need a special FM tuner that can switch over to these "SCA" (Subsidiary Communications Authorization) channels embedded into the baseband. Back in the day, radio station owners would lease these SCA channels to companies like Muzak. Muzak would then use the SCA channel to broadcast their own music meant for malls, hotels, elevators, ETC. Muzak would sell the rights to carry their music format to the malls to use. $$$ Reading for the blind services would also use and still use these hidden mono program channels that can be received with the correct tuner.
