The system for magic items seems like it could have a compounding effect. Could you use one magic item to make it easier for people to believe that other magic items work? Say you use one magic item to mimic the effects of another not-yet-created magic item in order to create that magic item. You could bootstrap into omnipotence somewhat easily as you use your greater and greater number of magic items to convince more and more people that you have more and more powerful magic items.
