I was working on a magic system based on fusing belief, sleight of hand, and argument.

Magic in this setting is being able to argue with reality well enough that the magician convinces himself and reality that it is different than what it is.

Say a magician wants to set something on fire. He focuses on the thing he wants to make combust, and then starts arguing with it (generally silently), trying to convince the item that it makes sense for it to be on fire, that its past history supports the idea that it should be on fire, that the narrative of the story so far supports the idea that it should burst into flames. What exactly he is arguing with is left a mystery -- whether the actual object can argue or if the magician is really trying to convince his own unconscious, and is personifying the object in his mind.

The rationally related part of this is that the arguments work best if they leverage cognitive biases, like a statistical outcome being more likely seeming the more details you add to the description, even though in reality that reduces the likelihood of the outcome, and things being more likely if the magician can make up a story narrative that supports them, and as many other such uses of biases and human irrationality as I can fit in.

That's the first level of the magic system. That form is slow and has trouble with large and unlikely changes, but can be useful for covert work. The next level up is sleight of hand in front of an audience. A stage magician that can do magic can perform the arguing aspect as part of his patter, and if he can do the sleight of hand/ stage magic well enough and convincingly enough that he makes some of his audience believe he actually did it, or even just want to believe he did it, then he can make the effect real immediately. For instance, if he performs an illusion of making someone younger using a potion in front of a gullible audience, he can make the person actually get younger.

This second level can also be used to enchant items. If he focuses his patter during the illusion on something that is supposed to be causing the effect -- say a healing potion, he can actually enchant the potion so that it can be used to heal people later when an audience isn't watching. This can also be used for making magic utility items and weapons.

The second level can be used off the stage as well. A magician could unload the guns of a gang, for instance, if he hired a number of men to be his patsies and pretend that when he waved his magic whatever at them while talking his patter this made all the bullets in their guns disappear. If he did this convincingly, then afterwards he could wave the magic whatever at the guns of the people who are not his patsies, and make the bullets in their guns actually disappear.

Another subtler aspect is retroactive belief magic. If a magician today convinces a bunch of people that yesterday he painted an amazing picture, this is not going to make such a picture appear on his wall. However, there can be more subtle effects. If the magician makes a large enough number of people believe that at some point in the past he took a potion which gave him permanent super healing, then he will get at least some accelerated healing now.

Self abuse is also a path to power in this system. If someone spends years doing things to themselves which they believe makes it so they deserve good fortune and god's favor, say, whipping themselves and going around in hair shirts while surviving on only alms and sleeping on a bed of nails, then after a while they will be able to use the first level far more effectively, their arguments with reality being more potent and easy for reality (or their subconscious) to believe.

This system allows me to use elements of humanity's rich history of stage magic and charlatanry in the story, as well as having magic which literally responds to the character's need and how much they feel they deserve to have the magic work and how well they feel it fits with their own personal conception of their life's story. And I can have debunkers actually destroying real magic by revealing the illusions that initiated it.

What do you think? What kind of holes/ munchkin opportunities am I looking at here?
