I like it. The knowledge of magic real working will be kept extremely secret as if it reaches the masses the second level stops working.

Also insane people able to believe in crazy stuff in their head will be extremely powerful. Which is a good thing since it offers opportunity for narratives.

kingdoms will want to gather crowds when magical items are created. Probably on a daily basis. This have to istitualized somehow. Obligatory school magic show attendance?
