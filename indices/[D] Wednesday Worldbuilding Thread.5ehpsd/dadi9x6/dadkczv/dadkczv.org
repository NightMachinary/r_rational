I don't really read romance and I'm a straight guy, so I doubt I'm in your target audience, but I'll leave some thoughts here anyway. If you don't find them useful, feel free to ignore them.

  Besides, after the reaming out her captain gave her for wearing her favourite pair of purple contact lenses on the job, she wanted to make sure she was the paragon of a good police officer.
#+end_quote

For whatever reason, this read more like the opening of a parody than a serious story. A policewoman wearing /purple/ contact lenses to her job (and she's not new to it - she's been at enough traffic accidents to know what a first responder should do), and then getting told off for it is just so off the wall as an introduction for a character. Maybe you're doing it intentionally to subvert expectations, but I guess it just seems silly to me.

  She ran beside the old sedan, using her phone's flash for light, and she saw something that she lacked the facilities to fully comprehend.

  That wasn't the disturbing thing; Jack had seen her fair share of mangled bodies. No, the passenger was not lying prone, not in shock. Instead, she had her head nestled in her unconscious companion's neck, her hands wrapped around his head, pulling him even closer to her than the impact had.
#+end_quote

As of right now, Jack has no idea that the passenger is a vampire. It's entirely in character for Mavis to be shocked/scared/distraught after the crash and hugging the driver, or burying her head in the crook of his neck (maybe even sobbing). As long as those are still halfway possible, Jack shouldn't be more disturbed by how Mavis reacts to the trauma than the sight of a ruined arm or a potentially dead guy. She's seen other accidents before, anyway.

  Jack felt a primal fear in her, something profound, like nothing she'd ever felt before. Quick reflexes - hard won through years of martial arts - ended with her pushing the wooden stake through the woman's heart, its passage made easy by the previously broken ribs and torn flesh.
#+end_quote

This doesn't feel realistic to me at all. (Also, aren't the splints described as 'two thin sticks'? That doesn't sound consistent with a stake that pierces through to the heart.) Jack's character isn't super consistent so far (is she super invested in acting professionally and following rules, or not?) but going from 'let me splint you' to 'I'm gonna stab you for freaking out and backing away' in a split second seems unrealistic, especially if she's under some sort of magical fear effect, and doubly so if she's learned martial arts. Usually they teach you to drop back and raise your guard if you feel threatened, not to stab whoever's nearby with whatever weapon is in reach.

  Canines that were about an inch apart.
#+end_quote

I feel like that's too short of a distance, but I could be wrong. It seems like an easy thing to double check though (for you, at least - to get an estimate of the distance between a woman's canines, you can measure your own mouth).

#+begin_quote
  All at once, she realised that either she was going crazy, or Mavis was an actual vampire.
#+end_quote

You should probably try to establish Jack's character a bit more, so that her jumping to conclusions like this doesn't come across as much as authorial fiat. Maybe Jack has an interest in myths or something, and has a book on Eastern European folklore in bag that she thinks about while on her motorbike. You can probably come up with something better, but think about how you personally would react in that situation. Would your first thought be 'everything I believe is a lie', or would it be [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/]['I notice I am confused']]?

I'm not really sure about the rest of the chapter. In large part, it fails to move me much because the preamble didn't hook me in and so I don't really know if Jack's behaviour is normal (for her) or not. It's consistent with some parts of her actions, and inconsistent with others.

I do want to add that it's well written from a technical perspective. There's no big spelling or grammar errors (that I noticed, at least, and normally I'm pretty good at picking them up) and the flow of the sentences was good.
