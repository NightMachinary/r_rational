Thanks! Because it's a novelisation of an RP, this is part of the "action girl squad" book that my RP partner is writing (even though I wrote this section because it's "my character", she'll ultimately re-write or edit it for novel form), and I am writing "a vampire falls in love with an american ww2 deserter who is scared of death" romance story.

My RP partner is unfortunately not part of the rationalverse, so when I start going hardcore on my story in January, if people enjoy it there will be Rational Gay Vampires Kissing being posted here and the more "Rationaliseable" plotline of "people killing vampires" will not be made so.

Thanks for your well wishes! I'm not planning on publishing it beyond putting it on Amazon for $0.99. We mostly want to be able to show our parents what we did for 5 hours every night after school back in the day.
