Miscellaneous service people? A world-renowned chef who is preparing the dinner? A sommelier who will go over the wines and how best to drink them? Live music from a violinist? Spouses and significant others of the super important people? A high-ranking member of the local religious organization? An low-ranking government official who was invited because she was pretty and/or has important parents?

(Naturally some of these would be red herrings, while others would be double agents, security in disguise, activists, journalists, assassins, etc.)

As for keeping everyone in the house, perhaps they're staying there because the police are "on their way". But of course the person who had said they would contact the police is keeping everyone in the house for other reasons, and the police are never going to arrive. Also, because of the ongoing issues with your Snowden-type, cell phones are being jammed (as supposedly happened in the Ecuadorian embassy to Assange).

Breaking open my Laundry Files RPG source book for more ideas:

- Cthunetics is loose parody of Dianetics i.e. Scientology, which recruits international celebrities and makes people sign billion-year contracts to have their spiritual energies cleared of the influence of a Demon in the Pacific.

- Christian Free Church of the Universal Kingdom ('Make babies for God! God is hungry!') is a front group and/or pawn for BLUE HADES.

- Clueless lone wolf terrorists: Dr. East believes he has a new psychotheraputic treatment which he discovered in the notes of a discredited alienist

- Sorcerous lone wolf terrorists: A dotcom startup skirts demonology restrictions to get ahead of the competition; an archaeologist dug up a DEEP SEVEN vitrified embryo that she's been talking to

- Corporations like Dillinger Associates, a British military/espionage research group that go privatized but is still technically part of Q Division, or TLA Corporation, which sells software to Black Chamber and others

- White Knights of Britain, the last remnants of a fascist group from the '40s which rails against "non-Nordics" and who has recently been linked to murders which might be an attempt to recreate /Thule-Gesellschaft/ type invocations.
