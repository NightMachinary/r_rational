I'm working on a setting for an [[http://espionageparty.com/thegame.html][Espionage Party]], where everyone attending is provided with character sheets and then plays those characters for the duration of the night. Players whose characters die re-enter the party with a new character sheet, until some sort of consensus endgame happens.

The setting has magic-users, whose magic is that of Charles Stross' Laundry Files novels: Lovecratian, mathematical, distinctly unpleasant if things go wrong. I think I have a working magic system, and plot and characters regarding that.

There's also a plot with an Edward Snowden character, some counter-intelligence spooks, and some reporters. Snowden is trying to hand off the secrets (a stack of floppies) to the reporters, but he doesn't know which reporters are true ones and which are counter-intelligence. Some may also be counter-counter-intelligence spies from foreign powers.

The party's setting is an American Embassy safe house in Britain, with the American Ambassador, the American Charge d'Affaires (a magic user), a British magic-user, two reporters, two spies, an embassy security person of some sort, likely an American magic-user not aligned with the Charge d'Affaires.

I need more characters, both as start-of-game filler and as mid-game filler. Angleton is a possible late-game filler character, as is a magic-aware SAS operative.

What sort of people are plausible to show up at an unofficial Embassy party in Britain? Why would those people not leave the house once people start dying? Why would new people enter the house? Where would they come from, and why were they late?
