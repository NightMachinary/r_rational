I am making a victorian horror setting loosely based on Bloodborne-Castelvania-WoD.

Things I want to achieve:

Lots of different monsters.

Some monsters as vampires and werewolves are smart and common enough to form communities (secret or not)

With few exceptions mosnters are reuslts of human doing experiments on humans.

A fluid mix of gothic horror and Cosmic horror.

For making the setting I need one or two big events/changes from real world and derive everything eles from them. Explain

magic (not sure if setting has magic) and mosnters from it.

Probabaly something to do with Old Ones. Any ideas?
