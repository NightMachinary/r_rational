  Isekai Fantasy seems seems like the best roll of the dice, as it's fairly conventional to have fantastical powers on insert and only a handful of awful settings compared to paradise settings.

Yes. My 2nd choice would be SF, and hope for a quiet period between galactic revolutions or Borg invasions.

  Also, I feel like I'm misinterpreting what single reset means. Isn't it just one reset only? Eg, a one time rewinding of the clock. Because if so, you'd have to already have molecular nanotech right now if you could develop it in a reset and you should totally share.

Yes, I mean just a single jump back in time for one person. And I would totally share the tech. I don't have the power / resources to just develop MNT right now, but going back in time would give me more time / leverage to do so.
