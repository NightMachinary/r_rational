Picking The Culture seems like choosing a specific setting so I'm not rolling the dice on maybe getting 40k instead, unless 'utopian sci fi' is its own genre.

Isekai Fantasy seems seems like the best roll of the dice, as it's fairly conventional to have fantastical powers on insert and only a handful of awful settings compared to paradise settings.

Also, I feel like I'm misinterpreting what single reset means. Isn't it just one reset only? Eg, a one time rewinding of the clock. Because if so, you'd have to already have molecular nanotech right now if you could develop it in a reset and you should totally share.
