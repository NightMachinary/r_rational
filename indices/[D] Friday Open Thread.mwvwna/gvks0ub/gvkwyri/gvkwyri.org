First thoughts: I wonder if I should choose a fantasy setting for the novelty or stay realistic for uplift power/initial understanding? I also love so many settings that I would do literally anything to avoid getting put into (40k, WtC, Worm etc).

Next and last thought: Pick The Culture every time. It's the most utopian setting I know of.
