It's hard for me to justify picking anything other than The Culture. Admittedly you're only looking at ~300 years of living in as close to heaven as is possible for sufficiently advanced technology to construct, but that's a lot longer than any of us is going to live.

I'm at least a little bit insane, but as a Graydon Saunders fan I would be tempted to pick "SI into the Second Commonweal as a low-to-mid-range Independent". I could plausibly expect a lifespan in the many-centuries, and I think the work and life might be agreeable. But like, would I pick that over the Culture? Aw hell naw.

There's that Mass Effect fanfic where humanity goes the upload route. That could be good too. Not as utopian and wonderful as the Culture, but unbounded lifespan (unlike the Culture).
