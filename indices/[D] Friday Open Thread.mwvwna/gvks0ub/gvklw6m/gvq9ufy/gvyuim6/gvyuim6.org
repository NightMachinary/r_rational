I wrote an anthology/manifesto book-thing as a wordpress blog, but I'm not sure where the best place to post the link to it is where those who would like it would see It. It doesn't seem to quite fit within any pre-existing cultural or genre paradigms so far as I can tell. Any idea where I should post this?
