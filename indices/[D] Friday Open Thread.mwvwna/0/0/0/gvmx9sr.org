  I may be dodging the spirit of the question...

Yes, definitely. The question is more about who is risk adverse / adventuresome. Or learning about other decision criteria like munchkin-ability that override survival concerns.

It is also interesting to see what people like to see others go through vs what they are willing to go through themselves.

  No, not the Culture. That's a sad civilization whatever the depicted tech level.

I can set why being considered an occasional amusing pet by the Minds of the Culture might not be appealing.

But none of the other Involved civilizations appeal to you either? I'm not the type that would enjoy living with the Affront, but there might be others that have broad appeal. The Gzilt were very meh.
