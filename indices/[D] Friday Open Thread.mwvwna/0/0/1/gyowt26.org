I'd go with "SI into Duane's /Young Wizards/ universe, with an option to peal".

The metaphysics are /actually good for people/, the moral arc of the universe literally exists and is bending in the good direction; options for inter-{planetary,stellar,light-cone,continuity} travel, etc. And the Mobiles constitute aligned superintelligence with a personal interest in Earth!

The only downside would be twinges about the opportunity cost of my chocolate consumption.
