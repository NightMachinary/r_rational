So a Random Omnipotent Being (ROB) plucks you out of reality, and has you choose a world to be put into. The ROB allows you to choose the story type, but not the specific setting. What would you choose?

- time loop

  - single reset only, /or/
  - reset upon death or time limit (Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow)
  - no powers or magic ("real world" -ish), /or/
  - straight-up historical (Connecticut Yankee), /or/
  - one of the below settings

- isekai

  - SI into an existing fictional setting you are familiar with

    - fantasy
    - SF
    - historical
    - horror
    - superhero

  - setting you are not familiar with / brand new system
  - generic RPG (D&D, Pathfinder, etc.)

- a standard fantasy, SF, or horror setting (not based on anything, no LitRPG elements)

  - where you are not human or humanoid

The time loop which allows resets upon death are implied to be "hard" and that you will die a lot, with a specific exit condition. A single reset scenario implies that it won't be quite so deadly and you just live out your best life.

My personal top choice would be a single-reset time loop in the real world in modern times. I should be able to develop molecular nanotechnology, achieve biological immortality, and have a grand old time.

My bottom choice would be a superhero setting, Marvel and DC seem to have world or universe-ending threats every year. Not sure I'd want most SF settings (besides Ian Banks' The Culture) because of the same. Ditto for video games like Divinity: Original Sin with universe-ending void coming for us all.
