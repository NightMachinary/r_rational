It is /conventional/ for a Culture citizen to live a few hundred years, and their biological mods are set up that way. But they have the ability to live longer if they choose. Some will upload, some will become drones, some will still live as biologicals. But most choose to pass on after a while.

Spoilers for Hydrogen Sonata: One of the characters, Ngaroe QiRia, is about as old as The Culture itself. Or so he says.
