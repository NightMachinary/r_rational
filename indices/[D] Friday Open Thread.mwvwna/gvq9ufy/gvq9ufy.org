Hi I've just discovered the genre and I'm curious about the definition. I mean - "Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear." " the fictional world follows known, consistent rules" - doesn't most good writing try to achieve this? I haven't started a RF story yet.

I'm curious as to - what would be famous examples of a character acting irrationally because of tropes? In some big piece of pop culture like Star Wars or Harry Potter say?
