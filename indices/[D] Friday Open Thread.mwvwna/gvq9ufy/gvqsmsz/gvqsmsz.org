  [D]oesn't most good writing try to achieve this?
#+end_quote

Yes and no. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_characteristics_of_rationalist_fiction][The "rational" this sub strives for]] isn't the same thing as good storytelling: most of the world's literature, including all of its best-known and highest-regarded works, are not "rational," and there are stories within the umbrella of "rational fiction" that most people here would accept as being fairly rational while also acknowledging that the storytelling isn't very good.

Something important to note but which is not made very explicit by the sidebar and wiki is that, insofar as "rational fiction" is a genre, that genre is more or less defined as "whatever this community likes." It originally sprang up around Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, but the makeup of the sub has evolved significantly in the intervening decade, distancing itself somewhat from the self-identified "rationalists" and gravitating more towards [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works][stories with certain themes]].

  I'm curious as to - what would be famous examples of a character acting irrationally because of tropes? In some big piece of pop culture like Star Wars or Harry Potter say?
#+end_quote

Sure. A couple of easy answers off the bat include Dumbledore's decision to hide the Philosopher's Stone at Hogwarts-- (Why? Why would you store the valuable immortality McGuffin at a /school?/) and Obi-Wan's decision to hide Luke, out of all the worlds in the galaxy... on the planet Vader grew up on... with Vader's only surviving family (great hiding spot.)

Now, these are plot holes, but rational fanfiction is less about sneering at the badness of the holes in the original, and more about exploring /what if that wasn't a plot hole./ It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I tend to find things I enjoy here more than anywhere else these days.

Edit: Here's a few of my favorite selections:

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time][Branches on the Tree of Time]]/ (Terminator fanfiction) is one of my favorite time travel stories ever.
- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation][Chili and the Chocolate Factory]]/ is a love letter to Roald Dahl and satire that also manages to hit on just about all of this sub's major buttons.
- /[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub][There Is No Antimemetics Division]]/ is the SCP Foundation at its very best.
- /[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868][Cordyceps: Too clever for their own good]]/ has some lovely subversions of tropes near to this sub's heart.
- /[[https://unsongbook.com/][UNSONG]]/ is an example of what's often called "rational-adjacent" around here. A delightfully original romp.

Beyond webfiction, I'd also recommend the [[https://www.amazon.com/Laundry-Files/dp/B078JHPNDV][Laundry Files]] by Charles Stross (who has also written other fiction that qualifies in my opinion.)
