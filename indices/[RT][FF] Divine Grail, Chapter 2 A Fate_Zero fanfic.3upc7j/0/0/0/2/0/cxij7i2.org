I'm still planning this part out, but I think question-answering also won't limited by things like "your query must be a singular question" but more like "The Grail only has a information gathered from before the questioning begins, and a limited (if massive) amount of power. If you ask questions and change the state of the world in a big way, The Grail's info is gonna be less relevant since it was gathered before you did X Y Z"
