After thinking about it some more I think that while technically as far as tools for the author go it allows for about the same things. If it -doesn't- actually make a difference then why is it there? why change it if its doing the same thing?

Its like having gun which is described as not working when humidity is higher then 70%, if the character lives in a desert and is never going to be effected by this limitation, then why specify it in the first place? basically Chekhov's gun.
