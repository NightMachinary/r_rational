It is still interesting, but i found the 1st chapter more interesting..

Should I understand from you description that the holy grail in this fic doesn't grant wishes, but instead answers questions?

Also it may be intentional but so far i don't see how what is described explains the need for 7 mages fighting for the right to ask a question..
