That should answer your confusion.

Regarding what kind of things you could do with The Divine Grail: it's still limited by the rules of the magic system. If there is a way to destroy the world in 5 seconds then yeah I guess the Grail could answer that. But there's have to be a way for that to be possible, ya dig? It doesn't rewrite the laws of physics.
