#+begin_quote
  Although this grail doesn't literally grant wishes, a carefully worded query will effectively grant a wish
#+end_quote

if that is the case are you confirming that in your fic magic has no real limit? i.e. if someone made a properly worded "wish" which had the spirit of "how could i destroy the universe 5 seconds after hearing your answer" the grail will be able to give some kind of incantation which would destroy the universe? If so why change the wording?
