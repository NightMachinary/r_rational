  But there's have to be a way for that to be possible, ya dig? It doesn't rewrite the laws of physics.

Yeah I got that, but you said "a carefully worded query will effectively grant a wish." which didn't specify a limitation so i asked if that meant you verified that in the fic magic has no limit, seeing as you are the author and in theory if you decide the world is built that way then anything -will- be possible. anyhow i mostly wanted to be sure there were differences and it wasn't just a different explanation, you can just show the rest in the fic :)
