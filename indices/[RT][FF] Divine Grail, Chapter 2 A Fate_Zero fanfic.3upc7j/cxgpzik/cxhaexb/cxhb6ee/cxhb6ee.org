Hmm i don't know, some things are just not possible with knowledge alone. I mean you can always phrase a question as "how could i make <wish> come true", but while its a valid question some cases will just have a null\"you can't" answer.

from the link you provide:

#+begin_quote
  If a task is absolutely physically impossible no matter what plan or path one could use, it is still impossible. For example, a user of this power cannot simply make objects appear out of thin air or warp reality. If, however, the user has enough time and resources, they may be able to find ways to attain these "impossible" goals.

What is physically impossible of course depends on the universe of the story\what the author decides , but still it is different than the original described in the fate series, at least as far as I am aware of it(just watched the series, never played the games).
