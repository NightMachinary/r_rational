It hasn't been explicitly stated, but it has been implied. And yeah, you can have a colour change as a result of divergence. But what shiny is, is a bit different. Its more along the lines of the most common colour divergence.

> especially as her color scheme is similar to that of the shiny Mega form. It's almost like she's in a partial transition to that, but not fully in it.

True. This will actually get explore later. But the color scheme is more representative of Not!Mia, than it being shiny.

Glad you enjoyed the chapter
