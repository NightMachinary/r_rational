In Ascension-verse, shiny is a divergent-species that has diverged to cause a color varient.\\
And that's it.

What has happened to Mia is far more than that. Dark is not evil and Mia is not turning into a Dark type. Remember, emotions are under the purview of fairy types. And negative emotions are also emotions. It is the gardevoir line that cannot normally consume them. Mia will most definitely change and gain new abilities. She is already beyond the normal purview of her species. Imagine an empathetic monster you fight in battle that literally consumes the pain, fear and other emotions as well.

At the end of the chapter, when Red observes Mia's Skirt, it is noticed to be somewhat more special than just being black.

Furthermore, the assimilation of Not!Mia isn't the only change that Mia underwent. She also understood something when she was shattered within the mindscape.

*Power is a state of Mind.*

This part was intentionally vague, but what exactly happened here will be explored as the story progresses.
