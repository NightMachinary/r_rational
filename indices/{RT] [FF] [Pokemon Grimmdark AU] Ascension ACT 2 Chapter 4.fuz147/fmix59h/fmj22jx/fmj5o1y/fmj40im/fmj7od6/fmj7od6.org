Considering our previous example of divergence results in a color change, it's quite reasonable to assume that something is similar here, especially as her color scheme is similar to that of the shiny Mega form. It's almost like she's in a partial transition to that, but not fully in it.

Never claimed that Dark is evil, just like never assumed Fairy included emotion. Emotion in Mon has always been associated with the Psychic type--For instance, see Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. It's hard to remember something that was never known. Now, if emotions are under the Fairy purview in the Ascension-verse, then either I haven't seen that stated until now or I must have missed that in the work itself.

I *asssume* she is now more Human-like, in that she can have (and consume) both positive and negative emotions, something her evolutionary sisters are incapable of. Certainly makes her stand out as unique.

I look forward to more interesting revelations!
