And all of this before his first badge, this is gonna be the easiest playthrough of kanto ever.

Also, oh no poor mia! Look what you did to my girl! She went off and became a lovecraftian horror! I'm hopeful that all of the baggage between her and Deliah and red will get resolved soon, but I'm starting to doubt that this is that kind of story at this point. Red and Ritchie's stories up to now have both been sufficiently dark that I feel "..." Red is gonna start making appearances sooner rather than later.
