Reading about a character losing again and again does get tiresome. Hopefully this is building up to some kind of character growth (although memory wipes and aren't exactly conducive to learning from mistakes), but for now the story is somewhat frustrating to read. She just smart enough to get into trouble, but not nearly smart enough to handle it. There is that vindictive kind of satisfaction when she's brutally punished for her idiocy, though, so it's not all bad.
