She's certainly not experienced enough to /crush trouble ruthlessly/, at any rate.

Yet.

But yes, while she's started with a lot of natural advantages, this is her /first week/, she still has a long way to go. But she /is/ learning a lot about how to (or in some cases how not to) deal with people and cope with adult-level crises. Once she's out from under her current time pressure (which is at least partially self-imposed), her progress should become a lot more satisfying.

Growth is either demonstrated by overcoming successively harder challenges, or by overcoming similar challenges increasingly easily. She just happens to have been saddled with an unusually involved challenge for her first heroic outing (without even counting Riddle).
