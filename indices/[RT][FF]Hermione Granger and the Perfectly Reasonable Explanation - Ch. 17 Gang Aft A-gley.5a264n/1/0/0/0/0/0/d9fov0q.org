Taylor also has reasonable amounts of downtime between major incidents that let her expand her capabilities. I think a significant strength HPGRE!Hermione and Taylor will end up sharing long-term is that when they identify a weakness, they take steps and work on it so that if something similar happens later, they're better prepared. And then try to anticipate other issues on top of that. Hermione just hasn't had much chance to /do/ that work yet.

Her battle plan for Scabbers was /working/ - even after he surprised her with his unusual willingness to self-mutilate - but she hadn't anticipated problems related to her ethical nature and that there might be plausible alternative explanations, or that she might be disarmed. Which suggests she needs a more robust ethical framework, a better way to detect manipulation, better non-lethal failsafes, and a wrist strap for her wand (or something - the fact that no one at all in Canon uses such an obvious workaround suggests there's a downside, like it interferes subtly with wand-motions, or the strap/your wrist/your wand might be damaged, etc).
