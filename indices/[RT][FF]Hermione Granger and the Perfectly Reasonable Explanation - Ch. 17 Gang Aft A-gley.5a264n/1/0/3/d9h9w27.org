  There's already a FF.net review claiming I gave YH the idiot ball.

I completely disagree. Hermione plans as much as she possibly can, but lets her Ravenclaw-ness blind her to certain failures in her planning, because she thinks she's covered everything conceivable. You want a character who's a realistic genius 11 year old, if she had thought things through any more than she did we would be stepping into wish-fulfilment/Mary Sue territory.
