Thanks. This one took forever, partially because I wrote five different drafts and agonized over which way to go with it. And I hope I haven't lost people, but that was probably inevitable. There's already a FF.net review claiming I gave YH the idiot ball. I /think/ it's justified...particularly first year, when she's so painfully conscious about doing the "right" thing?

FWIW, it also took a while because I was writing the next chapter (or two, maybe, since it came in at 10k+ words) in parallel, which was less about agonizing and more just fiddly detail work. But it only needs an editing pass or two, so it'll probably be up within a week. :)
