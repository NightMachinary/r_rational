I enjoy it, but it's more of a character-driven worldbuilding piece mixed with space opera rather than what we usually consider rational fiction. The worldbuilding is top-notch though IMO.

Familiarity with the Madoka anime is recommended but not required, taking place hundreds of years later. Side content from canon is sometimes incorporated but is thoroughly explained.
