The /backstory/ is pretty explicitly rational. In terms of events happening in the story's present though, it's hard to say. There's very little of the "rationally consider options" thinking/arguing that I consider a major part of the genre, particularly for the main character who reacts more than acts (for very justified in-story reasons, but still). The characters aren't finding tricky/clever solutions to the problems presented to them, they're methodically doing what needs to be done with all of the fancy trickery being provided to the main characters rather than figured out by them.
