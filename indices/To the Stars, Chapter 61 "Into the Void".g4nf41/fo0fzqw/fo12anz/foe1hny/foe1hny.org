hm really? I probably would have just called it rational fiction unqualified (in addition, of course, to those other things). I mean the whole premise is the MSY is powerful today in part because the Mitakihara four were acting rationally with long-term strategy. The modern integration of magical girls with the military is pretty rational given the circumstances, and you get the impression magical girls really explored the limitations of their powers, they really utilize the properties of their soul gems... I mean, I really can't think of a reason to /not/ just call it rational.
