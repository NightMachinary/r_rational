Pace slowed down because the author got their PhD and started working fulltime. I would expect the pace of the last ~3 years to be instructive: between 3-6 chapters a year. However, it's plausible the rate will speed up as the story starts getting tied up - this might be expected as part of the 3/4 years completion estimate, but that's just speculation on my part.

(Also: AO3 thinks the publishing date is 2013, but it's actually late 2011, since it was first only on fanfiction.net.)

(I think Volume III probably only has 1 or 2 chapters left personally, but it's hard to say.)
