/To The Stars/ is on volume three out of six. I'd say we're nearing the climax of Volume III, in three or four chapters. Each of the volumes is easy to consider as their own book. I don't know what the pace is like; I know that it's drastically slowed down recently (read: the last two years) but there's a chance things might pick back up.
