Ch. 60 refresher summary:

Ryouko, Asami, and Simona practice in simulation for their upcoming mission: using Project Armstrong's wormhole apparatus to launch an attack on the Ceph's pulsar mines. The simulation ends in their deaths---not an uncommon occurrence, a fact which weighs on them, especially Asami. But Ryouko works hard to support her girlfriend, even genetically engineering an exotic plant for Asami to wear in her hair as a gift.

Yuma's investigation into the AIs involved in Ryouko's life turns up no TCF corruption, but indicates that the conspiracy she faces may have simply covered their tracks. Her investigation into the mysterious deep space coordinates yields more: a hidden asteroid base. Yuma plans to personally lead a field mission, using experimental anti-IIC technology to prevent any occupants from revealing Yuma's conspiracy to their own. Excluded from Yuma's planning, Kyouko unknowingly organizes a Cult-sponsored expedition to the same exact coordinates.

On Adept Blue, Clarisse van Rossum hears the Goddess's voice telling her not to go to the pulsar.
