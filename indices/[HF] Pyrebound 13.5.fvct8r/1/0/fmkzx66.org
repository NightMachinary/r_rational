Thank you very much! By "the recent arc," do you mean the whole period specified--from 6.1 to now, 13.5--or just chapter 13, or something else entirely?

ETA: Whoops, missed a clause due to early-morning reading--you mean 10.1 till now. Much more manageable, I thought you meant literally half the story.
