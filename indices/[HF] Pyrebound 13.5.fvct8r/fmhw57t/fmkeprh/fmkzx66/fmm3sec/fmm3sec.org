  , I thought you meant literally half the story.

No, no, just this last bit. More specifically, chapters 11 and 12 (and maybe a little of chapter 13). And don't take my opinion as definitive, of course. It was just hard to quite place where the narrative was going. Was this our hero's abyss? It seems like it must have been, and yet there was a lot going on, and many successive turning points, making it less clear. Of course not everything must follow a hero cycle pattern, so maybe this arc serves a different purpose. But what, I'm not quite clear on.

Anyway, thanks again for writing! Looking forward to reading the rest.
