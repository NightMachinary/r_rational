I mean, you probably couldn't do it like a strong woman crushes watermelons with her thighs.

However a leg triangle choke looks dirty and will cut off the blood flow to a brain in under a minute. You would just need to keep it up for about ten minutes till some brain cells die of ischemia and you should be set. Although there is a good chance anything less that like twenty minutes has a chance of the person being ending up in a hospital on life support. Their brain will be mush. But they could die slowly over the course of years in a nursing home. Which is brutal as hell tbh
