I have no trouble believing that somone got strangled between someone elses thighs. Though it seems like it'd be hard to actually kill somone that way.

However I'd find it weird for that detail to make it into the paper unless it had come out during the trial, as it seems a bit overly specific for what I'd expect a coroner to actually be able to determine from an autopsy (I'd expect "strangulation with a large unknown object", to be more along the lines of what goes on the report) and while I'm not sure how true it really is cop shows have trained me to expect the police to avoid leaking details like that to the press during the investigation as a means of verifying potentially false confessions and to avoid revealing to any suspects how much they really know.
