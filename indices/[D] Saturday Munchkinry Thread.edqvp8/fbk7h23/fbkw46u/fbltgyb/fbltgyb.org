Any hammerspace that ignores potential energy breaks thermodynamics.

Simple example: Set up a counterweighted elevator tuned so that your platform will rise when only your weight is on it, but will fall when you + a milk crate of lead is on it.

Sit there producing your milk crate of lead at the top, and storing it at the bottom. Draw infinite power from the pulleys in the middle.

Fix: make retrieving an object either cost or generate a certain amount of some sort of energy, based on the difference between the current potential and previous potential energy of the thing.
