Hammerspace is a dimension that runs alongside our own, so access to it is gained by moving "H"-dimensionally. Think a magician vanishing or producing an item, if you have a coin in your hand, you "push" it into hammerspace, or draw it back out. Because of this, when you extract something your hand is visible the entire time.

I'm not sure yet how I want to deal with the idea of someone who has this ability losing a hand, (most likely through a prosthetic, which would eventually work as well in accessing hammerspace as their own flesh,) but for now it's simply a matter of how fast they can physically take the item.
