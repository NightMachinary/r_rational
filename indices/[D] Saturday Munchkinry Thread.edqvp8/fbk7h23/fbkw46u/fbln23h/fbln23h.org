Christmas present munckinry!

this christmas, gifts you give have the potential to be much more. give the kid a hot wheels toy car? he gets a real car when he opens the present. give a girl barbie, and she gets the matching wardrobe in her size. this will not create life, and will not put children in danger (real space shuttles are too big, unless there is a LOT of extra space nearby). this includes toys for tots, if you donate.

the only limit, is the recipient must want the gift you give them. whats your most creative list of gifts?
