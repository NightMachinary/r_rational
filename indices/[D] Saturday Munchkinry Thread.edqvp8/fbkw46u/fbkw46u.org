Power: personal hammerspace, roughly milk crate sized items (12"^{3)} living creatures can be stored in this way.

•The power involves physically inserting the object into this separate dimension (think a coin disappearing into thin air) partial items can't be stored

•No negative feedback for trying to store something that's too big, it just doesn't work

• No limit on the number of items that can be stored

• No accompanying index ability, you have to remember what you stored to retrieve it, but there's no first in/out, anything can be taken as-needed

• Each object is stored in its own "pocket", separate in all concrete ways from other objects

• Time progresses in hammerspace, but it is an otherwise ideal place to store things. It's a perfect insulator and "unbreakable" insofar as an explosive that detonates inside hammerspace will have its effects limited to its pocket.

• No location rule for retrieval, if I hide something behind my back I can retrieve it from thin air in front of me. It also doesn't need to be with my bare skin, I can take items if my hand is gloved with no caveat.

•W/R/T the above, my hand isn't physically subject to the conditions of the pocket, but I am not protected from burns or degradative effects of a molten or corrosive object

• Objects stored aren't subject to gravity

I think that's everything.
