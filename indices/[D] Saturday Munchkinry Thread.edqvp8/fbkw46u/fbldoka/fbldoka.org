-Can you open more that one portal/door/whatever into hammerspace at a time?

-Does the portal have to be facing you or could you turn it outwards to catch incoming projectiles?

-What happens when something too big tries to go into a portal? Like, let's say you tried to drive a car into one.

-How far away from yourself can you open portals to hammerspace?

-Are the boundaries within hammerspace interactable? Could you create a shallow portal at around knee height, step on/in it, then create another and do the same to walk through the air?

-How fast can you open and close a portal? Maybe you could generate electricity by rapidly opening and closing a portal that holds a magnet near a conductive substance.
