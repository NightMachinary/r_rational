Okay, here's two potential metaphysics for hammerspace:

1. It's a continuous dimension along which things can move. This would work like our spatial axes, but in a direction we can't percieve.

This means that things entering hammerspace (moving in the H+ direction) appear to shrink away to nothing, and things exiting hammerspace (moving in the H- direction) seem to grow into their full size.

If you wanna make this process "instant", you just need to throw a lot of H-ward acceleration at it (on both ends) - you'll need some sort of hyperspace catcher and launcher on either end, and there's neat failure modes for those devices. You'd still be able to see the object shrink away with a sufficiently high speed camera, maybe.

This is potentially vulnerable to stuff like "what happens if you put something into hammerspace, but only halfway" - does it stay "shrunk" (it's really just far away in a dimension we have a hard time conceptualizing, but whatever)? Do accelerations only affect the part in realspace? But it's kinda stuck in hammerspace, where it can't move? Also you can get to hammerspace from anywhere in normal space, so how does that work for something that's halfway in?

2. Hammerspace is actually a /quantized/ dimension. Now items can only ever be in one state or the other. This would work sort of like the energy levels of an electron, or standing waves on a piece of string - there's a fixed set of states it can be in.

In this case, instead of a launcher and a catcher, you'd have something more like a dimensional tuning fork on either end; jam the business end of fork into the object to store and pour energy into it, and it'll make the object vibrate at H+ instead of H0. In order to bring objects back, you'll want either an H-vibration damper or another tuning fork tuned to realspace on the other end. Again, you'd need to dump a lot of energy into it all at once, and you might get a weird flickering effect as the object bounces between modes, or maybe some flashes of light if your hyperspatial energy can be lost into photons, but you wouldn't get the shrinking imagery.

This one also has failure modes, like for instance if H-vibration wears off, eventually things will drop out of your hammerspace. Or if hammerspace has a lower vacuum energy than reality, you could eventually cause a false vacuum collapse as everything falls in to hammerspace (and that's why hammerspace /has/ to be H+ (more energetic), because if it's H- and is less energetic we're all screwed probably)
