  Can you "retrieve" an object on yourself and wear it? I'm thinking instant armor. If you can have an instant anti-rad suit, you can start playing with radioactive material directly on the battlefield.

This is a great idea, I guess under my own rules it would depend on their size. You could vanish a motorcycle helmet and then hammerspace it back onto your own head, or vanish and materialize gloves, and so on. Since objects inserted retain their shapes, you could also do this for a jumpsuit. If you got into one, let it drop to your feet, and then pushed it into hammerspace, you would have it ready as-needed to put back around your legs and draw it back up. If the jumpsuit also includes boots/foot coverings, then your feet would need to be in the air. sitting down with feet raised would work -- but a person /could also/ "jump" into a hazmat suit, insofar as they'd jump, pull it out of hammerspace around their feet, and begin lifting it up over themselves.
