As with any appear-something-out-of-nowhere type of power, you have to think about how it interacts with the matter around it. I'd assume disappearing it would leave a vacuum (and a popping sound when the air collapses), but what about taking it out? It wouldn't grow out from a point since shunting something along a fourth spacial dimension would be instant. If it outright replaces the matter, then you'd have a perfect cutter and destroyer of anything. If it pushes the matter away, you'd be creating black holes that grow at the speed of light since the acceleration of the particles, and the energy they would have, would be infinite due to the instantaneity of the appearance. On a more macro scale, can you take it out in any gas? In water? Honey? Mercury? Glass? Sand? Aerogel? Etc.

There's also the question of how you define an "object". If its "a solid block of matter", then you'd be ruling out sand, glasses of water, soil, and living beings (composed of all three basic states of matter) (Side note, would assume that your pocket dimension has air and atmospheric pressure, or else things would explode or stop working. In fact, a bunch of stuff reliant on the presence of gravity /would/ stop working). There'd be the question of if you can store two pebbles at the same time, or if you'd have to tie them together with a rubber band first, or something. If it's "a volume the size of a milk crate", then you've again created a perfect cutter that can cut out milk-crate-sized chunks out of everything. When it comes down to it, the world is just a wash of atoms that happen to connect to each other in different ways, so what happens at that level?

In terms of applications, there's being a delivery person. No need for an entire truck when you can have just one person. Same for space travel - you'd be saving the companies millions by having infinite mass-free storage. And also for transporting hazardous materials. You'd be able to completely securely store valuable items as well, though that would make you the target for people who want the stuff stored in your storage. You'd also make any check-in security useless and be able to bring anything anywhere, obviously.
