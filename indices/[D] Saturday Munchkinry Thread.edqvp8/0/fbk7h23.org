So I guess *Bill Gates* consistently participates in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/edjz1k/bill_gates_was_my_secret_santa/][reddit's secret santa gift exchange]], which made me think of how matching with him might best satisfy my values, in either direction. I guess being his recipient would entail a small legion of assistants poring over your post history to find compatible presents -- hopefully they'd be pretty discerning, since I don't think I'd much want a 90 lb box with net cost ~$1k. Instead, I think I'd much prefer, say, a 10-minute phone conversation. So since you can't control gifts he (and his staff) purchases you, *I'm curious how all y'all would munchkin 10 minutes of his undivided, teleconferenced attention.*

I think I'd personally focus on two topics, trying to start a short dialogue on something like:

Cause Prioritization: I've noticed from your recent pivot to charity work that your primary focus is on developing world health. What are your thoughts on the moral patienthood of nonhuman animals? (or global catastrophic risk, or senescence research, or social change vs. direct work, etc. Probably the first one, though). Would probably come off as a crazy here.

Personal Job Searching: Do you happen to know anything about navigating the tech job market in Seattle? (A-WINK). Then when interviewing I could shamelessly name drop -- "well, I was talking to Bill the other day, and he mentioned that... Bill who? Gates, lives near here, you've probably heard of him; as I was saying...". Would probably come off as a parasitic opportunist here!
