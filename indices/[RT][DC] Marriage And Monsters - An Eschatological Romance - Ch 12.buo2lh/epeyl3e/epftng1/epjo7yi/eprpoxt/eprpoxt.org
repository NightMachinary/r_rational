Like someone else mentioned the cowboy being the joker/comedian/loki has major potential to take over the narrative with themes of "look how bad people actually are" from all of the fractured groups and realities fighting.

Aslan can be a major threat though, I think he killed the first kid to avoid the five being able to send him back or something. He also has the potential to highjack the military with xenocide/rapture theme.

I don't really understand how the cowboy had the gifts for the kids though, this seems to imply he's a subordinate or at least connected in some way? Or it could just be the reality holes coordinating to kill the dragon/closer.
