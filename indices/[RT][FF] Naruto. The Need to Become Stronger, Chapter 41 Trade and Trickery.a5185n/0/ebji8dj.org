I have a question about this situation. Subtracting Temari and Kankuro out of the equation for this.

How exactly could the Konoha 11 get in trouble for meeting up like this in a legal sense? What constitutes this as a "council" when they could just as easily say they're training together? The fact that it's secret wouldn't really change anything, It's not like you're forced to announce every time you meet up with friends and train with another Konoha shinobi. I don't see what could legally happen to everyone if Temari and Kankuro "exposed" this meeting had they been turned away. I feel like a may have missed something here so I'd appreciate the clarification.

On a different note, seriously keep up the good work. You're putting these chapters out pretty damn fast.

Edit: I was gonna leave this review on the chapter but I think it'll be easier for discussion if I posted it here

I absolutely love the short exchange between Temari and Naruto at the end of the chapter. Of course you gotta torture us with the cliffhanger lol. Can't wait for the next chapter, I'm pondering what she means by "nothing much". I think she's come to the conclusion that Naruto is just a relatively normal person despite his abilities and what he did to Gaara.

Notice how Tenten is acting around Kankuro right now, people tend to have a heavily altered perception of someone when extreme emotions and/or trauma are at play. Since Naruto is the guy who killed her little brother, she's gonna have a certain perception of him based off that before ever truly interacting with him. Once you start mingling with people on a different "side" than you, you start to realize you're not all that much different. Naruto is just a normal person pretty much and she's seeing that.

Now I may be completely off the mark but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it.
