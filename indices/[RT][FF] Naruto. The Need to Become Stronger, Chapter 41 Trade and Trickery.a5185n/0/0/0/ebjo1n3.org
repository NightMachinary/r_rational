I see, so the number of people here is basically the big concern. Had Naruto just simply shared his findings about chakra with either Sasuke or Sakura since they were all on the same team it wouldn't get any attention, where as amassing a big group like this with the intention of gaining power of any kind is a threat to what the council established. And so you're saying even if there aren't any actual laws against grouping together and training/sharing knowledge, the council wouldn't need there to be to still strike out against them sorta how the Uchiha clan were taken out behind the scenes.
