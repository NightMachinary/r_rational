Thanks! I thought I was improving, but it's nice to have it confirmed :)

The explanation for that lies in the mechanics of summoning and that of chakra itself: It was hinted at in the chapter where Naruto learns the summoning technique, as I explain here:

But there is also a second reminder given in this chapter, if you read between the lines:

  “Don't tell anyone,” he said hurriedly. “Nobody is supposed to know I have this.” He unfurled the parchment which he had wrapped around the handle of the knife. “This is a summoning scroll, the kind we were given in the Forest of Death. The basic idea is that you fill the knife with chakra, clone it, and then when the cloned knife hits your target the resulting burst of chakra activates the scroll and summons you to its location.” He showed the scroll to Shino. “The thing is, I tested it and the natural resistance that makes it so difficult to seal chakra also makes it much harder to summon it, at least when it comes to people rather than spirit animals since those kinda have to be able to absorb natural chakra just to stay alive. So if you're able to shunt all your chakra elsewhere, even temporarily, it suddenly becomes possible to teleport yourself without it costing everything you have.”

Basically, so-called spirit animals can only exist despite their massive size because they absorb natural chakra from their surroundings: That's why you only have giant chakra animals in high-chakra density areas like the forest of death, and why summoned animals have to go back to where they came from after a while. Because spirit animals constantly absorb chakra from their surroundings, they don't have the resistance to foreign chakra that humans do - they would die if they did! That's why they are vulnerable to genjutsu and summoning techniques, and that's why Gaara lost his ability to resist Naruto's summoning the moment he let Shukaku take over.
