Yeah, it's important to bear in mind that Konoha isn't a modern nation-state. It's a feudal military dictatorship, kept in check by local nobility. This study-session annoys every power group within the system, as no clan wants its techniques given away to their rivals.

To a large extent, the law here is whatever the people in charge say it is, provided they can at least come up with a fig leaf of a justification. Purposely scaring them or annoying them is dangerous. Worthwhile, for this group of students, but still dangerous.
