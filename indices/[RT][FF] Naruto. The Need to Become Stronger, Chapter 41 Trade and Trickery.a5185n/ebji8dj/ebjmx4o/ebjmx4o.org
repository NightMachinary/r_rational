On the subject of why they don't want the council to know it's basically just what Sasuke said last chapter. The konoha council doesn't want anyone getting power too fast, before they've proven their loyalty, before they've proven they aren't another Itachi. This goes double with a large group gaining a lot of power. What the council would be concerned about is a group other than themselves having significant military might, for fear of revolt. A very reasonable fear given what we know of Narutos motives. You also talk about what legal charges the council could bring against the Konoha 12. You must bear in mind that Konoha is not a democracy nor even a constitutional monarchy, its a military oligarchy. The only reason laws exist is to govern those without a clan, when the clans interests are at stake the council can take unilateral action.
