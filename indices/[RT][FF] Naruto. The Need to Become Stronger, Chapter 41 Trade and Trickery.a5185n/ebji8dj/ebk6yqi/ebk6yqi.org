You have to remember that forbidden techniques are a thing. In NTBS it's not so much that you can't learn certain techniques because they are dangerous to the user (That never made much sense to me: If you're using child soldiers you might as well go all the way), but rather that Konoha is worried that those techniques will fall into enemy hands. Imagine how much the Sand could learn if they found an opportunity to read Naruto's mind, for example. Naruto might get away with learning secret techniques because of his family connections, but sharing secret intel with the Kazekage's children or even with Leaf gennin is a huge no-no.

The other part is that just like Kaukamieli said, there is as much rivalry between clans as there is between Villages. Sure, Konoha is united in theory, but they still spend 99% of their time interacting with other Leaf shinobi, and the thing about ninjas is that nobody actually trusts each other. If Neji were to reveal the Byakugan's secrets to Sasuke for example, well, Hiashi would not be pleased. And of course, the first priority of anyone in power is to hold on to it, and no ruler or council would ever be happy about nobles sharing power and meeting in secret behind their back.
