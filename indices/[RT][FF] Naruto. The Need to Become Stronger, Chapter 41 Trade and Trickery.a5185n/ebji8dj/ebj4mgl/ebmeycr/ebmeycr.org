I've been rushing through all the chapters in a couple of days now and I love the story. Also reading them so quickly there is really visible improvement in your writing, so kudos to that.

What I might have missed somehow is, how exactly Naruto was able to summon Gaara / one-tail in a previous chapter. Wasn't the rule that you have to be stronger than the target, i.e. expand more chakra than the target? It was hinted by other characters later, that it only worked once Gaara let one-tail take over, but I don't see how that would make it easier, and how Naruto would know to wait for that moment.
