Hey, had a question. Will you be releasing the last 3 chapters as separate Patreon posts? I'm ready to celebrate years of entertainment with my wallet, so let me know the plan. Also I know the appeal of 103 releases is horribly tempting, but what I'm not-so-subtly implying is that you deserve the patreon money for every chapter!
