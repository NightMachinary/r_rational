I strongly disagree with the scummy/greedy label, since these will be (I assume) separate chapters and you've always had a per-chapter patreon. It's not like you're springing a predatory surprise on your patrons - though an advance warning would be nice in case anyone didn't plan to pay in quick succession. Also, money is money, especially when it's honestly earned. I think a lot of web serial authors write for the joy of writing, but it's perfectly acceptable to profit off of your hard-earned work. And don't worry- I'm not so touchy. Just sharing my two cents because I thought it was inequitable for you to lose a hefty sum out of generosity.
