Ohhh, yes, I think it might've been the word bespoke. Well, I'm glad I got to learn something today! Thank you for explaining it more thoroughly.

I had no idea that's a thing, but I'm glad it is! Sounds pretty great that you get your own book printed, just one (and it doesn't sound THAT expensive either). I'll keep the idea in mind for the future, because this is more of an ebook/audiobook situation - he wouldn't carry a physical copy of a book around with him to read. But thank you for this idea, it's great!
