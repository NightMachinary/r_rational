The book is quite big so maybe by the time he reaches the current chapter the rest will already be released :)

Alternatively, maybe "Harry Potter and the Natural 20" would be nice if he plays Dungeons&Dragons. Book 1 and 2 (Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets) are complete though the author stopped in the middle of book 3
