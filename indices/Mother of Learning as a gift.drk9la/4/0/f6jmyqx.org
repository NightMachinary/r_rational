I considered becoming a patreon, yeah! Cause I also wanna support the author if they made something that a loved one will enjoy, it's nice nice to do idk. I love your personalised PDF idea, I'll definitely work on putting something together! I think I'm gonna include the books that didn't make the cut for sure, cause it's a shame not to. I just hope it'll make him happy üòä thank you so much for your advice, helped a lot! ‚ù§Ô∏è
