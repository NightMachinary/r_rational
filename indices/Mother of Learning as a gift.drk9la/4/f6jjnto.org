A gift does not necessarily have to cost anything :) And insofar as people might feel that gifts do have to cost something, you've clearly put in plenty of effort into vetting stories to find one he likes.

Just send it the same way you'd send any ebook, but as a link

You can always converted it to PDF if that makes it more official looking haha

Or to make it even more gift-y you could even add a page containing a love note at the beginning of the PDF to personalize it, or a page at the end of the PDF outlining the selection process and the second and third options and all the books that didn't make the cut, or idk add fanart or something.

Or/And! You could donate to the author and tell your boyfriend that you did that [[https://www.patreon.com/nobody103]]
