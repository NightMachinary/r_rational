Two reasons why that wouldn't work, before I get to the subject of further hacks in Simverse IV:

-The simulator has limited resources available. While it can handle a hack from a single ship, it would be difficult to accommodate 3 million new realtime zones to fully render, much less the googol^{googol} that follows. You'll crash the simulation in literally a fraction of a second.

-To duplicate 2^{3,000,0000} entities, you're going to have to find 2^{3,000,000} rendered sectors. I mentioned that an 'empty swap' doesn't work.
