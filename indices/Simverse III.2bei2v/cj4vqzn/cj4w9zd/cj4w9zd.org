Beyond a certain distance, you can swap as fast as your computer allows you to.

The problem with your method is that

A) You can only swap whole sectors. Unless your memory card is one hundred thousand meters cubed, there is no point in doing so.

B) The only useful pre-calculation is when you are trying to guess the coordinates of a sector outside of your realtime zone. Inside that zone, you can read the coordinates off the sectors around you directly, calculate the hack and apply it much faster than you could by transmitting it and receiving the calculated information at the speed of light. Plus, you can't read coordinates outside of your own realtime zone, so it is limited in that aspect.
