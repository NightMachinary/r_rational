Maybe have a tether behind the ship with a sensor on it and a small computer preloaded with transportation stuff. It sends details of the code around you to another zone which is next to a huge super computer. The super computer calculates all the details and sends the small computer back, and it relays the code.

I imagine you could use it for rapid ship to ship combat and teleportation. Jump in, see an enemy, teleport to a safe unrendered zone.
