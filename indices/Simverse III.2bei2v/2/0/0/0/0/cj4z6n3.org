The idea was that you'd the ftl power to skip the information travels at light speed. You are in zone 1, your relay computer is in zone 2 and is much smaller and preloaded with another location. You report a conflict, teleport the relay computer over, it sends light speed signals at the speed of light to the massive computer 50m away, receives signals, teleports back.

Clarifying whether this work is important for other things. If the rendering time is 0.03 seconds and you can cut it down to 0.02 then a third of the time you can teleport first, which is a huge advantage, though thinking about it the required times stop that. If it works it also means you can send ftl signals and teleport an army over, having given them your coordinates.
