Hmm. Instead of swapping two sectors, could you copy the state of the first to the second? Exponential growth! You said that the verification tool checks on the oort cloud about once a minute, and that being outside lunar orbit (rendering cycle length up to 10^{-5} seconds) gives you enough time to do a teleport, whose time requirement surely is on the order of a duplication. 3 million duplications and then 2^{3 million} spaceships doing whatever the hell you programmed them with for 30 seconds is surely an instant global victory condition. (Or just simulate your own sub-universe for longer than Gurkenglas' universe might have left to live.)
