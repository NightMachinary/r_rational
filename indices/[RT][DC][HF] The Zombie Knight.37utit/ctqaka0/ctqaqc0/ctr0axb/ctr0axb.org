When they were all trying to escape the guys at the castle, along with the queen, is the first case that comes to mind. There was that explosion dude but it didn't strike me like he could displace enough matter quickly enough to catch up with a reaper underground. And everyone except the bodyguard had reapers and the bodyguard could've just stayed behind in the castle. I don't think there was a net under the castle either.

Also, I just realized that the aberration's powers have much less explanation than that of the servants and so are kind of cheating, especially in the latest chapter where they make use of a, from what I can tell, completely never before used BS ability.

edit:

And also all the times when they're trying to get somewhere--they are limited by a reaper's max flight speed anyways so why not solve the human transport problems by just killing them and rezzing where needed? Doesn't seem to take that long to rez from nothing and time would still probably saved because the reaper can just move at max speed to the destination instead of them having to match transport speed.
