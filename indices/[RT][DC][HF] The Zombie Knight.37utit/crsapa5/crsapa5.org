So I've read a fair bit of this, certainly not a majority yet, but I've ran into a thing that I feel a lot of writers do that I don't really enjoy.

X happens. X has a lot of implications, HUGE implications. It totally changes things for the protagonist, for the reader, for the world, and then when we are just sort of getting into the action regarding X's changes, suddenly A, B, C, D, and E are added. And now we have no clue what the world is really like. Before it was a normal world or a setting we recognized + X, which means that we can start to think and ruminate on how X might change the world.

E.g. Rational Luther in the world of Superman (using this example because Mr Alexander Wales is well known). It has far reaching consequences. The reader starts to think about what might change, but imagine if suddenly it was also revealed that Luther could do magic and that there was a sentient race of bugs living in the Earth's Crust. In my opinion, now its too much. At this point, for that story, I am having a really difficult time understanding what the rules are. And this might just be me, but I like knowing the rules, especially if the author is setting us up for this to be a sort of rules centric story.

For Zombie Knight in particular, I really felt like a lot of things were explained early, and so, as the reader I was mentally prepared. There were some extra things thrown in, fine, that is a bit of a stretch, but now I can understand why their impact will be major.

But when "abilities" start showing up, and I'll try to keep this spoiler free, I felt like I was now in a world where anything could happen. There could be magic, or AI, or new sentient races, or any number of things. I don't know what the rules are, or what the baseline rules are, and its like, sadface stuff there.

Im not sure if I am explaining this very well, but I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts. Also, I think Zombie Knight is pretty darn great, and this story certainly isn't the worst abuser of this particular aspect of story telling, but it just made me think of it.
