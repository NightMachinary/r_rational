I think part of it is that it /is/ a world where anything could happen, but that anything has been very carefully picked out by the author. The story scales up. It starts with Hector, then Hector's city, than his country, then globally local conflicts, than international conflicts, and will get even greater from there.

Also, the rules are kind of poorly explained at the beginning. The author gets much better at it later on. I'm not aware of any case where the rules are downright violated, though. There is a cohesive set of rules, and it makes sense. Eventually.

I think part of it is that there is a rather large world beyond what the story's currently about. Like, huge. International political intrigue, history, godlike monsters wrecking havoc.

The "normal world + X" element is fine, so long as it really is "normal world + X". But it's more than that, it's "World with X, Y, Z, Q, and ‚àè which looks normal on the surface if you happen to live in a global backwater that hasn't suffered magical apocalypse for long enough to build up a tech base.".

I guess my point is that it's not a "Rational Luther in the world of Superman" story. It's high fantasy, there just happens to be an approximately 21st century facade on it.

The abilities, by the way, are awesome, and make sense once they're properly explained. You will see someone weaponizing magical fluorine chemistry at some point. I promise.
