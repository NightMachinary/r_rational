*In rational fiction:*

- The author displays respect for the value of intelligence, reason, forethought, and preparation.
- The author seeks to explore the moral and material implications of the elements in the story, as well as alternate solutions to presented problems, even if they violate the usual conventions of the genre.

- Consistent worldbuilding. In pre-established settings (like fanfiction) the author makes an effort to remove or justify seeming incongruities.
- Intelligent characters, who seek to understand the world, and to competently pursue their goals in accordance with their values.
- A focus on the thought-processes of the characters as they pursue said goals.
- Themes and topics that relate to the extensive exploration of solution-space, e.g. metaethics, effective altruism, munchkinism, transhumanism.
