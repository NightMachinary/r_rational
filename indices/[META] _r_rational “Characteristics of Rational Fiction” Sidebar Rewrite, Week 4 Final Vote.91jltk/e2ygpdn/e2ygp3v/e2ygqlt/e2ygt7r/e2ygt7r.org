*Rational fiction* is fiction which specifically emphasizes themes related to *rationality*, where "rationality" loosely refers to a set of ideals such as reason, science, thoughtfulness, learning, excellence, self-improvement, goal-directed behavior, optimal strategy, understanding how things work, and similar ideas. A defining feature of rational fiction is that it strives to stand up to careful reader scrutiny by proceeding /realistically/ given the setting, rather than according to standard literary forms or tropes (if these are used, they must be justified independently). Rational works should possess at least one, and preferably both, of the following attributes:

*Competent* characters: Characters possess at least [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent][Level 1 intelligence]]; that is, they act as intelligent agents optimizing to the best of their ability towards their goals. Characters do not ignore obvious opportunities and weaknesses for the sake of the plot.

*Consistent* settings: Settings obey rigorously applied rules. Every aspect of the plot and setting is a plausible consequence of the underlying rules and the initial setup, and conversely, logical consequences of the rules are not ignored for the sake of the plot.

These qualities apply to many works of fiction to some degree, but rational fiction respects them with an extra /thoroughness/. Other genres may relax the rules in order to establish a certain payoff: action that sacrifices physics for fun, thrillers that ignore probability for the sake of twists, literary fiction whose oddities are designed to be metaphorical rather than literal. In rational fiction, competence, consistency, and rationality are /themselves/ part of the payoff, and are not sacrificed for other considerations.

*Rationalist* fiction is a subgenre of rational fiction in which reasoning techniques are shown in a way that is realistic and /emulatable/ by the reader. Such works explicitly demonstrate techniques from science, logic, probability, game theory, decision theory, or other fields. The story is often structured like a puzzle that the reader can solve by applying such techniques.

Rational fiction has developed a set of common tropes which convey its aesthetics and ideals, including Munchkinry, Genre-savviness, Deconstruction, Worldbuilding, and others.
