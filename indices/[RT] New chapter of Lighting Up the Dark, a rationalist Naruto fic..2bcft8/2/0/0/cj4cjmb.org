There are two problems with that. First, ordinary clones aren't great at taijutsu. In canon, you'll note that when Sakura uses clones in her fight against Ino, they only deliver a single blow (IIRC) before popping. Here, it's the limitations of Clone AI, which make it hard to create a clone that can act with the flexibility and creativity required of a good taijutsu user.

Secondly, Hinata's technique costs chakra each time she uses it. Not much, but she's not a chakra powerhouse like Naruto, and creating clones with a bunch of extra chakra would cost her over time (especially since clones only have 1 HP, so they wouldn't last long individually).

The Shadow Clone Technique would solve these problems, but Naruto isn't prepared to teach it to her after what Kakashi-sensei said about the dangers (which seem like the sort of thing that could indeed apply to Hinata).
