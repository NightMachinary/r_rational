Honestly I just used the spoiler tag because the original post did, but I don't think it's at all necessary. As for the usage, it's [Title here, I put "regarding your spoiler", no quotes](#s "remember the quotes, put text here").

Anyway, I greatly enjoy your fic, thank you for that. It's one of the better I've seen.
