I'm sorry for the lack of information on which interpretation of those terms I meant.

In most cases I adhere to *sapience* as the ability to use tools, to plan ahead, for intellectual capacity, so to speak, whereas *sentience* more properly reflects the emotional spectrum; empathy, capacity for pain and passion, those things.

In light of your story this interpretation feels true concerning chakra: it can react and respond to stimuli in the fashion of an automaton, but does not care for feelings of its master / wielder, nor the target it is aiming / aimed at. It has no aspirations of its own, as far as I understand it, and I would even dare say chakra is bereft of any agency.

The counter to that hypothesis are the tailed beasts, of course, being of pure chakra and actual goals, whatever those might be.
