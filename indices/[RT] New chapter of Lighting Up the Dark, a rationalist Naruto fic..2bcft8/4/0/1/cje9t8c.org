I am curious how you will explain techniques that involve the user's soul stepping outside their body, or immortality techniques like those of Sasori and Kakuzu. Or how Orochimaru couldn't use his arms anymore after his chakra-arms were sealed. I think that in canon naruto, chakra basically is your soul. Is your explanation of chakra consciousness a replacement of that? Or is it an addition? Does that mean people have three consciousness inside them: Chakra, their brain and their soul?

if so, that's freaky!
