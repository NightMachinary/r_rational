I've seen different people use those two terms differently, so I'm not sure exactly how to answer that. But in short, according to the conventional understanding of chakra (which may or may not be incomplete or incorrect), chakra is self-aware, aware of its immediate surroundings, and capable of processing information. However, it has no personality and is completely passive, doing nothing except react to its master's will (conscious and unconscious). Most ninja, when they stop to think about it at all, tend to consider the intelligence of chakra as a part of the general intelligence that runs their bodies.

There'll be more on this later in the story, but probably not for a while, since chasing up the deeper implications of chakra intelligence would take way more advanced knowledge than our Genin have.
