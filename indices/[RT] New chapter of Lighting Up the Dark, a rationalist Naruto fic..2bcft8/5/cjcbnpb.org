Good lord, The Naruto fanfics here made me nostalgic and start to rewatch the actual show.

It's painful how mind numbingly stupid Naruto and everyone else is, I swear y'all are spoiling me. Having a ready supply of fiction with intelligent characters is wonderful.

Anyway, I'm really curious to see what you do with Gaara,especially whether his seemingly violent nature stems from genuinely alien thought processes.
