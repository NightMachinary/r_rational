Something I'm not understanding; Grak is the end result of a single founder line that has bred solely by parthenogenesis to avoid "drift," and as a result could be seen as a prince/ess. But Grak left Darili Irid because he was going to be forced into sharing a Kiss with a bondmate.

Seems odd that a line which prides itself on not drifting would force its heir into a Kiss with someone else... wonder if that's part of the reason Grak left?

Also, someone refresh my memory, was there a conversation with Fenn and her views on children before? I seem to recall (or at least believe) that she's against the idea because she doesn't want to raise a child who had to face the alienation she herself faced as a half-elf, but I don't know if that was actually written. Or maybe this is some more evidence that Nellan is a child she had before?

Next, I'm wondering why the two unknown companion connection lines disappeared when Joon came back from the DM discussion. His skill was still over 100, so it's not based on that... did the DM exclude something from him, perhaps?

Finally, clarification question on chapter 80 when they're discussing the ritual; Joon originally says he could take Solace's druid connection to do the ritual, but she'll come back as a non-druid. Isn't Solace's druidity (fake words are fun!) what would keep the bottle stable? So what would be the point of even proposing that, besides getting Solace alive again. Locus would still die.

... thinking about it, Joon was probably just speaking outloud, huh? Anyway, good chapters, lots of interesting stuff afoot :)
