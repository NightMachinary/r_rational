It's unlikely that Joon would be able to create a set of tailored scar magic ex novo. The original explanation by Fenn suggests it's neither quick nor easy:

  You go through the pain of this scarring in very specific patterns, and when you're done and they've healed, you can put your fist through stone or leap up a few stories into the air. The problem with it, aside from the perfection of technique needed to do the scarring right, is that the scars themselves need to be positioned properly upon the skin, and if the skin changes too much, the magic gets lost.

So Fenn went through the legitimate process but the effect waned with time and bodily change. Reminds me of the blueprint theory analogy. Easier to fix loose shingles than make a new wing of a house.
