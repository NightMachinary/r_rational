Come on, Joon! Copy Feen's scars onto your own body and try your best to patch the mistakes. Write down the materials you would need for a more complete version of the scar magic so you can passively start collecting them. Look at Fallatehrs scars and try to combine the knowledge from the two of them to build scar magic on as many companions as you can.
