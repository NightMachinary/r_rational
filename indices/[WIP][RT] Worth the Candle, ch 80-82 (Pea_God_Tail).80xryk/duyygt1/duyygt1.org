February report, x-posted from [[https://www.patreon.com/posts/february-report-17268937][my Patreon]], probably not that interesting to anyone:

I think that word count is a terrible metric of performance for an author, because word count isn't terribly hard to inflate, and really easily comes at the expense of the story construction and/or quality of the prose. That being said, it's not like you can easily quantify a work's other qualities, which is why word count dominates discussion of output. Word counts are reported verbatim as taken from the function in Google Docs, but shouldn't be treated as absolute, since there are lots of ways to count words and those methods are in disagreement with each other.

The last chapter of January was published on the 26th, so the February period covers all writing done January 27th to February 28th, a period of 32 days. In that time, 10 chapters were posted (not including ch 75, which was a compilation of material), totaling 60,329 words, or an average of 1,885 words per day, and an average chapter length of 6,032 words.

And some other stuff, mostly to answer the question of what else I'm doing with my time, and in the interests of being at least transparent about where my time is spent (so you can keep an eye on it):

Words written for Worth the Candle but not actually used in it total roughly 6K words for the month, though some of those are in the form of scenes that might potentially find a home later.

Words written for other projects:\\
~12K for A Series of Fights Without Any Meaning [WIP Title]\\
~4K for untitled fantasy/military novel\\
~3K for Glimwarden

Reddit comments for the month total (very roughly) 12K words, not counting quotes or mod messages.
