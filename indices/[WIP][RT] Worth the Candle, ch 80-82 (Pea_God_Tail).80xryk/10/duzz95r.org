That first chapter had so much going on and I thought it did an excellent job of capturing a D&D timed skill challenge with the race-against-time rush. Hope there are more of these!

Some parts made me laugh inappropriately though. Joon telling Val that she had to "hurt it to save it" like a parent with the tough love mentality - that won't come back to bite him, right? I laugh-groaned when it was finally clear why Mary was chosen as the nickname over Amy or Liss... Virgin Mary giving birth.

  On Earth -- well, no, in the specific part of Earth that I grew up on, we're raised to believe that there's only one singular god, who made everything in the whole world, wrote all the laws of physics, set up all the rules the world works by, is omnipotent, meaning that he's all powerful, he's omniscient, which means that he's all-seeing, and finally, the kicker, he's omnibenevolent, which means that he's all-good, as good as good can be.‚Äù

When you phrase it like that, it looks like one of those super obvious "which one doesn't belong?" multiple choice questions.

I'm wondering how the tuung can live in the Boundless Pit with their strict H2O needs. If it's like the hole in Cyoria, then they might have access to groundwater but that doesn't seem sufficient. Some sustainable source of water constantly pouring off the edge?
