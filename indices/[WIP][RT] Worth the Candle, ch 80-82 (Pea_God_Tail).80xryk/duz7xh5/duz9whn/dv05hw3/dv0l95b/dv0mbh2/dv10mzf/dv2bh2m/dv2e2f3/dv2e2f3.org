Take one step further back: Joon chose to be around these people. He /picked/ them. He didn't have to make friends with someone just because the game there would be game-layer benefits to doing so. Like Mary says in this very chapter-set, Joon never had to actually "let her in" on the whole game-layer thing. She could have just been some random person who /he/ happened to have secret useful information about; and then he could have left her alone at any point if he didn't like the direction things were going.

I mean, obviously, like he says in his conversation with the DM, Joon's companions were made specifically for Joon to enjoy being around---likely, for him to empathize with. It'd be hard to pass that up, but only in the sense that it'd hard to pass up your favourite flavor of ice-cream. If you think you'd be better off not eating any ice-cream, it being your favourite flavor isn't going to change anything.

Instead, Joon has decided he wants the ice-cream. He /wants/ these people around, and then he /wants/ to allow them to steer his life (probably in no small part because he's afraid that the alternative is him steering all of /their/ lives.) He always has the option to just... not hang out with these people.
