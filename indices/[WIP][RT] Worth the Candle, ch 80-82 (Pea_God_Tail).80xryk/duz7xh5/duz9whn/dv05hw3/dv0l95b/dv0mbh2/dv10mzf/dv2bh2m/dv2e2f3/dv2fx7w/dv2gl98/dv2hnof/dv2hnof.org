  He's the one who decided voting would be a thing they did, rather than just unilaterally making decisions by himself.

Well this goes into territory of me saying "he doesn't take responsibility for his action and makes it so he had no or only partial control over it". It happens a lot be it voting(i didn't want to but i guess i have to listen now", narrative\DM, this world is like this so i should act like this, etc.

The whole dump companions would be the stupidest thing to do. How exactly getting their trust\help is less efficient when going on his own, escpecially when he knew\knows almost nothing about the world.

  Joon would do: keep the teleport key to himself

Well, see he does need them, cause teleportation key would be very limited

  Either you go to a place that you've physically been before, or you follow the pull of a touchstone.

If he had power and resources the first thing he would have done is go for Arthur and abandon his companions to do as they please. Him following Abswifth to the white tower was not because he wanted to do it, he lacked power to do otherwise. Same here having companions is better than not having them, but Arthurs importance is pretty close to the top on his priority list.

You also pretty much said as much yourself.

  But, from my viewpoint, the "main arc" of the story hasn't begun yet, because that'll coincide with Joon actually having to let go of Arthur in order to save Aerb (in other words, explicitly choosing to grow rather than to be tied down to the past.) Everything happening right now---this is all a long demonstration of "pre-crisis" Joon.

  And, because the story is "about" this conflict, Aerb basically doesn't matter. Only the Earth framing-device storyline matters. Aerb matters to Joon, and will eventually (likely) be the cause of his character development, but nothing that happens there will change things for us, as readers.

Part of my point is Arthur being so important to the junipers story, no way he was 6th on the list of values the soul magic displayed.
