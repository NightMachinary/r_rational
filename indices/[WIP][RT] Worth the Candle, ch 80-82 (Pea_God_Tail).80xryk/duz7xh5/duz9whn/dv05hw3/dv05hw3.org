  Like, dude is generally trying to acquire power in order to become God and save Aerth from its myriad problems. Like, he wants to fix the 'problem' of theodicy, make 'everything perfect forever'.

Only motive he directly displayed with actions is Arthur. Other motivations are given by quests aka DM. Start was drifting with the flow and figuring out what is happening, that was good premise.

But after that he isn't actually doing any of that. As soon as Arthur was back and alive somewhere, it all shifted to focus on saving him. He was willing to pretty much let Locus die in a form, i don't know how to help so if it happens it's not my fault and others voted in him to save it. Maybe saving a living being, that was very important to your companion, who died helping Juniper and saved the life of Fenn should have been a good enough motivation.

With introduction of Narrative it felt like outside motives driving them and not really inner logic or motivation. Looking out for narrative threads was pretty heavy up to Chapter 79 and it seems to be back with the Chapter 82(Princess Boogaloo)
