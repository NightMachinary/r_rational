Juniper started as relatable, traumatized, but trying to do good guy. He had issues, but it seemed that he learned from them and was doing or aspiring to be better. It all started to go down for me after the narrative started to creep in, soul magic and Chapter 79 with DM was a culmination of his regression in my eyes.

His part is only numbers for the most part, he could have asked the DM for Loyalty to not affect them, but instead he opted for "Double Tiff, but no Harem tho". Can loyalty even regress, frankly it should have if he told them the DM exchange as it transpired. He says he cares, but his actions speak otherwise.

"You guys have free will, but I only say when you are around"

"I don't want a harem, but let me ogle Valencia in my room while we are alone for no reason. Why he decided that being alone with her was a good idea?

The problem with Narrative is - you don't need character motivation or logic. I thought DM encounter solved that, but it seems we are again on that track.

There are other"rant" of mine here, I just think this is a summarized version of my problems. So it can be kinda separate.

Edit: This was often compared to Mother of Learning. That series started with Zorian being distant, cold and not that caring for people or their struggle. As the time wen on he matured and even in the time loop physically and mentally reacted to negative things he had to do, even tho they shouldn't really have any effect on the "real world". Here Junipers thought more about "who is that Glenn in Fenns values" than he thought about killing people. Or he thought to himself that he should treat people of Aerb as real human, but even with Grak calling him out he replaced into only thinking about and not actually doing it.
