I don't get your problem sympathizing with with Juniper's motivations.

Like, dude is generally trying to acquire power in order to become God and save Aerth from its myriad problems. Like, he wants to fix the 'problem' of theodicy, make 'everything perfect forever'.

That may not be literally 'what anyone would do' if granted the ability to rapidly acquire infinite power, but it is certainly not a huge leap. Presumably if you were in Juniper's shoes you wouldn't just let Aerth lie fallow, but would be doing some variation on what he is up to, yeah? Leveling up and gaining power, in order to 'win' and fix everything.

As far as your harshness towards his imperfections go, I guess I can see that. I think you don't make enough allowances for the difficulties of his situation, but if you can only relate to Clark Kent then I imagine if you wait long enough someone will write a story about a character who never makes mistakes.
