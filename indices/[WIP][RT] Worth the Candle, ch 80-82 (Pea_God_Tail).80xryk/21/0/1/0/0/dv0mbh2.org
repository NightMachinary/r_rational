  The 'quests' don't actually assert any compulsive force. They don't make him do anything. He has chosen to do everything he's done so far.

We literally had chapter upon chapter of party wondering that if they don't do quests and idle for to long DM would punish them or drop something bad as the response to their negligence. They are wondering about the new princess in this current chapter, because "it might be a narrative thread". It's very much the compulsive force and the answer at the same time. Without those quests they could move at their leisure, be more aggressive or have a base of operations without fear of it being attacked because the narrative would demand it. Without the information in those quest descriptions Juniper would have been wandering aimlessly or actually had to learn about the world at large. It helps to keep the world disjointed and have blank spaces in it for future use. Quests pretty much set them on a path, they can approach them differently, but it's a path nonetheless.

  The most recent thing he did was strive to rescue the Locus.

No he didn't he voted against it. Valencias vote decided that they were going to save Locust right here and right now. He very much wanted to go and find the clues to save Arthur. Of course it not mind control, but his intentions were pretty clear, he even had a one on one talk with Valencia about "why you voted like you did". Locus conveniently didn't get a vote. He did all that was in his power to not save it at that moment and go for Arthur instead.

  “Kuum Doona,” I said.

  “Kuum Doona,” said Fenn.

  “I want to save the locus,” said Val.

  Fuck.

Yeah, he seems so eager to help the Locus.
