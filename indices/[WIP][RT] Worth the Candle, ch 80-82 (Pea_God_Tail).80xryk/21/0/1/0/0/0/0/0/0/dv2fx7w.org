How this in any way relates to him not wanting to save the locus now and to go after Arthur instead?

  he could have left her alone at any point if he didn't like the direction things were going.

You mean how he literally was struck with a cowardice affliction in the first chapter, because he left someone alone. How we had a whole chapter about "don't separate the party" and how Arthur had companions, so you will have them to to the exact number even. How only reason for him trusting Valencia was her appearing on the companions screen and same with Grak. He does like them as people, but it's unrelated to the whole "narrative" steering them in a direction.

Hell, saving locus is now conveniently tied to the "follow the Arthur" location, not the other one that they voted on and not some other place.
