Yeah, alienate my whole team or agree with them even i don't want to. So until his is willing to kill them or mind control everything he does is and agreement. Lacking powers or ways to do otherwise is not an agreement, that's not how it works. Wanting to do something else, but denied it by the group=he wanted to do it himself.

This is some strong denial of facts going on.
