  How exactly getting their trust\help is less efficient when going on his own, escpecially when he knew\knows almost nothing about the world.
#+end_quote

That's like saying that making friends is less efficient than just relying on your family for everything. The people pushed on you (whether by genetics, or a game layer, or whatever) aren't necessarily the best people for /you/. You can maybe find ones you'd rather be around---and, at the same time, ones who may be of more /help/, and who might also /ask/ less of you.

Keep in mind that, even very early on, Joon became insanely wealthy. He can afford to hire mercenaries, cultural guides, and whatever else he wants.

Consider the way a business operates. Businesses operate based on efficiency, and they do so by making money and then using it to pay people to get things done. Operating like a business would likely be more efficient for Joon than "going with the flow" of depending on the companions the game shoved on him. He knows how businesses work. He has chosen not to do this.

  If he had power and resources the first thing he would have done is go for Arthur and abandon his companions to do as they please.

I agree that Arthur is higher on Joon's values list than the story reported (maybe this is an intentional change? Maybe the game-layer is lying to him, to make him avoid considering tweaking the Arthur-value the way he has the levelling-up value?)

But I don't think /Joon/ really thinks that way, where he'd abandon his companions like that. Though, not, of course, because he's a good person :)

Joon, at this point, is sort of a... Shinji Ikari figure? He feels like he has an /obligation/ to solve all his companions' quest-lines. He feels like he has an /obligation/ to do the things required to raise his companions' loyalty, even if he doesn't /like/ them. (And /this/ is what's at the heart of Grak's annoyance with him.) He just feels like this whole thing with his companions is one big /duty/ that he has to discharge. He's going to do it, even if he hates it. Even though nobody ever asked him to do it if he hates it. (Just like how he was still running RPG sessions even though nobody asked him to!.) Of course, to be clear, the one making him do these things... is him. (And that's sort of the point I was making with the voting: he isn't really being bullied by his companions. He's bullying /himself/, using his own sense of obligation, into accepting their vote.)

If he suddenly munchkined his way into being the right level for the endgame Arthur-saving quest, he'd almost certainly drag his companions along. Not because they'd be useful... but because, at least at this point in his character development, he would think he had an /obligation/ to "carry" them through to the endgame with him. Even if they're a pure burden.
