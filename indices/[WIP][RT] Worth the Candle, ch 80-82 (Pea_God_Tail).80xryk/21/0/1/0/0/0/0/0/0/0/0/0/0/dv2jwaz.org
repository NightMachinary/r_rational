We are kinda agreeing on this, just maybe viewing it slightly different.

My points are:

1. He treats them like "loyalty" upgrades and not like people a lot. It happend before Graks call out, extreme was at Chapter 79(DM talk) and kinda happening again to a lesser degree.

2. He in fact can't abandon them and has to agree to some things even tho he doesn't want to, because they have skill and abilities he doesn't have himself or can't have. This was a sticking point in the Solace druid part. Bonus from the level 20 loyalty going both ways is a heavy intensive to be around them and is somewhat of a "game patch" to implementation "don't separate the party trope", cause they have literal stat bonus for being together.

3. He was very willing and going to pretty much abandon the locus(companion). He did most of what was in his power to do it and other methods were going into monster\unethical\manipulation territory.

  Keep in mind that, even very early on, Joon became insanely wealthy. He can afford to hire mercenaries, cultural guides, and whatever else he wants.

Could he? Morals aside the solution to his "Boneitis" problem was knowledge of one of the companions. He had 1\4 of the money. As others love to bring up he is just 17 and having people that he can trust after all he has been through is kinda important for him.

I'm not saying this is the only driving force behind his decision, but Arthur, "narrative" and loyalty heavily affect those. People around him are downplayed at times, because of his

  And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That's the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle
