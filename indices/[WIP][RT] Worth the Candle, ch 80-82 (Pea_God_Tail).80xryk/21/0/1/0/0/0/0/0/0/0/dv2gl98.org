  How this in any way relates to him not wanting to save the locus now and to go after Arthur instead?
#+end_quote

Because he signed up for being bullied into that. He could have /not/ signed up for that, by not associating with these people, or just, y'know, being mean. He has the power to get his way 100% of the time if he wants to. He's the one who decided voting would be a thing they did, rather than just unilaterally making decisions by himself. He decided that because he didn't want to make his companions' lives into a weird form of slavery, but again, it was a /decision/.

Yes, because he didn't act to save someone who he knew was going to die without his immediate help. That's an /entirely different thing/ from the act of dumping his companions off somewhere safe and then going questing on his own, or picking up mercenaries and going questing with /them/, or any number of other things.

The game-layer has very specific rules associated with its punishments. There is no rule about actually having your companions as... your companions. If you dump them off somewhere, they can probably even go and do something and die from it, and as long as Joon wasn't aware of that happening and with full ability to teleport in and fix the problem, there wouldn't be an affliction from it.

  How we had a whole chapter about "don't separate the party"
#+end_quote

It is a trope that separating /a party/ means ambush. A party being the set of people who are actively travelling around together, and separating being a temporary condition where they're each trying to achieve something but are temporarily vulnerable. It's an action by DMs that's supposed to make you /regret/ being stupid enough to think you could gain efficiency by separating the party. (And it punishes players for making the DM do more work keeping track of several concurrent things happening in several concurrent places; and, by proxy, for the fact that it also annoys the other players when your PC is getting the DM's focus and everyone else is sitting around waiting. Splitting the party is just bad RPG gameplay all-around, really.)

This trope would also apply equally to anyone else Joon was adventuring with---and thus in /a party/ with---even if they weren't Joon's game-layer companions, I'd expect. Or, really, anyone who Joon might like to perform distributed concurrent actions with to gain parallelism.

There's no related trope where the DM would be expected to kill off people Joon has explicitly /kicked out/ of the party.

  how Arthur had companions, so you will have them to to the exact number even
#+end_quote

Again, "companion" doesn't mean "in the party." Compare: having seven siblings. Doesn't mean you drag them around with you.

  How only reason for him trusting Valencia was her appearing on the companions screen and same with Grak.
#+end_quote

In a world where (so far as it seems) everyone is trying to kill you, someone being a companion is at least a filter telling you that they have the /potential/ to be someone who isn't trying to kill you. That's a helpful way to bubble people up as, at the very least, resources Joon could pretty quickly be able to lean on.

Consider what a sociopath!Joon would do: keep the teleport key to himself, and let each new companion live their life until he randomly pops in on them whenever he needs them for something.
