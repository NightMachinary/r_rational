While reading the "fighting a dragon" bit, I pictured Joon, on an airship, trying to dredge up an air-to-air missile from the backpack to chuck at the dragon. He would fail---then internally monologue to the DM that it was really no more OP than Fenn's multi-void-arrow thing, really just different flavor---and then try again and succeed.
