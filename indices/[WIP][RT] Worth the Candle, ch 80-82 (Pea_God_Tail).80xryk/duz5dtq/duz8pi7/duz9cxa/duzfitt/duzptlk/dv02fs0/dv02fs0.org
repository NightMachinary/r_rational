They are written on the fly and not properly organized. I tried to separate my points the best i could so it was easier to read. The problem is a lot of the complaints interconnect with one another and it's hard to lay them down in a specific order without going into the next topic. Quoting and lists are also kinda finicky on reddit and i had to edit the formatting, cause it was a mess of numbers at points.
