Basing the world and gameplay on D&D does set certain boundaries, but I don't see it in terms of strength/weakness. Good stories have boundaries; they need it to restrict the scope. Aerb has already been confirmed as some kind of simulation. If you live in the Matrix, how real do you want it to be (if a tree falls in a forest...)? Is it boring if you know that certain events are being orchestrated, nudged or deus ex-ed? When you compare a D&D world to a seamless fantasy reality, I imagine it's like comparing the value of a biographies of people who lived in one place their entire life to others who traveled the world. It will still come down to what you take away from the story.

I doubt Juniper will find a way to pry the world wide open, but victory by munchkining doesn't seem to be the intended conclusion of WtC (nor a satisfactory ending if it ends like Harry's triumph over Quirrelmort in HPMOR).

Regarding the personal values that bother you, here's the original quote. There's no reason to expect a perfect representation. In fact, Juniper actively distrusts its accuracy.

  Fallatehr had said that values were part of the soul, which meant that there was some way to view them, and maybe change them. I had to think that there would be something like a social network as well, some conceptualization of the internal models I had of various people, as well as physical models of various things, which would be how my brain knew that when a ball went up, it was going to come back down again.

  Mostly, I kept thinking that this wasn't how people were built.

  People were really freaking complex. They weren't a list of attributes, or neat piles of declarative and procedural memories, they were messy, complicated things that didn't always make sense, there were contextual shifts and a plethora of messy models and hidden assumptions, it wasn't just numbers. And as far as I could see, the soul as presented to me was missing half of the picture, which was the matter of how all these little bits and bobs actually did anything. So far as I had seen, the “soul” didn't have all that much in the way of process or algorithms or any kind of decision-making in it, only weights that could be applied to some decision tree or neural network or whatever else it was that took this static information and let it actually do anything.

  ...

  I kept thinking that this was not how humans were. Let's say that you actually could take someone through a trillion different tests, pairwise comparisons like “Would you rather eat a hamburger from Culver's or spend twenty minutes playing Tetris, a year from now?”, and then you crunched that enormous amount of information, the result that you got back wouldn't even be that sensible, because people weren't sensible, concepts were shifting and mercurial, I could think differently about a given person based on the last word out of their mouth, or the setting I was in, or any number of things. That was, to my understanding at least, how the human brain worked.

  The soul, as it was presented to me, made sense as the sort of thing you could maybe pull from a brain, if you had some hypertech and were willing to cut some corners in terms of how you were mapping out what the brain actually was. You couldn't capture everything, not really, but you might be able to put a number on time sensitivity of value, maybe, and then make a chart that would be a little bit useful. The soul made sense as a report, or a visualization. That wasn't what the soul purported to be though; it was meant to work as the mind, not just a report on it, and changing the soul meant changing the mind. Was there some hidden conversion process in there? Was this just a game interface covering something vastly more complex, for all the data that was exposed to me? Or was I really reducible down just this stuff and whatever sort of thing was involved in actually running it?
