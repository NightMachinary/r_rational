  The problem for me is, when you look at the whole picture, i see a pattern in his behavior and it's something that i highly dislike in real life humans.

Yes, but... characters in fiction having traits that would make them awful people to know in real life, can actually make them /more compelling/ fictional characters. And, like [[/u/eaglejarl]] says above, everyone here thinks that Joon's inconsistency is part of what /makes/ him compelling. His screwing up and backsliding and hypocrisy is, well, a messy, human character arc, of someone who is not a very good person attempting to be better---and then screwing up and backsliding and being hypocritical. As people do. As we tend to recognize in ourselves and our own attempts to be better.

I mean, to be clear, Joon isn't meant to serve as an /example/ of, well, anything much. This is a /rational/ story, not a /rationalist/, story, y'know? This isn't HPMoR; Joon isn't any kind of attempt at portraying a paragon of any-rationalist-skill-in-particular. Joon himself isn't rational at all; but nor is he marketed as being such. (As far as I can tell, the main way this story /is/ rational is actually just that the fantasy world of Aerb is, to quote Philip K. Dick, "A Universe That Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later." The setting here is quite thoroughly munchkin-proofed in rather novel ways for a high-magic fantasy setting, which makes it all the more tantalizing to wonder how exactly it'll end up being pried wide open. The setting itself is a puzzle-box, one made to be taken apart with one's mind, rather than one's hands.)

  Everyone that doesn't have "loyalty" is extra dead after meeting him or an enemy that he couldn't kill.

Ah, but now /that's/ a solid critique! This one is not Joon's fault, but the author's---in the story thus far, we've just had the "camera" pointed at very few characters who both aren't companions, and /also/ aren't out to kill Joon. I have a feeling that they're there---they have to be---they're just elided, and I think that's a mistake. Anyone in this story actively "making a friend" who /isn't/ a companion would be a great move for this story to take.
