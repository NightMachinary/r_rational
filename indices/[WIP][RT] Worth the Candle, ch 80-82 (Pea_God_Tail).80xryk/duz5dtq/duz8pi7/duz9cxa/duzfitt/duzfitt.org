Well I disagree with your points in general -- I think they're based on a weird conception of what fiction should be. But my complaint isn't about that; it's about the sarcastic tone and general meanness which I'm getting from what you've written. If you don't intend your posts that way, my apologies, but please be aware that they can be read as mean-spirited.
