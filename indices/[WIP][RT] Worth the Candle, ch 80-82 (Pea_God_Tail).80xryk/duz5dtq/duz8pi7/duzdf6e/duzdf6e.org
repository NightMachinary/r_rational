Clear communication powers, activate!

Speaking as an author who has received lots of negative feedback over the years, I find that it comes in two categories: "ur story sux! Juniper bad guy! I'm not reading anymore!!1!!"[1] and "I used to like this but it's gone off the rails for me because <reasons>" The former type is easy to ignore. The latter type is much more nuanced, and I divide it into "critique" and "criticism". Critique provides useful and thoughtful evaluation of the story and its failings in a way that is actionable for the author (e.g. "Jess doesn't ever have an emotional reaction", one that I got on the first couple chapters of Tinker's Daughter). Criticism is oriented around tearing the story/author down condescending, or simply offensive, or a whole spectrum of other BS.

Critique is gold; it's nice to get "Woohoo! This is awesome", but it's the constructively critical reviews that help you grow as a writer. They generally aren't /fun/ to read, but they are usually useful.

I think [[/u/Ace_Kuper]] 's posts fall into the "critique" bucket. He's put significant work into thinking through what it is that bothers him and he's conveyed it in a clear and (IMO) polite manner. There's no ad hominem[2] or offensive language, just a set of clearly-stated and actionable problems. You might disagree with him on whether these are problems or not, but I don't think he's just trying to tear down the story.

[1] <tangent class="pet_peeve"> I've never understood why people feel the need to tell me when they're going to stop reading, especially when they don't say anything else...I mean, unless I know them personally, am I really going to care? It seems awfully self-indulgent. </tangent>

[2] I've gotten every sort of personal criticism from "u sux as writer go die" to the far more insulting "Clearly, you aren't as talented or experienced as you think you are. I suggest taking some classes before you try to publish anything again." Ah, internet...how we love and hate you.
