A joke can be mean-spirited; that was how I read this one, and many of the other comments you've made which I assume are "jokes."

Look, I understand you're trying to figure out why you don't like some of the recent writing in this story. But you've written literally thousands of words, and you've conceded now that many of the points you made were weak, poorly-stated, or in error (in fact, I would argue that /all/ the points you made fall into one of these categories). You've also had other commenters tell you that what you've written comes off as mean or sarcastic, or not understandable.

I have two actionable suggestions for you. First, remember that this is a piece of writing that someone has spent hundreds of hours on, and is giving to you for free, and structure your response accordingly. Try to imagine yourself in the shoes of the hard-working writer who reads your sarcastic joke -- surely, even if all of your points were unarguably correct, that tone is inappropriate, right?

Second, if you're determined to write thousands of words of criticism, approach it like you would any other long-form writing project. Think about it for a few days before you start writing, so you know what point you're actually trying to make. Then pick your strongest claim (or at most your strongest two claims), and then pre-write, draft your post, and proofread it before posting. I think this would go a long way to address my concerns, and those of other commenters, though I can't speak for them.
