Most other responses were not really a joke , nor were they mean spirited. I admitted that my points about "princess rescue" were weak, even tho someone agreed with those specifically. Ones relating to the timeline were just questions, me feeling that it was to tightly packed and would bring future problems.

  You've also had other commenters tell you that what you've written comes off as mean or sarcastic, or not understandable.

But there are also people that didn't think that they were mean or ill spirited. In fact you are the only one that brought and still brings up "mean" or "ill intent". Others did bring up that my posts were poorly constructed or had a good amount of spelling\grammatical errors - i agree with that.

  First, remember that this is a piece of writing that someone has spent hundreds of hours on, and is giving to you for free, and structure your response accordingly. Try to imagine yourself in the shoes of the hard-working writer who reads your sarcastic joke -- surely, even if all of your points were unarguably correct, that tone is inappropriate, right?

This is one of the worst advice i have ever read. Not being an asshole part is fine, but being free or putting hours in doesn't make the work immune to criticism. In fact major success and fame doesn't too. Have you read\heard about Ready Player One? It's one of the best selling books, i'm sure author also spend time writing it, but it's one of the worst works in terms of writing,narrative structure and in terms of characters and it's world.

Second advice is pretty solid, but i had to get it off my chest for egoistical reasons. Thankfully i received a great amount of responses that disagreed and explained why, people that agreed with some points elaborating on the reasons for the partial agreement.

For the next time i already planned to focus on the stuff i liked and one thing that is not poor wring, but rather a fun observation or question of Joons judgment. In Chapter 81 he describes in detail an answer to one of the problems he previously had, but doesn't realize it. So most of the work was done for me.
