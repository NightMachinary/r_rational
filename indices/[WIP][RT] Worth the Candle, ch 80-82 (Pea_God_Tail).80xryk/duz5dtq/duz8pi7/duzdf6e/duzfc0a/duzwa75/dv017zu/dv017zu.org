... except sometimes you don't have a bug at all, you have user error, and you spend time trying to track down the bug and replicate only to find that you can't replicate, or the thing the person was talking about as a bug was actually intended behavior.

In terms of prose, I get the occasional spelling or grammar correction which is, in fact, wrong, which means that I spend time looking up the rule or googling the spelling for no practical reason. I would say that in these cases, having an incorrect error report is much worse than having no error report at all. (Signal to noise ratio is generally good though.)

In terms of /interpretation/ it's a little different, because I can't strictly say that someone's interpretation is /wrong/, and I do think that it's the author's job to create a text that gets interpreted how they wish it to ... but that doesn't mean that there can't be user error. I think that's especially the case when someone doesn't like something and is fumbling around in order to try to figure out why they didn't like it, and stumbles from complaint to complaint, none of which are really the problem that they've run into. All I get out of it is "I don't like this", which isn't anything that I find actionable.
