Yeah, rather than a bug report, this seems like someone complaining about /features/ (e.g. that the characters have complex inner lives and are imperfect, or the interesting meta-narrative aspects of the story), along with a lot of weirdly overstated nitpicks (e.g. the timeline, which seems totally reasonable to me).
