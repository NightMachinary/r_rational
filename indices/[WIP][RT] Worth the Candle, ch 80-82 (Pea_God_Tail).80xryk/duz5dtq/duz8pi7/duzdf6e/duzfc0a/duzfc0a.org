I absolutely agree with you that constructive criticism (what you call critique) is useful, when it's well-thought out. My most charitable reading of Ace_Kuper's posts, however, is that they're ill-thought-out and based on surface reading; I also think there's a fine line between what you call "criticism" and writing 1000s of words (in this thread and the last WtC thread) essentially repeating the same points over and over again.

Even if you agree with the points made by Ace_Kuper (which I suspect you don't, based on what you've written), I'm also kind of annoyed by the tone, e.g. the sarcastic "Great pattern of princess getting captured and being helpless."
