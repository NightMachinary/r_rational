Do they do it somewhere publicly visible? Because I've often found that the point of this is for them to use their little comment box below your story, or their retweet/reblog/etc., as a platform for them to convey their feelings not to /you/, but rather to the people who tend to read the things /they/ post on the Internet. (And I've basically never received such "news" as a direct private message. What would, indeed, be the point /then/?)

I'm surprised there isn't a name for this---it's the same reason that, say, random Tumblr posts can devolve into RP in their reblogs. People are trying to do a thing that /reacts/ to your post, or /uses/ your post, or is /inspired/ by your post, within their own closed community for their own friends/fans, but---due to the way the platform works---that thing then happens to be publicly visible to you, when that was never their intended effect.
