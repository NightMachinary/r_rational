I think that many of the points you make here have merit -- specifically, it's hard to reconcile Joon's actions with the values in his soul (unless there's another way to slice them or there's more to the story than just the ordered value list)

I especially disagree with your #6:

1. Princess needs rescue in town. ---> I suppose Joon helped, but she had void rifles and a soul cycle. She might have managed on her own.

2. Princess needs rescue from a literal castle, she would be captured if not for Juniper. ---> She had the key and was waiting for him. If not for Joon, she would have just ported out

3. Princess needs rescue from the tower, she is captured. ---> yup

4. Princess needs rescue by killing a unicorn. ---> I mean, she had a medical condition that made them need to kill a unicorn, but they also went through a ton of effort to revive Solace and fix Joons bones.

5. Princess is captured for a second(3rd) time, she frees herself, but it wouldn't work if Juniper didn't kill Fallatehr. ---> She actually took care of this one on her own rather handily. I think she was fine.

On the whole, I very much enjoy the story, and even though I disagree with many of your points, I appreciate that you made them in a constructive manner.
