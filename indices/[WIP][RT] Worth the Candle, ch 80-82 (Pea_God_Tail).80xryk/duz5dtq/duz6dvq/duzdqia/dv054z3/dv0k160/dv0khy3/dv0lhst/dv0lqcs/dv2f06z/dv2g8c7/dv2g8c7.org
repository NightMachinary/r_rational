My points are.

1. Is he intended to be an asshole to this degree.

2. Are lapses in his judgment intended to be like that, because of his previous history.

3. There some points i just found interesting and wondered if they are intended.

4. Logical deconstruction of decisions doesn't work if Juniper stops thinking every time it involves him directly.

5. I in fact think that moment to moment Juniepr works, but as a whole he is a mess. Same with the world it is disjointed on purpose, but it makes it feel less real as a result. "Narrative" suck the drive out of their decision and in fact they relied heavily on "is this narrative" to make their decision. The last chapter is them wondering "is this princess on a train a narrative".
