  I read this as Juniper speaking directly from the id -- he wants this, but he recognizes that he shouldn't want it
#+end_quote

I read at as the same thing, mu problem is almost all of the things he does fall into - "I don't like this, but i will do it anyway or i shouldn't do this, but i will."

That "Tiff moment" was just the last straw for me. Also, Soul magic having a clear number for "values" should not have really shown Arthur as 6th, he was willing to trade Tiff to make good for Arthur. Giving an underage girl to a 40 year old guys is not really a good thing.

1. When talking about Amaryliss or other girls he constantly brings up how they "were created for me" and it's mostly physical.

2. Why exactly he chose to take Valencia to his private room to be alone with her. There did this come from "My heart was hammering away in my chest, and I told myself that it was fear and anxiety talking." Like is he going to be like that with every girl.

3. You can have low empathy, but he still should take responsibility for his actions. It's not the DM creating a harem when Juniper himself falls for the looks of every party member.

4. Every time it's convenient for him it's either "they were created for me", but "no you are you and you have free will".

This is what defines his hypocrisy for me. He says that i should change, but doesn't and backpedals with his actions.

Unrelated to the Tiff, but related to the hypocrisy. "I couldn't feel any connection to the locus. I didn't understand the cultural significance of it". Well, maybe you should save it just on the basis that your party member just died helping you and she saved the life of a girl you liked. Or honoring someones memory only applies to Arthur and his D&D books that are treated with more reverence when a LIVING being. Like his admittance of "i was an asshole to people because of Arthur, i will try better" didn't solve anything, in fact i would say it became worse, cause now Arthur is Number 1 priority above living people that are near Juniper and their desires.
