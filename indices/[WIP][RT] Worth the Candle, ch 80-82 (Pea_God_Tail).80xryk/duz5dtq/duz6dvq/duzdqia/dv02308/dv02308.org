I've read all of his previous posts and agreed/upvoted some of them because there were legitimate concerns but now I feel the posts have degenerated into a not-entirely-coherent rant where he's really committed to his own tunnel-vision interpretation and railroading his reading and opinion as fact or ultimatums of how Joon-the-teenager should/shouldn't think. That's very different from saying "I think Joon is acting like a complete asshole and hypocrite at times because of examples X, Y and Z. It makes me really uncomfortable that Joon even thought about requesting Tiff like a commodity for both him and Arthur."

It's obvious that Ace_Kuper's a very invested reader, which is always valuable to a writer, but you can't blame people for downvoting a harangue.

[[/u/Ace_Kuper]] - I also think Joon is an asshole sometimes. Personally I hope he continues to show his shortcomings, as it makes him more interesting than if he were a paragon of justice or "being of pure, perfect empathy." People are complex and make mistakes.

I'm happy you mentioned the save-the-princess trope. I've been wondering whether Amaryllis is aware that she's routinely in some position of distress. She probably has one of the least complementary personalities to endure that and it seems to have had an effect on her confidence, so she probably isn't aware of the ever common damsel-in-distress plot. The anxiety will really start once Joon realizes this /and/ that his party is now filled with princesses.
