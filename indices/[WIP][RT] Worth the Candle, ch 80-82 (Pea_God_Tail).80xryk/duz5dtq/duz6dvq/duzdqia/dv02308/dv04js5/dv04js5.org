It is incoherent at times, that's why i'm thankful for people disagreeing with me, that way i can clarify or acknowledged their points. A lot of those complaints flow from one to another and listing them in a good order is kinda hard for me, but it's fully my fault for not being clear\coherent enough.

  I think Joon is acting like a complete asshole and hypocrite at times because of examples X, Y and Z. It makes me really uncomfortable that Joon even thought about requesting Tiff like a commodity for both him and Arthur.

If it didn't came out a such that's my fault, but this was explicitly my point. I feel like he acts as an asshole and should put his actions towards his words.

  I'm happy you mentioned the save-the-princess trope.

See, this is funny. Cause other people heavily disagreed that this is the case and even i admitted that this was one of the weakest points i made.

Some clarifications, i hope they are more coherent.
