My point was she would have spent at least 2 year with them. That's a lot of time to start liking someone, especially since she and Arthur "argued" from the start.

Wait. How "It almost seemed to be working" and "last text message from her (an unanswered â€˜how are you doing?') was months ago."

Doesn't this imply that they weren't interacting for months at the end, so how can his attempt at fixing the relationship "seem to be working"? Or is it "It almost seemed to be working, but didn't"? Or it was broken, but he tried to fix it later?

There was another question i had.

  the group had a Ship of Theseus thing going on where people came and went until Arthur and I were the only constants, and then eventually it was just me.

  The funny thing was, while Reimer and I never actually made up, we kept playing together, and in the end, just before I left Earth, he and Tom were the only ones still willing to play with me.

It kinda seems that Reimer and Tom were also those constants.

Also, thanks for reading my rants, i know they are somewhat incoherent in places. So i tried to clarify my points in the responses to people, maybe those responses articulate my gripes better.
