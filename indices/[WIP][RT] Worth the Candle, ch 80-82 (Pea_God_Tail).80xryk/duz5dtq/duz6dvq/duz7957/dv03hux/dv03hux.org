From my notes:

March 23rd, 2017: Juniper gets 'sent to' Aerb\\
June 21st, 2016: Arthur dies\\
June 10th, 2016: Arthur's accident\\
December 15th, 2015: Juniper and Tiff first kiss

2016-17: senior year\\
2015-16: junior year\\
2014-15: sophomore year\\
2013-14: freshman year

Tiff is explicitly mentioned as living out in the country, which would mean that she would both have the incentive to get her license early, and (probably) have a farm license, which a lot of the country kids do whether they're farm kids or not.

Regarding where any of this is mentioned, it's mentioned twice that Juniper is in his senior year of high school, it's mentioned that it's been nine months since Arthur's death four times (ch 20, 34, 58, 79), and in chapter 42 it's mentioned that Tiff and Juniper dated for five months.

I don't particularly feel that this timeline is actually important, and don't want to restate it whenever there's a new flashback, especially since a lot of it is just implicit in the text. If you can point me to where there are concrete continuity issues, I'll do my best to fix them.
