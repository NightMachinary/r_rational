  It wasn't true that he encountered her at the time"she had moved to town around the middle of high school". It wasn't true because "She'd grown up in Bumblefuck, Kansasshe". My question is did he meat her at the middle of high school or couple of moths after the freshman year, cause those are different.

Okay, maybe you're not American and therefore have different definitions of 'high school'? In the US high school is 4 years and freshman year is your first. "The middle of high school" would be your sophomore year, so "a few months after freshman year" is approximately right. Also, he's not giving a friggin' measurement, he's talking casually. If it's at 33% or 40% instead of exactly at 50% that's hardly something surprising.

Seriously, this is a nitpick, let it go. You have other points that are valid, but this ain't one.
