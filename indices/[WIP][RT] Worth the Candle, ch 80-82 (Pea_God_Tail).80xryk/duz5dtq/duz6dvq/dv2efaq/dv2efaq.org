I'm not sure if it would help your enjoyment any, but when I read this story, I'm mostly thinking of it as this:

#+begin_quote
  Juniper is obsessed with Arthur and he would trade anyone who is not Arhur for Arthur. He never learned his lesson of not being shitty to others and is ready to tready anybody for his Athur time. He holds the D&D books that Arthur had to a higher value than the "Deer" that is a living being, that was VERY important to Solace\friend that die helping you and saved the girl you "love".

...being the /conflict/ of the story. This is Joon's /character flaw/, introduced in the very first chapter. It's the thing he can't let go of; the thing he needs to get over. Aerb is here as a trial, a spirit-quest for him to go through that will lead to him figuring out how to let go of Arthur and grow as a person from there.†

And he /has/ started to do this, in a few small ways. For example, his relationship with Fenn is a lot healthier than how he was treating Tiff only a few months earlier.

But, from my viewpoint, the "main arc" of the story hasn't begun yet, because that'll coincide with Joon actually having to let go of Arthur in order to save Aerb (in other words, explicitly choosing to grow rather than to be tied down to the past.) Everything happening right now---this is all a long demonstration of "pre-crisis" Joon.

And yes, right now, Joon is an asshole. But I think it's promising that even Joon can see that he's an asshole. He hates himself, and is self-destructive (those two things coming together in him killing a version of himself in Ch. 79)---but I think he feels those impulses now more out of a revulsion for the way he was behaving before, on Earth, after Arthur's death. He knows, at least, that he /doesn't/ want to be the person he was at that point. He just hasn't resolved who he /does/ want to be yet.

--------------

† And, because the story is "about" this conflict, Aerb basically /doesn't matter/. Only the Earth framing-device storyline matters. Aerb matters /to Joon/, and will eventually (likely) be the cause of his character development, but nothing that happens there will change things /for us/, as readers. This story is no more about Aerb---or Joon's companions on Aerb---than it would be if Aerb was another of the regular RPG sessions that Joon was playing. This story is, essentially, a one-man fever-dream stage-play. This is /A Christmas Carol/ for gamers.
