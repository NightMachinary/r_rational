I almost fully agree with you and it's my view exactly.

1. My problem is he started on this "let go quest" at chapter one, but relapsed heavily at the point narrative and Arthur quest became a thing.

2. It doesn't excuse him being an asshole to his current "friends?" and no amount of him thinking "i lashed out in real world, i should not do it again" would convince me he isn't doing the same thing again.

3. People are heavily disagreeing that he can't let go of Arthur and is in a self\others destructing rush to get to him.

  This story is no more about Aerb---or Joon's companions on Aerb---than it would be if Aerb was another of the regular RPG sessions that Joon was playing.

This is the blessing and a curse, cause it makes the world aka Aerb that much disjointed and not real. The strength of this story is in the separated moment to moment happenings, but it breaks the connections between them. The journey is often more important when the ending, but if this whole journey doesn't matter it doesn't work. He should grow as the result of the journey, not because he needs to grow. He needs to let go , because he comes to some sort of understanding, not because it makes this story pointless otherwise.

P.S. You are the same guy talking to me. Boy is this super disorganized now and hard to follow for anyone else.
