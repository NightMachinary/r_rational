So lat time i went on a pretty long "rant". I slept on it and thought that i was to harsh on Juniper and i should cut hims some slack.

Cause his actions are good and he helped all those ... Huh

He did that good deed...

Well, it can't be at least his party members helped...

So i discovered why i disliked the direction the story was taking, why i felt Junipers character was regressing, why meta"narrative" layer and soul magic were bothering me and a ton of other problems. All courtesy off me trying to find the good thing Juniper and his party did.

So what exactly his motivation are in general, what moves him forward, what was his life goal? What is the goal of all of his comrades? What was motivation of his Earth friends?

The overarching problem with the story is "telling and not showing". I reread previous chapter and Juniper is highly egoistic, hypocritical, asshole (the nicest word for him i can muster), he says something, but he acts completely different.

The only two people that acted like they care for somebody else and really mean it so far are Tiff and Solace.

So this are the problems that exist both in world and in writing that culminated in Chapter 79 (meeting the DM) and they are not that easily fixed if they are fixable.

1) DM is a Deus Ex MAchina that motivates the living Deus Ex Machina of Juniper to function on Aerb. Without them the whole world doesn't exist. What i mean is Juniper is conveniently motivated by outside force that only exist to give him motivation. If Arthur was not existent here he would do nothing, if he could get Arthur right this instant other things would cease to exist.

2) Juniper is obsessed with Arthur and he would trade anyone who is not Arhur for Arthur. He never learned his lesson of not being shitty to others and is ready to tready anybody for his Athur time. He holds the D&D books that Arthur had to a higher value than the "Deer" that is a living being, that was VERY important to Solace\friend that die helping you and saved the girl you "love".

3) Souls stats are a problem, cause they put an anchor on the logic of the world that is too easy to check and it created problems when it clearly doesn't make sense. So Fallatehr can change values so that others follow him, it assumes he is at the top of that value list, right?

Yeah, when at the top of Junipers it's

1. Making excuses for himself

2. Arthur (More than Fenn and Tiff combined)

Power gap

3.Level up

This is not the 6th place

    And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That's the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle.

4) Juniper double questioning and saying"I felt bad", but still doing it doesn't mean anything at this point. Actions speak more than words.

5) All the philosophy, morality and psychology discussion in the world mean nothing when characters don't follow them with their actions. Frankly it portraits his whole friend group as a collection of shallow hypocrites. More so it does to Juniper,Arthur and Tiff. I was confused why they are having this discussion, but are not adapted to real world. I confused his age all this time, i thought he was in college, yeah, age of 17 only brings more problems from the time\story stand point.

6) Bringing points or discussion to the story makes people think about them, it kinda makes them relevant. So we had that segment about feminism so. Now we a have a literal princess in the need of a rescue at the start, which would be fine only.

1. Princess needs rescue in town.

2. Princess needs rescue from a literal castle, she would be captured if not for Juniper.

3. Princess needs rescue from the tower, she is captured.

4. Princess needs rescue by killing a unicorn.

5. Princess is captured for a second(3rd) time, she frees herself, but it wouldn't work if Juniper didn't kill Fallatehr.

Great pattern of princess getting captured and being helpless.

6) This next one requires it's own separate entry, cause even tho it is similar to other ones and is mostly "actions speak more than words", boy is it BAD.
