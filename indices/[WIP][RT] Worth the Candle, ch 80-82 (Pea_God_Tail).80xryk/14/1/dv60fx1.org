  Seems odd that a line which prides itself on not drifting would force its heir into a Kiss with someone else... wonder if that's part of the reason Grak left?

My interpretation was that it was some sort of political marriage, maybe with another kingdom. So that realpolitik angle took precedence.

Also, there doesn't seem to be any reason that they have to have only one selfinsemination child each generation, so there could be multiple prospective heirs that are Grak's siblings.
