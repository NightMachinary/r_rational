  Next, I'm wondering why the two unknown companion connection lines disappeared when Joon came back from the DM discussion
#+end_quote

Possibly it was the DM removing some rails: initially, all companions were set in stone, and them joining Juniper was just a matter of time; afterwards, the DM removed connections to them, and decided to give Juniper more freedom as per his comments about narrative. It could mean that Juniper's group now has a pool of potential companions to choose from instead of preset two, or that they're free to dodge new companions.

Alternatively, the DM just decided that letting Juniper see his future companions is too easy, and made the lines invisible.

Alternatively, it was one of the "choices" the DM is apparently so fond of: he wanted to see whether Juniper would want to see his future companions or follow the suspicious black line; if he chose one, the other would disappear.
