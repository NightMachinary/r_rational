  Odds on Frog Princess joining the party?
#+end_quote

I'm betting that, given the perverse interpretation of "princess" that the DM has seemingly used to select Joon's companions so far, /someone/ from the frog princess's retinue will likely be joining, but that someone won't be the same someone considered by said retinue to be their princess.

Given the fact that the only reason to point out and explain a pattern in a narrative is to build the audience's expectations so you can then subvert them, the next princess will probably be one who's considered a princess by /someone else's/ culture's rules, rather than by their own culture's rules.
