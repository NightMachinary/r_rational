It's literally just raw honey and raw garlic. They ferment each other; the honey gets watery and infused with garlic flavor, while the garlic loses most of its moisture and becomes sweet (almost candied). Then add some vinegar if you have to in order to lower the pH, which should be below 4.5 (I try to use as little vinegar as possible, because I don't think it tends to do good things for the taste). After that, you just wait a month with it out of the light and at room temperature and burp it occasionally to let out the gasses. There should be enough honey to cover the garlic and then some.

I use it as a sweetener in anything savory; lately it's been part of kimchi stew (kimchi, rice vinegar, sesame oil, fish sauce, honey-garlic, broth, and some seared pork belly or a soft-boiled egg).
