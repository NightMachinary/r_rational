  How exactly the "real world goods" back pack functions?

Probably the same way time-travel in HPMoR does: you ask God (i.e. the DM) for something, and he decides whether you can have it. It's a literal Deus Ex Machina... but that's only a /bad/ thing in stories when that fact is to the character's /advantage/. Nobody tends to have any problems with a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina][Diabolus Ex Machina]].

  it is proofed by a Deus Ex Machina not internal logic

I mean, in some ways, yeah. But the whole concept of exclusion zones, and the way the teleport keys work, and the limits on bone/blood/etc. magic, are all crafted in such a way that it's clear that these are each---at least /individually/---actual /battle-tested/ systems that the author used in real games as a DM, putting them up against real munchkin players who broke them and re-broke them across a number of sessions, with their associated rules evolving to make gaining "free energy" from them impossible. It makes you expect that everything that /hasn't/ yet been explored to the same level of detail, will end up being just as (individually) robust.

I agree that Aerb itself is a weak amalgam of those ideas. The exclusion zones---and the DM's likely ability to introduce new ones instantaneously---are probably the likely glue preventing Aerb from falling apart at a moment's notice.

I would mind this in any other universe, but this universe is, under one interpretation, a pen-and-paper RPG session (there are even dice-rolls that can be rerolled... somehow) and RPG sessions have DMs, who do make calls on house-rules to resolve disputes and prevent /unexpected/ avenues of munchkinry that breaks the game (as in, ruins the players' further enjoyment; not as in, breaks the world economy or anything.)
