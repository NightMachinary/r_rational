That's completely unrelated to disliking Joon's character choices. I like how the story exploits the looming Deus Ex Machina, except they take shape in "nudges" (however the DM defines those). Matter of taste, I suppose.

Soul magic was like a black box before the rules were revealed by game layer proficiency. As others have also pointed out, there were weights to whatever he chose. Blackmailing Joon from a remote location has a limited set of outcomes (which would have inevitably failed and set to to square one face-to-face). In hindsight, my opinion is that his smartest move was to work with Juniper in good faith. He hedged his bets on a reasonable assumption given his character values and it failed.
