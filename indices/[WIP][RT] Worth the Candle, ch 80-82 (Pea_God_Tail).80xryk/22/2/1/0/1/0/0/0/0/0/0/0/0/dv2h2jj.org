The last one was a long standing critique that i had and people tend to agree with that one more.

Like Solace was exactly that and she died. My problem of hypocrisy solidified itself as the result of it. Wanting to go after Arthur pronto instead of wanting to save an active companion(Locus), that also was very important to said friend, friend that died helping you and kinda used powers of the locus to save your loved one.

I answered about Juniper and his traits in another response to you, so i want say the same thing here, by the time i was done with that one you already responded here :)

  The setting here is quite thoroughly munchkin-proofed in rather novel ways for a high-magic fantasy setting, which makes it all the more tantalizing to wonder how exactly it'll end up being pried wide open.

Yeah, the problem is it's really not and it is proofed by a Deus Ex Machina not internal logic. In fact this world would not really function at all cause it's an amalgam of so much variety. (I also touched on this in the another response to you)

Here is a fun question that popped into my head. How exactly the "real world goods" back pack functions? Cause depending on it's ability in conjunction with "clonal kit" it breaks everything.
