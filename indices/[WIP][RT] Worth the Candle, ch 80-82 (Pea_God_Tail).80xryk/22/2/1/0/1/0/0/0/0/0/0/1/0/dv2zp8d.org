  I don't actually think you're looking at the whole picture, but rather nitpicking on any slip-ups Joon has or you think he had.
#+end_quote

Those were not slip ups, they are pretty constant. I know that progress is not linear, but all the "progress" he had before Aerb was pretty much reset to 0 at the news of Arthur being alive and narrative introduction, this is not a solid statement, but rather a reference to the time frame.

Check my responses to \derefr. I think, i already explained myself better in them.

  he doesn't owe you or anyone else a self-actualized identity. It's fine that his thoughts and actions make you feel that way. But how we think and act is not how others think and act.
#+end_quote

Well, yeah. I was commenting on how it seems. I just personally dislike people that say they are trying, but they don't act on those promises. Most of the time they don't change. Is the part i quoted deliberately similar to the speech Juniper received from Grak?
