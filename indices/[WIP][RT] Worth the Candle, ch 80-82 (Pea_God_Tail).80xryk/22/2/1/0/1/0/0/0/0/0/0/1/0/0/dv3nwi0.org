Constant? Given your effort in trying to prove Joon an asshole, you should do a text analysis to record these occurrences, like behavioral data. Take all the instances where Joon has positive/negative interactions with his companions. Find a frequency/rate/celeration of when he is shitty/nice to others, when he makes resolutions, when he keeps them or fails, when he makes excuses for it, when he "feels bad", etc. It will help because you provide few examples and make arguments based on a few isolated situations that you /feel/ strongly about.

  Well, yeah. I was commenting on how it seems. I just personally dislike people that say they are trying, but they don't act on those promises. Most of the time they don't change.

You're also saying you dislike the direction the story is going in, which is implying the story would be better if Joon acted in accordance with your expectations.
