  If you don't focus on all his perceived flaws, Juniper has been a rather upright and empathetic guy overall.

Well, yeah if you ignore all his flaws he is a great guy, if you ignore all of his good qualities he is a monster.

I think at the start of the story and before the "narrative" structure was present he was making progress towards being better.

In fact, this story is at it strongest when you view every chapter or interaction separately, when Joon is having a discussion with someone that dialog is mostly great and he is super reasonable.

The problem for me is, when you look at the whole picture, i see a pattern in his behavior and it's something that i highly dislike in real life humans. Joon thinks something like "i should be more empathetic", he doesn't act more empathetic, thinks "they are real people" acts "time to grind loyalty". Everyone that doesn't have "loyalty" is extra dead after meeting him or an enemy that he couldn't kill.

This is how his thoughts\actions feel like to me.

Joon - "I don't want to kick you".

"Joon kicked you." Well, he is a nice guy he thought about not doing it, he had to tho, he is trying at least.

"Joon you probably should stop kicking people" - Grak. Oh he got called out, that changes everything.

"Jonn contemplates about kicking you" - he kicks or maybe future holds something different and he punches.

This is exactly before the Chapter 79 with DM.

  I need to just ... listen more, I guess, and focus less on the end goals, at least when it comes to our kharass.‚Äù

I feel like him saying he would try and trying are actually different thins. I doubt he wouldn't ever change, but he kinda reset all of the progress he had before coming to Aerb and all that he supposedly learned after lashing out on people in real world.
