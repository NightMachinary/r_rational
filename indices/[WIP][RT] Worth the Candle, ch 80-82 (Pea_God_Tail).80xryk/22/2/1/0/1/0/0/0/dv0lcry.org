Yeah, see, here's where your take differs from mine and from (as far as I've seen) literally everyone else's in this thread: you find it upsetting that Juniper's goals, desires, and actions are not perfectly congruent and consistent at all times. Everyone else finds it very relatable and an example of excellent characterization.

I generally try not to resort to arguments from authority or consensus, but in this case I'm going to: It's possible that you are the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan][OnlySaneMan]], that Juniper's characterization is bad, and that the rest of us are all wrong. On the other hand, the fact that literally everyone else seems to be disagreeing with you might be a good signal that you should go back and reexamine your beliefs. If you do, and you still find yourself thinking that Juniper is poorly written, fine. If not, it might help you enjoy the book more.
