  Well, yeah if you ignore all his flaws he is a great guy, if you ignore all of his good qualities he is a monster.

I'm saying it's pointless and irrational to think of people in black and white like that. You keep emphasizing whatever flaws you think he has to show that he's a monster or terrible person. Maybe you also have an expectation that characters always have to progress for the better, which is untrue in a rational world.

I don't actually think you're looking at the whole picture, but rather nitpicking on any slip-ups Joon has or you think he had. I see him as honestly attempting to be more empathetic and trying to treat the others as real people (also, you seem to be forgetting that he literally /sees numbers in his head/ representing loyalty - no matter how good your intentions, this tampers with a person's sense of reality, and it can lead to all kinds of psychological effects - e.g. you reciprocate for another's loyalty, if you are a min-maxing gamer and have quantifiable feedback, you'll have this urge to max things). Also, people make resolutions but that rarely means instant self-improvement; your interpretations of his behavior are short-sighted in many ways. He's merely been in Aerb for a month or two? He's a teenager who barely came out of a traumatic episode only to be thrown into an even more stressful world: he doesn't owe you or anyone else a self-actualized identity. It's fine that his thoughts and actions make you feel that way. But how we think and act is not how others think and act. Progress is not linear.
