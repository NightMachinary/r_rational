No, i dislike heavy reliance on "narrative" as a story motivator, i dislike DM as a Deus Ex Machina that looms over the party and i somewhat disliked soul magic related chapters.

Soul magic was scheming in the dark without set of rules and only way it was resolved is because author said so. Soul magic was too powerful, but needed to be limited so the story could exist. Fallather needed to be super smart and scheming, but he had to go down by not being smart. As others pointed out in the related threads, he could have taken the teleportation stone and go to another part of the Aerb, there Juniper could not touch him, with Grak and Amaryllis as hostages. Then interact with Juniper via 3rd party or some remote method. He schemed how to escape or beat the prison for decades, but he was so impatient and arrogant towards Juniper that he needed to be present personally to interact with him, when in reality he had the upper hand if he didn't.
