Just to be clear, I called him an asshole sometimes, but I don't agree with any of your points. I'm thinking of his behavior after Arthur died (which is an understandable coping method) and his attitude toward the game and Aerb which Grak called him out on (also extenuated by his circumstance - if people were given divine messages and power, it's likely most would be spoiled into an instant gratification expectations). He's also said insensitive things, like the Tiff demand that you keep harping on about, but people do that all the time, especially in the heat of the moment.

I think you have certain idealistic and/or moralistic expectations towards Juniper's character that haven't been met. If you don't focus on all his perceived flaws, Juniper has been a rather upright and empathetic guy overall.
