  don't have consistent morals nor clearly defined motive outside certain kinds of fiction

I would assume in any type of fiction written or otherwise people have morals, goals or character traits. In fact best work i would say makes the characters feel alive and human. Archetypes exists for a reason ,cause people use them. Characters don't need to be good or evil to the bone, but their internal motivation or logic is often present.

I would dare to say that if characters are flip flopping between morals and change their motivation constantly it makes the story worse and certainly not a rational one. Character can be unstable and troubled, but if he changes what he does constantly people should point that out. Especially if the story is about a guy who analyzes things, thinks about actions and their consequence and tries to be better. All of his moral pondering are useless if he doesn't act on them.
