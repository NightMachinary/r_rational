As i said being a story of D&D session is it's strength and it's weakest point.

  the limits on bone/blood/etc. magic, are all crafted in such a way that it's clear that these are each---at least individually---actual battle-tested systems that the author used in real games as a DM, putting them up against real munchkin players who broke them and re-broke them across a number of sessions, with their associated rules evolving to make gaining "free energy" from them impossible. It makes you expect that everything that hasn't yet been explored to the same level of detail, will end up being just as (individually) robust.

I actually expect the opposite, because any living human can't have enough time and ability to test all of that. In fact the only reason Juniper is not breaking anything apart is because Author is going "no no no, narrative excluded that". How would your self insert win a battle against yourself controlling the narrative. I'm pretty much sure that the point of readers seeing something extremely busted comes along:

1. Author is to deep in descriptions to fix it

2. Exclusion or "narrative" justification comes along to say it doesn't work.

I'm pretty on the fence already about the legitimacy of "personal values" that soul magic displayed. Considering Arthur and desire to save him being so important to Joon. In no way was Arthur was 6th on that list. Also, i guess soul magic gives some resistance to soul magic, or Juniper is just that special that he can downgrade his number 1 value. Considering the whole problem with Fallatehrwas that he controlled people by being at the top of their lists and they couldn't break from it themselves. Yet Juniepr just willed himself to reduce his own number 1 value.

This are not broken things, but i can see the cracks forming.

Don't get me started on Anyblade. IT's God Tier and i'm saving it for the next chapter. Cause boy is it ironic in some way.

  I turned my back and kept my attention on the Anyblade, testing the limits of its abilities. It could only do blades, but it was pretty permissive when it came to what a blade was, and I could work whatever I wanted into the ornamental features of the sword, axe, or other bladed weapon I formed it into.
