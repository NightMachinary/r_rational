No, you're saying he shouldn't treat it as a simulation but as reality. I phrased that line poorly - I meant there's no distinction between treating it either way. With the evidence he's given, it's equally viable to treat it as simulation or reality (and doubt your choice).

Your other points in that post are either your opinion or they outright contradict each other. How do you accept powers-that-be nudging your and others' free will, and also just accept people as real and never wonder? People today are still pondering the meaning of existence or struggling with the idea of free will vs determinism. It hasn't lost meaning or tension after millennia.
