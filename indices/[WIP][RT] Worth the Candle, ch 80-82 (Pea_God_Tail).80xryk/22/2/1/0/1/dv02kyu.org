  I think they're based on a weird conception of what fiction should be.

Some of the problems are have are not about what fiction should be, but

1. Lack of internal character motivation.

2. Morality of the characters and especially Juniper wildly changing to fit the situation.

3. Sometimes the story contradicts it's own set of rules. Aka hard "values" with soul magic or Joon claiming one thing, but then saying something different about it later. It's not a change of mind, because it sometime was about the past Earth events and his recollection was contradicting itself.
