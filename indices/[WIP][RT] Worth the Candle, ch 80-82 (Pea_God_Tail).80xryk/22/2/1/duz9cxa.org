Because i liked it and there are still great elements in it, but it took a turn for the worse starting with the introduction of the "narrative" and being the lowest at Chapter 79.

Like recent chapters are fine, but this things are kinda a problem for me. I also would expect to dispute my points or show evidence of me misunderstanding things.

Like i think people, especially at rational fiction, should describe and talk about why the liked\disliked the thing.
