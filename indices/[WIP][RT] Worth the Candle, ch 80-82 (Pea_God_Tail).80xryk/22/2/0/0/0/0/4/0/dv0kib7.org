Yeah, the "give me Tiff" thing was weird and out of the blue. I kinda understand it (cf prior comments about "speaking from the id" and "knows this isn't really plausible or right") but it was still strange. I'll give you that one.

As to the other two...what? I don't really see where you're coming out with point #1. Joon is a teenager trapped in a difficult situation. He doesn't have a lot of romantic experience, or even general people experience, and he's doing the best he can. Like everyone he isn't a perfect example of self-consistency and rationality, but he's trying. He feels very human to me.

Point #2: I am /really/ lost on this one. Arthur is very much a background desire here -- an overarching, plot-driving one, sure. But he very clearly prioritizes those around him above pursuing Arthur at any expense. If finding Arthur was his top priority then soul magic gives him lots of unsavory opportunities that would be much more efficient than the way he's doing it -- walk up to any mage / noble / sage / whatever and mindrape them into being his devoted servant so they will tell him everything he needs to know and give him whatever resources he needs. Joon is not doing that, so Arthur is very obviously not "above all" at this point.
