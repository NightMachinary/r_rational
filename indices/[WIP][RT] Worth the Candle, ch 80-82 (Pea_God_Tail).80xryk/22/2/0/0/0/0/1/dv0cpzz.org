  In terms of interpretation it's a little different, because I can't strictly say that someone's interpretation is wrong, and I do think that it's the author's job to create a text that gets interpreted how they wish it to

So the fun thing about writing a serial story, and Wildbow has been playing with this in Ward, is that the author is /not/ in fact dead. The text is a work in progress, and if there are reader interpretations in the fan community that run counter to your view of the story, you can have the text contradict that interpretation in a future update.
