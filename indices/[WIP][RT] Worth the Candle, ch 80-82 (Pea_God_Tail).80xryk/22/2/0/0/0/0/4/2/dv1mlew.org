I don't think the point was to actually get clones of Tiff. He was just venting his god-problems to an actual god, but there was no way he thought there was a chance he would get it. I think the whole point was to whine about the unfairness of the system, and now there was actually an omnipotent being that listened.

I'm very sure that if he thought he was gonna get whatever he asked for, he would have been waaay more careful about his words.
