I was trying to find out why i started to dislike it. The minute to minute story or set pieces are great. Character dialog between people feels real and is a fun read. I think the problems i list pile up when you have a multiple levels to consider and there are some continuity errors.

My main gripe would be.

1. Juniper says something, but acts completely different in the next scene.

2. Arthur is clearly above all at this point.

3. That whole "give me Tiff" raised a lot of problems. Like contradicting himself "i want that girl", but no "harem" well a second love interest is clearly going on that route not even counting the moral problems it brings.

In no way my points are universal truth or the full picture. They are just how i saw the story as a whole over time.
