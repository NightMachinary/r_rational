Cares about Arthur or cares about looking for Arthur? Everyone he knew is gone. Possibly he imagined all of them. Possibly not having an excuse to do something urgent means having to fix every single problem in the world which only exist to give him quest hooks. Possibly it means spending the rest of his life wondering if the people around him are just articulate NPCs.

Honestly I think he'd spend as much effort on Reimer.
