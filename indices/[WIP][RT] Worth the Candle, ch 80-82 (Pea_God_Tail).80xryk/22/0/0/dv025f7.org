You are correct on this one and this was one of the weakest ones. But it was more about the pattern for a princess to get into trouble in a somewhat cliche manner. Bandits after her>castle rescue>tower locked>unicorn>controlled against her will.

1. Is fine on it's own.

2. She is dead cause at this point she has Ratrot and only Juniper knows it or that they would need a unicorn to heal it.

3. It lingers from the second point. At this rate she is not surviving without Junipers knowledge or power.

4. It was more about her getting captured for the 2nd time. She did save herself, but if it wasn't for the convenience of (Soul link that juniper has) she Fallatehr would not let her go from literal mind control.
