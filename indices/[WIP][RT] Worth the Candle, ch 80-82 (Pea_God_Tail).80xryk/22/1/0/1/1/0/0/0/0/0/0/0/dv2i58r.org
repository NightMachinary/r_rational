Pretty much Mother Of Learning. If the simulation is so close to reality why does it matter that it's a simulation? The protagonist also has realistic reaction and aversion to committing atrocities even tho it's a simulation and ultimately doesn't matter. He also starts as the unsocial, cold guy who doesn't really care about other people, but he grows other time.

My problem is the whole existence of the simulation layer and i hope that Chapter 79 was an end to it being in focus. "Soul magic" chapters especially were too close to infinite loop of wondering if it's real or not, are we under control or what. At that point it becomes either a philosophical debate or looses all tension cause it doesn't matter.

Just accepting that there are powers beyond your control trying to nudge you in directions is fine, accept people as real and move on. It looses all meaning when he wonders for the 20th time if they Aerb people are real or not.

Here is one of the things that becomes problematic because of the "narrative" layer. Why exactly he is so reluctant to believe that DM is not trying to fail him, yet he believes and follows the descriptions of quests, they are written by the same DM.

Like Jooniper himself said "Even if it all happened like you said, even if I was in a paradise of my own choosing, I would have to worry about whether you were going to show up again." This creates to much problems especially when there are multiple levels of meta narrative going on.
