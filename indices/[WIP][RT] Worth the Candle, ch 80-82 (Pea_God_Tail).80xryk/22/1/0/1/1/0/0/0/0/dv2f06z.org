I think there might be a miscommunication here on a deeper level.

Are you aware that, generally, the people here are trying to interpret your posts as /constructive criticism of the story itself/? That's what the parent poster means by "useful feedback"---they're expecting the "point" of your message to be something regarding things you'd like the author to /change/ in order to write a story that more suits your tastes.

Because, if your point is literally "this is a good story about an asshole," well, I mean, there are plenty of stories like that. /Hamlet/ is a good story about an asshole. But people don't generally spend thousands of words trying to point out to others that the character of Hamlet is an asshole. Everyone /knows/ that Hamlet is an asshole. That's rather the point of the play, and is, in fact, part of /why/ the play is good.

Personally, I think that Joon being an asshole is part of why WtC is good, for similar reasons. It's exploring the /consequences/ of Joon being an asshole. It's not a power fantasy where he'll be able to /get away with/ being an asshole, over the long term. It'll either be a tragedy, or a bildungsoman, and---given that it's semi-autobiographical on the part of the author---I'm guessing it'll be more of the latter.
