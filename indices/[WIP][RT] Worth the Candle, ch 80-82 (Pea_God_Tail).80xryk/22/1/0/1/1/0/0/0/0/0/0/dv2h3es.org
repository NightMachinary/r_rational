  "Narrative" suck the drive out of their decision and in fact they relied heavily on "is this narrative" to make their decision.

I'm curious---how would /you/ write a rational story exploring the consequences of being someone living in a simulation where there really is such a thing as a narrative? Wouldn't you do the same? Is it not rational to pay attention to it, if it is there?

Or is it the conceit itself that's bad, in your opinion? Because I personally find the conceit enjoyable: it's rather novel speculative fiction exploring the /social/ ramifications of a change in the world we live in.
