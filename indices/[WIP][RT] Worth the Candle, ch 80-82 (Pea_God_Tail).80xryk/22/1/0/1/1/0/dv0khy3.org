  ..that's what he's doing? Like, he just sacrificed a bunch of skills for a cheaty-munchkin ritual so that he would have the ability to attempt to save it? And now he and all his friends are spending days traveling in order to get to the place where they can take the next step on saving the locus?

he was going to pretty much abandon Locus, they voted on it, Juniper was going to do something else instead, but Valencia's vote decided that they should help. He specifically had a one on one talk with her about why she decided to vote like that. Also, all of a sudden he found her highly during that exchange.

  Sure, but he's not thinking of Arthur as a 40-year-old. He's thinking of him as the teenager that Juniper knew back on Earth. He knows intellectually that Arthur is not older, but he hasn't accepted it emotionally.

Okay, how about making a clone of a girl that loved you for your friend. She clearly stated that girls are not trophies to be won, but juniper wanted to give her as such for himself and Arthur.

The problem that i have with Juniper is exactly that, he is not thinking about it, but only in cases that it involves other people. When it's about him making a decision he goes into the over thinker mode. My whole problem is he can justify any of his action, but it doesn't make them less bad and when he is calling out someone for the same thing he does, it's hypocritical.

He specifically had problems having relationship with Fenn, cause she is older than him, he even thought about her as being immature for her age and that being a problem. Yet, he conveniently forgets about Arthurs real age and acts super immature when it suits him.

Like i don't think he is badly written, but i do think he is an asshole kid who never interacted with the real world or people. He reminiscence about how Arthur had this talks about morality, but Juniper applies zero of it to real life.
