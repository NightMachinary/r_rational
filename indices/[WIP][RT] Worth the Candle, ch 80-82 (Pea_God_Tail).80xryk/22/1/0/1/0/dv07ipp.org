In regards to Junipers â€˜harem', I don't think it's particularly controversial to point out that physical image is crucial to attraction for a lot of males and that you can't choose what you're attracted to. I personally would never judge someone on what or who they're attracted to, only how they choose to act in regards to that attraction.

Juniper is a teenager boy who has slept with a single girl in life and then been surrounded by a number of very attractive females who, at various points, show interest in him. He has done nothing unethical or been unfaithful at any point. If you ask me /that/ fact is less believable than a story where Juniper caves in and sleeps with Valencia, or sneaks looks at Amarylis through the soul link or something similar.
