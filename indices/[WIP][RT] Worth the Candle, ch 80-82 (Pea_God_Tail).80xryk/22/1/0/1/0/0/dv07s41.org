All of your points are valid, but the fact is,being attracted to them is on him and not on the harem flag that forces him to sleep with them. My problem is, he isn't admitting that, but rather shifting the blame of his possible actions on someone else. It's a flaw of his character, not a wrighting flaw. It's me disliking him for not taking responsibility for himself.

There is a difference of liking someone and thinking to yourself "I might be not able to control myself cause she is so beautiful. His compassion for Valencia took a sudden turn to lust, even tho he saw her as a clueless innocent kid a couple of chapters ago.

  He has done nothing unethical or been unfaithful at any point. If you ask me that fact is less believable than a story where Juniper caves in and sleeps with Valencia, or sneaks looks at Amarylis through the soul link or something similar.

Not for the lack of trying. There is a segment in bold text that is in my other comment. He did try to do something super scummy and bad.
