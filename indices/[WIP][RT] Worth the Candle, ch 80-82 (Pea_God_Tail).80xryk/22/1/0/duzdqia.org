I'm not clear on why you're being downvoted, since I think your posts are constructive critique as opposed to criticism. Having said that, I disagree with your take on the Tiff thing. I read this as Juniper speaking directly from the id -- he /wants/ this, but he recognizes that he /shouldn't/ want it. He knows perfectly well that these aren't reasonable (or perhaps even possible) things -- that's the point, he's telling the DM "I hate this situation so much that there is nothing you can plausibly give me that would make it right."
