  “Some personal things,” I said. “Things I don't want to share, and that I don't think it would be helpful to share. And ... keep an eye out for a backpack, I guess. He said that there would be a magical one that could get things from Earth, a gesture of goodwill.”

Yeah, it would not be. I mean Juniper said this first

  I want Tiff.

“And Fenn?” he asked.

“Fuck you,” I said. “I want Fenn too, god damn you, you fucking made her just for me, I knew from the start that Amaryllis was too pretty, terrifyingly pretty, I should have seen it with Fenn too, that you were just --” I shook my head. Manipulating me, but doing it with a full person that couldn't even be blamed for that manipulation, who I loved in spite of the fact that she was designed to be with me. “Fuck you,” I said.

Followed by this

  I don't want a harem

It really shows his ethics and how Fenn and Tiff(especially) are clearly more important when Arthur. Maybe if you don't want a harem stop acting like a horny teenager. Did he ever describe any of the Aerb girls by something besides them being beautiful and made to appeal to his physical taste? At this point when he says "I didn't want to peak at her being naked via soul link" i assume he stared like crazy, but just made an excuse for himself.

Also, let me get this straight what he asked and question how exactly that was going to work.

Junipers point of view:

*I want you to create a copy of a 15-16 year old feminist girl for me and my 40+(500+) pal. Forget about the fact that i didn't speak to her in moths, she might have moved on, she doesn't like the 40+ in question and he doesn't care cause he had multiple wives,lovers and children. Forget that i did the whole speech about Aerb being a hellhole and totally unsuitable for a 15-17 year old girl from Kansas and she probably doesn't want tob e here*

So at what point does he tell her about the sex clone of her for Arthur? How exactly it would work? Is she 15-16 at the time of her liking Arthur or 17 when after she dated Juniper and doesn't love Arthur? Would he like her sex clone to be reverted to being a virgin?

Yeah, he is awful.

Also story contradicts itself at times.

  We drifted apart by inches until she was sitting somewhere else for lunch and the last text message from her (an unanswered ‘how are you doing?') was months ago.

  I'd been trying to mend things with Tiff, and it had almost seemed to be working, so I guess there was that.
