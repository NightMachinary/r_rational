Time in the story is pretty convenient for maximum Juniper suffering and it's balanced like a house of cards.

Good thing Arthur was discovered to be alive right before the Junipers birthday (i assume it's June), otherwise it would be a guilt sour 18th one for him.

  Tiff always felt like she had moved to town around the middle of high school, but that wasn't actually true. She'd grown up in Bumblefuck, Kansas, same as the rest of us, it was just that she lived out in the country and she had mostly kept to herself, cloistered within her own group of friends. That group of girls had collapsed at some point freshman year, first with Laurel, a keystone member, moving away, and then with two of the girls dating boys a few grades ahead of us. Tiff was adrift for a few months, until she fell in with us.

So is it "middle of highschool" or "couple of moths after freshman year"? Cause those are kinda different.

Either way Tiff has a loose definition of "I kept waiting for him to ask me out or even just confess to me, but months and months went by and he never did", cause moths and moths in this case are *2 years*. No wonder she gave up on that. Also how exactly Juniper was thinking he was fooling anybody when "Arthur new him better when he himself", but they dated for "We carried on like this for about five months."

Is it an unfortunate coincidence that Tiff driving Juniper alone in her car would be them almost breaking the law and Arthur driving in a car crash. The are not breaking it only if Tiff really rushed for that drivers license and her priority of "not making the first step with boys" is to drive a boy alone with her at the first opportunity.

So Tiff was a 15-16 year old girl that extensively read up on feminism and Arthur did the same as 15-16 year old boy, because he had arguments with her?

Tiffs parents wrote a permission for her to get a tattoo and another minor was present during the process? considering circumstances maybe.
