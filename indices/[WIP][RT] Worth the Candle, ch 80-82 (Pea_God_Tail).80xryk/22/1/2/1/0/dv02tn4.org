That was a mistake. "Determined" changed to "discovered". Juniper found out that Arthur is alive on Aerb.

It wasn't true that he encountered her at the time"she had moved to town around the middle of high school". It wasn't true because "She'd grown up in Bumblefuck, Kansasshe". My question is did he meat her at the middle of high school or couple of moths after the freshman year, cause those are different.
