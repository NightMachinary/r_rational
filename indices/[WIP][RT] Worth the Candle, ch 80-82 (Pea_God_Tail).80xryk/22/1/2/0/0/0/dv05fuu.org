  Probably not, but it means that Tiff did wait for Arthur to make the first step for 2 years.

No, it doesn't. During that whole conversation Tiff is using indefinite periods of time, both "in the beginning" and "months and months". Tiff is established as having joined the group at some point at least a few months into freshman year, probably late in the year. Given some indefinite amount of time for her attraction to Arthur to grow, then "months and months" without him making the first move -- and then that attraction began to fade, and her attraction to Juniper began to grow, a state which continued for some indefinite amount of time until their first kiss /and/ that's coming from a character viewing their own past in light of a current relationship and/or flattering her boyfriend.

  Since we are on about the timeline this was a contradiction:
#+end_quote

That's not a contradiction. Juniper doesn't say "until [...] was months ago [and then I was sent to Aerb]", the sentence only says/implies that the "until" is when they reached that state of having a failed friendship. "We drifted apart until we reached this specific point."
