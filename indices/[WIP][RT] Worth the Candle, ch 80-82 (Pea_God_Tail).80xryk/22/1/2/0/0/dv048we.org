  Once you turn 16 years old, some of the restrictions will fall off of your license, but not all of them. With your less restricted license, you may drive only:

  we drifted apart by inches until she was sitting somewhere else for lunch and the last text message from her (an unanswered â€˜how are you doing?') was months ago.

  I'd been trying to mend things with Tiff, and it had almost seemed to be working, so I guess there was that.
