Nice, loved some of the interactions in these chapters. Amarillyis had some excellent moments, and their mini therapy session was well done. I'll be interested to see if they can stay uninvolved like they seem to want to, it's a good test of what the DM said to be true. Of course something may happen that will cause them to choose to become involved, something they couldn't ignore or the like. Still not necessarily forcing them (putting them in direct danger or need) but rather enticing them in some form.
