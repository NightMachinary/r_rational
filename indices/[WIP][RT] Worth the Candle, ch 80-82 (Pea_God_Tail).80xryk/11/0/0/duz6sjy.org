Ok sure. I was just trying to say that in a world with no respawn I would hate to feel forced into a time limited encounter. I would rather get another companion, better gear, maybe figure out a better form of attack than swords or find a trainer for magic skills - do everything I could to maximize my odds of success. But this questline implies they may have to take on those guards in the next 2 days.
