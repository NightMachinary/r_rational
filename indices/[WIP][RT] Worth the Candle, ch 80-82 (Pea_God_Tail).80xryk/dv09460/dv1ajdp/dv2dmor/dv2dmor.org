  the locus should be far ahead of Joon as it is several hundred years old (or is a few centuries considered young for a locus?).

My understanding of what Joon is perceiving when looking at the locus's soul is that it doesn't have /one/, because it isn't one being, but is rather an emergent property of a large number of independent souls making up its local ecosystem. In other words, the locus is essentially a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryozoa][bryozoa]]: many life-forms with independent DNA, but which function together as one larger organism in the same way the monoclonal cells of a multicellular plant or animal body do.

This might neatly explain the waning of the locus's power: even if the emergent phenomenon of sentience of the locus has "cultural memory" that is old, if most of its /constituent organisms/ are presently of a young age (because many of the older ones were left outside when its domain was sequestered to the bottle, and then the few remaining older ones died off), that might cause it to be less powerful than before.
