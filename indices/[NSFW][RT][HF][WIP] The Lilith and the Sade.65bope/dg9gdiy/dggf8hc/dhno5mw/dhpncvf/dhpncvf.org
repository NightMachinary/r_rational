No worries! I'm glad you read.

  First of all, I don't understand the sad ending. At all. What made Beauty sleep? What made her momentarily wake up and then sleep again?
#+end_quote

The answer here, of course, is that it's not the ending - that's why the [WIP] tag. Looking back, it's indeed not clear that this isn't just unedited but unfinished narratively (because I can't figure out exactly where to go from that point). Hence you're asking after things that are /supposed/ to be mysterious at that point in the story - and I don't tend to do sad endings overall.

  So this confirms that "Spiking" is actually a summary execution for all kinds of nonconsensual actions. Maybe even the ones that don't really deserve it and/or are understandable mistakes (in judgement, not communication).

Spoilers follow.

Hmm. I've been trying here to convey something about the culture of this part of Sade Hall, which is that the consent protection to a certain extent gets treated like a nearby volcano or faultline: it's notionally cataclysmically dangerous, but is rarely observed to do anything more than make a warning rumble here and there, and so due to the constellation of poor (except that the stopped clock happens in this case to be telling the right time) risk assessment heuristics common to human-style consciousness people simultaneously mythologize it as being wrathful and volatile out of proportion with reality while /acting/ like the actual probability of cataclysm is far smaller than the data would seem to suggest (except that volcanoes don't take into account personal behavior).

  Those things don't necessarily make for a worse narration, but they do kind of break the suspension of disbelief when it comes to this being a translation.

As Cheryl herself says:

  Note also that I'm focusing here on /telling the stories/. I've tried where possible to convey the 'feel' of the original Infernal text relative to its source context (as best I could figure that out, connotation marks can only take you so far) by rendering things in ye olde Anglish or other such kinks, and I'm not trying /not/ to write pleasing sentences, but at the end of the day when I'm translating these stories I am clarity's bitch.

  Huh. So the fairy-like person did/wanted to do something non-consensual?
#+end_quote

Good catch, thank you. The intention here is that this was a genuine accident and Beauty saved her, but based on how the consent protection is seen working elsewhere that's not clear. //me adds to fix notes/

Also, on a purely word-of-god level: the lower bound is - it's generally observed - intention you're in the process of acting on, and most people seem to observe it not to act until the absolute last minute, and in the most minimal possible way for the situation.

  Wait, she actually bleeds in two colors that don't truly mix? How does that work?
#+end_quote

Nectar/ichor and fluid dynamics is an interesting relationship. It seems to operate more by meaning or something like that but I'm not exactly sure...better go do some detailed investigation. :)

#+begin_quote
  I don't know if this comment is helpful but I hope it didn't disappoint too much, given the month long wait. Looking forward to reading the chapter you recently posted. You definitely deserve all the love and nectar you can swallow ;)

Thanks :) And don't worry - I've already filed you under "useful negative critique".
