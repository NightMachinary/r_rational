Three things:

a) I got that this is tongue-in-cheek parody, but it still gave me flash backs to this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwZsSfu6QmY][horrible kickstarter covered by retsupurae]].

b) Elevator gate - does anyone really want to bring that up again? I didn't even knew that had any crossing with the Less Wrong community, and I fear that if I dig into that I will facepalm a lot.

c) I find that the concept hardly works, even in the most "perfect" examples shown in the page the humor doesn't work as well and the information is not transmitted well enough.
