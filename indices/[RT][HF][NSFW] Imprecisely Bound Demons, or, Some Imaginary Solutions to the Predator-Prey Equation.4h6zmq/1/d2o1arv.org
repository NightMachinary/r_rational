I looked at the main site, and found not enough there to make me care one way or another... the teaser is extremely empty. Demon summoning is something I am usually a fan of in fiction, but really there's not much there.

Honestly, the most notable part about the teaser is the abuse of fonts make it an actual eyesore - I actually disabled the page style so that I could read it comfortably. I hope that this is a stylistic choice that is used only in this teaser and you make different choices in the actual narrative, because I won't ever be reading something that alternates between Poseidon and VT323 both glowing against a dark background, and if what you're writing turns out to be any good it would be a pain in the ass to have to constantly disable your page's style just to make it readable.
