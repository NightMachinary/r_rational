Ditch the novelty fonts. Novelty fonts are fine if it's just a line here or there, but the eyestrain of reading more than a thousand words of that is too much.

The purpose of the first chapter is to establish what the story is about. My impression is that it's about sex, and the relationship between a human and a demon. The problem is there is no tension. There's no conflict between human and demon, no trepidation about being flung from the word, no regrets about never, ever seeing his family and friends again.

The human doesn't feel real; he gives up his life without a single thought, proving his background was never anything more than a cardboard cutout in the first place. The demon sounds like a cheesy phone-sex operator just saying her lines, not a real, three-dimensional character.

You did a good job on the humor. That helped a lot.

I know this is a little harsh, so let me reassure you that I'm not trying to be mean or drive you away from writing, just give you what I think is good advice.
