We built a device to instantiate ourselves in a different dimension, fed it some requirements for the new dimension, and we got it wrong. The dimension it chose was excellent; the way it instantiated us was mistaken.

The machine was meant to be flexible--it was meant to make us breathe chlorine, if necessary, or make us work on different laws of physics. Above all, it was meant to choose a dimension that was similar to our home world, so that few changes would be necessary.

So the device incidentally made us as small as possible while still being able to think like humans. Our whole physiology is different, but we can still think, and we can still walk, talk, behave as normal--so the machine met our requirements as we stated them.

We spent so much time specifying what the new dimension should look like, we made a mistake specifying how our device should put us into it.

If I were stuck in that situation, my most immediate concern would be safety. Presumably human beings don't reproduce as fast as the insects they now resemble; we are going to have to be more careful than insects. It is a dangerous world.

I think our best bet is to look for a niche that most small animals are unable to occupy, but we are capable of handling. Something where intelligence, language, or tool-use would give us an advantage. It just also needs to be something where we don't lose people faster than we can reproduce.

For example, we could settle a fruit tree. The fruit wouldn't need to be that large to sustain us, and the stability and defensibly of the tree is desirable. We could place splinters in the fruit and branches to discourage animals from hanging around our tree. We could apply poisons to these splinters, coordinate guards to kill invading ants and insects, and build enclosed hallways to prevent birds from snatching those among the branches.

Birds would be the most terrifying enemy, I think. Hiding works well for many things, but humans have never had to keep track of flying enemies. They'd be like dragons, except faster, ridiculously common, and all business. I definitely wouldn't try to ride one, though feathers from dead birds would be a good starting point for artificial wings.

In terms of animals to domesticate, I'd probably go after silkworms, ants, and bees. It might be possible to use chemicals (perhaps from the ants themselves) to get ants to accept us, and we could use their burrows and numbers for safety--or use them just to broaden our diet, by taking some of the food they bring back. Bees are a similar story, but more dangerous. Bees would be better able to defend a tree, so assisting a hive in our tree might be mutually beneficial, if we can somehow convince them not to sting us. Silkworms seem like the safest starting point overall.

Maybe we should settle a mulberry tree? Silkworms would eat it, the fruit is small and edible, and the unripe fruit can be made into a toxic paint.
