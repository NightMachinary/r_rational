After some thought, I'm inclined to go lower rather than higher. If you think about it, 1 grape is 2 calories, so is 1 gram of chicken. A grape is about the size of a 10cm human's head, certainly bigger than their stomach. If they're required to eat the equivalent of 20 grapes a day, which is a huge amount of food in terms of volume, that would be pretty weird. They would be spending all their time eating and shitting.
