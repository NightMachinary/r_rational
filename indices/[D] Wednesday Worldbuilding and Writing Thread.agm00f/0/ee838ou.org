You and your people barely escape your world's destruction by fleeing through a portal to another dimension. You get there and everything is enormous, positively gigantic. The trees are the size of mountains, and even the smallest animals and insects are around your size.

You realize that it's not the things that are bigger, you're all smaller. Around 1/20th the size (~10cm/4 inches).

Some mechanism you don't understand is maintaining your bodies so they function identically to before, so your cells and molecules don't collapse or implode or turn into antimatter or whatever. Even weirder, it also allows you to eat and digest the native fauna and flora as normal.

Now what?

Some thoughts:

- The square cube law and so on would mean that their physical capabilities would amazing for their size. Like how an ant can lift many times its weight, or a flea can jump hundreds of times its length. Falling from great heights would also be less fatal, as would being swatted around.

- Because their strength to weight ration is so high, and because the air pressure is also high relatively, a person with some big artificial wings could potentially generate enough lift to fly! For the same reasons, building aircraft would be a pretty straightforward process.

- Assuming their caloric requirements are also similarly scaled down, very little time and energy would be needed for sustenance. A single stalk of corn would feed hundreds, a few acres of various crops would be enough for a city of tens of thousands. (It would be a very different kind of story if their caloric requirements stayed the same. A little 10 centimetre human needing to eat 2k cal a day would be terrifying.)

- This also applies to other, previously scarce resources. Energy would be way easier to come by, though the engineering challenges would still be considerable. Things like windmills, watermills, steam engines, even fossil fuels.

- They could devote that extra time to building beautiful stuff. Huge buildings (relative to their size) could be built relatively easily. Their cities could have massive domes and towers and minarets and so on. A skyscraper that is 1km high(relatively) would not be a huge challenge, structurally.

- On the other hand, protecting their cities and crops from animals would probably be their primary challenge. Humans would be at the bottom of the food chain. Even insects and small scavengers would be enormous threats, not to mention the bigger stuff. A small tunnelling pest could undermine their entire city single-handedly. Imagine how hard it would be to fight off birds the size of houses, carnivores the size of stadiums, or even just a swarm of mosquitoes.

- Can you imagine trying to produce enough gunpowder and ammunition to protect from so many casual threats?

Anyone have any further thoughts?
