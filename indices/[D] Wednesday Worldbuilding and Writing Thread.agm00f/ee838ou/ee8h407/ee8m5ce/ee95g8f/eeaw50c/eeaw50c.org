1) Is the aggression reasonably reasonably scaled to the mana? (Mages have agro.) 2) The people who produce very little mana - how do they get along with animals? 3) Can these effects be altered using magic? (Aggression aside, if animals can detect people via their mana, then spells to minimize this may be essential for stealth (and getting anywhere, or hunting).) 4) Can the mana of 'most people' be harvested? 5) Is it possible to use mana to get to a normal size? Do the animals have mana?
