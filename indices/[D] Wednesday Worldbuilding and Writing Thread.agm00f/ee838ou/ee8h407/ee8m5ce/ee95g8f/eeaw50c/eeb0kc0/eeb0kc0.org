#+begin_quote
  1) Is the aggression reasonably reasonably scaled to the mana? (Mages have agro.)
#+end_quote

I think that would be the more interesting option. It would give people on the lower side of mana production an interesting role as scouts and rangers and so on, and it would balance out the advantage of being a demigod mage with the disadvantage of being beset at all times by kamikaze critters.

What do you think?

  2) The people who produce very little mana - how do they get along with animals?
#+end_quote

Any mana provokes aggro. The quantity only changes the range it can be detected at.

#+begin_quote
  3) Can these effects be altered using magic? (Aggression aside, if animals can detect people via their mana, then spells to minimize this may be essential for stealth (and getting anywhere, or hunting).)
#+end_quote

I would say yes, but not extensively. Enough for a quick expedition, but nothing more. Eventually constructs can be made to stealth a city, but it would not scale down.

  4) Can the mana of 'most people' be harvested?
#+end_quote

Somewhat. Mana is an anomaly, and apparently exists only inside living beings who crossed between dimensions. Nothing else has mana, and nothing can really contain mana. Constructs that use mana in predetermined ways can be made, though. I see constructs like subways or trams being powered by the passengers themselves. Instead of consumer appliances and electronics powered by electricity, a lot of those would be made to run on mana. (undecided about how electricity would factor into the world)

#+begin_quote
  5) Is it possible to use mana to get to a normal size? Do the animals have mana?
#+end_quote

The initial iteration of this idea was to make it xianxia inspired, with cultivators becoming increasingly larger as they progress, with no upwards limit. That's been mostly scrapped.

Any living being who cross the portal have an innate mana production.
