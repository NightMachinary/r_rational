As a note, due to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiber%27s_law][Kieber's Law,]] calories scale to the 3/4 power, rather than according to the usual square/cube law, for a multitude of reasons. Which means that your average citizen will need about 200-250 calories per day, if I did my math right.

Edit: Whoops, I think I really bopped the math. Showing my work now, I think that the real difference would be ( 20^{3} )^{3/4}, which is about 845. Dividing the average caloric consumption of a human by that gets you about 3.
