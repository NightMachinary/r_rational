The biggest issue with a serious shrinking story is that every part of an organism is highly calibrated to the scale they live in. Shrink eyes, and even if they can detect the photons and focal length is fixed, everything will still be far dimmer. Every source of heat in the body would be far too active to avoid cooking, and as you already covered, every other life form of that scale would be far more mobile and deadly.

Hand made rifles would be even worse than normal scale ones, due to massively higher air resistance and the expansion factor of gunpowder.

That being said, simply applying intelligence to a small creature or group has a lot of potential for jumping off into original world building. Intelligent spiders could learn to build farms for their food, rodents could set up micro forges to make tiny batches of worked metal, butts could map out immense areas to select a new meeting site, and so on.
