In my brainstorm I had an idea to make the situation even more precarious. The idea that the mechanism that allows people to function at 10cm tall is mana. Everyone who crossed the portal now produces a certain quantity of it at every moment, and if they run out and can't maintain their existence upkeep they will instantly die.

The interesting part is that people produce varying amounts, a normal distribution. At the left of the bell curve are the few who produce very little, barely enough to survive. The middle, the vast majority, produce a little bit extra.The last group produce a lot more than needed to survive. Those people can become mages, and use their excess mana to produce other reality-altering effects, like telekinesis, pyrokinesis, and so on.

Mana has another interesting property: it causes all animals in this new dimension to be unreasonably aggressive if they come within a certain range of it. There will be no domesticating the fauna in this world, or even co-existing. Humans will always be at war with anything that moves.

Thoughts?
