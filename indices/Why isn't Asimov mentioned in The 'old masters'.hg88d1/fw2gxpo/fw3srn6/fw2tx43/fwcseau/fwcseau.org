I would think that both /Foundation/ and the /Robot/ stories and novels work extremely well as rational fiction - they're based on something logical - the Three Laws and psychohistory - and their implications are logically analyzed. And there's some extent of fair-play whodunit here, especially in the /I, Robot/ stories.
