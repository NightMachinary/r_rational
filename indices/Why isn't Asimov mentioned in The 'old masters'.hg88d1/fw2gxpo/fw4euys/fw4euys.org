I would not say that Asimov's works place any kind of premium on rational worldbuilding, for one. A lot of his stories are about exploring a theme, or an idea, or the effects of technology on human society, and he would then go on to put little work on making the setting make sense beyond superficially.

Maybe it's my biases talking but Asimov is my least favourite of the SF golden age big 3. Clarke was dry and Heinlein was preachy, but Asimov is the only one that I feel has no depth to his big ideas, with characters being very similar and often blatantly just narrative vehicles. And even the stories that I really liked(Foundation, for example) I couldn't imagine them as real, couldn't picture myself living in these worlds.
