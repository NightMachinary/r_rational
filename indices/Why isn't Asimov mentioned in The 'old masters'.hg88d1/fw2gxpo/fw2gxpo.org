Because the list is not representative nor complete and is fairly subjective. If you are going by this list you are going to get the author's skewed perspective.

It includes random works that have gotten medium-levels of attention at best while not including better-accepted ones.

At any rate, I love Asimov, his writing is great and he is at least somewhat 'more rational' than most but clearly they were going for a much more strict definition of 'Old Masters' here. In fact, I think that specific subsection is straight-up just works which Yudkowsky listed in an old comment on LW before this sub even existed.
