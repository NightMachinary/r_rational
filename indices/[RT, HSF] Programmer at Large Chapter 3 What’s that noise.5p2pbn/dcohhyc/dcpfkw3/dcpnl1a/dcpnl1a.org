I'm familiar with the idea of a tagged filesystem, but in my opinion that's only a small part.

What if more then one process wants to access a data object at once? A good 'file system' should handle locking and merge-conflicts, as an example. That's going to end up being pretty necessary for big distributed piles-of-daemons like the ones in this story.

Tagging FS are a very small improvement over our existing options, I think.
