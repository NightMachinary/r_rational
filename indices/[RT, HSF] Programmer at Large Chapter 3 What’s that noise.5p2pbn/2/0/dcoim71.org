  I don't know how intentional is is, but I really like how the conversational interface doesn't have any consistent voice.
#+end_quote

Mostly unintentional but intentionally not avoided. It's a specific feature that the conversational interface is something closer to cleverbot + a long history of editing and heuristic tweaking than any sort of true AI.

It /is/ deliberate that it alternates between very dry (somewhat automated) and very sarcastic (someone has probably edited this while annoyed).

  I would love to hear some thoughts about better ways to organize things then file systems.
#+end_quote

I'm semi-deliberately not going to provide too many canon answers about how the shipboard computer systems actually work.

My assumption is that they have some sort of extremely well indexed content addressable storage as their public interface for organising things and then individual processes have a private namespace of on disk data that they own and can expose parts of to clients.
