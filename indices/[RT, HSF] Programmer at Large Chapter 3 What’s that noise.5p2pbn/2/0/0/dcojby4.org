I get that. I'd still like to hear some non-canon thoughts on the subject though. I'm working on some tools to treat rethinkdb like a filesystem, in that it fills a similar role, not in that you interact with it like a file system.

Capnproto is also doing some interesting stuff, integrating an object store with its RPC protocol.
