Yes, I suppose both of those fit the description I gave. [[#s][Deepness spoilers]]

"Winning by out-thinking all your enemies" could describe pretty much any story where victory is not just a matter of power. /Lord of the Rings/, for example: Instead of winning through force of arms, they conceive and execute a strategy that Sauron didn't think about, and so bring about his downfall. That's pretty broad, and not at all confined to Rational fiction; I was trying to get at something a little more specific.

Many Rational stories have a sort of pattern where the protagonist gets into a bind, gets out of it by thinking of a clever solution or using a tool no one else was smart enough to invent. Then they get into another bind, think their way out of that one, and so on. Several works that are well-liked on this sub have this pattern (/Methods of Rationality,/ /The Two Year Emperor,/ and /The Waves Arisen/ all do), but I've not seen it much elsewhere. /A Deepness in the Sky/ doesn't really do this iteration of clever solutions, or at least it didn't feel like the same thing to me.
