I actually think that /A Deepness in the Sky/ hewed very closely to the "official" Rational principles (i.e., those listed on the sidebar). But it does lack most of the "unofficial" tropes that are often seen in Rational fiction (Slow accumulation of power, munchkining, winning by out-thinking all your enemies, slight preachiness about utilitarianism/atheism/transhumanism, etc). I'd second your recommendation whole-heartedly, in any case. Anyone who hangs out here will probably appreciate and enjoy it. I certainly did, despite having to take a break because of how horrified I was by Focus.

(Haven't read /A Fire Upon the Deep/ yet, so can't vouch for it either way, but I certainly intend to.)

I'm really enjoying /Programmer At Large/ because it's like a bunch of Qeng Ho slice of life vignettes, which is something I never knew I wanted before.
