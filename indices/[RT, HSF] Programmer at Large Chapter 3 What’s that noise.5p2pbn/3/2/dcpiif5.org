There are some rules of thumb that help:

- 1 megasecond = 1 fortnight (it's actually closer to 11.6 days, but for informal reading the difference will rarely matter)
- 30 megaseconds = 1 year (actually more like 11.5 months, but again good enough).

The metric units come from Vinge's Qeng Ho, who are the major inspiration for this story (though the Trade Fleet society have diverged rather far from the source material and have a healthy dose of Ursula Le Guin and other sources in their design. Vinge is very libertarian and the Trade Fleet are... not).
