I infer from this that you haven't read much of Vinge (A Fire On The Deep, A Deepness In The Sky)? If that is the case, you should definitely go check his stuff out.

Not like super rational or anything, but anyone who likes the stuff this subreddit has and this story series in particular will probably love Vinge.
