LMAO I was just speculating on whether a path through the worlds demons inhabit can even exist for a dog, because as you said, all dogs go to heaven. I had assumed that that's where that was going.

Bad doggie heaven just has lots of grass and gives them a passive buff to self-control so they can be good dogs there.
