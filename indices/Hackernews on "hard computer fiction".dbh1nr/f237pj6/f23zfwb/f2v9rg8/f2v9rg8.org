That's pretty off. Y Combinator is an incumator, but new.ycombinator.com is a forum community. [[https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html][The Guidelines]] say:

  On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.

  Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.

I've found it to be full of useful information and perspectives. There are usually experienced experts from many fields there weighing in.
