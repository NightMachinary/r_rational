  The Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown

I can save them the trouble.

Comp-Fi score is /maybe/ a 2. (The US government built a machine with literally a million processors, so they can decrypt anything! Someone put a virus into a message being decrypted, so the machine got infected!).

Which is to say, Dan Brown knows as much about computers as he does any of the other subjects he writes about in his novels (e.g. the virus in /Inferno/ which, as described, would wipe out the human species in ~20 generations, rather than saving it).
