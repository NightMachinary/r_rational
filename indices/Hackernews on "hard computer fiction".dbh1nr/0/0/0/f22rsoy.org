It gets worse. The method that the hacker supposedly used to make it uncrackable was a virus which constantly re-encrypts the file so that the encryption code is constantly changing. That description got the NSA to turn off their antivirus so they could attempt to decrypt the file. That's how the virus infiltrated the system in the first place: the actual encryption on the file was negligible, and it loaded the virus from there, which then infiltrated other secure systems on the NSA network by "eating away at the databank's security" so that it can be accessed publicly. At one point, a "security expert" sets a password to, and I'm dead serious here, the number 3. Just that one digit.

President Skroob could be hired as a security consultant for the NSA and it'd be an /improvement/.
