I believe apocalypse actually comes from an ancient Greek word meaning "revelation".

That said, even if things do end happily (which is not certain right now) it's entirely possible they'll get way worse before. The Drug Lord striking a deal with the Other King to get names and bring forth Thamiel sort of worse.
