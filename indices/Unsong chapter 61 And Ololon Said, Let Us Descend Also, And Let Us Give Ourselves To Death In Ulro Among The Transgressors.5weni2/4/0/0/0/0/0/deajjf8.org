Oh sure. I was just stacking it that way to make the joke that, even with the slow release schedule, people in that hypothetical timeline would still be getting their fix before the fans in this universe.

Different question, but one that I find interesting: Martin could conceivably have written the series faster, at a cost of quality. In order for the final book to have been published today, how much of a drop in quality would you be willing to accept for the whole series? Is a version of the series that is only 90% as good, but complete, better than the series as it stands? How about 80%?

(As an author myself, the question seems very pertinent)
