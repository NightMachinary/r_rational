Hm... There are 344 chapters in ASOIAF. If we posit a hypothetical web serial version of ASOIAF whose first chapter was released in January, with subsequent chapters being released every month without delay, then we'd be getting the first chapter of The Winds of Winter in 2024.

What do you want to bet that fans in the Song of Serials and Webfiction universe will still be getting their Winds of Winter fix before the fans in this universe, though?
