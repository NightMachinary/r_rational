Thanks! It's a nice motivational bonus if other people enjoy my stories as well. I don't have an overarching plot planned in advance, but I do intend to keep making up stories as I go along until the deeper plot can be 'resolved'.

These aren't meant to be rational (or even rationalist), just stories wrapped around fun mathematical ideas.
