Huh. I don't know why I'm so surprised, but it seems that most fiction that touches on government corruption (particularly law enforcement corruption) seems to want to paint the entirety of the government as hopelessly corrupt because of some underlying truth about relationship between governments and their own power in society, etc.

Good to see a more nuanced take where just because some agencies or individuals are up to shenanigans it doesn't mean everyone nominally on their side is down for it. Will be interesting to see how things play out.
