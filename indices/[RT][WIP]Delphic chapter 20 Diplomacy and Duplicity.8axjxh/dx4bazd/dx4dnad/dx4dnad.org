There's a brief discussion in chapter 11 that no one with super-intelligence has 'gone public' with it, so the Doc thinks it probably doesn't exist... sort of like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox][Fermi paradox]].

Because the source of powers is very different here than in Worm*, anything that relies on a person being supplied with inexplicable outside knowledge isn't going to be a thing. The Manton Effect is also not a thing, for the same reason.

That doesn't mean there won't be cool tech solutions to problems; several of the characters including Hector himself are very much willing and able to tinker. But the tech they come up with will be sourced in modern Earth tech (with a nod to the alt-history that developed upsilon emitters in the 40s rather than nuclear fission).

*If the conversation gets into specifics on Worm, let's use spoiler tags.
