I really like this one much more than "How to avoid death on a daily basis". It resonates with me much more and is better written. It may be so too because i am tired of the coming into a fantasy world however the world may be different from the rest. HADDB had a couple of tropes i was just tired with and characters that i didnt quite like as characters. As in i couldnt really identify with them. The tone shifts were sometimes weird too which i threw me off many times while reading.

In this work everything is done exceptionally well which suprised me considering the authors previous work. It avoids the cliches and has an interesting setting.
