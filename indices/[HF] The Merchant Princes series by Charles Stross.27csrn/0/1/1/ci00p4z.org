If someone /does/ provide a link to Amazon, I try to avoid using it. My usual alternative is to search for the title and authour at BookFinder.com, which knows my country of shipping and preferred country, and searches multiple sites to find the best price. Picking a book at random, "Quozl" by Alan Dean Foster, the [[http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?new_cache=on&author=alan+dean+foster&title=quozl&lang=en&isbn=&new_used=*&destination=ca&currency=CAD&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr][cheapest]] used paperback at an Amazon site is CDN$7.92, but there are almost a dozen from AbeBooks that are only $7.60. Sometimes, the differences are more dramatic.

BookFinder links are reasonably easy to make: [Here]([[http://www.bookfinder.com/?author=alan+dean+foster&title=quozl][www.bookfinder.com/?author=alan+dean+foster&title=quozl]]) is one if you know the authour and title, and [here]([[http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?isbn=0441694543][www.bookfinder.com/search/?isbn=0441694543]]) is one for ISBN.
