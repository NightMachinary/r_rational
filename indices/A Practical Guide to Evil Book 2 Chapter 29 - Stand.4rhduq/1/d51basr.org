I think Cat's final Name could be the overarching conflict of the story. Callow views itself as a force of good and therefore produces Heroes. Black is trying subvert this plot by changing Callow into a place that no longer produces Heroes. By taking Cat under his wing he is looking to change the narrative through Cat. This has worked so far as Cat clearly has the evil side of Squire. However as this chapter shows, Cat still has the Callow identity and I expect that to through a wrench into Black's plans. I wouldn't be surprised if the name that Cat comes into is a new name that blends the pride of Callow with the ruthlessness of Preas.
