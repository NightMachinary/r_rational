Feel free to disregard this but I think making this about Laura still keeps the trio pretty much front and center in the story. I think reminding the reader about the larger world would be better done by placing the disaster in another country --Leaf can find out by seeing a newscast as she's walking by somewhere or maybe someone else talking about /their/ relatives. I think this would have the following benefits:

1) Makes the digression shorter and more on point -- more focused on what you're trying to accomplish with it

2) Leaf being worried about strangers rather than red's mom would also help underline her sense of responsibility since she would be worrying about randoms as a trainer rather than just about her friends, like any random civilian would, of any occupation.

3) Helps expand the world. Now the digression would be less of a non-sequitur and more of a way to bring out more details about other areas of the world and what's going on there. You can also maybe use this to foreshadow a place that will be visited in the future. Or maybe have one of giovanni's factories blow up to give an alternate explanation to his typing and curtness/hurrying.
