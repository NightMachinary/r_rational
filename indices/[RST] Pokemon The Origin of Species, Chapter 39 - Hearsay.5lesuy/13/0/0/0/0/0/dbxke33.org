Yeah, I definitely considered just having it be some random event completely unconnected to any of them, but internally I felt like it was too removed from Leaf's perspective for her to do more than just feel a vague sense of worry and frustration. This first time, it needed to have someone she knew there to really drive home the worry. I also wanted to communicate the idea that their loved ones aren't safe just because they're not out in the world adventuring.
