It has probably to do with conservation of energy: you can turn an existing pokemon or object into pure enegrgy and store it but you can't just create the energy out of nothing (well you probably could invest some energy into it but it would probably be massive).

However you could maybe clone a pokemon by unplugging the cable as the transfer is going through........
