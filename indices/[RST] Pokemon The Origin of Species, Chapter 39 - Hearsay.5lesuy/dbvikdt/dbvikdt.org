So based on the final section I think we've confirmed Leaf isn't a Dark type. That really isn't surprising. I've never had a problem with Leaf sections, but the research segments I've enjoyed the most have fed us details about other regions or were fantastically original like one old woman's tale on rock-humans. The way Leaf chooses to interact with her Pokemon is a pleasant contrast from Blue. She doesn't just tell us, but shows us that Pokemon aren't just for battling and we rarely see that in the anime.

Barring another event I'm guessing we'll see Blue battling Misty within the next two chapters. It will probably be a mostly underwater battle, but we've seen water Pokemon that are less-than-dexterous underwater (psyduck). And she might use an odd foreign Pokemon like togetic. Or she could've evolved an eevee from Bill into a vaporeon which I'm suggesting just because I've never seen her use one before. The last thoughts I have for Blue are how he'll react to hearing about Giovanni meeting Leaf and if he will meet any of Misty's less famous sisters from the anime while working on the Cerulean lesson.

I don't see any major reasons for our heroes to stay in Cerulean while watching their Clefairy and Abra sales. We'll probably hear from Bill at least one more time- oh man do I feel dumb. The thing Bill wanted Red for has to do with that ticket for the S.S.Anne doesn't it? I can think of a few things the kids could do there. Anyway what else could happen before we get back on the road? We could learn something about the cave Misty found (and someone other than Blue could snag a high level Pokemon since he set the precedent), Bill could get involved, the Abras could be stolen by team rocket, something related to coordinators, someone's Pokemon could evolve and we get to see some training/behavior differences, we could learn about shadow Pokemon from the Orre region, or Xerneas could wake up thus activating the fairy type.
