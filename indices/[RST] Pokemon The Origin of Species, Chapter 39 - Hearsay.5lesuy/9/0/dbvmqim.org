Some of the reasons I like Leaf's sections are who and what she can bring into the story that are outside of Blue and Red's experiences. Strange Pokemon from her region, pokemon and item specialists, etc. Would you enjoy more stuff along those lines as opposed to the mundane (non-Pokemon detective work) research? Or do you find Leaf pretty flat all around?
