Heya, thanks for the write-up! I won't spoil anything, but can respond a bit to some of these:

  (unless DaystarEld is just using it as a metaphor for a backed-up sewage or pollution treatment plant).
#+end_quote

Yep, this is basically the understanding those in the pokemon world have of why this sort of thing happens. Some treatment process somewhere broke down, or some influx of substance caused a population boom, or some major sewer artery got clogged, and they basically just overflooded the local area.

  (Aside: Isn't it fun to think about what lost metamorphic stage the ancestors to the Paras line might have had, before the entire species and its descendants got ‘jacked by the parasite fungus?).
#+end_quote

Yep! Same with a lot of other plant pokemon hybrids, like the bulbasaur line, though theirs is more symbiotic a relationship.

  *The fact that the fungus can infect species besides Paras also surprises me. For the degree of parasitism involved in hijacking the brain, I would have expected the reproductive spores to be highly specialized to only Paras biochemistry. I am not a mycologist or entomologist, but I have never read about a Cordyceps species that targets multiple, let alone distantly related, species.
#+end_quote

I should clarify that the fungus doesn't actually hijack other pokemon in a sustainable way: it just uses their biomass as food and keep spreading through spores, without controlling their movements. The paras family is indeed the only species where they can essentially take over.

#+begin_quote
  Years ago, I read another Pokémon fanfic (Pokémon 0 by Afroshock) that explained the 6-mon limit as a legal imposition on Trainers. His ideas were that it limited the severity of the threat posed by any rogue Trainer, and it limited Trainers to a number of Pokémon that they could reasonably be expected to care for adequately. That story also implied that Pokéballs were an imperfect stasis and that certain licenses permitted a higher number of carried Pokémon.

That's a pretty neat idea too. Hard to enforce, but not if there was a strict ball registration process and the ability to force pokeballs not to work for trainers who try to break it, or straight up teleport them away like in the cartoon (If there's one technology I've basically ignored it's the ability to teleport pokemon into PCs from anywhere, since that feels ridiculously broken and unexplainable)
