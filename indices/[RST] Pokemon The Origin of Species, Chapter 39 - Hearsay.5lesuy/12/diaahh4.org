The Grimer/Muk outbreak in Celadon makes me want to draw a connection to the earlier Paras/Parasect outbreak on Mt. Moon, since both locals are associated with Rocket activity in game canon. Maybe it's just coincidence... or maybe both were planned. This is an older thread, but I came up with an essay-sized post, so hear me out?

Grimer and Muk have no real-world animal counterpart (that I know of) to use as a basis for interpreting their behaviour, but in the game canon they do not occur in outbreaks. So I find thier outbreak slightly suspicious (unless DaystarEld is just using it as a metaphor for a backed-up sewage or pollution treatment plant).

In contrast, Paras and Parasect are strongly based on cicada nymphs and the Cordyceps fungi, and the outbreak conflicted a little with what I expected of their ecology.

I acknowledge that Paras do swarm in game canon, but so far that has only been in Unova, possibly as a reference to the real-life periodical cicadas (genus /Magicicada/) found in the USA, which emerge from underground in large numbers after maturing as nymphs for 13-17 years. So in that sense, I can kind of see Paras outbreaks as a natural part of their ecology -- even if Parasect does not advance to an imago stage (it could be relict behaviour from an ancestor), and the outbreak behaviour is transplanted between regional breeds.

(Aside: Isn't it fun to think about what lost metamorphic stage the ancestors to the Paras line might have had, before the entire species and its descendants got ‘jacked by the parasite fungus?).

However, in our world, a Cordyceps fungus needs its spores to reach and infect another member of its target species, rather than purely maximize the dispersal distance. If the Paras are already living and breeding in a colony, then the spores already have access to new hosts without the need to mass migrate to the surface (the Pokedex supports this with a very reasonable statement about Paras being doused in spores at birth). Some sort of breeding migration between colonies could help maintain genetic diversity for both parasites and hosts, but then the most efficient behaviour would be to find other Paras colonies first, rather than head directly for the surface and release spores enmass. Although, perhaps that was what was occurring when the other Pokémon caught in the way panicked in an effort to avoid poison, paralysis, sleep, or fungal infection, resulting in Chp 31.

Since the Paras-fungus spores were described as infecting other species* (the wild Graveller in Chp 31), a breeding migration could also be an opportunity to try infecting new species as hosts, which in turn would learn to flee to avoid infection, also leading to the events of Chp 31. Ants have adapted to recognize and evict Cordyceps-infected colony members before the fungus sprouts. If the breeding migration is seasonal, and a threat to other species, the local species populations would likely adapt to avoid the migration and the threat it poses, reducing the numbers caught in it.

In addition, the Rangers in Chp 29 were aware of strange Pokémon displacements beforehand and wary of something, but never voiced that a large Paras migration could be responsible. And the security personnel Leaf interviewed in this chapter said they did not expected the Paras to chase stronger Pokémon out in front of them. This suggests that Paras migrations do not usually have such a disastrous effect. Perhaps it's a 1-in-10 or 1-in-100 year event. Or climate change.

Or perhaps Team Rocket(?) intentionally agitated the Paras into migrating early, which in turn panicked the other species. Or, the Paras and other Pokémon were agitated into an outbreak altogether. And then Yuuta uses the planned distraction to steal the fossils, rather than waiting to capitalize on a chance opportunity. Later, the same or a similar method is used to agitate Grimer and Muk in Celadon, in order to... distract attention from the Rocket Game Corner? Maybe I'm reaching too hard to justify a chance correlation. But the ability to trigger uncontrolled Pokémon outbreaks at will would be hugely useful for Rocket shenanigans. In GSC canon, they used radio waves to agitate Pokémon into maturing early, so similar experimentation towards agitating them into sudden outbreaks doesn't seem far off.

*The fact that the fungus can infect species besides Paras also surprises me. For the degree of parasitism involved in hijacking the brain, I would have expected the reproductive spores to be highly specialized to only Paras biochemistry. I am not a mycologist or entomologist, but I have never read about a Cordyceps species that targets multiple, let alone distantly related, species.

Years ago, I read another Pokémon fanfic (Pokémon 0 by Afroshock) that explained the 6-mon limit as a legal imposition on Trainers. His ideas were that it limited the severity of the threat posed by any rogue Trainer, and it limited Trainers to a number of Pokémon that they could reasonably be expected to care for adequately. That story also implied that Pokéballs were an imperfect stasis and that certain licenses permitted a higher number of carried Pokémon.
