Since it's the only Psychic/Dark pokemon besides the mythical Hoopa Unbound, I just imagined that Malamar's evolutionary line has two brains, one dark and one psychic, hence the whole upside-down thing. Maybe that'll prove to be a silly fancy, if Gamefreak adds in more, but so far it would preclude any human from being both.

Good thought though, that would definitely make for a terrifying antagonist :)
