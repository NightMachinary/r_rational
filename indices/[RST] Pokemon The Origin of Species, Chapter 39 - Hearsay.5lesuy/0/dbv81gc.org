Very interesting indeed.

Giovanni seemed to know Leaf wasn't planning on publishing as soon as Leaf /thought/ it, even though she didn't say anything. Leaf seemed to think the conversation was oddly like Giovanni could read her thoughts.

Theory: Giovanni isn't psychic himself, but he was getting notifications from someone who was, hidden nearby. He easily has the resources. Probably spoken directly into his mind, with the phone being a red herring to disguise the psychic involvement. Hence the lack of noises from the phone.
