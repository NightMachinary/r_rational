Giovanni wouldn't be able to hear a message spoken into his mind, being Dark and all. The rest of the theory seems plausible. The phone could simply be on silent mode, to make it less plausible for Leaf to notice that he received messages.

Besides that, if it was not necessary to use a phone, it would be far more reasonable to not give any sign that communication took place.
