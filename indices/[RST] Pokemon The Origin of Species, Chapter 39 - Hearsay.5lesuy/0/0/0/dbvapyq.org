Yeah, I suspected this too; psychic readings via the phone.

Listing reporters names would have probably been enough for the psychic to monitor Leaf's reaction and identify which ones (Zoey) she responded to. I wonder if anything will happen to Zoey in the next chapter or two.

I also wonder what would have happened if Leaf started suspecting Giovanni during the meeting.
