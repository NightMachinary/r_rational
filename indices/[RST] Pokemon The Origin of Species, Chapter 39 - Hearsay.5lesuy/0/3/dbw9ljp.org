Yeah, and the fact that he didn't follow up with Leaf about the other reporter looking into it after realizing she wasn't going to publish was a dead giveaway. Forgetting to get that information is not a mistake you'd expect Rational!Giovanni to make, therefore he most likely got the information.

Rather than having a human psychic nearby though, I suspect he was using Mewtwo somehow, possibly in conjunction with the phone. The suspicious chrome ball on his belt is also probably related.
