That seems unnecessary.

First, Mewtwo's range is apparently "over five times" (IIRC) that of a human psychic, so he'd still have to be relatively close, he couldn't just do it from a lab two cities over. Mewtwo's capabilities may actually be significantly higher than that, but the interlude doesn't suggest that Giovanni knows about that if it's true.

Secondly, why use Mewtwo for such a mundane task? I got the feeling Giovanni does this thought-reading thing a lot. He probably has one or more psychics on payroll who literally just follow him around for this exact purpose. Leaf is a fairly minor player in the grand scheme of things. Even if it is possible for Giovanni to get Mewtwo to help him in important discussions, this is unlikely to qualify. It's not even the most important discussion he's going to have TODAY, since Giovanni's going to follow up with Leaf's source. And the reporter Leaf got the story off is more established and experienced, and thus more of a threat.

As for the chrome ball, I'm not sure. There are non-Mewtwo explanations for that though. It's a rare (or Kanto-exclusive) type of Pokeball which Leaf isn't familiar with, or Giovanni, being a rich man, has custom-made Pokeballs to look impressive. Or it's a special type of ball developed by Team Rocket to try to contain the Mewtwo line. Either way, I don't think it actually contains Mewtwo, or is directly related to 2.351.
