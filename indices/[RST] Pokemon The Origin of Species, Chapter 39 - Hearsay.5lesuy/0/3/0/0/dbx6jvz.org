  That seems unnecessary

It is unnecessary. I guess it was more of an argument made based on story tropes and foreshadowing. I wouldn't be surprised at all if I'm wrong.

  Secondly, why use Mewtwo for such a mundane task?
#+end_quote

Practice? Testing/training range, obedience, or something else? Teaching Mewtwo that Giovanni wants to use his powers "for good"? I dunno, there could be a bunch of reasons, and while it's an argument based on tropes and outside knowledge that he's probably a "bad guy", there are plenty of possible rational /justifications/ for him to use Mewtwo for this. Sure, I wouldn't rank it as the highest probability explanation if it were the real world, but it /is/ a story, even if it is a ratfic.

  I got the feeling Giovanni does this thought-reading thing a lot. He probably has one or more psychics on payroll who literally just follow him around for this exact purpose.
#+end_quote

You're probably right. That'd be the efficient way of going about it, though risky if he ever unknowingly tries to use it on a psychic who can notice what's going on.
