Hey everyone, welcome back! Aside from the holiday crazyness, I worked on a lot of other projects this month, so I'm glad this chapter didn't suffer in terms of length as a result, and in fact ended up holding the longest-chapter-yet ribbon. This is the first full Leaf chapter too, and as I've always been less sure about her sections than others, any and all feedback is more welcome than usual. Hope you all enjoy it!

Also, I was super tempted to end the chapter at the second line of dialogue in the final section. Not just because of all the busyness of the holidays, but for the sheer cliffhanger value. Consider me finishing the section here rather than another chapter my new year's gift to all of you :) Happy 2017!
