Although I find Leaf to be the least interesting character of the trio by far (she seems a bit bland) this chapter was quite enjoyable. Started a bit boring, then the tension slowly rose, and kept rising, and then SUDDENLY FREAKING GIOVANNI HIMSELF. That escalated quickly and Leaf's reaction pretty much mirrored the reader's! As for the cell phone, it might Mewtwo shenanigans. Although he could also be dwelling in the Cerulean cave after his escape, based on Misty's mysterious trip. The plot thickens! Now I'm looking forward to Abra silliness and Cascade Badge battles. Thanks for providing us with our monthly dose of OoS :)
