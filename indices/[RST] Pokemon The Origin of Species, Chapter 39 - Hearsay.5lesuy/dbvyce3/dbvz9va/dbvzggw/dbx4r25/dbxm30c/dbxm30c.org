I feel like one of my potential weaknesses as a writer is that Conservation of Detail is less of a thing for me, particularly in a story like this, where I might throw out little details and bits of worldbuilding for no more a reason than a "huh, isn't that interesting" moment.

This definitely leads to chapters that can go on overlong and a plot that feels too slow, but is more enjoyable for those who like the atmosphere and exploration aspect of the story.
