So the fungus is kind of using Giga Drain? I can live with that.

  Hard to enforce, but not if there was a strict ball registration process and the ability to force pokeballs not to work for trainers who try to break it

Agreed. For example, have the Pokeball 'lock' immediately after capture and have it unlock during registration with the Pokedex (or whatever device non-Pokedex trainers use) if and only if the trainer has fewer than 6 unlocked, occupied Pokeballs. The extra Pokemon have to be either deposited or released at a Pokemon Center or other institution. And voila, Pokeball-control; this idea could be used for some neat parallels to real-world gun-control debates.

And naturally, you'd have hackers and cyberterrorists (Super Nerds with grudges?) who would try to break this system, to either unlock their own Pokeballs, or trigger mass lockdowns during an emergency. This becomes an added dimension to each region's cyber-law enforcement, and each department starts commissioning Sliph Co. for Porygon (2 and Z?) specially-coded for this task, and maybe also Bill?

As for Pokeball teleportation... study Abra and other Psychic-types until teleportation is understood well enough to be technologically replicated, as Bill referred to. Miniaturize the technology until it can be integrated into Pokeballs (if it's possible), and have the 'home' location hardcoded to a central depository for each region. At the depository, Pokeballs are sorted by the Trainer No. registered via the Pokedex.

....Maybe I got a bit carried away in places, but that was fun.
