My interest in signals intelligence had me thinking very hard through that Giovanni meeting and made me all too aware of how Leaf's thinking about the wrong things throughout. Her earlier sensitive phone call made in the clear from a room that was provided for her put me in that frame of mind, and Giovanni showing up sealed it. Going toe-to-toe with such a significant figure who's clearly operating at least one meta-level higher... poor Leaf never stood a chance, even without a psychic next door feeding him info.

Helps to have outside knowledge that he's almost certainly villainous, of course. I feel like he needlessly tipped his hand by leaving when he did, but there could always be reasons for it.
