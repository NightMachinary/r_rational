I think EE just revealed what the bard's last stack of cards was, from the Tarot drinking game a couple chapters back.

1. Empress, already revealed to be Cordelia

2. Tower, not named specifically but the card heavily implies ruin and is immediately followed by the assasination attempt on the prince of Brus.

3. Justice, Cat lets the red blade survive her injuries out of a sense of responsibility to shore up weaknesses in the terms.

We know Cordelia is coming and she'll find a massive mess. All 3 cards were bard's, so does this mean Bard wins by the rules of the game, or it's a draw by pattern of 3? And what would a draw mean if it takes a victory for cat, for the terms to stay the course?

Edit: Oh that was a few days ago. Anyway the mirror knight isn't even part of the theory, so he's safe having the sword.
