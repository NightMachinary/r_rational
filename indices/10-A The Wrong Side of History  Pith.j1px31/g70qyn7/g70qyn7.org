Well this arc title is promising.

This seems REALLY tenuous. It strikes me as the sort of "realization" that comes about as a psychological defense mechanism. Ana was starting to realize that Commonplace (however monstrous their methods) had legitimate arguments and reasons to fight while the Principality was worse than she'd believed it to be. Her black and white, "Commonplace bad, Paragon good" worldview was threatened. Just before she's actually forced to adjust her beliefs and admit the world is more complicated than she thought, however, she latches on to a flimsy connection that lets her blame Commonplace for everything wrong in her life, thereby letting her continue to uncritically reject everything that doesn't paint Commonplace as the spawn of Satan.
