I think it's more that she's more inclined to punishing a particular evil that hits closer to home than she is to keep going after the biggest picture stuff.

Saying that it's wrong for her to go after the body scammers instead of the big picture stuff is like saying that it's wrong for people to work in animal rights organisations when there is still much work to be done in human rights (mind you I'm not condemning that at all).
