I feel like that's being a bit uncharitable. She's confused, she's depressed, she's hurt, she doesn't know what to believe, so she's latching on to one thing that is viscerally /real/ to her amidst all these confusing conspiracies and competing "truths." It's a purely emotional reaction; it's not that she doesn't care what's right, it's that she doesn't /know/ what's right but she does know that her life sucks and she wants someone to blame.

I think if you asked her "Do you care about doing the right thing? Do you care about helping people?" her answer would be "Of course!" The issue comes when you ask her what the right thing /is/, when you ask her /how/ she's helping people, because she's sort of having a meltdown right now (understandably so) and so she's refusing to think about things that are emotionally distressing such as "is the group that I've idolized my whole life, who I have committed crimes for, who I have /killed/ for, actually evil?" and "do the terrorist have a point?"

She's letting her emotions lead the way and not really thinking about the "conclusions" they're leading her to and the broader ramifications of her actions. Which, yeah, that's never really a good thing to do and it's easy to criticize her for from the outside, but considering she's a homeless fugitive with a terminal illness who recently lost her superpowers due to being betrayed by the government she idolized, I think it's understandable.
