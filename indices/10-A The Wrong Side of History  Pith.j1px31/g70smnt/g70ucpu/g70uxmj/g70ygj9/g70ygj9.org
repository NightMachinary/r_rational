Hm. I get your point. I agree that Ana's assumption here is far from ironclad. But I think your analogy is possibly not that generous to Ana. There's (maybe?) a difference between an argument that goes "Stalin liked steak, so eating meat makes you like Stalin." and "Commonplace operated a lot of these specific types of shell companies during this time period, they were the biggest players in the black market at the time, and Sapphire was one of these types of organizations." Like, steaks are relatively common, but shell companies fitting a certain criteria might not be.

To be clear, I'm not trying to argue that Ana is right or wrong. I'm just saying that she might be basing her assertion on information that we're not privy to. I think the fact that we weren't given that much information about Sapphire is a questionable authorial choice, and I think we should wait to see where madwhitesnake takes it before coming for a decision. In my opinion, they've done a good job of creating complex characters with complex motivations, and I don't think that they're going to buck that trend anytime soon. I think that whatever path Ana is going to take, is ultimately going to be her own way and not anyone else's, for good or for bad.
