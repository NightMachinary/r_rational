It definitely is. There is zero proof that Commonplace sold the body, her logic is basically "Commonplace uses shell companies and Sapphire Industrial is a shell company, so Commonplace must own Sapphire Industrial!"

  It could be a coincidence. Lots of shifty people used front companies. But the timing made sense. Grace Acworth had become the Pyre Witch, and begun her takeover of the mob a year or two before I'd been struck with Loic's Syndrome. In the chaos after the Treaty of Silence was broken, no one was paying attention to the black market. It was the perfect time to make a quick buck off gullible Humdrums.

  The insight was so obvious, so clear. How had I never seen it before?
