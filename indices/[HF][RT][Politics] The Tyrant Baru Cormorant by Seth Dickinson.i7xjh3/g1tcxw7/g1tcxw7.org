I just finished this third installment recently, and I REALLY enjoyed it, compared to Monster which felt unresolved emotionally to me.

Monster and Tyrant really are very inter-linked.

Tyrant actually advanced on both of the first 2 books in major ways. I felt Baru grew a lot during Tyrant and I had so many moments when I looked back at the past and really marvelled at the growth in so many characters. Solid work for book 3 of 4, and it felt... just right.

I think one critical idea among many I really dug was the layer upon layer of plan - counterplan - countercounterplan. The depth of the planning and tactical thinking was deep, and I felt the latter parts of the story's stuff was well-earned.

We saw the work being done, and not just the "answer" to the circumstances of the universe.

Btw , it's definitely also cool to learn about CTVT too -- a thousands-of-years old transmissable tumor with stable genetics (mutation rate not like other tumors) that passes alive when dogs sex each other. An interesting and really weird thing. The backing research into the feasibility of the universe is fascinating to me, always, similar w/ Blindsight for eg.
