Agreed.

I was excited to go through the two books because it was being touted all around as hard economical/political fiction with an uber-pragmatist protagonist; but it all felt like a sham, because of exactly what you said. We're told things are clever but never really shown why or how. Ultimately, the climax of the book just fell flat and didn't lead to any kind of emotional response; which was sad because it /did/ have a lot of potential to be otherwise.
