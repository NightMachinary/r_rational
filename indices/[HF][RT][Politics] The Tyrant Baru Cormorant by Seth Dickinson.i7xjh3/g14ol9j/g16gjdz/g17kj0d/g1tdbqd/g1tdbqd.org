fwiw, I ended up enjoying Tyrant, while I felt Monster was a bit flatter and less resolved. The author seems to have grown a bunch in skill, IMO -- lots of good prose balancing showing thinking as internal dialogue vs getting the thinking across indirectly in interesting ways and with stories-within-stories and interesting real-world-adjacent callouts to concepts. Then again, IMO Traitor was similar, whereas Tyrant is deeper, so you may not enjoy Tyrant if you didn't like Traitor (book1).
