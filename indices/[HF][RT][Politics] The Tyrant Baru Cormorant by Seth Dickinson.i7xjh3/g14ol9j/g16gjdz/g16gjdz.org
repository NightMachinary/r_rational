I read the first book and I didn't really care for it. Maybe it's because I've been reading too many webnovels lately and expect everything to be a million words long, but the pacing here felt very fast. There were a lot of time-skips, and we're just /told/ what happened in between rather /shown/ it. All of the "competence" and accounting action happened offscreen and between chapters, basically. Also, I didn't really buy any of the relationships in the latter half either due to the fast pacing.
