So the third book in the Baru Cormorant series is out!

A quick summary by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9txzmx/hfrt_the_monster_baru_cormorant/][tvcgrid]] for people who have never read this series:

#+begin_quote
  Baru Cormorant is a young girl from nowhere who that gets economically and culturally invaded by the Empire of Masks, which is a clever, power-hungry, expansionist political entity. She has a mother and two fathers (on her island the families are often large) but to the Masquerade, with its own self-servin philosophy about "social hygiene", such practices of same-sex or poly relationships (and many other practices) are anathema. The Masquerade also has a brewing scientific culture, with new advances in chemistry leading to better sanitation, longer life times, but also crueler implements of war and control. Baru decides to fight back in a subversive way -- to gain power from within the Masquerade, a meritocratic republic, so that she can help her family and her island.

  Baru's story will see her using economics and general reasoning to develop offensive and defensive strategies, in a bid to gain power and achieve her goals.

This is competence porn with political scheming upon economic scheming upon layered scheming with a heavy glob of emotions to really put it all together to get the reader invested in the story.

At it's core, this is a story about the systems of a civilization and one woman's mission to destroy an empire by hitting it where it hurts, their infrastructure.

Also, here's a review of the story by [[https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/guest-post-seth-dickinson-on-building-a-better-evil-overlord/][Joel Cunningham]] which does a much better job of shilling and explaining the story than I ever could do.
