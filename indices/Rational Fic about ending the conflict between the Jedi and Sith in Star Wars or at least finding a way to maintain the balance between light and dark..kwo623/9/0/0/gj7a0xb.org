Probably wouldn't disagree with this, but all the criticism here didn't really put me off and I skipped the sex scenes so note this may be taste specific.

The biggest appeal of this to me was the "reasonableness". I really enjoy it when characters faults don't make them do stupid things which just aggravate a situation which could be solved nicely, which this story served that taste perfectly. To others this could be the definition of "bland" though lol.
