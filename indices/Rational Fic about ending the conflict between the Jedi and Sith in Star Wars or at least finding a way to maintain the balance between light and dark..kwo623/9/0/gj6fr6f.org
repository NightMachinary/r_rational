I'd have to anti-rec this one. I got through Rumors/Gossip but the characterization of everyone here is just horrid. Sure it's the New Trilogy so you don't have a lot to start with, but things like Flinn being a slave-soldier since birth and the trauma of his training he forgives Kylo in two chapters.

Not to mention the force abilities being OP as hell constantly teleporting across the Galaxy and never being utilized properly.

Again I realize this is Star Wars, but the politics of running a Galactic Empire is never, difficult. Sure it takes effort but everything just seems to work and everyone is happy.

Finally the nail in the coffin at least for me, is the fact that Kylo immediately settles into the 'Grey' Force position without much effort, and Ray never deals with being tempted to it. No discussion is had on the moralities of either side except superficially, they are both just in the middle and sit their right from the start.

Also, the sex scenes. Fine I guess, but not the most romantic I've ready nor the most steamy. Which sums all this up, its a bowl of bland oatmeal.
