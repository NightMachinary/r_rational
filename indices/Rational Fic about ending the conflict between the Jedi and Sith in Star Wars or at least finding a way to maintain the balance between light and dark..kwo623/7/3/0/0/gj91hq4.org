While I agree in general with all of this and saying there's no clear reason why the Republic should be better than the Empire seems absurd - even going by canon movies alone (admittedly all the xenophobia and slavery stuff is only covered in other stuff) - I don't think it's correct to say that the Light-side Jedi could not /possibly/ conceive genocide. They can think, calmly, rationally, and peacefully, that for the greater good, painful as it is, some might have to die. They don't have much problem fighting, killing and waging war. But it would take the right setting for them to do that. Though for example, it's not genocide, but we see them go along pretty easily with the whole clone army thing, which is monstrous by our standards (but then again, that's probably more of an oversight in the writing).
