Interesting, the SI mentions the [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Je%27daii_Order][Je'daii Order]], which apparently is an ancient version of Jedi that emphasized balance. Looks like a Canon version of what [[/u/jacky986]] is looking for. Not rational, but yeah.

  The Je'daii Order was an ancient organization unified by its belief and observance of the Force on the planet Tython, in the galaxy's Deep Core. Focusing on maintaining a balance in the Force, a state at which Tython was itself hospitable, the Je'daii saw the Force as three aspects of a whole; the Ashla (Light), the Bogan (Dark), and the Bendu (balance). They saw this duality in the Force represented in the night sky of Tython in the form of two natural satellites; one bathed in light, the Ashla, another shrouded in darkness, the Bogan. In keeping with their view of balance, Je'daii who fell too far to either the light or dark were exiled to the opposite moon to meditate until they returned to balance.
