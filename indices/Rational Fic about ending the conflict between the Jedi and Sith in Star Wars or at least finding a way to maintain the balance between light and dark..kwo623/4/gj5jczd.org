There's a NSFW SI fanfic over on QQ [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/touch-the-lekku-star-wars-si.7919/][Touch the Lekku]] which has an interesting take on the light / dark sides.

The dark side is more about strong emotions. If you let yourself be swallowed by emotions amplified by The Force (especially anger / hate) then you can turn into evil. If you can draw from the light and the dark without giving yourself over to them, then you can be pretty strong and not evil. I'm probably not doing the story justice in explaining it...
