I've seen an interesting point about the skewed balance in favor of the Dark Side as a direct consequence of the Jedi doctrine:

The Jedi are asked to get rid of most if not all of their emotions. Where does all go, all this fear, anger, love, passion? In the Force.

The Force, from which the Sith extract their power through fear, anger, love, passion.

Through the Force, the Jedi /fed the Sith./ A galaxy-spanning Order of Jedi funneled power to a handful of hidden Sith for centuries.

Until the Jedi were wiped out, and then the Sith starved and lost their power in twenty years. Because honestly, the way Darths Vader and Sidious died did /not/ scream "overpowered sorcerers".
