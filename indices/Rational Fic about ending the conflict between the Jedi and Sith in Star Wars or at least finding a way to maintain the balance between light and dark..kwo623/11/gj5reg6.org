If I recall correctly the Lore behind the Dark/Light balance is that they both were "supposed" to be eradicated when the Vador killed Palpatine (Bringing balance to the force). The force users who came after would have been neither Jedi nor Sith but an average of both that wouldn't drag the universe into needless wars to maintain the constant swinging seesaw that is the force balancing itself out.\\
This is the biggest reason to find balance. The star wars universe is defined by destiny/fate, (it actually defined by telekinesis and cool laser swords but ignore this) people who use the force and those who are around them are guided by it to fulfill a destiny pre-ordained by the force. the extent to which this limits their free will is debatable but that is another argument for getting rid of the dark/light dichotomy that drives force users to kill each other in a never-ending turf war over the fate of the galaxy.

This video goes over it pretty well and has a few follow-up videos that go over this pretty well. It's very long but if you just want to skip to the parts relevant to this argument then skip to about an hour and a half in.

TLDR: Constant war and undermining of free will.
