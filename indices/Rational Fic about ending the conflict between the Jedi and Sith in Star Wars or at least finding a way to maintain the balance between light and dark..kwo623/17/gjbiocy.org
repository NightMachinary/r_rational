I feel that the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4121383/chapters/9290023][Trial of Darth Vader]] successfully paints the picture of the choices the Empire takes and why these choices might have been chosen correctly.

It is set after the events of the original trilogy, so it is not about ending the conflict for good but rather a reconciliation between the warring parties.
