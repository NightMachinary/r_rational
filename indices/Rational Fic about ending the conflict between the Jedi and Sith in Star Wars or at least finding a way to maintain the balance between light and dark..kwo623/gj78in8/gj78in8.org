The whole “He will restore balance to the Force” line was clearly ominous foreshadowing that between Episodes III and IV, thanks to Anakin Skywalker, there existed exactly two Jedi and two Sith. Expanded Universe fans will argue, but I would bet $100 that this is what was in Lucas's head when he wrote that line for Ep I.

Also, Eliezer wrote a short alternate fic of the Darth Plagueis conversation where Palpatine makes a convincing case that there is no such thing as the light side of the Force. The Force is a combination of telekinetic powers and an evil emotional alignment. “Light Side” Force users access the former while purging emotions to avoid the latter. But induce emotion and a temptation for more power and a dude who woke up a flawed but noble Jedi will slaughter a temple full of Kindergarteners before he goes to bed.
