Oh, I didn't mean the Jedi pushed emotions to the Sith (EDIT: Ah, rereading your reply, I don't think you implied that either...); I meant the Jedi fed the Force with the exact kind of power the Sith needed from the Force, in outrageous quantities.

In this scenario, I don't actually think the Jedi nor the Sith knew what was happening. The Jedi probably just thought they were doing "routine cleansing" of the spirit, and the Sith just rejoiced that the Force seemed so in tune with the needs of the Dark Side. The Force in all of this is just a repository of power, with no particular "side".
