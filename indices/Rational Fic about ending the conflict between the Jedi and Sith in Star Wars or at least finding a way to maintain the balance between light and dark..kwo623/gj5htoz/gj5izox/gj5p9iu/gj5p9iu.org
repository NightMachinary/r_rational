That's the Potentium interpretation, not Jedi orthodoxy.

Basically, the Jedi say the Force has a Light and a Dark side, and through suppressing your emotions you avoid the Dark Side.

The Potentium says the Force is the Force, it has no sides, and the Force is inherently good. The Dark Side exists /within the individual/, and is still to be avoided, but not at the cost of total self-annihilation.

Take, for instance, Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi would say the he fell to the Dark Side only partially by choice; once it had its hooks in him, the Dark Side corrupted him, made him a worse person. The Potentium would say Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side because he was a bitter, spiteful prick with anger issues and no self-control. The Force didn't do that to him, he did that to himself and misused the Force horribly along the way.
