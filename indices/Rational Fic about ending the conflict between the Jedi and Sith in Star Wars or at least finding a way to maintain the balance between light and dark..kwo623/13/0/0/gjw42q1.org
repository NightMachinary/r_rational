This, as many of you probably already realized, create a situation in which the "light", as represented by the Jedi, and the "dark", as represented by the Sith, are two failed ideologies and products that each adhere to an ideal about the human mind and behavior, and fail spectacularly in it's execution.\\
The Jedi fail to realize the wisdom and maturity comes not from avoiding your issues, but confronting and solving them, and that a truly calm man is not one without fears, worries and wants, but one who can safely deal with them and live in happiness. The Jedi failed to understand that fear and hatred are two emotions that comes from places of insecurity, and a good way to deal with them is to teach others compassion and love, rather then Apathy.

The Sith, on their side, failed to realize the undermining side of their ideology. While you can form a Cult who could work properly in unison around the failed model of light the Jedi have, you cannot form a proper, working hierarchy based on a hedonistic, individualistic ideology and expect it to work in the long run.\\
The Sith had to adopt in many ways the Jedi model to actually work, which not only undermined their entire ideology without them realizing, but also spelled their own doom.

Which brings me back to the topic of proper unity and balance:
