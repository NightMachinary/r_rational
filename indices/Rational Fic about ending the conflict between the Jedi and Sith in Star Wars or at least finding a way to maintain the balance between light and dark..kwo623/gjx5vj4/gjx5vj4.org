Something interesting from canon is [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Vectivus]] a sith who due to a preexisting rigid moral code and a policy of prudent, long term planning used his power carefully and never fell into bad habits such as attempting galactic domination, random acts of mass destruction, attempting to wipe out the jedi or so on. He eventually died in bed after a happy and very long life surrounded by friends and family, not having made any significant impact on history. I think it's interesting that the Sith do not have to be evil but rather it seems to be a result of tendancies and culture
