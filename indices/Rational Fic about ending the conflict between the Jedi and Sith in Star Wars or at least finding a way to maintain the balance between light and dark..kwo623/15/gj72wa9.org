My idea of it is that the force is a sort of echo/ psychic field that is imprinted upon by its users. There are inherently some destructive imprints, but trying to destroy them actively is itself a destructive process. I feel like the way to destroy the dark side would be to let it fade naturally, or to start over with a blank slate in a galaxy where force users have never been. There is some indication that any plan to delete the memory of the force would cause some sort of wound. Maybe there is a way to cut off the galaxy from the force.

Whether that's destirable permanently is a difficult question, but I would maintain that doing so temporarily, if it results in the history of the force getting reset, may be desirable.
