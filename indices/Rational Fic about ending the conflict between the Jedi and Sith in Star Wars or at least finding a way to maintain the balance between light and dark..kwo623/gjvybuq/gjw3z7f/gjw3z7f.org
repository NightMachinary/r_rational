So now, after laying down these issues, I will present my case:

The ideal of a calm and rational Jedi is inherently wrong, as the Jedi were never calm and collected. They simply avoided any and all emotional tasks and tried to make themselves into cold machines while claiming to be the light hearted, good guys. Mace Windu is a good example of what happens when you don't teach someone how to properly vent anger and how to conduct himself, as well as Anakin Skywalker.

Spoiler Corner:

>!In the Darth Plagueis novel, an interesting case study is shown with Palpatine.\\
Palpatine was strong in the force since his birth, but had no real knowledge of it. However, it still affected his life, and his relationship with his family. Opting not to send him to the Jedi temple to receive proper training, they suppressed these powers in him, limited him, and eventually placed so much stress on the young man, without actually teaching him how to properly use his powers or to vent his anger, that he ended up murdering his entire family.\\
This is why the existence of an order like the Jedi order and their work are so important, by letting individuals simply discover these powers on their own and growing up without the proper guidance, they can grow up emotionally immature and become people like Palpatine, who view in part the non force sensitive as insects and non dark side force sensitives as fools, going on with his life thinking of himself as a god.

The teaching of Plagueis himself certainly did not help, as he taught Palpatine to revel in this emotional immaturity, to use his intellectual superiority and the force to lord over others and grant all his childish whims.\\
The Dark side certainly loves it's intellectual superiority, and all forms of superiority in general, having no qualms about pretending to feel certain emotions, lying to itself and others and being a cold, manipulative schemer while it's basic ideology stands in complete contrast. The Dark side is very much so hypocritical, at least in the way the Sith interpreted it. To being with, the galaxy is not big enough for two, true Sith Lords working together, as the poor execution of the rule of two in the late republic showed, as each one of them only looks for his own emotional liberation and superiority at any and all cost!<
