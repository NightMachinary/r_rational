Obi Wan, by watching over Luke since birth and guarding him, gave Luke the chance to experience perfectly normal life up until his later adolescence, allowing Luke the gain the proper experience and the wide emotional range of a normal human being.\\
Introducing him to the force so late in the game, as late as Palpatine was in his days, but with Kenobi acting as a guardian who managed to prevent any accidents to happen which could have alienated Luke and ruined his experience, allowed Luke to grow into a proper adult, UNLIKE Palpatine.

Later on, as he taught him briefly the ways of the force, he never told him to shun away his emotions, despite the old and wise Jedi understanding now well the wide range of emotions there is to feel and their danger.\\
Luke's journey, from there on, was filled with both emotional highs and lows, giving him a taste to the more extreme realms of their wide variety.\\
In his trainings with Yoda, he learned of the dangers of wild and uncontrolled emotions, but not through lectures, rather through personal experience. Through his own frustration, through his visits to the dark side cave, and ultimately, when his emotional recklessness betrayed him, costing him his hand, as well as the emotional shock resulting in his confrontation with Vader, showed him how dangerous it was to let himself be controlled by his own emotions and not adhering to his senses.

And finally, we have the final duel.
