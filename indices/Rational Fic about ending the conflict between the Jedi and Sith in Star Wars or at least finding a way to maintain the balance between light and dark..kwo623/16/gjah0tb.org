It's not quite what you mean but here's [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/using-the-force-made-easy.62952/]] Basically a Jedi in training realizes he's probably going to flunk out to the Agricorps but decides instead to make his own way in the galaxy, a few years later he starts making a series of irreverent internet tutorials on force-use partially out of spite. Other than the casualness a big difference between his teaching and the mainstream Jedi is not actually trying to make the darkside taboo but rather just risky, impractical and only occasionally useful in niche use. I rather like it.
