You know what I never understood? How is the entire galaxy so technologically behind? Has no one reached an AI singularity? Why has no one built an actual dyson sphere? Clearly they could build a planet to absorb a star's power and shoot it out. But no one built a Dyson sphere? Why even build a Death Star? Just launch asteroids at planets like a normal space faring civilization. Technically we could do it by just adjusting the degree of an asteroid slightly.

Finally, why is anyone using blasters? They might have infinite charge or whatever but they are slow as hell. People can literally see them coming and dodge. They're like spells from a wizard's wand and they're so slow Jedi can catch and hold them meanwhile a gun could reach a target before they realize they're dead. Honestly I just think the world building, while fanciful, isn't fully explained or thought out enough.
