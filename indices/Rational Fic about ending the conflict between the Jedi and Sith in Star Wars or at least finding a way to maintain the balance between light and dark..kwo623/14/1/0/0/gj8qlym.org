I'm not talking about 100%, maybe 85-90% or maybe 75%. It doesn't have to be perfect but I would prefer that they be more proactive in stopping the Sith that way they can at least reduce the lost of life that result because of these conflicts. Granted it would risk infecting them with agendas and the PT is evidence that doing so is a bad idea, but if they got out more they would be able to improve public relations with the galactic citizens who are mostly apathetic towards the whole Jedi-Sith wars until it's too late.
