TBF the Jedi were operating after a millennia of peace in which there was no war or Sith to speak of.

They fucked up badly with Palpatine but considering that the Sith always fall Id say they have a pretty good track record.

The sheer size of the galaxy makes it impossible to police everything. Expecting the Jedi to be able to defuse the Sith 100% is generally unrealistic given how vast the galaxy. Not to mention that being proactive risks infecting the Jedi with agendas and biases. In order to be effective the Jedi have to be closed off.

Which is why they put so much effort in collecting force sensitives as a preventative measure.

The Jedi are passive and reactive. But it's counterbalanced by the fact that the Sith are unrestrained and self destructive.
