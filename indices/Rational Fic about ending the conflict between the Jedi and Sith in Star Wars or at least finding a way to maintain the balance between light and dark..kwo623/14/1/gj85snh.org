Okay but, when it comes to maintaining balance in the force the Jedi are very bad at their job. The fact of the matter is that the Jedi's reactive stance has allowed the Sith to grow and plot right under their noses and by the time the Jedi the Sith will have killed hundreds if not thousands of people and/or they are two powerful for the Jedi to handle which results in a purge of Jedi and the Sith takin over the galaxy. I suppose it is logical to assume that trying to destroy the force is a bad idea, but fact of the matter is is that the Jedi's withdrawn nature and reactive stance has led to the death and suffering of thousands of people across of the galaxy. Now if ending the conflict between the Sith and Jedi is impossible then at least the Jedi should fight smarter and take a more proactive stance against the Sith.
