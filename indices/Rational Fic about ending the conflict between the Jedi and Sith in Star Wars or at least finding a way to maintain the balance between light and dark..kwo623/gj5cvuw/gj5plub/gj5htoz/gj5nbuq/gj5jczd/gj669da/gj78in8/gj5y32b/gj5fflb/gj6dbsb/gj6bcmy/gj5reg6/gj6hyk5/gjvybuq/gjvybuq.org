So.

As some have pointed out, Lucas never saw the balance as having a balance between light and dark. Rather, The light side being the balance and the dark being the chaos and disruption of it. My issue with it, of course, is the themes his movies explore, especially the prequels, as well as the simple question: balance what?\\
if you wish to create a balance, common sense and the definition of the word dictate that you equal two different things, or more. usually they are opposites. So if the light is just another word for balance, and the dark side is merely a chaotic, outside force to disrupt it, then what is being balanced?\\
later on, in the prequels, we saw more of the Jedi mantra and codes, and we saw that they act in ways of heavily suppressing the emotions of their members to give them control. This is then countered by the Sith, who revel in emotional turmoil and chaos.\\
This gave rise to the fan consensus, which was a heavy point of focus in the old legends, that the light side of the force is the calm side, and the dark side the emotional one.\\
In which case, the Jedi takes the light side to it's absolute extreme, banning confusing emotional maturity and level headedness with stoic apathy, suppressing their emotions and indoctrinating their younglings that as the dark side thrives in emotions, they must be wary of their emotions, and seal them away. Or as Yoda puts it: "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering." Of course this quote can be used differently, but it does show how rather then teach how to confront your faults and your emotions, the Jedi instead makes them the enemy.\\
On the other hand, the Sith takes the dark side of the force, who's source is in emotions, to it's absolute extreme. They believe that one must act from the most inner places of emotions and revel in every single act. Most of the time, however, the only emotions that matter are fear and hatred. Because the Sith has a severe issue, and it's their lust for power. Due to acting out of their basic emotions and desires, each Sith is a lone wolf, one that try and grab as much power as they can and wish for, which resulted in far too many civil wars and purges amongst the Sith. Which led to a weird, and convoluted system in which masters inspire specifically fear in their apprentices to control them, using their wild emotions to restrict them, which should, in theory, stand in stark contrast to the code of the Sith, in which your emotions should liberate you. Palpatine and Anakin are a perfect example for that. Palpatine has been scheming and acting all calm and collected, being busy with politics and running an empire, that he very much so became like the Jedi, a Stoic, overly powerful Bureaucrat. And Anakin, on his side, once turning into his emotions was betrayed, destroyed, lost everything he had, and entered into a long period in which he was manipulated and emotionally devastated, being almost a machine. Tolkien once claimed that evil plant it's own seeds of destruction, and the Sith ideology of freedom of emotions while at the same time being a selfish ideology that supports the limiting of other's freedom of emotions ruined it from the beginning.
