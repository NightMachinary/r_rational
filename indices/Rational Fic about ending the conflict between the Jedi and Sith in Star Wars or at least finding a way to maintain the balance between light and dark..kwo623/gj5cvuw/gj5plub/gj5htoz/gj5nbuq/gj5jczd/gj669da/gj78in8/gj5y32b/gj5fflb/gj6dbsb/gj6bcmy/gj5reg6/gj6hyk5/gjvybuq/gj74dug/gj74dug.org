Frankly there isn't. The Jedi/Sith is alot more complicated than it initially seems

The Light side of the Force represents the natural order of the universe. That is, life existing as it should in relationship to other life. Because the Force is a metaphysical field of existence which exists in all life. Life exists with the living force, and when it dies it returns to the Cosmic force in a feedback loop

If the Force is a living organism made up of every organism, than the Dark side is a cancer.

Its why the 'Jedi are the same as the Sith' argument is such bullshit. The Jedi as a system exist to defuse the latent danger present in the existence of force sensitives. Which is that force sensitives possess an absurd amount of power. Not just the visible telekinesis but an ability to see the web of relationships and causality that allows them to effect the world to their desire.

There a reactive force, not a proactive force. The Jedi are the white blood cells who uphold peace using violence for the sake of de-escalation not for the sake of personal gain

Furthermore the force isn't an ability you can fine tune to manipulate its mechanics. The abilities of the Jedi and Sith are tied more to intent, desire and understanding. Its spiritual not utilitarian.

This is why force lightning and force choke belong to the Dark side even if they seem arbitrary. Not because electricity is evil because they are both techniques born solely with the intention of inflicting abuse on another sentient and emerge from the desire to do so. Its about the application, not the actual mechanism itself. Its also why a Jedi can't use Sith magic because to use Sith abilities requires Sith intentions to do so.

Its also why the Sith always have to be stopped. Because the Darkside is a cancer born when sapient life wields the force to try and impose its will on reality. But as stated earlier it works by a feedback loop. The Sith starts out wanting to change the world and in doing so becomes more and more addicted to his own power inevitably devouring others and wreaking havoc in order to fuel it. The bigger the tumor grow the more it consumes.

The Sith desire dominion over nature. The Force is all about the intrinsic relationship between living things and their constraints. So as a result the Sith desperately want to escape from those bonds and put themselves somehow above nature. Which leads to all their works and endeavors always culminating in destruction. The Lightside is the understanding that all things have to exist in harmony and that no one is an island untethered from anything else.

Ultimately there isn't a solution to the problem. The Force is a setting specific thing which is intrinsic to life in Star Wars, it can't be removed without killing everyone. Meaning there will always be force sensitives, the only solution is the Jedi which exist to defuse the threat they pose.
