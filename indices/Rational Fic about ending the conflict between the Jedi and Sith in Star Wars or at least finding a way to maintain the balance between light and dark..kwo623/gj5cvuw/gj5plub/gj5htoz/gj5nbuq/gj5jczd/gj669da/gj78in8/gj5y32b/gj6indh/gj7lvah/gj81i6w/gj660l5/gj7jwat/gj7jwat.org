  This, and also it's never entirely clear why the Republic is inherently better than the Galactic Empire.

The Republic had its problems, but it was never as bad as the Empire. The Empire

- destroyed an inhabited planet to teach others not to step out of line, and had no qualms about doing it again,
- enslaved entire races to build its war machines,
- inundated its citizens with propaganda that non-human aliens were inferior, that species like the wookies and mon calamari were "non-sentient" and to be used as slave labour,
- carried out genocides against alien races,
- had its government and military controlled by xenophobes,
- brutally crushed any and all form of dissent.

That the Empire evil is is a central theme in Star Wars. It's not even a secret that Lucas based the Empire on Nazis. They're the bad guys.

  I think a truly rationalist fiction would need to have its hero notice that the so-called "Light" Jedi are just as prone to genocide as the "Dark" Sith they are purportedly opposing,

Except then they wouldn't be Light-side. The light side was aligned with calmness, peace, and passiveness, and was used only for knowledge and defense.

The Republic was corrupted by a Sith. Before that it was actually a pretty good form of government. I'm not sure where you get the whole "they carried out coup d'etats and then disappeared" idea, but I'm fairly sure that never happened the way you described.

Again, the Jedi weren't without flaws. But one of their central tenets was that they didn't have the right to rule others simply because they were Jedi, that they were servants of the Force, something greater than themselves. The Sith were users of the Force, in service to themselves, and that always turned out badly (for others especially). It's arguably this difference in mentality that separates the light side and the dark.
