You might want something more like /The Price of the Stars/ by Debra Doyle & James D. Macdonald. I.e. something less good-vs-evil and more space-wizards A do things different than space-wizards B (and are good because they're the ones on our side).

(I can't recall any thing that would be suitable here with a similar premise though)
