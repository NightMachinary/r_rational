In which, at long last, Luke, filled with rightful fury, almost completely in the dark side, managed to use it to defeat his hated and detested father, crippling him even more and bringing him down. And then, as the voice of temptation whispers in his ears to kill him, end it once and for all, to accept the dark side and it's powers he found inside of him, Luke decided to reject them.

After experiencing the wide range of emotions, Luke managed to bring Balance to the force by embracing his emotions as they are, and acting out of both love, and rational level headedness, decided not to kill his father, and asking him to join him.

This act, which fully embrace both the dark side and the light side of the force as they are laid down through the Jedi and Sith code, led him to his victory, as Palpatine, trying to deny this young, successful mirror of himself from his emotional maturity and freedom, lashes out against him and by doing so betray the dark side, as he now tried to take away Luke's emotions, as he did with so many others. And again, with the ironic laugh of fate, and evil planting it's own seed of destruction, the emotional immaturity and the cage of pain and fear Palpatine locked Anakin in, in direct contrast to the commandments of the dark side, came back at him in full force, as through Luke, Anakin found his salvation and peace, and attacked Palpatine, killing him.
