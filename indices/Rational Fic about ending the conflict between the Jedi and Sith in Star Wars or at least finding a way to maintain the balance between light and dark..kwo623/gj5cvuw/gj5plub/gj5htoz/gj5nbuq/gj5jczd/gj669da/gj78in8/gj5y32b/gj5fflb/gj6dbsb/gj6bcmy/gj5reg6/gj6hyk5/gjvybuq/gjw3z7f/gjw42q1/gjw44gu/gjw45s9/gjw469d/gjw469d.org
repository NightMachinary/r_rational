This is why, in my opinion, there is balance in the force after Luke wins. Luke is not a real Jedi by the end of episode 6, neither is he a Sith. He is a man who, knowingly or unknowingly, fully accepted the wide breath of both the dark and light side as they are, without conforming to extreme ideologies.

This is, as I see it, the rational end for this giant mess.

Both sides need to let go of their extreme views and understand their own folly, and allow themselves to learn from each other.

There is power in being one with your emotions and acting through them, and the Sith would say, but there is also power in serenity and level headedness.

If only they understood that both things go surprisingly well together, and that without the other they are just a broken mess, the galaxy would have probably been a far better place.
