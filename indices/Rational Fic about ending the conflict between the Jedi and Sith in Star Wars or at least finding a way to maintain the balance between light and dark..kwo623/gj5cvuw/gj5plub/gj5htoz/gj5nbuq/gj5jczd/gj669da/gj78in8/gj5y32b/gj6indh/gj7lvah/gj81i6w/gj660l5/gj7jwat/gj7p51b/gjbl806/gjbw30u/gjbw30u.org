It's not just "destroying planets"; it's an unprovoked attack on neutral civilians. Even if they suspected the Alderaani government had Rebel sympathies, and even if we discount that they were already guilty of enough evil actions that the Rebels were morally justified in their, y'know, rebellion (let's not forget that the very way the Empire came to power was by sparking a war, enacting a coup, subverting a democracy, and genociding an entire religious minority)... even giving them all that, they /still/ killed a bunch of their own citizens who had done nothing wrong to them or posed no danger.
