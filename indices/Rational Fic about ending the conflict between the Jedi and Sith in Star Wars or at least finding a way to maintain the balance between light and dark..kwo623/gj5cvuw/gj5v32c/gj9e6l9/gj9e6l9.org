I mean in the Star Wars Universe it is pretty clear that dark is evil. The darkside users are literally going around torturing people while laughing manicly and blowing up planets. That's pretty evil.

That doesn't necessarilly mean the light side is good. Honestly one could make a good case in universe that both sides are bad but the dark side is clearly worse. And if the force really is all about balance (which I suppose is a nice way of saying it demands a certain amount of planets blown up and people tortured to death) then the obvious conclusion of a stereotypical rational protagonist would be that the force is itself the enemy that needs to be defeated or at least modified.
