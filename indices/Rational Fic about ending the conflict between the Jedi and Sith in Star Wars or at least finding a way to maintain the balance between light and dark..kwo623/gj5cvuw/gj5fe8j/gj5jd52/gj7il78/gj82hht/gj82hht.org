I get the comparison, but be aware that the Italian Mafia has been quite a bit more violent than that at times. It has now been forced to keep a low profile because had it kept up the insane levels of violence it demonstrated in the '90s, even the relative tolerance of the state and the local population towards its existence would have eventually run dry.
