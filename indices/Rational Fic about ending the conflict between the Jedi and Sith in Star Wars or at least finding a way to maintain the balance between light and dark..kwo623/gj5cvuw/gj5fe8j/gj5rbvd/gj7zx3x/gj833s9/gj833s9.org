The Force seems to be an entity that, for those who manifest it, will end up amplifying their negative emotions (really, emotions at all: Anakin is undone also by love, after all) to unhealthy degree. So basically if you're born a Force sensitive you're shit out of luck and a therapist's nightmare; you either have to go full suppression, the Jedi's way, or become a psycho murderous Sith. I think this is also one of the main issues with the new sequels, by the way. Instead of exploring more in depth this interesting mechanic, which takes "rationality vs. emotion" to the extreme, it just went for the Force being an awesome inspiring motivational empowering something that Everyone Can Have And That's Okay. Utterly toothless and uninteresting, whereas the old approach to it at least gave a glimpse of a far more difficult reality to deal with.
