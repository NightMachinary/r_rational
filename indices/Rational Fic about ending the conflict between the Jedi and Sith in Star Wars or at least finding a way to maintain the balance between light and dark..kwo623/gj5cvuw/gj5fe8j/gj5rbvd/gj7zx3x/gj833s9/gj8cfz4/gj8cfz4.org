I guess what I'm trying to say is that each Jedi in training NEEDS to meet and train with each Sith Lord to understand and overcome those feelings in order to emerge from the other side of the experience for the better.

The movies don't do this concept full justice --- they explore it initially in the first part of the trilogies --- but don't follow through with it.

So what I'd like to see in an Inside Out/Star Wars Rationalist fiction is a Jedi like HPMOR's Dumbledore who recognizes through prophecy that the Sith are necessary --- and splinters them into numerous parts to expand the journey of the Jedi to further the emotional/rational exploration.
