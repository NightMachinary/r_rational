Interesting side point --- Yudkowski posted his thoughts on the Pixar movie Inside Out which is about (spoilers: the value of negative feelings.)

He analyzed the rational components closely, but I see correlates here.

Perhaps a ratfic of light/dark balance is one which notes the need to have multiple Sith lords somehow, each representing different dark feelings, in order to maintain a better balance and then each dark faction is pitted against each other by the Light who in turn vies for influence over teenage protagonist.

Then just like Star Wars and Inside Out, the main lesson becomes --- as a teenager--- do you give in to rage, anger, depression, disgust, lust, etc. hormonal impulses or do you follow the peaceful and rational way of the Force?

Edit: hm, I realized that my “lesson” actually undoes the storyline. Do you as a teenage recognize the importance of of rage, depression, disgust, lust, etc., as NECESSARY portions of your journey to achieving enlightenment and following a more peaceful path and the rational way of the Force?
