  There are three different and mutually exclusive views of the Force in Star Wars canon. (If you quibble the word 'canon' with me, or start bring up Legends or Disney or whatever, I will be angry. By 'Star Wars canon', I mean officially licensed and published Star Wars products.) I'm going to call these Jedi Orthodoxy, Manichaeism, and Deconstruction.

  Orthodoxy: The Force is unitary, and it is somehow connected with life. It binds the universe together, it flows strongly in some people or places, and it is inherently benevolent. Particularly wise or spiritual people can sense its currents and draw upon its power. However, there are also some evil people who can twist or pervert the Force, wielding it to their ends and against its own will. This creates the Dark Side. There is no such thing as 'the Light Side': there is only the Force, which is good. Orthodoxy is the viewpoint you get in all the films: this is why 'bring balance to the Force' means 'destroy the Dark Side', and it's why the phrase 'Light Side' is never mentioned in the films.

  Manichaeism: The Force is still connected with life and with holding the universe together, but the Force as a whole is in some sense amoral. The Force is divided into a Light Side and Dark Side, which constantly push and pull each other. People can tap into or serve either one of these sides, but never both. The Force is characterised by a constant struggle between good and evil, but neither Light or Dark can ever be eradicated. They are like yin and yang, rather, constantly moderating each other in this eternal dance. This viewpoint is very common in EU works. Manichaeism is operative in comic titles like Jedi vs. Sith, for instance, or in KotOR's alignment system. There is Light, there is Dark, they constantly fight each other, neither can ever win, pick one.

  Deconstruction: This is the rarest view, and is a conscious response to and criticism of the above two. Deconstruction often denies that there is any Force/Dark or Light/Dark distinction to make at all, and tends to question all conventional dogma. It might question whether the Force is needed for life, or if using - or following the will of - the Force is at all meritorious. It might liken the Force to a hostile parasite on life. Alternatively, it might still embrace the Force, but suggest that the Force is somehow beyond all of our categories or understandings. The main feature of Deconstruction is the suggestion that everything you thought you knew was wrong. It mostly appears in works like KotOR II or Traitor.

  When I have to interpret the Force in Star Wars, I find it can be useful to start by trying to work out which of these perspectives is in play. George Lucas is mostly Orthodox. (Though you still get weird things, like The Ones, which are clearly Manichaean.) The Manichaean view seems to be the most intuitive for a lot of people: it's surprising how many people reacted to the 'bring balance to the Force' prophecy with 'well duh it means killing all the Jedi'. Figuring out the underlying assumptions of a particular piece of Star Wars media is important so that we can understand what the Force is doing in it.

I tend towards the Orthodoxy position myself. There is no light side. There is only the force (which is defined as balance and who the Jedi serve) and the dark side (which is defined as creating an imbalance through selfish acts and deeds).

Or, as Yoda put it:

  YODA: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.

  LUKE: What's in there?

  YODA: Only what you take with you.

At the same time, I think there's room for this to be an in-universe debate. We can have a jedi orthodoxy, while at the same time Manichaeic heretics. I can see how Manichaeism could be a very effective tool to corrupt jedi.
