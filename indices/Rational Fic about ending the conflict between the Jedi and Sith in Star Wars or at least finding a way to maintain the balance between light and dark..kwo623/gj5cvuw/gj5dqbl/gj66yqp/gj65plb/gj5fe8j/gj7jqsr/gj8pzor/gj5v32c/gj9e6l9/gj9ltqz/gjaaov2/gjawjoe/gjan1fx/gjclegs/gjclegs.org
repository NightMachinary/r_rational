Your position is actually that the demonstration of your nukes was good for maintaining peace in the post-war world and as such was beneficial for humanity in avoiding nuclear exchange.

The nukes were not required for peace, and Japan wanted to accept peace before the nukes just not unconditional surrender. In the end the same agreement (Japan would technically unconditionally surrender but the Emperor would stay) could have been made without the nukes, and was in the process of being made.
