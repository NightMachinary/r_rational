Each Sith faction gets their own planet built like a theme park for going all-in on one emotional extreme, but in a rational and healthy way. The Temple of Malice is a BDSM club, the Temple of Futility creates art to be shipped to the Temple of Fury as target practice. The Temple of Hate is serene and austere, with plentiful medical equipment so initiates can see how deranged they've driven themselves by simple contemplation. A Jedi must pass through each Temple, earnestly partake of their emotional vice, and find the inner strength to rise above it and move on. The Temples are populated by the failed initiates who couldn't master themselves.
