Oh, actually /A Practical Guide to Evil/ deals with these themes, in a world where fate is bound up in Stories, which have actual power. The Black Knight character here - he doesn't try to maintain the balance, but he is aware that good and evil seesaw and goes to great lengths to suppress the emergence of heroic characters so that evil can dominate for a little while longer than it is “supposed” to.
