I think Lucas is on record as saying that the dark side isn't actually a part of the balance of the Star Wars universe, but the manifestation of imbalance. So if you were sticking to that interpretation, you wouldn't. I find it kind of interesting that so many go in for this 'light and dark together' idea of balance when the original intention is quite different.

And Qui-Gon (as written by Claudia Gray) had a take on it as well:\\
“...It would mean the darkness would be just as strong as the light. So it doesn't matter what we do, because in the end, hey, it's a tie! It doesn't matter which side we choose.”\\
“It matters,” Qui-Gon said quietly. “It matters which side we choose. Even if there will never be more light than darkness. Even if there can be no more joy in the galaxy than there is pain. For every action we undertake, for every word we speak, for every life we touch---it matters. I don't turn toward the light because it means someday I'll ‘win' some sort of cosmic game. I turn toward it because it is the light.”
