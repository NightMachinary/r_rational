  I mean in the Star Wars Universe it is pretty clear that dark is evil. The darkside users are literally going around torturing people while laughing manicly and blowing up planets. That's pretty evil.

I don't remember any maniacal laughter. Was it in the last movie?

But sure, they blew up a planet. It was a war. They thought, correctly, that the planet was a planet of rebels. That kind of shit happens in war. The US atomic bombed 2 cities in Japan. Does that make the US evil?

  Honestly one could make a good case in universe that both sides are bad but the dark side is clearly worse.

What is evil? What is good? Some might say evil is doing something horrible to the other side. Well, people do that to the other side in war all the time, and they are considered good by their own people.

Some might say evil is crossing an arbitrary line, such as sacrificing someone else's soul. Or eating people. But if your particular group needed to do either of those things to live, you would view it as good.

I think we need to actually define evil. Can it be merely hurting others for enjoyment? In that case, the true evil is being passive aggressive.
