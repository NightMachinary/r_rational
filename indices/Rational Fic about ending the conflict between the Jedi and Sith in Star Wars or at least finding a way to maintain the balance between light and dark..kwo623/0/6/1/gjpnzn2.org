Star Wars canon doesn't have an answer to that question, mostly because the different authors can't make up their mind.

Much of the EU jumps straight into Manichaeism head first - that is, opposed forces of light and dark, always in conflict, requiring each other. That seems to the the understanding most people instinctively jump to. In a Manichaeism view 'bring balance to the force' means bring jedi and sith into equilibrium, since you need both.

It's out of Manichaeism that you get debates like is it good verses evil, light verses dark, calm verses emotion and so on.

But the actual movies (at least the original and prequel trilogy, spear headed by Lucas) don't really subscribe to this. For example, did you ever notice the term "light side" is never used? Not once.

This is because in the Lucasian view, the force /isn't/ clashing light and dark. The force is defined as balance and the jedi are guardians of that balance. The sith bring imbalance and corrupt the force towards selfish ends. That imbalance is the dark side.

Or, as Yoda put it:

#+begin_quote
  YODA: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.

  LUKE: What's in there?

  YODA: Only what you take with you.
#+end_quote

The dark side isn't properly part of the force. It is a corruption of it, created by people who misuse it.

In this view 'bring balance to the force' means something very different. It means wipe out the sith. You don't bring balance to a system by introducing equal parts balance and imbalance. That's absurd.
