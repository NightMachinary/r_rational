This, and also it's never entirely clear why the Republic is inherently better than the Galactic Empire. Obviously the Galactic Empire rules through fear and military suppression, but the simple fact is that the poverty-stricken worlds we see depicted didn't suddenly *become* poverty stricken when the Galactic Empire took over; they were presumably like that under the Republic, too. It's very clear that the Star Wars galaxy is rather brutally divided between the haves and have-nots, with smaller time evil like the Hutts being the only clear winners regardless of regime.

I think a truly rationalist fiction would need to have its hero notice that the so-called "Light" Jedi are just as prone to genocide as the "Dark" Sith they are purportedly opposing, and try to identify a path forward that doesn't rely on supporting corrupt regimes or overthrowing existing regimes and then eschewing all responsibility and retreating to some mountain to meditate or whatever.
