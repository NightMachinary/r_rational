Maybe, except as far as I know that never happened. Causing misery is just anathema to the Jedi way, even if its for "the greater good." The closest I can think of is the [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Covenant][Jedi Covenant]], who turned their back on the Jedi code, and even they were being manipulated by the Sith, which calls into question whether they were still Jedi at that point.

Traditionally the Jedi have avoided getting involved in wars. Only when there was a great enough threat, like something that could topple the Republic, did they do so. But even then, the Jedi were careful - they knew that the horrors of war could (and would) turn some of them to the Dark side.

Take the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Order didn't want to get involved, but a group of [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Revanchist][younger Jedi]] did so anyway. Which led to the rise of [[https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Revan/Legends][Darth Revan]] and a new Sith order.
