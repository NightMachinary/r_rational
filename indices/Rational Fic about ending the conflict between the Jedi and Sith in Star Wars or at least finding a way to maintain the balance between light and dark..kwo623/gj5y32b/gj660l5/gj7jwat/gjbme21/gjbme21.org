Fair point on the planet destruction, though most of your other stuff must be EU because I sure don't remember it in the movies. :-)

  Before that it was actually a pretty good form of government.

Perhaps, but this is never shown in the later movies (although I haven't watched Episodes 1-3 in a while, so maybe there?). The point I was trying to make is that the lawlessness and poverty that's depicted throughout the Outer Rim in the movies didn't happen overnight. Maybe it was a good form of government for the wealthy folks on Coruscant, though, I don't know.

  I'm not sure where you get the whole "they carried out coup d'etats and then disappeared" idea, but I'm fairly sure that never happened the way you described.

Episode 6 they take down the Galactic Empire. Episode 7, Luke is a hermit and the New Republic is apparently completely unable to police its own systems to the point that the First Order is basically in charge; what were they even doing all those years?

Which brings me to the fact that I think it's the most recent trilogy that has made me super ambivalent about the so-called "goodness" of the Light side. We're shown that Storm Troopers in the First Order are unwilling, brainwashed conscripts, but then the Resistance goes in guns blazing and destroys an entire planet's worth of ships carrying those troops. Not as obviously morally repugnant as Alderaan's destruction, sure, but the practitioners of the Light side as depicted in the movies are virtually incapable of comprehending the complexity or moral ambiguity of their own actions. It's cool to kill a bunch of unwilling conscripts because they're on the "bad side", yet Darth Vader and Kylo Ren are both back in the Light because despite murdering and torturing their way across the galaxy, hey! Turned out they were capable of human feeling toward a single person each.
