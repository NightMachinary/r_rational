  Killing millions by blowing up the Death Star is good
#+end_quote

The Death Star had a crew size of 265,675. Alderaan had a population of 2 billion.

Alderaanians were known for their philosophy of paciÔ¨Åsm. The Death Star was known for having a superlaser that destroyed planets.

So yeah, blowing up the Death Star was good.
