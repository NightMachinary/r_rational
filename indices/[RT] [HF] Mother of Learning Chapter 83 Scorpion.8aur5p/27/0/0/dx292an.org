Of course there is a point, or QI wouldn't bother doing it in the first place. I'm expecting QI to somehow inhabit Xvim's body now through every loop, so our Z & Z may be operating with a mole in their midst without ever realizing it. Hell, QI even has an advantage because Zach aside, Zorian was caught up in the soul corroding attack. He may be out for several loops, just enough for QI to perfect his disguise and master being Xvim.

Even if we suppose that QI doesn't have the memories of this loop, waking up in Xvim's body in the next loop will still prompt him to find answers. It is inevitable that he will learn everything, which means that Z & Z finally has a real threat since the departure of Red - can they stop QI from leaving the loop too?
