Oh, I agree there would be massive benefit to inhabiting Xvim. However, from what we know about souls and the Sovereign Gate, I don't see how your theory would be possible. The Sovereign Gate destroys all unmarked souls at the end of every loop and recreates everything from a template. I don't see how doing a soul switch in one loop would affect the next. Otherwise wouldn't Sudomir's soulwell get more and more full every loop and thus render more and more people soulless at the beginning of ever loop?

Do you think in that split second, QI figured out a workaround to all that? I don't, but I guess it's possible and it would definitely be interesting.
