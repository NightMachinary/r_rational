Possible?

- Structured spell---if such a spell existed, I bet QI could do it.
- The author specifically said Xvim seemed very calm after the mental attack.
- QI could have used a structured compulsion spell on Xvim-inside-of-QI to force him to act "normal".

But now that the loop is over, I doubt there would be any lasting effects by possessing Xvim.
