Maybe you're right, but I read this section and also felt it should be immigrate. The sentence in question can be expanded to read "if you emigrated [sic] to Ulquaan Ibasa". Immigrate to, emigrate from---and I justify it by looking at the prefixes. "In" means into and "ex" means out from.

I think that's the correct way of writing it because the prefix "in" means "into" whereas "ex" means "out of".

As for it being in-character, the fact that we're even having this discussion supports your statement really well. However, I think it was an author error and that it is better corrected than not; most readers who happen to notice the error will think of it as a typo rather than assume that it was intentional.
