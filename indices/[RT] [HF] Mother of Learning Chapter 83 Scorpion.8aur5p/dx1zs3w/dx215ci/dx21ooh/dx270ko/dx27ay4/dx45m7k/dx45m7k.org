Well I imagine QI isn't all powerful since he wasn't able to remove the tether they got from breaking into the vaults which is divine in origin so if the artifact works on the same divine level then they might be able to track him. They'll just trick him with the coin and they should be good unless the QI is sufficiently powerful enough to redirect where his soul goes to when his "defenses" activate from the coin trick.

It seems alot easier going that route than fighting him over and over which might be pointless unless they can destroy those skull things and be able to keep his soul in place under the wards that silverlake promised.
