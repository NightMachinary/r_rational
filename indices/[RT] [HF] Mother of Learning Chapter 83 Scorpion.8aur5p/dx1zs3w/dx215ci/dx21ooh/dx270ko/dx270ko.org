Well, the ring wouldn't "work" in the sense that QI would instantly know something had been done to his soul, but he probably wouldn't be able to remove it. The only reason they were able to remove divine tracking from their souls this chapter was that they were able to get out of range so the tether snapped on its own. If the ring's range is 'everything inside the time loop,' then QI wont be able to get out of range. So using the ring tracking on him has a trade-off of immediately putting him on alert for the entire loop, but when they do get the ring a week after the loop starts, they'll be able to find him anywhere. But I don't think that's a good trade-off for them, because as long as they keep the loops somewhat consistent they'll always know about where QI will be anyway, and being able to fight him when he's not on extreme alert seems more important than tracking him on the off chance something causes him to greatly change his schedule.
