Not to mention that in the chapter, it says placing a soul tracker on a soul mage is instantly recognizable, so the tactic would not work on QI even if they could place the tracker on him in the middle of the month after getting the ring.

As far as knocking off the crown is concerned, that would be an interesting idea. If they could fight such that Zorian is hidden somewhere, if during the fight everyone could focus on hitting the crown, maybe a well-placed gate spell when the crown falls would allow Zorian to retrieve it. However, I feel depending on stealing the crown mid-battle like that would be too unreliable, but maybe they could try it.
