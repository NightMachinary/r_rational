So Zorian's strange danger sense again.

It first appeared in chapter 4

#+begin_quote
  ... he almost failed to notice one of the winter wolves attacking Zach had stealthily broken off from the main pack and was sneaking up on him. Almost. Thankfully, some primal instinct alerted him to the danger and he threw himself to the side, narrowly avoiding the creature's deadly pounce.

Next is ch 34.

#+begin_quote
  And then, two weeks into the restart, he woke up in the middle of the night to see a black-clad figure with an obscure face and a knife in their hand standing over his bed.

  Later on, he would wonder what had tipped him off that he was in danger, but in that moment he simply reacted.

And then ch 83.

#+begin_quote
  later, Zorian would wonder what exactly tipped him off and made him immediately activate his marker's restart switch when realized Quatach-Ichl was rushing at them.

And another thing. On the surface, it doesn't looks like other cases, but I highly suspect this example might relate to above cases.

In ch 35. When Zorian met Sword Divers.

  Zorian almost lost consciousness as nine attacks slammed into his mental shield, crushed it like an egg and then ripped straight into his unprotected mind. the pain was excruciating...(omit)

  He felt his muscles lock up as an alien mind seized his motor control away from him and started rooting in his head for facts and memories. He had to do... something... had to...

  suddenly an image flashed before him, of two necklaces hanging from his neck, one of them inscribed with the defensive spell that ultimately failed him and the other that contained...

  his mind suddenly snapped back into place, his course of action clear. Activate the suicide rings, that's what he had to do.
