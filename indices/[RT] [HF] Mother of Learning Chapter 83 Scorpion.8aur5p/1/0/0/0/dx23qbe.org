You could be right, but I don't think the author would necessarily reveal it directly. Narration never deviates from 3rd person with access to Zorian's head. If Zorian doesn't think back to those events with enough clarity to realize what happened, then the story wouldn't reveal anything about those events. I think that might be what's happening.

But again you could be right and it would be an interesting twist. I feel coincidentally having empathic abilities was already a massive deus ex machina, so to be honest, I would sort of resent yet another inborn power like that. Honestly, as much as I /love/ all the mind magic shennanigans and wouldn't change it, on principal I generally dislike those kinds of inborn power-ups in main characters.
