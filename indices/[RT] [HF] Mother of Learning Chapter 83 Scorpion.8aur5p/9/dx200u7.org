Here's an interesting idea:

What if QI's soul suicide leaves a lasting scar on ZZs' souls that will be instantly recognizable to QI (just like how Sudomir recognized Zorian fiddling with his soul marker), thus barring recruiting his help (or at least acting as a warning sign for him) for several restarts if not into perpetuity?

Well, we'll have to tune in next time to find out! It'll be something to keep in mind if they meet QI off the battlefield again---and even then, I feel he wouldn't act immediately upon seeing such a scar but use the scar as a clue that he would bring up later.

Another theory:

His soul explosion actually fused small shards of his soul onto theirs. The small shards perhaps don't have any lasting effect other than to mark them, which again would make QI instantly suspicious upon seeing them again.
