Well consequences don't matter at all if they can't get out of the loop. Why handicap yourself further when there's a chance you might permanently die if you do that? Sounds pretty stupid to me.

One way or another one of them is going to make it out of the loop given that they are the main characters but it's still pretty stupid to make things harder to yourself when solving a serious problem. Tbh I won't be surprised if they are down to the last restart and have to only allow one of them to escape.
