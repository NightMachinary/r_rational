As the Guardian explained, from a certain point of view, the Gate's operation is indeed mass murder.

However, ZZ did not (as far as we know) cause it to happen, and can't readily stop the whole thing. They are attempting to save lives from the invasion in the best way they can.

(Besides, they don't even know how to eject souls from the loop. It might be associated with the dagger, in which case, they may well start using that power once they have it.)
