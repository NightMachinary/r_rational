I'm not arguing it's ethically wrong or right. I just believe it's stupid to not do these things when they need to get out of the time loop and defeat the Red Robe/save peoples lives. Its more about practicality than morality.

Why even Zorian might even be able to defeat the lich without needing to be there if he becomes proficient in the long-term mind magic since he could have the mind control person try to recreate the events which Zorian himself did to defeat the lich(throwing the coin at the lich because the mind-controlled person look ultimately harmless also the lich himself could hardly tell since he isn't nearly as proficient at mind magic as Zorian). They don't even need to be there in person and only show up after the fact to reap the rewards then immediately run away but they won't do that because of the morality of long term mind magic.
