  Well as for your question on experimentation on criminals is because the criminals do infact exist in the real world and someone can trace all that back to you.

Yes, hence the later part of my argument saying that things you do in the time loop could potentially be traced back to you. After all, it isn't really looping time: it's just creating "prison" worlds and populating them, then destroying the worlds. There are ways to escape from the loop worlds into the outside world, just like there are ways to escape a prison. It's just much harder, but clearly doable: after all, Red Robe did it.

  Morally it is worse because these are not copies but real people who won't be recreated ever again. there's a difference between cutting off the leg of a lizard and cutting off its head.

What makes the copies /not/ real? At the start of the time loop, they are identical in pretty much every single way to the people in the outside world, the only difference is their location and time of creation. Neither of which seems like a good reason for why the outside world people should be considered more /real/ than the loop world people. Rather than cutting off the leg of a lizard, it's more like cutting off the head of an identical twin.

Also, "real people who won't be recreated ever again" is really weird as a moral justification. Does the ability to recreate someone magically mean that now it's more moral to kill them? That their moral rights are now worth less simply because no matter how badly you treat them, they can be recreated?

(I imagine that our future machine overlords will take offense to this.)
