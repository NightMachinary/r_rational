Just keep your sense of self and its a made-up world so nothing would apply outside. As long as you get the results you need you don't need to continue to apply it in the outside world in said situation of Zorian. Why even Zorian himself has admitted he isn't ambitious so he would mainly make due with being self-employed and have a well to do lifestyle.

Majority of those twisted horrible people are those who can't stop and continually do such things are weak and merely do that to satisfy what carnal desire they want whether its money, power, women, etc. Now if you are arguing just because he does such acts he would be regarded as twisted then look at Alanic. He sure as hell didn't get powerful in soul magic by being good but he was able to reform or see the light.
