they still go out of their way to kill as few as possible, viewing everyone as renewable is really dangerous since all human lives are basically finite, and justifying things with "they are gonna die anyway" get awfully close at hand if you start down that route, especially if you have acess to a alchemist that can make immortality potions.

and they feel bad about the people the killed at the airship heist, but remember they didn't kill anyone (knowingly) in the heist itself but did it in self defense later when they got attacked, and yes they console themself with the fact that it's a time loop but they still don't think it's okey.
