You don't see a difference between an instant reset nobody notices and and seeing your family being beaten to death by a war troll just before you die to artillery fire?

If there is a difference, then Z+Z should never allow the final day to go through, and never learn how to counter the invasion.

If there isn't a difference, then Z+Z should be fine to experiment on anyone they'd find useful, since clearly the gained information is worth the suffering if they're all going to disappear each month anyways.
