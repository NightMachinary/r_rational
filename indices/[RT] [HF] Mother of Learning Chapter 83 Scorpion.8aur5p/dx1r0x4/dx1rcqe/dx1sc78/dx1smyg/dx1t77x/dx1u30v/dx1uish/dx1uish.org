Would conducting a single immoral experiment on an unwilling human subject instantly turn them evil? No, of course not. Repeatedly doing that same kind of evil thing, on a month-to-month basis, for years? That would probably do it.

And if you think that makes them "stupid and babies," well, I sincerely hope that no one I care about is ever in a position dependent on your making the right moral decision.
