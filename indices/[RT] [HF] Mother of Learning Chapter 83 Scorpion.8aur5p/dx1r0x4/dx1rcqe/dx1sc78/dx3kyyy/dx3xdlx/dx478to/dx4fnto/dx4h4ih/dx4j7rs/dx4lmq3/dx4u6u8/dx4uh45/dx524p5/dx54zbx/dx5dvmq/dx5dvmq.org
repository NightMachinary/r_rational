  Well of course not but that's because if you personally are a utilitarian you want other people to maximise utility, not to be utilitarians. Those are two closely aligned but separate considerations.

/There/ we go. That's what I'm saying, only I'm going a step further removed. I am /insufficient to the task/ of utilitarianism, so, for utilitarian considerations, I want to outsource the utilitarianism to someone or something that /is/ up to the task (which would produce higher utility than being a utilitarian myself), so that I can adopt a moral code that will maximize utility.

Of course, finding/creating the ultimate utilitarian is the hard bit, and ensuring it optimizes for the correct values is [[https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2012-04-03][even harder]].
