  You can literally torture people you know are going to otherwise be tortured in the loop and who otherwise you wouldn't save.

  There is no downside to this.

  Zach and Zorian are not doing anything to stop all the ongoing torture or torture-equivalent.

Oh, for the love of...

*There is absolutely a moral difference between not acting to stop something evil and being an active participant in that evil.*

  Besides which I don't know why human experimentation = torture but whatever.

/Ethical/ human experimentation isn't. And, in fact, this loop would present the opportunity for the perfect controlled clinical trial: get the double-blind right, and with exactly the same patient, disease progression etc., the /only/ variable would be the treatment.

I doubt they're talking about the ethical kind of experimentation, though. Otherwise, they could figure out a way to do it legally. The impression I got was that Silverlake was pushing for more dubious stuff. Google "unethical malaria experiments" if you want your faith in humanity cracked a little further.

  The only relevant impact being the last two, and the consequence to society could be Zach and Zorian curing cancer the minute they step out.

The people in the loop are people, and their pain matters.

*The people in the loop are /people/, and their pain /matters/.*

Besides, whoever steps out of that loop is going to be an archmage. Zach might even have a plausible claim to the Imperial Throne (especially if he gets his hands on the five artifacts outside of the loop). Do you really want your Ã¼ber-powerful archmage Emperor to be the kind of person who has become okay with callously causing pain and death "for the greater good?" Or that such a person couldn't easily cause more pain and death in his lifetime than cancer ever could?
