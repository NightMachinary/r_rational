Isn't that basically the entire premise of The Metropolitan Man?

Lois tries to convince Superman to spend every hour of his every day improving life for everyone else, when she is unwilling to make such a commitment herself, because his abilities give him the power to accomplish so much more good by the use of his time than she can. Luthor thinks that Superman is obliged to kill himself because there's a miniscule chance that he snaps and decides to massacre humanity, which, even on average, outweighs all of the good he might possibly do.

I would never try to teach a dog utilitarianism, but I can teach the dog to be friendly and obedient to his owner, which, given a dog's abilities, is about the best I can do, and, given a morally good owner, should be functionally equivalent.

A dog should be taught the best moral code a dog might be able to adhere to, a human should be taught the best moral code a human might be able to adhere to, and a being or system with superhuman understanding should be able to adhere to a higher standard of morality yet. And the highest standard, for an omniscient being, is bound to be some form of utilitarianism.

Asking a dog to follow a human moral code is a task where all you can expect is frustration, and asking a (present-day) human, with all the inherent flaws that implies, to follow a code of perfect utilitarianism is no different.

Until we can transcend these bodies, in which hurting people for good reason will build habits, that could, in turn, lead to hurting people for no reason beyond those habits... Until we, to a person, learn to see past the self-delusion of moral superiority that colours every memory of our past deeds... Until we have the innate resources to inhabit a perfect moral code better then we can inhabit a custom-tailored one, we'll have to settle for an imperfect one, one that leverages our imperfections instead of ignoring them.

I can't see how it's in any way utilitarian to think otherwise.
