I like this novel but this honestly has to be one of my biggest peeves with it. Clearly they don't care enough about people in the loops to go around trying to save all the people in Cyoria every time, so if they are operating according to moral concerns they should be doing whatever is necessary to escape the loop and ensure an optimal future. Not being willing to go even in the slightest outside their comfort zone is neither pragmatically moral or selfish. It's just self-handicapped squeamishness.
