This is a wonderful birthday present for me, despite it not being April 20th yet!

And here I sincerely thought QI would have had some information about the previous time the looping had occurred. Instead he comes up with a hilarious miss-guess.

Also, I /really/ don't like Silverlake acting as if people sticking to their ethics are babies or stupid for doing so. I bet the ideas she has about abusing the timeloops revolve around stealing or tricking others into doing research for you in various ways.

Edit: I seem to have sparked off a discussion about whether or not Zorian and Zack are foolish for 'handicapping' themselves by ignoring unethical actions. Since it's too late to weigh in properly, I only would like to point out that the disagreements seem to boil down to arguing whether utilitarian (the ends justify the means) or deontological (the ends /don't/ justify the means) ethics are better.

Yes, yes, it's an oversimplification of two complex moral philosophies, but I needed a pithy summary of the two.
