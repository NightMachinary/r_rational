Idea:

Attempt to replicate this restart's palace heist with QI. If successful, repeat the gate to Xlotic.

Ahead of time, put down a plate enchanted the same way as Kael's coin right where the gate exits into Xlotic.

Humans rarely take notice of what is directly below them, so QI may not realize what he's stepping on. If he does notice (which I would expect seeing as be would be on high alert stepping through an unknown portal), fight him as planned. If he doesn't notice, well---now you have a crown and a dagger as huge payoff for a plan that was improbably successful.
