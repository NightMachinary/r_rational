Keep reading; Zach went on to say that he /had/ tried to throw items at QI in the past, and QI is expert at deflecting or even returning them.

The odds of them getting past his defences in that regard within their remaining iterations are too low to warrant the risk of facing him. Just look at what happened this time; ZZ may be a while recovering.

Being very generous, I'll allow that they might have a 1% chance of surprising him and dispelling him each time they try. But they might also have a 10% chance or more of having him get suspicious and hit them with enough soul magic to do them lasting harm. And the more they gear up for the confrontation (like warding their souls), the worse their chances of taking him off guard.
