IMO they need two methods to deal with QI:

1. A reliable way to defeat QI under specific, loop-replicable conditions so they can always get the crown.
2. An extremely robust method to defeat QI under the chaotic post-loop conditions where RR might be present. It needs to be done once, but arguably that's when it needs to work 100% of the time, which is why this method needs to be extremely robust.

Both methods could be the same method if there's a reliable enough way to do it each time. I think having QI think he needs to use soul magic was a handicap they could exploit as their method 1 approach.

In the loop where the coin was used, Zach had the students have a party in his mansion. Red Robe tracked Zach down to the mansion specifically to discover who the other loopers were. You would have to hope to create a similar scenario sans RR and that may be doable, but it may be problematic.

Also, I think Zorian could be present albeit pretending to be merely a student. A disintigrating beam to that vampire heir woman would attract QI's attention, and there you go. It's worth a try if you ask me---but I maintain that the hardest thing is to get QI and the vampire lady into the mansion in the first place without the influence of RR.

I think another attempt could be to similarly raid the Imperial Palace with QI, eventually gate away to Xlotic like in this past chapter, but ahead of time place a plate below where the gate will open so that QI steps on it. If notices the plate and doesn't step on it---well, now they get to practice fighting QI normally again, this time hopefully with the addition of a small army stored in the Orb.
