Well they don't need to use the coin themselves so long as the coin hits QI. They don't even need to put anything else on hold as long as they had that happen with a friend or mind-controlled person. Obviously they only do it at the end of the restart so QI doesn't mess them after the fact it fails but it could work if Zorian didn't have any hang ups about long term mind control.

QI isn't as good at mind control as Zorian and they only need to do trial and error of throwing the coin at him via a proxy/different settings to see what sticks. Tbh he should have started on this as soon as he learnt QI had the crown but they keep wanting to strong-arm this entire situation. Its not a waste as long as they are doing other things and I find it wasteful they went through so many restarts learning QI has the crown yet not trying anything on him (as far as we know). It only has to be during the invasion like i said to be safe.
