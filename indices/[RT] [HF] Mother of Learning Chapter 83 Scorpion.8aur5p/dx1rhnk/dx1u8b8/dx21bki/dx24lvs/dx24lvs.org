But imagine the soul detonation hadn't occurred. If they could induce this sort of situation every restart and reliably incapacitate QI, then they would have a way to get the dagger /and/ crown and they'd have four of five keys. One more key and their exit path is secured. By then, the only remaining hurdle would be to have a solution for fighting QI normally to permanently end his threat---which they could also practice---but remember is a whole other project in itself because it involves destroying his phyactery. If they just want to end the invasion, they could instead try to sabotage the creation of QI's special gate structure, which I think they already know results in the Ibasans just giving up.

I think the risk was maybe worthwhile---though I agree that it probably would have been safer to just prefer fighting QI normally to avoid the dangers of soul shennanigans.
