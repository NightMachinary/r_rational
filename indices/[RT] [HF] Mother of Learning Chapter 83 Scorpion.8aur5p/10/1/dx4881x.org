This is what I was thinking.

1. Make thousaof those coins Zorian used once before to disconnect QI from his body, but make them the size of sand. Scatter them around planned dimensional gate exit - all over the ground, in the breeze, everywhere.
2. Tag QI soul with the ring just as he steps through the dimensional gate. If he notices and tries to stop, be ready to blast him through the gate.
3. In the rest of this restart, while you do have the ring, track QI soul to his phylactery
4. Repeat over multiple restarts, sending a simulacrum towards the phylactery before you start each time. Each restart starts tracking from closer than before.
5. Go ask QI nicely for the crown. When he laughs, threaten him with the exact location of his phylactery.
6. When he still refuses and starts trying to kill you, have your Alanic-and-friends strike team attack his phylactery so he has to abandon the body with crown to defend it.
