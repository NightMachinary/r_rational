Being an empath does include better reception of divination results in general, because being an empath means having a mind framed to better "accept" that input. Spear of Resolve even mentioned way back when that an "occasional prophetic dream" is one of the things that come with being "Open". I think we can chalk this up to his empath abilities - a kind of extremely short-term death divination that acts as an inconsistently-activated "danger sense".
