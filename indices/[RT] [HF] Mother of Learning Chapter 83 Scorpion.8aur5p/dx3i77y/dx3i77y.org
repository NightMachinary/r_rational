What a pity, I would so much have hoped for a possible long term understanding between ZZ and QI.

I mean, if ZZ manage to escape the timeloop, then it is in QI's best interest to peacefully cancel the invasion, before it is discovered (if Eldemar is not crushed, then the backlash is not worth the hassle; and ZZ can damage QI's plan enough to become counterproductive). If they can get QI to abort the invasion peacefully once out of the timeloop, then it is in their interest to do this. Hence, QI has an interest in providing ZZ with contact info and proof that would be convincing to QI, and ZZ have an interest (in the real world) of using it.

If ZZ manage to escape, then QI has an interest in (1) obtaining time-loop info and more importantly (2) having a workable relationship and trust-base with the new ZZ power in the world. Their acquired knowledge (Bakora gate information, where to find the imperial artifacts) is priceless, even for QI. He can put good probability to them becoming important long-term players that might be more amenable to lobbying for a peace treaty (which is the thing QI wants to achieve with the invasion). I could even imagine him taking on Zorian as an apprentice and future Lich, post-timeloop and once Zorian is close to death.

On the other hand, ZZ emerging successfully from the loop without a working relationship with QI is his nightmare scenario. Hence, his preferences should be:

(1) Subvert the timeloop [too unlikely to pursue], (2) see ZZ fail to escape, (3) have ZZ escape from the timeloop with QI's help and (4) have ZZ escape from the loop against QI.

ZZ's preference order should be 3,4,2,1.

Both parties prefer 3 to 4, so there is room for trade/trust, but not easily due to the possibility of QI betraying ZZ or being less helpful than he appears to be. Also, there is an issue of haggling: How much knowledge do ZZ transfer across loops for QI, or otherwise trade him? How much knowledge that could be used against him is QI willing to divulge to ZZ? This is interesting! (but apparently not happening)
