Great analysis. I'd rather set ZZ's preferece order as 4,3,2,1. ZZ have vocalized how they completely disagree with QI's approach. Not only that, but I feel both of them believe QI is too dangerous and wiley to cultivate a longterm cooperative relationship with. Their priorities ought to be:

1. Exit the loop and survive.
2. Halt the invasion.
3. Find a way to end QI permanently.
4. Barring ending QI, find a diplomatic solution.

Outcome-wise, this is your 4,3,2,1.

Unforunately, option 3: cooperation is so unstable. QI knows that ZZ don't trust him and he would probably admit that given the opportunity, he would betray them. After all, QI very plainly said to them at the initial meeting that he believes in maintaining power and peace through the threat of violence and so ZZ feel if QI could eventually find a way to remove the threat of ZZ, he would choose to do so---they're forced to assume that if QI is given enough time to conspire, he would eventually choose a zero-sum solution.

QI realizes he cannot convincingly promise an option 3 even if that would be the best option for everyone, so all that is left for him is option 2---do his best to prevent ZZ from escaping. And if he fails? Well, ZZ exit the loop and stop the invasion. Even in that case, QI may still survive to fight another day if ZZ can't within the loop reliably figure out how to destroy QI's phylactery.

If the above is QI's calculus, then I can see why he would choose to detonate himself, likely inducing a coma, death, or otherwise scarring them in a way he might be able to notice if they try to negotiate with him in subsequent loops. I do agree with you, though, that an alliance would be a lot of fun to read about and it's a pity QI generally views alliances as temporary until one power outmaneovers the other.
