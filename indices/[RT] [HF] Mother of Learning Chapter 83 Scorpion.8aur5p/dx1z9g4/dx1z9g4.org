I like to think of MoL magic system as code, specially the soul magic field about markers and templates. I think QI soul bomb is a workaround against the Sovereign Gate loop, QI just hacked a mark on the timeloop to erase the template on his soul just as if it were SQL injection. This could be a pretty handy mechanism to protect oneself against loopers, as alternative to not engaging at all, I think ZZ souls are fine, but QI will be soul killed now and they won't learn more about him. It would be even cooler if all of their teachers are also wiped out of the time loop! A really nice and difficult situation for the story. Maybe that's why Demian wasn't included, the plot will need him for Blatyrre exploration.
