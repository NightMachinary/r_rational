I think we're arguing that the skill is extremely worthwhile for limited scenarios and thus worth training.

To give a somewhat contrived example, say Eldemar is trying to exercise eminant domain over some shifter territory. I could buy the shifter group time to muster a more permanent legal solution or otherwise broker a better deal if I could magically compel several officials to delay or drop the case outright. My point is that there are instances where the ability would allow for a more moral outcome---and some of us argue that there may be ways to practice the skill that would not push Zorian's moral boundaries very far.
