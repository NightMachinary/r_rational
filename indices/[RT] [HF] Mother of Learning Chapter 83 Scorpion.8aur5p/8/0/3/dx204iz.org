tbf they've yet to actually defeat QI. Hell just now it was a 5v1 and QI didn't actually lose. He realized the futility of simply fleeing, and instead managed to gain the information needed to actually do the one action that would have any possible real impact on our mcs.

He only seems non-threatening because of the fundamental limitation of soul magic- that it's slow/clumsy in offense, which means despite his thousand years of experience QI can't actually just snap his fingers and wipe out ZZ's souls.
