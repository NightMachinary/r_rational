Quite frankly he's a bit underwhelming to me. Zorian is powerful with 10 real years of mage experience, a very good work ethic, and 1 natural gift. Zach is stupidly powerful with a (presumed)divine blessing and 65 years of mage of experience. QI has two divine blessings, the crown, a 1000 years of mage experience, and no morals holding him back in anyway. Presumably he also has a good work ethic too and put those years to good work. He should be an absolutely unstoppable monster.
