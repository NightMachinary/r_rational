I agree that "immigrated" is probably more natural/common here. But while "emigrated" is unusual in this context, I don't think it's wrong, strictly speaking. It's all about whether the focus is on the place which is left (emigrate) or the destination (immigrate). I didn't even notice that Quatach-Ichl had said anything unusual when I read this part, but if I had, it would have seemed perfectly in-character for an articulate, millennia-old lich.
