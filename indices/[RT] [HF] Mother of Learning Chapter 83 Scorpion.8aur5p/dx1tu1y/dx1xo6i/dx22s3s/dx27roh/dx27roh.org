#+begin_quote
  Immigrate to, emigrate from
#+end_quote

According to the oxford dictionary, "emigrate to" is absolutely valid (they list the "full" form as "emigrate (from...) (to...) )

Example sentence given:

#+begin_quote
  The family left Czechoslovakia in 1968 and emigrated to America.
#+end_quote

In this case (this chapter) the full sentence would be "if you emigrated from here to there"
