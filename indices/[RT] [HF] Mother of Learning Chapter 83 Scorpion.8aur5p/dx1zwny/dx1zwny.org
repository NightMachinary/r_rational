I feel like QI's denotation of his soul was an intelligent move rather than a suicidal one. QI knew that no matter what he does, ZZ could do nearly anything to him with the help of the time loop. Once they get out, they have extensive knowledge on him while he's utterly ignorant of two adult mages in the body of innocuous teenagers. And there's no changing that whatever he does in that moment.

However, there's a version of him who is still well-off. The version of him one month ago. And all he needs to do to save that version of him...is to destroy their souls.

So I believe the soul-bombing wasn't /just/ a desperate act, but also a move to ensure a version of him will be very well-off after the time loop is over with all but one of the controllers dead. Also, some people seem to think he knows Red Robe even if he doesn't know about the time loop.
