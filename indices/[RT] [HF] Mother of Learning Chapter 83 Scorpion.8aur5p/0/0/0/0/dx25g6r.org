Precisely my thoughts. Zorian saved himself but still felt some effects. If Zach was closer to the blast, he probably ate it harder than Zorian.

I don't think it'll happen, but here's the kicker: What if Zach ate it hard? As in, he's comatose for the remaining loops hard? But Zach is so fun, I definitely would not enjoy that. :P

And then, and then . . . Zorian saves /both/ of them because he's a true friend of Zach, but then when he exits the loop, RR was Zach all along! The twist is real! Zachorian was never meant to be . . . /s
