Right---that was the reason for the /s, but just to mess with you, *if Zach is Red Robe, then Zach knew how to cast simulacra all along, but due to memory shenanigans or maybe skilled method acting, Zach couldn't remember how or pretended to be unable to cast the spell!*

Remember---Zach /admitted/ to finding the simulacrum scroll /years ago/, so maybe when we saw RR and Zach in the same room, we actually just saw Zach and his simulacrum!

In reality, that theory is not likely at this point because of how simulacra work: Simulacra are linked to the original's soul, so if RR or Zach is just a simulacrum, then when RR left the loop, Zach's soul would have left too because they would share the same soul. In other words, after Red Robe left the loop in chapter 26ish, Zach should have become a lifeless husk just like Veyers and the Aranea---at least, that what makes sense to me.
