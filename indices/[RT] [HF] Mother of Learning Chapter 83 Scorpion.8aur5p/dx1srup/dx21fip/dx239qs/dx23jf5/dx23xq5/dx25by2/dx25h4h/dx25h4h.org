Read it, and Hermione became a Mary Sue in Lady Archimedes and I honestly couldn't go on when she kept making up excuses for not winning the war in 10 minutes.

The Seventh Horcrux is the single funniest thing I have ever read in my entire life. Nothing has ever come close. That is not sarcasm, 100% earnest. On rereading it I occasionally laugh myself into tears. God, Voldemor's "inner circle" after being purged "of spies and traitors" consists of Sirius Black (no, it's like canon where he was never a death eater, it's hilarious but complicated), Snape, and Hagrid (who nobody bothered rescuing from Azkaban after the second book so he got broken out along with the death eaters)

Edit: oh god, or when he gives Hermione "The Talk." And by that I mean the "Evil Overlord Talk."

  sometimes there are going to be boys who are rich, attractive, funny, and whom you're going to want to, more than anything, crush beneath your heel.

  I don't like Malfoy! He's a git and an idiot!

  of course he's an idiot, he's 15! But someday he's going to look back and realize what an idiot he was as he lays prostrate before you
