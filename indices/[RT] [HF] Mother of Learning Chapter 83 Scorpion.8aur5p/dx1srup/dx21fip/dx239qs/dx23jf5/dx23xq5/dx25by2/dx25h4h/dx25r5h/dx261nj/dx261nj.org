There's The Evil Overlord list by [[/u/boomvroomshroom]], very dark humor but enjoyable nonetheless

There's Inquisitor Carrow and the God-Emperorless Heathens for the Harry Potter/40k crossover (I found it hilarious but its mainly for people who think wizards losing their shit at servo-skulls is funny)

There's When in Doubt, Obliviate, a fun romp about Harry being raised by Lockheart

Spock Unleashed for 20th century star trek fans

Daily Prophet My Ass for something that will make you laugh yet can complete in 10 minutes

So Not My Problem/The Jedi Kind of had it Coming for the KOTOR fans out there

Food Scandal for a short adventure from the Empire's perspective in Star Wars

and we come to a close with a "wizards learn how dangerous guns are via bullet holes" fic in Divided and Entwined.

its nearly 3am so i think i should stop here
