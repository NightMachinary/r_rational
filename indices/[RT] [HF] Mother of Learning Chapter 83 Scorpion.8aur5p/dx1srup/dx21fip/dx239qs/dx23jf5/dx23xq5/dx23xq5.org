I will always remember the line from The Seventh Horcrux

  "For instance," I said. "The moral of The Fountain of Fair Fortune is that the magic was within you all along. The moral of The Warlock's Hairy Heart is that you shouldn't care what anyone else thinks of you. And the moral of The Tale of the Three Brothers is that you should be invisible at all times."

  Hermione frowned at me, as she often does. "That isn't the moral at all. It's that you can't cheat death."

  "Really, Hermione? Did you even read the tale? It clearly states that the youngest brother spends his entire life under an invisibility cloak, only taking it off when he wanted to die. I'm not sure why he would have wanted that, though," I mused, pulling my cloak tightly around my shoulders.
