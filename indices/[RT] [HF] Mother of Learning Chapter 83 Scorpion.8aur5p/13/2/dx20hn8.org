one factor you're forgetting about though, is zorian killed and mindraped enemies. Ok well the main exception being the aranea tribes he practiced on. Animal rights? Still, this too could have been dealt with by merely having zorian restrict his practicing on aranea tribes who tried to kill him first.

There's a big difference between attacking cultists who are trying to destroy his home/aranea who prey on humans. Also I'd also argue that medical experiments on the cultists is pretty fucked up too, simply because of how long the torture lasts. Like how there'd be a difference between executing a man and having him die by slow torture/starvation.
