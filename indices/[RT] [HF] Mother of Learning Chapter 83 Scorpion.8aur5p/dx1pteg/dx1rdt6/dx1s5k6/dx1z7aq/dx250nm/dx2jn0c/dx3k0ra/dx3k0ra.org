It'd be really funny if in the last month, Zorian gained the ability to do deep brain edits, edited Xvim's mind temporarily (questionable) so Xvim would /believe/ a loop was occurring, then recreated what happened in this loop.

QI, invading Xvim's mind and believing he's in a loop, decides to self-detonate, thus permanently committing suicide. Tricksy hobitses!

PS: I in no way endorse this plan. Casual deep edits of a mentor on the off chance everything goes according to plan isn't my idea of a reliable strategy.
