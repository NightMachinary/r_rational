Like I said, it's not about what they get out of it. It's because they give Q-I a chance to trigger a war /without/ the invasion. Q-I wants to trigger the war and make Firn win. So they break into the place, plant evidence implicating F. Q-I gets to save the lives of his soldiers, who he apparently values. He gets to plant some evidence implicating another nation. He gets whatever he can carry off. C isn't invaded.

Well, not immediately, anyway. Maybe in the future. But by another nation, and not a military action that involves a terrifying undead wizard with a thousand years of experience.
