  He should be an absolutely unstoppable monster.

He invested all those years into defensive and utility magics. Hence hasting, personal Bakora gates, lich magics, etc. With all the simulacrums and fake bodies he's pretty much impossible to kill. His offense is weak because he probably didn't think he would need them to be any stronger than they already are.

  and no morals holding him back in anyway.
#+end_quote

QI does have morals, it's established that he is just from an ancient time when values are different, more based on honor than human rights. He actually cares about his country and his people, though he is incredibly strict on them. So that means he won't go around performing human experiments on his people or can't take reckless actions that might provoke other countries to declare war on his country, not without decades of meticulous planning.
