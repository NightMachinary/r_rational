And let's be real, we're using the word "weak" in a very skewed sense; homeboy is a walking artillery platform. When he isn't just using soul magic---which is inefficient to cast in battle---he can usually single-handedly stand toe-to-toe with an army of mages as we've seen in the past: and we're talking about an army of mages being led by two timelooping archmages pretty familiar with how he fights /plus/ Xvim and Alanic.
