I'm betting QI exploded his soul so that he would fuse some of his soul fragments into Zack or Zorian. Zack is going to be in the clear probably because of how sensitive his marker is, but Zorian's going to have a sizable portion of QI stuck inside him.

I bet QI thinks his soul fragments might be enough to take over Zorians soul and make Zorian more like him. His way of vicariously surviving despite the fact that this isn't the real world.

On the plus side, Zorian might get more mana and some ancient Lich magical powers assuming he manages to keep his personality intact.
