I'm not going to argue that torture can never, under any circumstance, be justified. I'm sure I could even come up with a scenario myself where it's justifiable (e.g. lives in danger, a ticking clock, a hypothetical form of torture that's actually effective at extracting information, the bomber in custody, and no other leads). But on the whole, it isn't. Not even when the ends is "to save lives." Because the world is complicated, and you can't plot out all of the consequences of your actions. You might not be saving any lives at all, because you could accomplish your goal by different means, or you could save five lives but the cost is a hundred more when the family of the person you've tortured vows revenge. Or you could end up with a keen supporter of torture as the chief of your intelligence agency, even when no one can point to a single life saved by the torture in question.

Now, the fact that they're in a time loop, and the typical consequences don't apply, and they can actually empirically verify that lives /are/ being saved through the torture, does screw around with the equation here. I have to admit that those scenarios I might construct, where torture is an acceptable means to achieve an end, can be constructed a lot more easily within the Conqueror's Gate.

But the rule should still be "no torture whatsoever," with every argument being made against it until it's clear there's no other way to accomplish the goal in question, that the ends are /worth/ such a means, and that the ends will be effectively accomplished throughout the torture. A last resort even among all the tactics of last resort.

Because torture is something hideous, and its consequences to its victims, to society, and to the torturers themselves, are equally hideous, and should be avoided at (almost) all costs.
