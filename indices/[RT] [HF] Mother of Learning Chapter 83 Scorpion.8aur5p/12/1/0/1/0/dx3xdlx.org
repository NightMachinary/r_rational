These are still real people in the time loop. The consequences are time-limited, but real, to both ZZ and the loopers.

If someone is sentenced to death, is it still immoral to torture that person? Of course it is, even though there won't be any lasting consequences for that person pay their death. Why? Because it's /immoral to torture people!/

Can exceptions be made, due to exigent circumstances (e.g. an impending invasion about to release an unkillable horror, massacre millions, and trap their souls to be used to power wraith bombs)? Sure. But that doesn't mean ZZ should let those exceptions become the rule, by telling themselves that these aren't real people that would be suffering. They /are/ real people, and their suffering would also be real.

Humans are very good at rationalization, at justifying our deeds once the deed is done. Better to not get into the habit of doing things that require you to think, "Well, it was okay /this time,/ because..."

Nasty habits like that, of doing horrible things and justifying them as "not actually that bad" and "for a good cause," they're the hardest habits to break, because breaking them means admitting that you might actually have become a bad person, and that's something that very few people can bring themselves to do.
