Then they are babies and stupid. It's not like such things would instantly turn them evil and as long as you aware of yourself then you don't need to continually do stuff outside the time loop. If they are aware they are like that sissy batman who can't kill some villian (thereby saving further victims) without turning evil then they are stupid and babies. i like this novel but I just pointing out that the so called evil acts would make things so much easier as long as they realize it was necessary. Sadly they are too squimish like Silverlake said which is disappointing because I find i more realistic that said morals would fuck you over in the REAL world more than helping you out.
