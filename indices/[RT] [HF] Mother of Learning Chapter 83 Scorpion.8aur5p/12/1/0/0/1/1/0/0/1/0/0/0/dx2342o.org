Just going to say this explicitly, I am not arguing that it'd be more ethical. I agree that it is very unethical in all respects and would hope that no one would do it.

However, I am arguing that the unethical actions we are implying are easier to have a proxy commit them than committing them oneself.

First off, I agree. Second, they might be on the same (un)ethical level but the damage to ZZ's psyches are different.

Let's take torture as an arbitrary unethical action, ordering someone to be tortured is easier than torturing someone. The act of physically, or in this setting magically, going through with the action is very different from the perspective of the damage done to an agent's resistance to commit such an action than ordering a proxy to commit the action.

The act of using a proxy however makes them much more likely to normalize the ordering of such actions, that's the real crux of the issue.

Then we must ask ourselves, do we think that ZZ would do this continuously for every single problem over multiple restarts? I don't, Zorain at least would try other approaches first and leave this until the point they have little other choice or something of grave importance to him was at stake where he would lose his rational self. Zach on the other hand would give me pause, he is much less patient and expects results instantly.
