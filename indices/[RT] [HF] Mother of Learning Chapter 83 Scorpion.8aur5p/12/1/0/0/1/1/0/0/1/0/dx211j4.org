How is it more convenient, if by all stated facts to the anecdote, the necessary act is going to happen regardless?

If someone has to gather knowledge from other mage's mind for them to accomplish some goal, why would they do it themselves instead of farming it out to someone else? It is very different ordering someone to commit an act than commit it yourself.

It's simply is not convenience, but instead it's the mitigation of damage to their moral constitution. As for finding mind mages, I'm assuming that mercenaries are a thing in this world and that favors, money, and magical knowledge (such as a gate or simulacrum spell) speak big (especially if the money can be provided upfront and magical knowledge acting as bait).
