But it *isn't* a made-up world. It has already been established that there's no actual time looping taking place: the sovereign gate creates a new world every "loop" and then destroys it at the end of the loop. That means the people inside are /real/.

If your argument is: "They are going to die, or they can't get out of the doomed world anyway, so what's wrong with experimenting on them?" then I must ask: Why not experiment on criminals who have life imprisonment or the death penalty in reality right now? They have the same restrictions: they are trapped and doomed, and will never escape into the "outside world".

Also it would not surprise me if some non-loopers do find a way out of the time loop. After all, it has already been established that primodial prisons connect the loop worlds with the real worlds, so there are exit paths, just highly dangerous ones. Such non-loopers would know about Z&Z's morality within the loop.
