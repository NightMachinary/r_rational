You can explain the morals but it's no use. Even ZZ don't take lives much seriously as they'll kill by necessity and console themselves with the fact that it's a time loop. If they treated the lives of those inside the time loop as real then they would go insane as they would be damning multiple ppl inside the city when they don't save the city every loop or killing innocent ppl who've been simple doing their jobs.
