My argument is that they are not searching every avenue towards getting out of the time loop due to their morals as opposed to actual consequences since everything is recreated in the beginning of the time loop.

Well as for your question on experimentation on criminals is because the criminals do infact exist in the real world and someone can trace all that back to you. Morally it is worse because these are not copies but real people who won't be recreated ever again. there's a difference between cutting off the leg of a lizard and cutting off its head.

Besides its not like ZZ are taking enjoyment in killing or other stuff they do. They do it because they need to in order to work towards getting out of the time loop.
