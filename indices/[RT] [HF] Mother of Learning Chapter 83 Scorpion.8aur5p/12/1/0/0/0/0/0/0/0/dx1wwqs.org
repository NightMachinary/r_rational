  Just keep your sense of self
#+end_quote

You are your habits. You become the things you do. Wear a mask too long, and you become it. The wolf inside of you that grows stronger is the one you feed.

Whichever clich√© you choose, it comes down to the same thing: if you do bad things often enough, you become a person who habitually does bad things. You can't "keep your sense of self" because no one thinks of themselves as "a bad person."

  its a made-up world so nothing would apply outside
#+end_quote

No, it's explicitly /not/ a made-up world within the Gate. The people are physically real. They have souls. They feel pain, they feel emotion, they think exactly like the people they are copied off of. The /only/ difference is that they cease to exist after a month.

  Why even Zorian himself has admitted he isn't ambitious so he would mainly make due with being self-employed and have a well to do lifestyle.
#+end_quote

Zorian is a freaking teenage archmage (or, at least, well on his way to becoming one). He has an immortal friend who can brew him potions of youth, and probably has a few other paths to immortality. He may not be ambitious now, but he'd be a fool to make any decisions right now about his possible futures. He could, almost literally, do anything he wants, for as long as he wants, when he gets out of the loop. Once the time pressure is off, he should probably devote a lot more time to considering that.

  Majority of those twisted horrible people are those who can't stop and continually do such things are weak and merely do that to satisfy what carnal desire they want whether its money, power, women, etc.
#+end_quote

I'm sorry, I'm going to need a citation for that. Most of the monsters I've seen have gotten into bad habits of thought (e.g. "prisoners are bad people who deserve to get raped;" "there are no innocents in Gaza;" "[indigenous population] are ignorant savages who can't govern themselves;" etc.), and do bad things because they can't bring themselves to care about the well-being of others outside of their [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number][Dunbar group]].

Yes, there are people who do bad things because they have compulsions they can't resist. I somehow doubt they are the ones causing the vast majority of suffering in the world, especially compared to the systemic evil some people perpetrate on people different from themselves.

Which makes getting in the habit of thinking of real-people-who-reset-after-a-month as not-real-people-at-all a pretty risky choice, morally speaking.

  but he was able to reform or see the light.
#+end_quote

I'm certainly not arguing that redemption is impossible. It's just a /ridiculously/ harder path than just not bothering to become evil in the first place.
