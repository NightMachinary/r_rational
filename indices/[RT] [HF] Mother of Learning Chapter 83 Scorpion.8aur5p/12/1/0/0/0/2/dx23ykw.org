  Are they not people just because their lives only last a month?

No, they are not people. The gods themselves looked at this question and decided it. In universe, that's literally as close as you can get to an objectively correct answer.

Also, remember that Zach and Zorian are trying to figure out how to stop the invasion. They could end every time loop before the mass-murder starts, but instead they try and figure out how to stop it and in doing so, condemn the entire city to be killed. Should they trigger the marker early every month, just so that kids won't get killed by war trolls?
