What? They don't relive the same events over and over, they're brand new copies of the originals from the unchanged template the gate took at the start. It's like copy and paste. After you paste something you can do all sorts of things with it (like killing it via invasion) but when you click control V again it's still a whole new copy, independent of anything that has happened to the first copy.

Thus, Zorian would be stopping new being from being created by template-killing people, not saving anyone.
