Because it would cause the death of one person? I understand the need of the many over the need of the one but I find a problem with the ends justify the means as how you do something influence what that something becomes. Your actions become you if you do them often enough and it has to start from somewhere.

There is also a point of the fact [[http://www.iep.utm.edu/conseque/][Consequentialism]] looks at the whole, for example what if Zorian had to sacrifice his whole family in a blood ritual to save the Nation. By the needs of the many over the needs of the few, he has to do it. I know its an extreme example but that is generally how you discover where your ethics lie.
