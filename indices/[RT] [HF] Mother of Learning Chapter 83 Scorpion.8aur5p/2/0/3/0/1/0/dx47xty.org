I'm betting Red Robe subverted it with the help of QI. After all, how else is an otherwise mediocre mage going to get that done in a hurry?

So he gets QI's help with either making the temporary marker permanent, or just resetting its counter each loop (hence explaining why Red Robe was initially helping QI).
