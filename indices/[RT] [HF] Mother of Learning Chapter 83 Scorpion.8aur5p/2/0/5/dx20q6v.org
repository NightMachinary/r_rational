  what are the chances that QI used this oppurtunity to put himself into the loop?

I want to offer more elementary answer: It's not controller's soul found itself attached to the Lich's soul. The most that can happen is the other way around: the controller get ahold of Lich's soul. Therefore, QI won't be looping. There's nothing in his soul to instruct looping mechanism.
