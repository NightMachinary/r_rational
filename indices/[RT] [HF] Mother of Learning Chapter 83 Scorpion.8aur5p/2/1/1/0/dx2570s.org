Ugh it sucks they wasted so many resets not tackling the issue and shelving the entire thing as too dangerous. They don't need to dedicate an entire restart and even have one of their copies on it while they had focused on other things. They're already having so many side projects already I don't see why tricking the lich couldn't have been one of them.
