The problem is: this isn't useful combat experience. The QI they are fighting now knows that something funny is going on and is mainly using soul magic and mind magic attacks. Not to mention he has to go easy on them with the lethality of his magics otherwise they die and he gets no mind/soul to read. In contrast, normal QI will be using straight up kill magic attacks, which is an entirely different beast. So the experience they gained in this battle isn't going to match up with the battle they have planned with normal QI.
