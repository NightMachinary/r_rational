Thing is they don't really need to combat the lich as long as they could recreate the situation where Zorian used the coin trick which sounds hell a lot easier than fighting a 1000 year old lich (who they learnt now that can soul detonate himself). They don't need to throw the coin themselves as well but just use another student.

Anything else would be easier than trying to fight the lich imho.
