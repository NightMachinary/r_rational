The thing I'm saying is that they don't need to do it but make someone far less imposing do it probably a fellow student. If its happened before with Zorian then they can do it with someone else just need to set it up properly and try to manufacture a situation that take advantage of QI's arrogance. Then just keep repeating that scenario every restart they want to take his crown.

Doesn't them taking the ring or defeating QI the first time tell you that you don't always need to use brute force to get something. QI is even diplomatic that they can offer to give him the same things red robe gave the invasion in the past in order to let down his guard and learn more stuff about him.
