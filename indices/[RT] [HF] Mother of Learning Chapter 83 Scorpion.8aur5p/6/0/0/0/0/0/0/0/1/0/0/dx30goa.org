Like I keep on repeating, they don't even need to be there and why they can just try with student by giving them a coin. Just say it's rumoured to be able to defeat liches or some nonsense if you don't want to mindcontrol them.

You don't need it to succeed all the time, just only once and you're good. It's well worth the risk though it's kinda scrapped if they are on a time table and kinda annoying they never tried it earlier. It's better than them doing nothing to the lich all the restarts they knew he had the crown. Btw it only needs to be done during the invasion.
