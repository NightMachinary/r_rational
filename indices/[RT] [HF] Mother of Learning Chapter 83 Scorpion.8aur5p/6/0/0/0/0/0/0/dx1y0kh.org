It was thrown out in favor for going guns blazing. He only said he doubted he could create a situation yet nothing indicated he even tried which he should have as soon as the crown was found. They only need to do the one attempt per restart and its not like they have any other death defying ideas to do on their last day. It doesn't even need to be them and its not like leaving the lich alone for mutiple restarts was smart of them when they could at least try.

I still feel its the author trying to throw out solutions by that sentence because they want the lich to be dealt in another way.
