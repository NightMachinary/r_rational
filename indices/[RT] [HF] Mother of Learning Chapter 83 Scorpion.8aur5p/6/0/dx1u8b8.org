  Zach should have hit the restart button the moment they got what they needed out of QI. Spending a moment longer in his presence after they got the ward design was dumb, they knew he had access to extremely powerful and unknown soul magic and could betray them at any moment.

Except that the other thing they still need from QI is more experience fighting him. They expect that to escape the loops, they will need to be able to defeat him in combat and take the crown before he can escape with it - which they still haven't managed to do yet. They have a limited number of restarts remaining to test working combat strategies against him before they run out of time.
