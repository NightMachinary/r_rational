We already know there's a built in method to (temporarily) add someone to the loop for a few months. I think the dominate theory about Red Robe right now is that Zack gave him a temporary marker and he somehow subverted it to be added permanently. This theory still has the question of how Red Robe was able to subvert the temporary marker, though.
