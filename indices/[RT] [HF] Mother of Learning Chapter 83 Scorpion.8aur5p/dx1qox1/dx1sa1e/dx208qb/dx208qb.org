because its happened before, its technically possible for this explosion to put QI in the loop. However, that's stupid, because its been stated multiple times that Zorian getting into the loop is supposed to be something like the ultimate coincidence, unrecreateable. We are told the creators of the marker are smart enough to put in many safeguards, to prevent this EXACT case of transferring markers. So if 2 consecutive soul attacks bring 2 people into the loop.. that's BS and a bad plot gimmick.
