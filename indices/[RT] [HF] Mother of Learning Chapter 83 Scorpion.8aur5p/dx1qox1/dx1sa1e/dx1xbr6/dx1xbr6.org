No, /he still didn't realise what was going on/. He thought that somehow they'd trapped him in an illusion, which is why he had such a hard time believing it; his skills would make it extremely difficult to ensnare or fool him that way.

He apparently doesn't know about the Sovereign Gate. Presumably he knows the legend, given his interest in the imperial artefacts, but he doesn't know what the Gate really does, not enough to recognise what had happened.
