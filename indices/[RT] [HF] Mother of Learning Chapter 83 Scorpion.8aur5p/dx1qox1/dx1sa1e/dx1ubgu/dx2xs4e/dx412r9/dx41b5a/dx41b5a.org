It most likely is still true, yes. Simply having Soul perception is a huge plus. It allows you to better perceive what you're doing to your own soul, and what other people are doing. Being able to perceive Quatach's soul is mentioned as one of the potential tell-tale signs that Zorian perceived before he buffed up his defenses right before the blast, too.

Most likely, Zorian still generally has better defenses, and he probably responded to the attack better than what Zach did. I fully expect Zach to be out of commission for a while, although I guess that we'll see if my prediction is true next chapter.
