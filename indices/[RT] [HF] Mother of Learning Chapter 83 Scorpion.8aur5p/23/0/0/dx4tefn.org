Would it be possible for you to elaborate on some points of the story (if they are not going to be explained in the future):

1. "Since it was extremely difficult for a controller with an intact marker to unlock their soul perception through classical means, it made sense for the Shutur-Tarana to prepare a workaround for his successor." The story so far was that Shutur-Tarana established an empire. Does this imply that Sovereign Gate was actually created by him (he was actual god who decided to establish empire just for fun or whatever, not the person who discovered old relic).
2. Any particular reason for Z&Z not to put the golems into the orb (or any other opposing factions). It's a huge walking prison/temporary, useful detainment/sorting facility.\\
3. Why Z&Z didn't bring like 10-20-50-100-200 golems into the fight/ambush for QI?
4. While the QI is very very powerful, Xvim is actual defense based archmage. It takes him brief moment to re-establish his non-structural magic defense. Also you've explained that mind blank is unnatural state and it can be dispelled. However it can be also said that there's a resemblance to the reason why dispel spell does not extinguish fire caused by fire spell (mind blank is sort of disconnect from great physic net in the same fashion as holding one's breath). Spell allows to achieve that state, but it goes beyond that and to remove unnatural state target needs to be affected in the way that it would revert unnatural state (like start breathing in surprise). Xvim offered very little resistance.
5. Souls were supposed to be indestructible. The last stunt QI pulled kinda suggest that you can do pretty much anything to soul (it is like hologram - if you break it up, every tiny fragment contains the same image). It is very close to blurring the line between mangling the soul beyond recognize and actually destroying the soul
