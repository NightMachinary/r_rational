1) No, Shutur-Tarana was not a god. The imperial artifacts were clearly made with the help of a god, but the first emperor probably had a lot of input into what his fancy set of magical tools would do and look like.

2-3) It takes time for Zorian to make golems. He mostly ran out of them by the time they fought against QI.

4) It takes just a moment for Xvim to re-establish his usual mental defenses, but those defenses aren't mind blank. They cannot stand up to QI's attack. Because the disconnect from the psychic net is so unnatural to mind, they immediately snap back to their natural state when the magic forcing them is gone.

5) They are. They have an indestructible core and an outer layer that is crucial for a person's existence but can be destroyed or modified. I don't want to explain what QI actually did, since it is slightly spoilerish, but he did not violate these principles in any way.
