Regarding compulsion mind magic:

Morally speaking, I wouldn't have an issue with learning the skill. I would practice mostly on animals, which I really dislike animal experimentation, but I think the situation justifies it. (If you think the ends never justifies the means, I believe you're incorrect but let's discuss it.)

I would practice doing things like compelling birds to once a day chirp at my window if they are nearby (so they aren't compelled to leave their home it they usually live elsewhere), or having a friend say "Zach smells funny" every time they see me, and other relatively benign things---with consent of course.

If learning the skill involved breaking minds, I would start with cultists and have them report news to me or something. I would eventually practice having cultists sabotage things on the day of the invasion. Imagine several hundred cultists each with a small explosive device from Zorian who could, for example, destroy key parts of the invasion. It would be very useful and could save a lot of lives---even cultist lives if the logistics of the invasion were sufficiently disrupted to make them give up.

Outside the loop, it would be useful for dealing with baddies in a way where nobody dies and people just go to jail, though Zorian can kind of do that now in a limited sense, he could probably do it more effectively. I think there are unique uses for the skill that would be invaluable and not require Zorian to injure his moral compass, which is a sentiment I do appreciate.

I think a major issue with learning the discipline is that Zorian hasn't found a teacher and few Aranea even know how to do it and fewer still would be willing to admit they know how.
