  "Impractical," Zorian said simply. He didn't want to explain that his ability to control people was really quite limited. He may be a powerful mind mage, but he never invested much effort into figuring out how to execute those kinds of long-term compulsions. Even the aranea considered that kind of 'deep mind editing' to be sinister and repellent, to say nothing of himself. His specialty was telepathic combat and memory reading, not enslavement.

This is really a big mistake imo, god knows there's many things that could be accomplished with that kind of skillset, even if it was only used on deserving targets or when absolutely needed.
