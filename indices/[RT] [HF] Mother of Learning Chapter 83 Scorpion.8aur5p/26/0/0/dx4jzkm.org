Ehhh, to be fair, Red Robe never /did/ really get used to his full potential, since he left the loop basically right after the end of act one. Now, QI as RR 2.0 wouldn't be interesting since he could just hunt down Zorian and Zach at the start of the loop and murder them, but I /am/ sad that the third looper big bad never actually got to go fully into a game of cat and mouse with Zorian having to fiddle around while trying to make the ripples in such a way that they obscure the source.
