I've got to disagree on your first paragraph. It most likely unintended, but author has a theme going. Namely, the protagonist will enjoy victories big and small as the story goes, but something outside his knowledge screw him big way by the arc's end. In this chapter, we aren't told what's the consequences of QI soul detonation. If it screw ZZ big way next chapter, then that will mark the arc's end.

Still, this chapter cuts above many others.
