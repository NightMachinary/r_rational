If we didn't already know that this was Book 3 of 3, I'd expect for this to have been the end of Book 3 and start of Book 4, with something very critical changing fundamentally as the next phase begins. As-is I expect this will throw a monkey wrench into the works but ZZ will still figure out a solution.

Glad to see the return of real stakes, though. It's been mentioned in previous chapters that the many things ZZ need to do can get stale when the worst possible outcome for anything is losing one restart, and not only is QI one of the few opponents that outclasses ZZ his soul magic makes the stakes properly intense again.

ZZ are a lot closer to getting out now that they can get the Ring and possibly the Dagger, but the Rod is still unknown and they still have to get QI's crown. I figure we'll have at least one more 'in the loop but not particularly high stakes' arc before we start gearing up for the finale in the real world.

All-in-all, this chapter was one of the most enjoyable in quite a while and I'm looking forward to seeing the consequences of getting partially soul-energy-blasted, since last time this happened it ended up with Zorian hitching a ride in the loop.
