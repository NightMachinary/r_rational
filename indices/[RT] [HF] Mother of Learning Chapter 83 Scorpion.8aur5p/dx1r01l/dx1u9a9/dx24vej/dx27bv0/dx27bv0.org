A theory I have is when QI learned of the loop from mind raping Xvim, he decided to adhere some of his soul to Z&Z with the detonation, knowing that ultimately it wouldn't cost him anything as a fake entity.

I imagine Zorian would proably end up with a significant knowlege boost, and possibly even the divine blessing out of that, but as a main character would have enough plot armor to not be overwhelmed in mind. Zach on the other hand might start having a split personality issue and become a real threat for Zorian as QI encroaches on his soul.

It'd be a cool place to take this, since it would put a real lasting threat for Zorian, but its probably going to just be a theory since the price of Zach would be too high and the power boost would probably be a bit much (but would offset the loss of Zach)
