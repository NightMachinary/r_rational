Also souls don't work like that. In the one of the worldbuilding posts it is mentioned that when you get better at magic it is you soul getting better, not your mind and only the gods could mess with that. Additionally, I find it hard to believe that Zach could fake being of a vastly lower skill level in soul perception than he was for so long. Even if Zorian would not have noticed Alanic would have surely noticed something being off sooner or later.
