Stakes had to return at some point. I'm not sure how many chapters remain (the author is cagey about it as well) so you never do know... At the same time, you're right that the Rod remains and until then, people are safe.

Unless the author decides to kills or make otherwise unavaliable Xvim or Alanic. Things were progressing too smoothly...
