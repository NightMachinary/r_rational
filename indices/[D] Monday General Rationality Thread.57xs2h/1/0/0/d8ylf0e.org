I don't think you understand at all. I'm not sure how good a metaphor this is, but imagine what it would feel like if you were a Windows 10 operating system being run on an old IBM computer.

Also, just because almost everyone has died so far doesn't make it good nor acceptable for human beings to die. When I talk about how my body and mind are not functioning well and how isolated I am, reminding me that my body and mind will most likely stop functioning altogether at some point is not at all comforting and doesn't help and is blatantly insensitive.

My cognitive and social problems are not something that I can just learn to cope with. They need to be solved or I will go crazy.

Also, the reason I get a lot of self worth from my intelligence is because thinking and intellectual activities are what I'm best at. Notice that just because I'm better at thinking than at anything else doesn't mean that I'm good at thinking in general.
