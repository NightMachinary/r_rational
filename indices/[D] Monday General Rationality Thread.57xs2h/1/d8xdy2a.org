What trekkie13 said made me think of some of my own experiences. Sometimes I've felt like other people are rejecting me because almost none of them will try any of the things I like. I can almost never talk about anything I like or care about with anyone I know, and that makes me isolated and lonely.

However, I've also noticed an alternative explanation. Thing is, it seems like almost everyone if not just everyone I've ever met seems to either be more intelligent than me or less intelligent than me. I don't recall having ever met anyone who was even approximately my equal, intellectually.

And to a large extent, people's likes and dislikes are affected by their intelligence. Someone who's really really smart is going to get bored by a subject or activity that's mind-numbingly meaningless, useless or unchallenging, while that same activity might have a lot of shock value and be very engaging to someone who is less intelligent, even if there isn't much informational content or challenge to it. Most movies I've ever been exposed to seem to fall into this category.

I suspect that there are probably subjects or activities that people even smarter than me enjoy which I would either find boring or find really difficult to understand, but I don't yet know what they are.

I'm not sure why I've never met anyone who seemed to be as smart as I am. It seems like it should have been very improbable for everyone I meet to either be smarter than me or dumber than me with no one who is approximately just as smart as me.

I've been to the rationality meetup in my area a few times, and maybe it's possible that I have met people there who were just as smart as me and I overestimated their intelligence due to the fundamental attribution error or something. But even then my priors for that are kinda low, and it still feels like I'm out of place there because I'm just not smart enough to keep up with them, and no one else I meet seems to be smart enough to keep up with me.

I'm not trying to sound melodramatic here, but it seems like, practically speaking, that I don't really belong anywhere, and am unlikely to belong anywhere anytime soon. It would be nice if I could significantly increase or decrease my intelligence without becoming a totally different person (preferably increase, obviously). But even if I could do that I'm not entirely certain that would solve this problem anyways, since I'm not entirely certain that being stuck with a level of intelligence that very few people in my geographic area have is what's going on here.

I mean, given just the evidence available to me it seems more likely to be true than not, but it still seems weird and impossible that out of all the people who live in this huge metropolitan city and surrounding suburbs, that there would be no one or almost no one who is just as smart as I am who I could meet or have met within the past five to ten years or so. That probably means that I'm missing something here, but I don't know what, and I've been trying to figure this out since forever and I still haven't been able to figure it out, and it hurts a lot, and I usually don't think about it because if i do it will just make me upset and i never manage to come up with any good solutions anyway no matter how much i think about it. this is really really frustrating, and I feel like i would be psychologically a lot better off if i didn't have to keep avoiding talking about things that I like or care about so as not to bore other people or commit a social faux paus by making them think more or harder than they feel comfortable thinking. To an extent it seems like I've been told that it's socially not appropriate to be myself around other people because doing that makes people think and they don't like that because it's difficult and stressful for them. I feel so stifled sometimes I just want to scream. I've tried to explain this to my mom, my therapist, my behavioral consultant, my life coach, and my sisters, and I don't think any of them really understand, because they keep talking about how stressful it is for /them/ to be around /me/ even now that my social skills are a LOT better than they used to be and a lot of the time most people can't even tell that I have aspergers. and yet the amount of difficulty and stress that people have from trying to comprehend what i say has not decreased proportionally to my increase in social skills. realistically speaking, i dont think i can solve this problem on my own. please help?
