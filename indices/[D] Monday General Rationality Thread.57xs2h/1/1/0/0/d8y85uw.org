Are you physically healthy? If not, getting fit and eating healthy to eliminate brain fog is an easy step one. Step alpha, to be implemented concurrent with step one, might be to stop censoring yourself. Instead, say what you want to say in such a way that the other person or the other people may decide to pick up that conversation thread or leave it be.

Step alpha's implementation would depend on your personality. For me, I'd smile and say something like, "Confirmation~ bias~♪！" If the person knows what it is, they'll smile or otherwise acknowledge the point. If they don't, and are interested, I can then explain. If they're not interested, they'll smile or otherwise acknowledge my attention and not pick up that conversation thread.

Another example, say something you read in a book about learning, in response to someone talking about studying: "I just read something about that! Apparently, we learn by making repeated electrical spikes in our brains which force the cells to actually change their inner workings. That's why repetition spaced out over days or weeks is so critical to actually remembering anything long-term." Simplified, not rambling, and easily comprehended. You can adjust from there.

My mind works differently from yours, so I don't know how helpful this was.
