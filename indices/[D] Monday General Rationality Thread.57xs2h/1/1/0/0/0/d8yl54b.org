I'm eating quite healthy as far as I know. Haven't had desserts or bread/pasta almost all year, and my health is better than it was before. Been eating fruits and veggies and meat/eggs/cheese. Been minimizing dairy intake. Not going out to restaurants very much, and when I do it's usually just a cafe or a Mediterranean restaurant, and usually I just get a salad. But I'm still not very fit physically. I've half suspected for a while that I might be aging prematurely, but my mom who's a psychiatrist says that's not possible because people who age prematurely end up being physically elderly in their teens, not late-middle age in their early twenties. I have neck and back pain, I'm balding, I have a decent amount of gray hair, I'm short, I often have leakage and there have been times where I've lost control of my bowels, I think a lot about my mortality, I get fatigued too easily, and I look back on my life so far and see most of it as a colossal waste of time, and somehow it really doesn't feel like I have another two decades of life left in me, and everyone keeps telling me this is all in my head.
