If you have good insurance, then the argument that alleviating the stress caused by your paranoia is worth investigating to your satisfaction that there is indeed no underlying cause might work.

You can do self-research for all of your symptoms and see if something specific comes up. If it does, then you know for what to test. Regardless, have your primary care physician direct you to relevant specialists.

You may have to play up the histrionics in order for your argument to work. I don't know your financial situation, and ultimately you're responsible for deciding whether this advice is germane to your situation.
