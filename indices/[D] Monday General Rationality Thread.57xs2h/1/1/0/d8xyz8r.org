Well, the kinds of things I like to think about in general. Stuff I read, games I've played, articles I've read. And also things in or about my own life and how I'm thinking about things. Things that are interesting and intellectually engaging to talk about. I don't enjoy being restricted to only talking about movies or sports or politics or some famous actor or band who I don't know or care about, etc. usually when I try to talk to people about anything that involves any more thought then that, it goes over their head, even when the person is somewhat intelligent, and even when the person is a good friend or someone who considers themselves my family.

There are a ton of things I would like to talk about with people and I almost never get the chance to. I've been censoring myself for so long that it's kinda habitual by now. I have trouble opening up to people and relaxing around anybody because I know that if I do I will say something that they will misunderstand or misjudge. It's not that I'm lying to people or keeping secrets from them, it's that most of what I think will just go over their heads and because of that they just don't want to hear it, so I have to "tone it down" by which I mean dumb down my self expression until I'm only expressing things that are simple and common enough for other people to understand and relate to. This makes me feel very stifled.

As for those who are smarter than me, I'm not smart enough to be worth it for them to talk to. I have a lot of brain fog and my mind just stops working sometimes. Like, there will be times that happen very frequently where I can't think clearly and have trouble focusing, and because of that I say and do really really dumb things that no smart person would say or do. And I realize after the fact that whatever I said or did was very stupid, but I can't seem to figure things out ahead of time. Additionally, I'm awful at coming up with original ideas for solving problems, despite my high levels of creativity in my writing.

I'm not sure if I have a high natural intelligence and health problems are getting in the way, or if I'm naturally very stupid and trying to compensate for it. Whatever the reason, the limits of my cognitive abilities feel like the walls of a cage. I've become more and more aware of these walls over time and I can't break through them because I don't have enough mental energy to do so. And I'm pretty sure people aren't supposed to be able to feel those walls like that. Not to the point where they feel confined and trapped in their own inadequate heads. I have never heard of anyone feeling stifled by their effective lack of intelligence. I often have trouble thinking straight, and I need to be able to think straight, and it feels like torture that I have so much trouble thinking straight, because thinking is something I really like and enjoy and if I can't think I can't do the things I like and do what I want to do with my life.

So I guess the problem is two-fold: I'm being stifled by lack of intellectually stimulating social interaction, and by my own mental deficits. I want to talk with people about things that are interesting or relatable to me and I can almost never do that. And I want to be able to think intelligently about such things too, and I can only do that like half the time, and even then I still can't think as intelligently as I feel like I ought to be able to.
