I've always been a little insecure over what fiction I like or dislike, though I've come to terms with my tastes now that I've accepted the subjectivity of my feelings. However, whenever I think someone is making a statement about the objective quality of a piece of fiction that my opinion conflicts with, I get angry.

It happened again [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/57gsnp/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d8svf0t][last week]] when I got in an argument over whether Worm was a good deconstruction of superheroes, and I was infuriated with with the fact that my comments got fewer upvotes. I felt like people were saying my opinion was wrong and needed to prove them wrong, but that's ridiculous.

I've decided it's something I should fix about myself, but I'm not sure how. I should just be okay with people having their own opinion, especially about something inconsequential like this, but whenever someone states what I think is just their opinion as fact I can't let it go, especially when it's inconsequential.
