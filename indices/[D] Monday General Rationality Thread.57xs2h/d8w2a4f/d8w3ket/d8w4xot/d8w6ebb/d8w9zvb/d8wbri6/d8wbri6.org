They didn't refer you? That was the whole point. This one is the treatment referral service, so they'll definitely refer you: 1-800-662-4357

There are only so many techniques, and eventually you'll learn them all. Applying them to your own situation is orthogonal to knowing what they are and having tried them a few times.

If I may be lazy and use a metaphor, imagine trees have muscles, and all humans are thin trees. We know how to stand up straight, but it's hard and sometimes we're tired. That's why we tie ourselves to wooden posts. It's the post's job to make sure we stand tall until we can do so on our own power. Some of us are really strong or disciplined and can stand tall by themselves without needing a permanent post. Maybe they know really effective standing techniques and applying those techniques have become habit. Others of us give up and fall to the ground and become sideways trees, indistinguishable from the dirt. Stand tall, trekie. Get yourself a wooden post. Make the call.

- Irrelevant to the message but it may irk you: the twine would be the bond of honest communication and good-faith effort binding you to the post, i.e. therapist.

Make the call, meet the therapist. "I've tried technique /x/, /y/, /u/, and /s/."

Let them take it from there.
