The suicide prevention hotline was a bit much, I'm not actually contemplating self-harm, but I appreciate the sentiment. Unfortunately, it did me no good. They listened, but all their suggestions were things I had already done that hadn't worked or I wasn't willing to do. They did congratulate me on my self awareness, though.

I should seek out therapy, but this is the problem I've had with it in the past. Most of the advice I hear are things I've already figured out by myself, since that was how I dealt with my autism and anxiety. I've tried to fix my problems on my own, but all my solutions have proven temporary at best. I don't know what to do anymore.
