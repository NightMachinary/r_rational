Thanks. I've calmed down now that I've come home and once my Mom is done with work we can hash out a plan. I don't have a psychiatrist, I haven't been to therapy since I was a little kid and haven't even needed special assistance with psychological issues for years. Even my anxiety has been manageable up until recently, with today breaking the pattern of a minor attack every 3-6 months.

This is actually the first time in years my issues have disrupted my work obligations. Things have gotten worse over the past year when I started having depression episodes, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that things started to get out of control. Last week I realized how bad it had gotten and resolved to get help, only to do nothing even though I know what I need to do.
