Ok, now we need to work out the first thing first: why aren't you able to take your own advice right now?

That involves a secondary question: do you have family, friends, or other loved ones whom you trust to take care of you, should you feel the need to declare yourself temporarily incompetent for everyday life or major life choices?

Further questions:

- Do you think you have a chemical-level depression? If so, talk therapy won't help all on its own. You should see a psychiatrist and seek temporary medication.

- Do you already have a psychiatrist? If you don't feel that you're going to harm yourself or others, you won't be able to get yourself involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital (which is a tortuous, terrifying, and traumatic experience /anyway/, so avoid it!), so you will need to find a psychiatrist under your own power.

- Do you have a general practitioner or "home-base" medical clinic? That should be your first stop if you don't already have a psychiatrist.

Pretty much everyone on this sub has dealt with some variant of neuro-atypicality, so feel free to keep asking questions. We're not trained professionals, though.

Good luck. Write back.
