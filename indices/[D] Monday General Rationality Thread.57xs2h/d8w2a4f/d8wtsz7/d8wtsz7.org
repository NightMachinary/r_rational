Definitely suggest getting tehrapy. Unfortunately, finding a good therapist is something of a crapshoot. At least a quarter of my colleagues within my current department at work seem to be utterly hopeless at any issue that isn't their particular interest or educational focus, and I don't think half of my graduating class in my Master's Program should have been given degrees.

If you need help finding a good one, PM me again and I can talk you through some of the options and modalities out there that you can try to look for.
