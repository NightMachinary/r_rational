It's also not very mentally healthy. Upvotes are zero-sum, insofar as exerting the effort to become able to easily rally support for one's opinions among the rational tribe, or any anonymous forum, primarily serves to inflate one's ego. While fora can be good media through which to practice rhetoric as you suggested, the feedback of upvotes or downvotes don't tell one much about what was or wasn't effective. If the goal is to improve one's skill at rhetoric methods of practice that give more immediate feedback will help one more in pre-mastery stages than those that rely upon asynchronous and broadly binary feedback mechanisms.

Of course, an inefficient motivator is better than none at all. I wrote this to point out that it's easy latch on to the 'why' of actions as having a rational basis, when in fact that 'why' is an ex post facto rationalization that assumes a goal one doesn't actually have. No matter how instrumentally rational an action may be for someone with that goal, that rationale does not apply if one doesn't consciously share it.

It's more honest, [[/u/trekie140]], and thus more mentally healthy to address why you need to Show Them All, than to try to twist it into a motivator for pursuing a goal that you decided to pursue solely to continue acting as you were before.

That said, Red intimates one method that might help: get a book on rhetoric, or find an online source, and only allow yourself to indulge your argumentative urge if you employ a new rhetorical technique or an old one in a new way. Further, and this is the most important part for purposes of changing your behavior, only start to write or formulate your response */after/* checking your reference source and using it to help craft your argument.

Put succinctly:

Pause, notice the urge, get up and fetch or open a tab to your reference, formulate, then return to the conversation and write. If in person, take out a notebook (carry this in your pocket or bag), politely ask the person to state their argument, then put it away while asking if they're okay with you responding to their assertion later. If they think it's weird, don't, and when you return home to your reference source just use the argument as practice anyway. Post it online, or something.

If you'd like to get rid of the urge cold turkey, there are other methods I think others will point out. Reading the LW posts about arguing for truth rather than to win might help as well. I'm not an expert on autism so I feel much less comfortable giving you any further advice beyond seeing a therapist immediately. Please post the links and explanations for me, someone.
