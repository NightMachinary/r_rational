I get what you're saying, but my concern isn't over my skills at persuading people. My concern is the fact that I'm feeling something that is clearly irrational, or at least not worth getting worked up over, but I have repeatedly in spite of that knowledge. I want to figure out how to fix that so I don't care that people have a different perspective than me on the objective quality of works of fiction.
