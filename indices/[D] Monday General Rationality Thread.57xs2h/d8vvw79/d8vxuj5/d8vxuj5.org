It'd probably be easier (and more profitable) to improve your skills as a demagogue than to remove your impulse to attribute significance to number of upvotes. Your posts got fewer upvotes for two reasons. First, because they contained fewer segments that were fun to read, like work-showing, chains of implication, and Deep Insights. Second, because your argument was negative (Thing A is not a member of category B reasons) while his was positive (Thing A is a member of category B reasons), so his was creating something interesting for the reader to consume, while yours was explaining why an interesting thing was actually not.

I'd recommend against removing your urge to Show Them All. Pursuit of incrementally higher numbers is a strong motivator for anything that can be measured in terms of upvotes.
