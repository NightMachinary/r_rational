They do, actually have an option. You can even set up three different break timers for different schedules, so that you can have one set of pomodoros for when you're working and another set for when you've gotten home but have other things to do (like writing).

The fact that I can have different things blocked at different times is also really helpful. Right now I have a plain old "distractions" list that goes up for most of the day, but I also set up a "never go here" list that's up for the entire day, to keep me away from e.g. gaming sites like Kongregate, because games are tempting in the moment but I have a bad habit of playing long after they've stopped being fun, because I Am An Awful Quitter If I Stop Playing Before The Game Is 100% Complete On The Highest Difficulty Setting.

It also prevents me from cheating. Using blockers on google chrome only works until I say, "screw it," and remove the extension. I can't do that with Cold Turkey, and I can lock it so that I can't change the schedule for a given period of time (right now, two weeks).

It also has a setting to lock me out of the computer for a block of time, so that I don't spend the night on the computer, and so that I can break my habit of checking the news every morning (which has started to cost me around an hour or more every day as the election has progressed).
