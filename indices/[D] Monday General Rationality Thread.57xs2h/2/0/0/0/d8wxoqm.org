Ah, that completionist urge is something I know very well.

I attribute it to having spent the majority of my life with little disposable income, thus treasuring the time spent in escapism with every game.

I'm trying to break myself of that habit, but it's slow going. My whole reward reaction is miswired, seemingly disconnected from actual enjoyment. To use a non-game example, I seem to feel satisfaction for coming up with cool story ideas without actually writing them.

My current approach is to periodically ask myself "Am I having fun?". If I'm not having fun---if I'm becoming stressed over difficulties with no satisfaction from surmounting obstacles, or I'm just mindlessly completing objectives---then the /idea/ is that I should stop. Actually committing to that is harder than it ought to be.
