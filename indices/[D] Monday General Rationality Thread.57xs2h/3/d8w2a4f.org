I already posted today, but something much more important came up. I think my depression is destroying my ability to think rationally. I keep thinking and doing things that are very out of character for me and I know aren't good, but I can't stop myself. It's hard to even talk to people about this situation, both because I'm autistic and because I keep rejecting their advice even though I know they're right. I know I need to fix things, but even when I know how I can't.

This would be easier to deal with if I'd faced it before, but I've spent my entire life battling autism and none of my strategies for that work here. I can't even build new strategies because I can't think straight. I could get help from others, but I either focus my effort on something else or I'm too apathetic to do anything. I don't care about doing the work I have to do anymore, which is the antithesis of my entire philosophy of life but none of it seems to matter anymore.
