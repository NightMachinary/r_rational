The only easy suggestion I can make is to--

Actually, I have a lot of suggestions.

Ensure you're consuming have adequate amounts of omega 3s, are consuming antioxidants (ginger root, turmeric + 1/20th black pepper, and amla powder are easy supplements to add to food and get high amounts of anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants), aren't consuming more polyunsaturated fats than saturated or monounsaturated, and stretch if possible.

While more controversial, you can buy pure glycine and supplement 10-30g of that a day with food and perhaps hydrolyzed collagen or dissolved gelatin just in case glycine by itself isn't that bioavailable. It may assist in joint maintenance and repair. If you have digestion issues, go see a specialist and have them help you fix them, as chronic systemic inflammation could stem from that and be aging you slowly but still prematurely.

Before or concurrent with doing all that, though, you should probably see some specialists just to make sure you don't have something rare or unnoticed.
