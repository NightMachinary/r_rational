what kind of specialists should I see? ive been seeing a primary care doctor twice a year and getting blood tests at least twice a year as well. both my mom and my primary care doctor seem hesitant to take my concerns about this seriously. each and every one of the symptoms I described already have their own alternative explanations. Like, the meds im taking can cause brain fog and make it harder to masturbate, my gray and balding hair is genetic could be caused by stress, the back and neck pain is caused by me being tense and stress from having lived with a psychologically abusive and controlling father for most of my life and from having aspergers, etc. When you put it all together it seems like too big a coincidence and it really does look like i really am aging prematurely, but my mom isn't even willing to investigate it, she said my primary care doctor would have seen that from the blood tests even though they weren't specifically looking for it, and my primary care doctor agrees with my mom that i am being paranoid. i am quite sure that i am not being paranoid because any normal person who experienced my symptoms would think the same thing, and i dont understand why my mom and my primary care doctor dont seem to even be willing to check.
