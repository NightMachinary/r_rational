I have a similar problem. I'm sick of one-to-many communication on the web, and would love to have somebody to talk about things I like to think about. Thinking is a big part of my life, but other people around me get tired of it, and this makes me feel isolated. The forums that I am most active in are not suitable for general discussion, and not so much at intellectual level. Was thinking about starting an open source organization for intellectual discussion and ideas and get in touch with others, something we could do if we want to expand on this idea.

Btw, I do a lot of programming ([[http://www.piston.rs/]]), so you know who I am. If you're interested, you could PM me, and we can discuss what to do about it?
