Hey, I hope I'm not assuming too much here, but from what I'm seeing in this comment and your other replies, you seem like a person who gets a lot of their self-worth from their intelligence. Like, an unhealthy amount. I get that you value intelligence a lot, and I think a great portion of the people here are the same to some extent, but you can't go through life obsessing about how smart you or the people around you are. That way lies madness. Trust me; I know from experience.

Something tells me that if you took a deep breath and just stopped thinking about it so much, you would be a thousand times more happier than you are now. I get what you mean about how people only keep talking about how /you/ affect /them/. It's frustrating because it feels like no one really gives a shit. Like they're only bothering to deal with your problems so /they/ can be better off.

Unfortunately, that's just the human condition. You can't really expect someone to understand you if you're not willing to see what problems they have with your behavior. I know it's hard, and even painful at times, but you have to make an effort to see yourself through the eyes of those around you. Don't make excuses for yourself or downplay the flaws they point out in you. You'll never improve if you're not willing to do this.

Have you ever stopped to think /why/ you value intelligence so much? You do realize it's all pointless when you get to the bottom of it, right? Anything you do in your life will eventually be forgotten. Everything turns to dust, everyone dies, and eventually entropy will get the better of the universe and make it not work anymore. It doesn't matter how intelligent you are, the smartest guy on the planet and the stupidest idiot alive all end up the same in the end.

You're worrying about something so abstract and relative that it borders on silly when you really think about it. Not that I'm downplaying what you're going through or anything. I can relate to what you're going through, and if you get anything out of this, I hope it's that you're not alone here. Don't give up on forming meaningful connections with people. This suffering is temporary and you'll eventually figure things out yourself.
