Okay. But the wish that [[/u/Jiro_T]] proposed was "You make your first wish be that the genie will be free *conditional on you being satisfied with your second and third wishes*" If the genie is on your side, he's not going to stop being on your side after you precommit to doing him a major solid, even if there's a minor caveat on it. (Or, at least, I wouldn't be.) In fact, he's now super motivated to make sure you're happy.
