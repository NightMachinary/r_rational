If you think the Genie might screw you over, you really have no chance to stop it.

I mean, what kind of theories could you have about the Genie?

- If the Genie is completely fair and honest, any reasonable wish will do here.
- If the Genie is completely fair with wishes, but might screw you over once freed, that could happen anyway. The only way to stop this is to avoid anything that /might/ free the Genie.
- If the Genie has lied about twisting wishes, the Genie could be lying about anything. "Evil omnipotent being trying to screw you over with wishes" is a possibility, but so is "Omnipotent being using your wish choice as a test of character" and "Omnipotent being not actually planning to grant wishes but toying with you" and "Hallucinogenic mushroom". In this case, you have no way to get true knowledge about the nature of wishes, so no wish you make is guaranteed safe.
