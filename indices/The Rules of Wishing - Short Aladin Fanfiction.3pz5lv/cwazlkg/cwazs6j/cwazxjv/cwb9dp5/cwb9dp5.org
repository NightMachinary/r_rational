Hm. This is a good point, but I think the "conditional on you being satisfied with your second and third wishes" part kinda ruins the trust angle, which Jasmine in particular is clearly going for. "I wish for you to be free after I've made the rest of my wishes" works though. I may retcon that in, thanks. :-)
