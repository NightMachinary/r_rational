That's a good point.

If this is developed into a longer story with back and forth combat between the three, then it might be interesting to show Kingdom/Genie/Jasmine as having /less/ power than Aladdin or Jaffar.

Aladdin wished for "as much power as possible", and presumably got it. Jasmine just wished for "as much power as you think is safe/best for me to have and would make me happy". Jaffar has the perfect understanding of wishes, and /presumably/ made one or two wishes we didn't see. (He had the knowledge to put his heart in a jar, which probably didn't come from the first wish, so he likely made at least one more.) Jaffar's wish was probably excellently worded, but had to force an uncooperative Genie, so I'd expect he ended up with less power than Aladdin.

So, I expect the rankings are:

Knowledge: Jasmine > Jaffar > Aladdin

Magical Power: Aladdin > Jaffar > Jasmine

The newly-freed Genie's an unknown on that scale. Aladdin has "as much power as possible for a free being to have". Genie /might/ have that much, but I'd expect not. In cannon the freed genie had much less than that - it seemed less than cannon Jaffar after he wished to be "The Most Powerful Sorcerer In The World", which is likely less than "The Most Powerful Sorcerer Possible".
