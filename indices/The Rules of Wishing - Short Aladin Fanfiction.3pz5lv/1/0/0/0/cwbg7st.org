Thanks for the kind words. :-)

RE other things I've written:

There are a couple of other things on AO3. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335][Stargate Physics 101]] is probably the best of them (I think it's been posted here previously)

I also have a blog. It's mostly non-fiction about whatever is on my mind at the moment has some non fanfic fiction on it - mostly very short. You can see it [[http://www.drmaciver.com/category/fiction/][in the fiction category]]. Of these, [[http://www.drmaciver.com/2009/04/gates/][gates]] seems to have been the most popular.

I also have [[http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][a software testing library]], but that's probably not what you had in mind. ;-)
