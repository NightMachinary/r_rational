Well, it's every time someone thinks of a loophole- which doesn't require they have a genie or understand genie rules, to start with- just coming up with a new genie loophole, given that most people think the obvious ones are fulfilled, there might be that much potential divergence.

There might be more worlds than this one with lamps floating around. I doubt aladin thought of 62 different loopholes alone- not because he couldn't have, but because it's pretty hard to come up with 62 new loopholes for over 5000 rules without finding a valid version first.
