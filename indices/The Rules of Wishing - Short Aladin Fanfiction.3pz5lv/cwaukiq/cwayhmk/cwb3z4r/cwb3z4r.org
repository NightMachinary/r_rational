It's good that the genie's been set free, and the opposing forces so far are 5, right? "The Kingdom", Jafar, Aladdin, Jasmine, and The Genie...

There's tons to be drawn from the wooing between someone "as powerful as a free-genie" and someone who's been granted "the best possible wish as per the genie's consideration". I'd assume the Genie is now siding with Jasmine rather than Aladdin, since well, she rocked the shit out of her wishes. So the forces are Basically Kingdom-Genie-Jas Vs Al Vs Jafar, and as far as power goes, it remains to be seen who is more powerful between Jafar or Aladdin, sin forseeably, Jaffar's last wish was wiser, but probably resulted in a less powerful outcome. Still, in Jasmine Vs Jaffar, Jas has the upper hand, since as far as it goes, The genie might have use the knowledge of the wishes he granted to Jafar and Aladdin, even without telling her (thus probably adding a new rule). Also, now Aladdin and The Genie are identical matches, level wise.

Still, jasmine has the kingdom, and now bff with an ex-genie. Short from Jafar killing her, she's definitely about to become the best ruler of all fucking times.
