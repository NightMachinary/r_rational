I've always wondered if the design would actually work. If cautious scientists are the ones to discover it, then maybe they would work in from the outside, understanding each level as they went. If so, they would back off and survive.

What if, instead, the people to discover it were a bunch of wildcat goldminers? Or some not-too-bright tomb raiders? I've always felt that there are more of this type of people than of the cautious type, and it seems more probable to me that they would /not/ take the time to investigate slowly, instead delving straight to the center to see "the goodies" or "the point of it all."

What do you all think?
