I think the combination of curiosity and uncorrected anthropic bias - 'how dangerous can it be, we've always been fine before!' - would lead to it's unsealing very quickly.

IMO the best option would be to hide it as completely as possible, so that anyone capable of finding it will also understand the contents. After all, "This is not a place of honour, nothing is valuable here" sounds exactly like what you'd say to keep people away, whereas "Warning, nuclear waste dump" in an unassuming hidden mineshaft just makes me want to stay away.

Make it as uninteresting as possible, and hope for the best... or better, avoid creating such waste in the first place.
