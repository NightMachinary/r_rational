The WIPP design team considered and specifically rejected obscuration:

#+begin_quote
  The site must be marked. Aside from a legal requirement, the site will be indelibly imprinted by the human activity associated with waste disposal. We must complete the process by explaining what has been done and why.
#+end_quote

Which I think is reasonable. Obscuration might work if you build it in the mountains and pay special attention to keeping the associated processing and packaging facilities underground or hidden. But in the desert, even slight evidence can last for a very long time. The Nazca Lines are [[http://epod.usra.edu/.a/6a0105371bb32c970b01901ec67911970b-pi][surprisingly tiny]] but have already lasted for 1500 years. Concealing something like [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant_2004.jpg/1920px-Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant_2004.jpg][the WIPP's aboveground facilities]] is basically impossible.

Also, take into account that the "tomb" in this fic is not very well designed and may have poisoned your intuition for the entire class of objects. It resembles other valuable archaeological finds in design direction and architectural symbolism, suggesting that the installation has something valuable to defend. Even worse, there's a clear "way forward", so the spikes and messages are defenses rather than warnings.

A well-designed marker is simply a forbidding field of spikes or a sixteen-square-kilometer slab of obsidian, with nowhere to go and no implied reward. If there is a way to go, it's toward a central monolith where the path clearly ends. Even if a civilization can muster the industrial might necessary to dig deep enough the lack of clear reward and path make it vastly more difficult to get the necessary billions of dollars of investment on board.
