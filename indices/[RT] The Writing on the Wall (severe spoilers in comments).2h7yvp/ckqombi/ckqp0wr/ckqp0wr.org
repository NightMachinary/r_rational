Yeah. To make it even worse, the described symptoms couldn't happen if the inner containment was still working properly. So one of the earlier groups must have been deliberately trying to retrieve the contents, and when the effects became clear the work continued anyway.

Luckily [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/42409/1/the-writing-on-the-wall/the-writing-on-the-wall#comment/1078069][this recursive-fic comment]] fixes everything by explaining the story as an in-universe Daring Doo fanfic by Twilight.
