Ponies live on a death planet only barely restrained by magic and a g rating.

This author's written a lot of dark stories, which honestly vary in quality.

Personally, I think that it could've been given a relatively happy ending by saving some of the victims with a genetic reset. With an undamaged reference piece of genetic material, magic could undo the genetic level damage without needing to rely on anentropic bullshit.
