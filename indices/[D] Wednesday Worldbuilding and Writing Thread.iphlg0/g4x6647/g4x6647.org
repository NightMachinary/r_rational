I'm trying to design a world (which will hopefully become my nanowrimo project) but I think I need some help with population dynamics...

Everyone on Tauschwa has 5 lives, they are reincarnated and reborn with all their memories each time and everyone on the planet treats this as just obviously true because they've seen the evidence. New people are born, grow up much as we do and die, but they're called newborns for the whole of their first life. When someone dies they are reborn to a pregnant person who is usually relatively nearby, and their memories return during their first year or two as if they are waking up from a long illness. People are usually reborn pretty soon after death, but not always instantly.

But what does this say about population numbers? If the population is stable, then fine, and if it's growing then you just get more newborns, but if it falls, even temporarily, there could be a backlog of people waiting to be reincarnated. Tauschwans strong believe that everyone gets exactly 5 lives, no matter what, but how can I make that work? I keep thinking I'm missing something important - am I?
