Small declines in population aren't actually a problem. People only get 5 lives, which means that given a population in equilibrium, 1/5 deaths will be final, and 1/5 births will be newborns. To get a backlog, you'd either need substantial short-term population decline, or a sustained decrease in births. For example, you might have a backlog for a few years if you had a 20% population decline over the span of a few years due to drought, famine, war, etc.

One important factor to consider is when the reincarnation happens - at fertilization, at birth, or maybe a year after birth? If it occurs at fertilization, there is a 30-50% miscarriage rate. If reincarnation occurs at birth, keep in mind that current worldwide infant mortality rates as of 2018 vary between 1.7 to 121.5 of every 1,000 live births. Also, if it does occur at birth, keep in mind that as of 2017, worldwide maternal mortality ratios vary between 2 to 1,150 deaths per 100,000 live births, though most of these would occur after birth rather than before. Nonetheless, you may have a not-insignificant number of women who give birth to themselves. Obviously, that number would surge significantly if reincarnation happens one year after birth.

  People are usually reborn pretty soon after death, but not always instantly. ... what does this say about population numbers?

This could reflect a highly localized reincarnation process, possibly with some random variation as well. Suppose that when you die, your soul starts moving around randomly in relation to your place of death (or birth? Or home?). Your soul's precise location could be modeled in spherical coordinates with random azimuthal and polar angles, and a variable distance following a log-normal distribution. Reincarnation doesn't happen until your soul actually collides with a infant/fetus/whatever young enough to accept it.

If souls do stay close to the area where they died, then it could be fairly useful. Murderers, rapists, war criminals, and their ilk could be captured alive and then executed in a secured area far from civilization, like a remote island with an all-male guard force. If souls stay close to their area of birth, or their home, then it would be very inconvenient, since truly getting rid of people like that might require abandoning their place of birth or the area near their home.
