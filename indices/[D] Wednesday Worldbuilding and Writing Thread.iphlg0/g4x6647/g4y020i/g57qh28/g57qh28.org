Thanks, you've given me a lot to think about. I quite like the idea of someone being their own mother and will maybe work that in as a myth at least :-)

As for capital punishment, it's simply not possible in this system, unless you are prepared to kill a lot of children. The soul in your scenario will eventually wander further and go to another region to be born, which I suppose could serve to export the problem, and the reborn killer could of course refuse to say who they were in their past life.
