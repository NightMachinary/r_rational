Thanks. I don't think this is entirely true, judging from the parents I know, but it would lead to a different kind of parenting which was more about protection from harm. My picture of the society is that children go to the children's centre at an early age, but they do still feel a bond to the person who has provided their genetic material as well as sustenance in their first few years. And their species only develop breast tissue for breast feeding, so they don't usually associate it with sex or attractiveness (to do so is a fetish, but not a common one)
