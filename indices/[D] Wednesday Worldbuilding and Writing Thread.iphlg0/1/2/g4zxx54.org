One rather significant issue that hasn't been brought up is that people in this setting have no intrinsic incentive to have children. If a child is most likely to be a reincarnation with all their prior memories, the bond between parent and child just isn't tenable in this scenario. It also seems like infant death and malnutrition would be incredibly common, since who the hell would want to breastfeed some random adult in the body of an infant? So having kids only makes sense if you want to extract resources from them, such as in the form of free labor.

Essentially in this scenario the idea of a parent-child bond probably wouldn't exist, in place of something more akin to indentured servitude. Also if this is the case, then this species (provided evolution meaningfully applies) should have evolved radically different psychology from that of humans.
