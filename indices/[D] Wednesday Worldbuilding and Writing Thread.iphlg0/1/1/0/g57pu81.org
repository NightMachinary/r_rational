Thanks that was very helpful. I think this world is what Ursula le Guin calls post fast forward - i.e. they have had their big technology boom and now live a relatively stable life, using some excellent bits of technology but not being ruled by them. I suspect that being effectively governed by people who've lived a few times will slow things down a bit in terms of change.

I am assuming the reincarnation backlog works somewhat randomly, with the soul searching for a suitable host outward from its place of death, but for unlucky souls that could still mean some people having to wait a long time as well as being born into cultures they are unfamiliar with.
