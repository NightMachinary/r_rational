What kind of setting is it, in terms of technology and culture?

World population in 1900 was roughly 1.6 billion, and today, is roughly 7 billion. In this world, that would represent an /enormous/ growth in the proportion of people who are "newborn", which would presumably have some consequences for the social and political structures that they've built.

  If the population is stable, then fine, and if it's growing then you just get more newborns, but if it falls, even temporarily, there could be a backlog of people waiting to be reincarnated. Tauschwans strong believe that everyone gets exactly 5 lives, no matter what, but how can I make that work?

IMO, there would be some strong cultural impetus for increasing the population as much as possible in order to ensure that everyone really does get five lives.

Interestingly, you do need to decide how this "backlog" works. You have a lot of options (these are just the first that come to mind):

- First in, first out: The person who died earliest gets reincarnated first
- First in, last out: The person who died most recently gets reincarnated first
- Life increment ordering, ascending: Those with most lives lived get reincarnated first, with ties broken somehow
- Life increment ordering, descending: Those with the fewest lives lived get reincarnated first, with ties broken somehow
- Random: There is no order to how the backlog is cleared

All of these would result in different outcomes if the backlog ever came into play. Narratively, I would probably like "first in, last out" best, since it means that as the backlog clears, you might get people who came out into a world that was radically different from what they remembered, two hundred years having passed.

Perhaps, if it becomes known that there /is/ a backlog, the idea that there will be a population boom to make up for it would become an article of faith for some people.

(I don't know if any of that is helpful, or if you've thought about it before.)
