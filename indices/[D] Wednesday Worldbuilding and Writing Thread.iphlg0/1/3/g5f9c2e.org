Fuck I typed out a bunch and lost the comment. Guess I'm doing it again but simplified.

You don't specify human, so make the pregnancy process weird. Let twins/triplets/etc be a common occurance, based of some paused period of development during pregnancy that has encountered loose souls given a body cloned from the original embryo. Coukd also make every default birth a newborn, with family structures among siblings being based around guiding the newborn from the pair/group that evebtually occurs. Also gets around parents being born with kids who are "not theirs" in a sense and not caring for them if you could come out of pregnancy with no newborns.

You can always fiddle with pregnancy frequency by changing the culture around it, or having the act require additional parties rather than two people, even if the majority of intimacy is between two.
