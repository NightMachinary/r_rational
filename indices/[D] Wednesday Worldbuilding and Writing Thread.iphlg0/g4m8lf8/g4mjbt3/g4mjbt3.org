I'm writing original urban fantasy and while I definitely see the universe I write ultimately ending with transhumanism, here's why it hasn't got there yet:

- majority of supes live separately from humans and don't care about humans (and don't have a way to make a human immortal anyhoo)
- where relevant, supernatural beings are scared of sharing power / space with humans
- there's no reliable way to grant someone immortality: the vampire transformation process has a 50%++++ failure rate (higher the sicker you are so don't just wait until you get terminal cancer and roll the rice, you WILL Die Forever); vampire blood keeps you alive but binds you into that vampire's service
- vampires require a human source of blood (True Blood doesn't and possibly can't exist)
- vampires don't understand how vampirism works
- vampire culture got fucked up in a big way as a result of a massive and recent population bottleneck
- werewolfishness is recessive/genetic
- being a vampire does fuck with your brain and may turn you evil

There's definitely ways to address the above, but it requires technology that vampires just haven't developed.

(I know there's definitely transhumanists on here that would jump at the chance of a 50% chance of immortality VS 50% chance of dying Right Now, but it's a hard sell for the average person!)
