Has anyone else noticed that urban fantasy really isn't transhumanist enough? Like, the main character finds out that there's a secret world underlying the human one with magic and monsters, and they don't even think of exploiting this to further human welfare? It's bad enough when there's some sort of magical "veil" up, (at the very least, you could come up with a plan to massively increase the amount of people under the veil who can thoroughly study it with the scientific method), but for the occasional work where humans and magic creatures coexist in the daylight, somehow the world is still basically just our own, with a few aesthetic trappings changes.

Alicorn's Luminosity is one big counterexample, what with Bella's goals of maximizing the amount of vampires, and therefore immortals, and I suppose the Artemis Fowl series eventually ends with The fairies gradually starting to roll out magic and advanced tech to the humans but it strikes me as lazy that so few authors even consider the issue.

The obvious solution is to just write a pro-transhumanist character, but on some level that feels unsatisfying, because why were there no transhumanists before them? Why did no one else have the idea to spread magic into the mundane world? I can think of a few justifications (illegality enforced by a corrupt magical establishment that wants to hold onto their power (Harry Potter), magic is inherently dangerous and 'evil' (Pact), no one is interested in uplifting humanity once the prospect of hot vampire sex is dangled in front of them (Twilight)). Can anyone else think of others?
