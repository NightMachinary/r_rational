Also, using the random words up until now allows you the extra meaning with the blahs that Athos doesn't just not understand what Eugene is saying here, but has actively stopped listening because Eugene is just being a big meanie and whatever he's ranting about isn't important anyway, which I thought was a really clever bit and would be sorry to see it go.

Another option to separate out the nonsense words, if your various hosting sites allow it, is different fonts. Maybe play with serif vs. sans serif but otherwise similar.
