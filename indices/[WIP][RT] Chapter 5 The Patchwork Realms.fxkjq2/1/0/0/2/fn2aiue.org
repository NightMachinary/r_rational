  I may switch to blah blah for all of the unknown words. It's easier to write, for one thing, and I can see how it would be easier to read.

I'm another person who kinda liked the gibberish - the more so because Artos caught on gradually but quick, and it's tapering off now. Whatever you decide though, you do you; you're the author, it's your story.

But if it's a question of the work involved: I don't know if it would be more or less interesting/annoying to read, but maybe you could find a [[https://www.google.com/search?ei=jVGRXrSVLe-j_Qbf8J-gDw&q=gibberish+OR+nonsense+translator+OR+generator][gibberish translator]] or [[https://www.google.com/search?q=cipher+text+encoder][cipher text encoder]] that suits your needs, or even just use find-replace to substitute a gibberish word for the real word everywhere. For some readers, keeping the English to Gibberish substitutions consistent across multiple uses, might even be more interesting and satisfying - the ability to go back and retranslate earlier conversations using the new understandings developed later.
