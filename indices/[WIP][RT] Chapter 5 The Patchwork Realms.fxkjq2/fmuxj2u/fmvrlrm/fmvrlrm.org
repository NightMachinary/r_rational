Reactions, mostly as they come:

- I'm enjoying it so far, but the language thing is starting to grate. I think it's the mental effort of sorting through sentences for the actual words when they're not visually distinct. I found the "blah blah" sentences less ugh than the "fleeb nurb" ones.
- Dog perspective is, as always, fun to read.
- Internal bleeding? Yikes. I hope he gets some time to rest up and heal soon.
- Just noticed I don't really remember the dog's name (Arthos? Athos. Had to go check the chapter again.), since it hasn't come up that much, though we're only at chapter 5 so this is probably a brainspace issue on my end.
- I have just spotted the cover image on royalroad. :D
- "Weapon of Peace" seems interesting - some sort of "stamina damage"?
- The cage of mice is mysterious, probably as intended - I'm guessing they're used as a sacrifice of some kind, or maybe for Skills that require a living target.
- Eugene is clearly going to be trouble, but what kind I'm not sure.
- Hopefully we see some more of the worldbuilding soon - I vaguely recall a Sliver-quest set in a similar (same?) setting that you did which was cool.
