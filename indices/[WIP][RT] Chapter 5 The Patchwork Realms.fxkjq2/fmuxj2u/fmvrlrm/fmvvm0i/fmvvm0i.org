Thanks, that's helpful.

I may switch to blah blah for all of the unknown words. It's easier to write, for one thing, and I can see how it would be easier to read. I might even go back and switch it for past chapters. Regardless, there's about to be a minor timeskip (about a week) so language will be much less of an issue going forward.

The mice will be explained, but it's not super exciting -- more of a "don't be stupid, Eugene" than anything else. I'll spoiler just in case: When something dies, each nearby living being over a certain weight will collect 0-1 of the Skills released. If you are hunting solo, bring some mice to collect the Skills you don't get, then one by one take each mouse aside and kill it to collect its Skill.

EDIT: Weapon of Peace causes your weapon to do extra knockback but no HP damage.

Yep, the setting reuses the general idea of the Chaos Lands sliver quest, except I won't be having fanfic worlds show up and they won't shift in and out as much.
