Suggestion about the gibberish words: either italicize the gibberish, or bold the words he picks out.

I do like the random gibberish, because it indicates that different words are being said, but I agree that picking out the real words is harder than it needs to be. However, indicating that Athos is noticing words (or ignoring them) thru formatting feels like a better solution than replacing everything with blah.
