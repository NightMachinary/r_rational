It would be interesting to p;lay up the blue and orange morality element of the Doctor. He's an aien interfering with human society mainly for his own entertainment, imposing his ethics as he sees fit then disappearing again. You could flesh out Three Worlds Collide style what he actually values and how being able to travel throughout time and space does to how he and the other time lords think of other sentient beings, etc. The daleks would be a good antagonist in that setting if they have their own coherent but human unfriendly values system.

it helps if the Tardis is the only method of time travel commonly used in the plot, because you can also have its limitations in the story. E.g. no going back a week to prepare more once you are already involved in events. You could say that he Tardis can only appear at certain arbitrary times and places dotted through time and space, then is part of the normal timeline while there.
