I've been trying to think about rationalizing Dr Who recently. Obviously you aren't going to be able to have anything rational that matches every aspect of the show. It's contradictory at times, but some things have jumped out at me.

First you basically have to have the Doctor be crazy in some way or another. If the doctors crazy we can ignore a lot of what he says and focus on what actually happens simplifying things quite a bit. There we hit more problems, but quite a bit can be explained by an idea of an immutable time which still allows for time travel. This would be in the vein of time turns or the like. There all exceptions to this, but if you look at most of the times the Dr "changes" something in the past it turns out to be consistent with his present, basically it turns out that the change has already happened. Yes the Dr claims this is not the way things worked. He'll say that things can be changed unless they are fixed points, but fixed points appear to be set fairly arbitrarily and there biggest feature seems to be that the Dr already knows how they are going to turn out and again I'm going with the idea that the Dr is crazy or at least unreliable.

Anyway can anyone think of any majors problems with this or a better way of making things consistent. Really interested to know.
