Nothing too weird to useful. For fixed structures it might make a good method of free storage space (not that space is particularly lacking in space). If the stack falls over, some weird stuff might happen as the falling items acquire X, Y, and Z components to their motion. You could have stuff seeming to phase through other objects and seeming to appear and vanish and move in an impossible way as it falls back onto the hyperplane.
