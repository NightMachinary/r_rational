  Am I misunderstanding, or does this mean that our visible universe is at the "bottom" of the W axis, below which nothing can travel?
#+end_quote

Yes and no. Its the bottom of the positive component of the W axis. So Approaching 0. The negative component lies on the other side of the hyperplane.

  What happens if somebody tries? Can you be crushed against the "floor" by being booted in the wrong direction?
#+end_quote

The boot isn't designed to push in that direction, but hypothetically if you broke one so it did, than no, your ship wouldn't be destroyed, it just wouldn't go anywhere, the boot doesn't have enough energy to crush the ship like that. It has to 'push off' the surface of the hyperplane in order to perform the kick. Trying to go in the other direction, there's nothing to push against, so you just go nowhere.

There is stuff on the other side of the hyperplane though, namely the titular Hyperspace. Its just that humans at the start of the story don't know about hyperspace, can't get into hyperspace, and their drives don't really interact with it. That will come later. Plot and stuff.
