Velocity should be conserved, I think. You're only changing the ship's velocity along the w-axis, which shouldn't affect it's velocity along the regular x y and z axes (assuming the higher-dimensional space is a vacuum).

A couple of questions, though, because I feel very munchkiny right now:

What causes the ship to "fall" back into regular space? Is there some kind of gravity-like force pulling all matter into our level of the w-axis, or does the flight system just calculate the exact force needed to bring it back to it's exact starting position? Is it possible to be stranded in higher-dimensional space? If so, is it a viable strategy to leave obstacles or traps in higher dimensional space to ward off unwelcome ships?
