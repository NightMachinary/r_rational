Two things:

1. This kind of establishes a pretty heavy restriction on distance (at least compared to the actual scale of the universe).

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law][Hubble's Law]] states that the relative velocity of a two galaxies is approximately 67.6 kilometres per second per megaparsec of distance.

A megaparsec is 3.0857×10^{22} metres, or 3,261,633 light years. Obviously that's a really enormous distance from our perspective, but even [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDSS_J1229%2B1122][the most distant star directly observed]] is a bit less than 16.9 megaparsecs away while the observable universe has a radius of around 14,300 megaparsecs.

This means that, purely as a function of distance, you'd expect the most distant star (16.9 Mpc away) to be moving away from Sol at 1,142 km/s, or 15.6 times the fastest known man-made object (the estimated speed of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)][the Juno]] before being captured by Jupiter. Of course, 1,142 km/s is only about 0.38% c, so it's well within the bounds of your 5% c estimate.

You also have concerns about relative galactic rotation, etc. The latter is even relevant within our own galaxy (relative velocity on the diametrically opposite side of the Milky way is 2× our angular velocity) to a lesser extent.

If your engines are really spectacularly good (and getting up to 5% c /at all/ is difficult, especially without killing your crew---if you take a day [86,400 seconds] you'd be accelerating at 173.5 m/s^{2} or 17.7 g, which is more than twice what Apollo 16 experienced on reentry), it won't be too much of a problem as long as you allow enough room to accelerate to match the system, but there's still the issue of how precisely you know those speeds.

You may have to do the trip in stages, or be very certain that you're not going to hit anything in your velocity-matching phase.

2. Kind of minor by comparison, but if velocity is conserved then you can annihilate any planet you wish by fitting an asteroid in a different system with a warp drive. You could do the same with torpedos in combat, even, which would mean that large combat ships basically couldn't exist (any space station in the universe could kill you pretty well instantly if they knew your precise location).
