I assume it would be relative to C and the original reference frame, since C is the only absolute and the starting point establishes a baseline.

You're absolutely right that two stars will not have a relative velocity of zero, which is why I think having velocity conserved between warps would be interesting from a storytelling perspective as it forces ships coming out of warp to burn their sublight engines to bring their velocity into line with that of the system they're now inside of.

I see it like this: Alpha Centauri A's radial velocity with respect to Sol is -21 km/s. So if you add up all the different velocity vectors that the two systems have, you still get a net 21 km/s that you have to make up for on arrival. Obviously you wouldn't burn all that velocity off or you would just be in a radial orbit and falling towards the star, however, you would need to burn off some of it or your trajectory will stay hyperbolic and you'll fly right back out of the system.

  You are need to keep in mind that energy needed to move like this has to conserve the total energy in the universe. So you have to prevent perpetual motions machines. You can't just warp somewhere "higher" and fall back down to get some free speed.

This is something I hadn't actually considered, but given some of the later physics I have in mind, this would be a problem. Maybe tie the energy requirements of the drive to the gradient of spacetime? So the best you could do with impossibly perfect systems would be perpetual motion, but not free energy. I don't want this universe to have over-unity engines (I have another story with those, lol)

I don't think that having the drive /not/ conserve velocity would fix that issue though unless the exit speed is determined by the initial input energy (and again, speed relative to what?).

As far as I see it, the only absolute against which speed can be measured is C, and speed relative to C is what would be conserved in the warp. Nothing else is conserved though, you can still rotate that velocity vector however you like.

I dunno, does that make sense?
