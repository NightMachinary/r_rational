So the problem I see is what is the velocity relative too? So if you go to another star those two stars are probably not both sitting placidly next to each other moving at 0 relative velocity. You are need to keep in mind that energy needed to move like this has to conserve the total energy in the universe. So you have to prevent perpetual motions machines. You can't just warp somewhere "higher" and fall back down to get some free speed.
