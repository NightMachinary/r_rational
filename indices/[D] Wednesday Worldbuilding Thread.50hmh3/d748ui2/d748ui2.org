Okay so some questions about physics and how it'll relate to the sci-fi story I'm writing.

In Sideways in Hyperspace, the humans start off the story with a modified form of the warp drive. This drive works by pinching space between two points and then 'kicking' the ship through higher dimensional space (non-time +W Axis). When the ship falls back into regular space, it falls onto the other side of the field distortion its drive created. Then the field distortion is allowed to relax, as it does, the ship is pulled along with the distortion, exiting the warp tunnel at the destination.

Given all that, the question is, does it totally violate physics (either my made up physics or real physics) to have velocity conserved through warp?

Example: A ship at Earth activates its warp drive while going 5% of C. It travels through warp for a week to reach Alpha Centauri, and it exits the warp still going at 5% of C.

One of my friends tells me this is wrong, and velocity doesn't exactly work like that, but to me, it seems like it would be wrong for velocity /not/ to be conserved.

None of this has yet had an effect on the plot, but I'd like to make sure I'm making sense with stuff like this before I get far enough into the plot for it to matter. Its important to get it right early though, because its pretty critical to a proper application of [[http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/][Sanderson's First Law]], which is something I want to achieve.

I'm going for a [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics][Minovsky Physcs]] type feel, where the technology is spelled out well enough that the main characters can use it to further the plot, without it feeling contrived. I very much want to avoid a star trek vibe, where the technology works or doesn't work solely as the plot requires.

Also! I'm looking for beta readers for Sideways in Hyperspace, if anyone is so inclined to help me, I'd really like to have someone other than myself go over stuff before I post it, and it'll mean whoever betas gets a chance to see stuff early, before its posted.
