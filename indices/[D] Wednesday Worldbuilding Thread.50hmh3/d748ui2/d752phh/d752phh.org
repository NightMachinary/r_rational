Next to one ship being able to "pinch" the universe as it pleases (and what would mean for the parts of the universe that end up pinched in such a way, which is a catastrophe in itself), I don't think anybody is going to worry about the conservation of momentum (and for ideal /hardness/ of your sci-fi you can look into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-momentum][Four-momentum]]).

The actual problem with physics (if you disregard what effects "pinching" of the universe would introduce) comes from this:

#+begin_quote
  Its not a gravity-like force, its actually gravity. All matter in the universe normally lies along the XYZ axes, forming the 'surface' of the hyperplane that is our visible universe. The +W axis is empty, the -W axis is the surface of the hyperplane. Because all matter lies along this plane, anything pushing off of it will be quickly drawn back to the surface by the gravitational attraction of all matter in the universe. The Boot just gives the ship a good hard shove in the +W axis, allowing it to 'hop' through higher dimensional space to avoid the deformations the drive introduces to the hyperplane.
#+end_quote

If you allow gravity along W axis and you also allow the usual matter to exist there, you're going to end up with an extra dimension, all your Inverse-square laws will turn into Inverse-cube laws, the orbits of planets will not end up being stable and the universe will not look anything like we're used to. The only way to somehow preserve the familiar universe, while still adding that W axis, is to postulate some kind of horribly kludgy rule like "no, the usual fields are allowed along W axis, but only when the (warp)-drive is there to enable it", which doesn't really sound like something that could actually be consistent under the hood, but could get you past the immediate "I call bullshit" reactions at least.

As for "pinching", it's gonna affect a bunch of things if one interprets it literally. Curvature of space(-time) and in turn pressure and mass are all going to be affected. You could well end up creating a singularity every time you're pinching the universe, and who knows what would then happen to it when you stop pinching. You could hand-wave it by saying that the overall distance travelled after ascending up in the W dimension is just much smaller than the normal one would be (with no manipulation of normal space-time required). The real problem is the interaction of the extra dimension with the original ones.
