  What causes the ship to "fall" back into regular space?
#+end_quote

Its not a gravity-like force, its actually gravity. All matter in the universe normally lies along the XYZ axes, forming the 'surface' of the hyperplane that is our visible universe. The +W axis is empty, the -W axis is the surface of the hyperplane. Because all matter lies along this plane, anything pushing off of it will be quickly drawn back to the surface by the gravitational attraction of all matter in the universe. The Boot just gives the ship a good hard shove in the +W axis, allowing it to 'hop' through higher dimensional space to avoid the deformations the drive introduces to the hyperplane.

  Is it possible to be stranded in higher-dimensional space?
#+end_quote

Not in the +W axis.

#+begin_quote
  If so, is it a viable strategy to leave obstacles or traps in higher dimensional space to ward off unwelcome ships?
#+end_quote

Spoilers.
