An idea for a superhero setting I had recently (perhaps not terribly original, I admit) is to begin with a set of essential mechanics that the superpower system can draw on to create end-user powers.

At the moment, I'm thinking of three main mechanics. The main three are; Lorentz boosting, momentum rays, and 'delaying'. Lorentz boosting works by applying a boost to a selected region of space, which opens the door towards things like fake-gravity manipulation, time manipulation (sort-of), weaker forms of invulnerability and super-strength, maybe some other stuff I'm not thinking of. Momentum rays are a means of transferring momentum between masses, which can do a whole lot of convenient stuff. 'Delaying' would work along the lines of delaying the application of forces on select things, which do more interesting things alongside the rays, and on its own can do some invulnerability-type stuff.
