One problem I've noticed with UNSONG is that it has a habit of saying, "this is true, except not really". For instance, when we first learn about angels we find out they lose their powers when their naïveté. Then we find out that doesn't apply to the really powerful angels, but most of them were killed in the war with Thaumiel. Then we're introduced to Gadiriel, who was neutral in the war and Ronald Reagan, but we never heard about before.

Revealing exceptions to previously implied facts is a reoccurring feature of this story. The Other King rules all of Mexico, except for the parts ruled by the Drug Lord. America has an alliance with Hell, except that time demons invaded. The Talmud and Torah are literally true, but the Israelites weren't God's chosen people. Even the first few chapters talk about Kabbalah as if it's the only magic in the world, but then we find out about placebomancy.

Why is this bad worldbuilding? Because none of these elements get the chance to develop before something new is introduced. There's so much exposition about how things work we never get the chance to see the full implications of any of them. The point of worldbuilding is to create potential plot points, but UNSONG doesn't utilize its own story potential before moving on to something else. It'd be fine if the plot was just a sightseeing trip like Alice in Wonderland, but it isn't.
