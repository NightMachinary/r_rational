I think a lot of the difference of interpretation comes down to what is implied vs. explicitly stated. They don't outright say "kabbalah is the only magic" bu the story starts by setting up a world with Kaballah and explaining how it woks, with no other things mentioned even in passsing. Then other things you couldn't anicipate are revealed later

In comparison most fantasy and scifi books establish the parameters of the world ver early on, and stick with that. E.g. Tolkien never explicitly states "By the way gunpowder isn't a thing" but it would still feel incongruous if the armies of Gondor were using muskets and they were never mentioned before. A good example is in Worm where the first few chapters give exposition on the world and characters, then build within that frameworklater on. Mostly this is a general expectation of how fantasy and scifi books work, not a codifed thing, though [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SandersonsFirstLaw][Sandersons laws of magic come close.]]

Unsong by contrast is slowly releasing new bits of the world as it goes on, which is exacerbated by the non-linear order of events*. Which is probably a deliberate authorial choice, but it does mean you can't really anticipate where the story is going and what is and isn't allowd by the universe. You can't derive from "this is a world with Kaballah as intellectual property" to placebomancy and demons.

It also makes the problem solving/prediction element of enjoying reading the story much harder, e.g. with HPMOR half the fun was speculating about what could be done with the tools available, but if new elements of the world are continuously being released you can't do that because you have no idea what the limits are.

[*] (I feel like way more time has been spent on flashbacks than the present day timeline thats supposed to be the main plot. Once the story is finished it would be interesting to rearrange the chapters chronologically and see the story of the wold unfolding chronologically. )
