  As for the Talmud and the Torah being literally true, that is definitely a misunderstanding on your part, from the very beginning we are told that the Torah was just another representation of the Adam Kadmon and a more or less accurate account of some of the stuff that happened. As for the Talmud, Aaron is constantly reminding us how crazy it is.

Mm, I'd have to disagree there. Aaron constantly reminds us how crazy it is, but is /also/ literally true in the world of Unsong - the whole "angels can't understand Aramaic" thing, for example.
