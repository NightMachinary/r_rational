I don't really agree with your examples and I think your objections have a lot more to do with your personal interpretation than the actual text. The very first angel we meet is Uriel and he didn't seem naive at all. It seemed very clear to me, from the get go, that not every angel is the same. Sure, Gadiriel and Samyazaz are anomalous cases, but I think that this is something that will still be revisited in the story.

I don't recall reading that the Other King ruled all of Mexico, my impression was that his territory was a stretch from Nevada to northern Mexico, including New Mexico and whatever else he took from the Comet King.

The alliance with Hell thing always seemed to me like something that happened in the past and then was over, especially considering how many times they mentioned the Comet King's crusade against Thamiel, "that time the demons invaded", as you call it, was something I thought had been pretty clearly foreshadowed.

I also don't recall anything in the first chapters implying Kabbalah was the only magic. They don't mention any other for a while, but I personally never got that same impression as you.

As for the Talmud and the Torah being literally true, that is definitely a misunderstanding on your part, from the very beginning we are told that the Torah was just another representation of the Adam Kadmon and a more or less accurate account of some of the stuff that happened. As for the Talmud, Aaron is constantly reminding us how crazy it is.

Most of these things come down to a matter of interpretation. Maybe it is the author's fault for leaving it vague to the point where more than one comprehension is possible, but I think the main problem is that he built a world that is too big to be explained all at once and it can confuse sometimes.
