I'm looking forward to Cat realizing that Cordelia has /also/ told a Choir to screw off when they offered her a Name. Wonder if we'll find a third character to do the same? Or maybe we'll get some more parallels between the two; they do both get advice from birds, apparently (although Cordelia a little indirectly).
