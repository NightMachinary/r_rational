What I enjoy is that every character in rational fiction is /like me/. Very easy to relate to. When we're reading The Scarlet Letter or whatever in 8th grade, do I relate to Hester? Not really, I think it's blatantly obvious that she should just throw the A away and move to a different town. She's already supporting herself as it is, there's nothing keeping her there. Or, let's try an even bigger gap...Do I relate to Odysseus? Even less so. I think he's a murderer, slaver, and rapist, and any notion I can form of him as a heroic character is merely me projecting how the ancients might think of him. (Even today, I don't understand why so many people think that, say, /game of thrones/ has any heroic or good characters. They're all evil. I enjoy it as a show entirely about evil characters. It unsettles me to know that other people perceive any good characters here.)

I appreciate that the book helps me get into the mindset of the cultural gap of someone to whom these solution would apparently not occur, but rational fiction is probably one of the /only/ genres that actually depicts /my/ "culture" in the characters. Do I relate to canon Harry, who is ostensibly a modern person? Quite a bit! But I relate to hpmor!Harry even more. He's closer to me than canon harry is, in the same way canon harry is closer to me than Hester, in the same way Hester is closer to me than Odysseys.

Which means ...I don't have to be the guy who has to try /not/ to ruin media for other people by complaining about what the characters could have done better, or pointing out that actually the lessons it teaches are deeply wrong, or perceiving some blatant inconsistency.

With rational fiction, I get to take a break from feeling like I am annoying and pedantic or missing the /real/ point every time I do this, because the story encourages you to do it. My annoying habit is now considered genuine literary critique!
