The kids have been watching My Little Pony lately. I was rather horrified by an episode where vampire fruit bats (whatever that means) were attacking the fruit trees, and the attempted solution of magically removing their attraction to fruit was treated as horrible and ineffective and prone to side effects, while the kind and friendly solution was to set aside a "sanctuary" containing trees they could access freely.

My reaction is, You've got to be kidding me. Making pests not be attracted to the fruit is about as humane (equine?) as you can get, while feeding them just means lots of healthy bats making baby bats who will strip your orchards completely bare next year. There was no indication that the bats are sapient enough to make a deal, so any kind of sanctuary is a ridiculous idea.
