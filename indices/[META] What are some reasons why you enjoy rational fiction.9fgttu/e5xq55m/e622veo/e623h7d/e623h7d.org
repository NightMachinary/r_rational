Disclaimer, I don't watch the show particularly carefully, and didn't read any of the books.

I lose track of how many needless killings every character has done so far (Actually, I think Varys and also Bran's party might not have murdered needlessly yet. I'm not counting murders for the greater good in this count).

But as for Jon, I really don't thin Jon is an exception, I'm pretty sure he has killed more than one person who he could have easily spared. There is so much violence in Game of Thrones that viewers slowly stop considering it a moral monstrosity when a character casually skewers someone who could have been spared but I'm /pretty/ sure Jon hasn't been unusually merciful.

Jon at one point betrayed the wildlings for basically no reason other than duty to the watch, which I don't count as a good reason, especially when it is fairly clear that the Wildlings fight for the more virtuous cause.

I can't count every instance, but over all throughout the story, Jon shows the same moral flaws as his father - he follows Duty and Honor rather than Good even when these are pointing in very different directions. When his duty has him to kill or betray good people, he does so. When his duty has him tolerate evil masters, he does that too. His failure to take the Wildling's side at the right moment made all the more clear by the times Jon (and Ned, for that matter) /didn't/ raise his sword against evil people who happened to have authority over him. I know he allies with them eventually, but that happens for different reasons than Goodness.

Sam...I guess Sam technically hasn't done anything bad. But I chalked that up to being bad at fighting rather than virtue.

( And I may have spoken too strongly, some characters may actually be more /neutral/ than evil, and some are at the very least /innocent/ and haven't made a clear stand for anything yet. But actually /good/ is very rare. Tyrion /almost/ made it to good before he strangled the prostitute he was in love with for sleeping with his dad. I think maybe Varys is still in the running for Actually Heroic Good, actually.)
