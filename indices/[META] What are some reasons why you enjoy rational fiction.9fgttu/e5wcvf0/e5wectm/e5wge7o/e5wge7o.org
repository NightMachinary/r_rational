I always thought Rowling's intended interpretation of that scene was that the victory cup was designed by the tournament manager to be a portkey for the winner directly to the victory platform in front of the crowd. Maybe I'm misremembering, but when Harry grabs the cup and returns, he is in front of huge crowds, whereas when he grabbed it the first time, he was inside the maze away from the crowds, thus implying that if the cup had worked as intended, it would have instantly and dramatically revealed Harry as the tournament winner.

So when Fake Mad-Eye placed a second, pre-emptive portus on the cup, he had to be careful not to remove the first portus, because the tournament managers would be going down their checklists doing analytical spells such as "is this cup a portkey to the winner's platform as it should be?" Fake Mad-Eye was taking a chance that they wouldn't discover the second portus, but, depending on the how the magic works exactly, it was plausible that they wouldn't find it if they weren't looking for that possibility (which probably didn't come up on their tournament prep checklists).

Of course, a smart Voldemort would have simply ordered Wormtail to destroy the cup as soon as Harry got to the graveyard, but whatever. Maybe Fake Mad-Eye didn't communicate the existence of the original portus to Voldemort, who didn't think of that possibility when first forming the plan months before the tournament. Maybe Wormtail forgot to carry out his orders in the heat of the moment.

For this theory to work, Harry needs to know in advance that the cup was supposed to be a portkey to the winner's platform, so that in the graveyard he knows to grab the cup again. I don't remember this being stated in the book, but maybe Harry was informed of it offscreen during tournament prep. Alternatively, maybe Harry knew that some portkeys are two-way, and just went for a Hail Mary that this would work, getting lucky that the tournament portus was in-place. [Edit: Actually, neither of these things are necessary. If I remember correctly, the ghosts who come out of Voldemort's wand tell Harry to grab the cup, implying that they could sense the other portus in place.]

Wow, I wrote more paragraphs on this than I expected to. Post-hoc-rationalization FTW!
