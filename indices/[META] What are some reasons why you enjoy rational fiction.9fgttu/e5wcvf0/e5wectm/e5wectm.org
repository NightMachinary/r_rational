TBF, with the Portus, it would make sense if you just established that as a rule for the spell itself. A spell having always some kind of condition required for it to work is a common concept, and there's a nice symmetry to the idea of any Portus having to be necessarily bi-directional. I don't remember though if HP canon says anything to that effect (I guess not, if HPMOR takes that dig).
