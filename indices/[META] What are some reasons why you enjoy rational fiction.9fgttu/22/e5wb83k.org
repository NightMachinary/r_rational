I enjoy the extra effort writers put in rationalizing their fiction because it isn't easy. Too often rationalism is thrown out the windows just because it's easier to write a story a certain way. A shortcut. I dislike it but I see why most authors take it.

In the end rational fictions are great though sometimes its hard to make it rational when an author wants the work a certain way. Take Worth the Candle. It is mostly rational. Keyword mostly. The author wants to veer towards the work being about the MC and his hangups which makes the world unauthentic and robotic since all of it is just made for the MC and his friend. The characters are irrational as they are background scenery for the MC.

A rational world is one that can operate independently without the MC and still be left standing.
