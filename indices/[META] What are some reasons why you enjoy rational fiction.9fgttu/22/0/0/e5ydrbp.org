I don't think that's fair. You asked for what people like in rational fiction and he answered. [[/u/Seyt77][u/Seyt77]] doesn't like the same style as many others on this sub, but he appreciates that it's a lot closer to what he does actually like. So he says that he likes rational fiction for the effort they put in to make it that way.
