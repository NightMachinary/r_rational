Seyt was describing that their utopian fiction (which they used the word rational to describe, which was probably a poor choice) has a complete and independent world that is not main-character-plot-based, which is something that (in general) the fiction on this sub do much better than fiction outside of the sub. They said how WtC mostly achieves this, but not completely as ultimately the entire world is bent around the main character's actions and that breaks the immersion for them. I think that's a completely valid opinion to have and they were just using WtC as an example to explain their opinion. Clearly people misunderstood them (probably the incorrect use of 'rational'), and thought Seyt was just bashing on WtC, which I honestly didn't see it as until I read peoples' responses.

They then saw people smashing on them for it and they were probably as confused as I was, so they responded with calls of hypocrite. I think that makes sense for someone to do in that scenario, though it's probably not the correct thing. I'm sorry for directly arguing with you, as I think the cutting-off happened immediately from the stream of downvotes, much before you replied.
