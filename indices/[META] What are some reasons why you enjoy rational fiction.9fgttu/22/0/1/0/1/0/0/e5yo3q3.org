I get the whole 'I can't listen to everyone', but I consider this corner of the internet the kind of place where I /can/ listen to everyone, and can expect that others will listen back. I suppose I should have just said this.

From my perspective, the argument being made was entirely useful, so I saw a meaningful discussion being cut off by public disapproval because they did not agree with one of the views being shown. I thought that our differing perspectives on the discussion originated from our different opinions on the arguments themself, so I was led to believe that people were deciding the value of a discussion by how much they agree with the points being made. When I felt this, this irked me. Please tell me if I misinterpreted something.
