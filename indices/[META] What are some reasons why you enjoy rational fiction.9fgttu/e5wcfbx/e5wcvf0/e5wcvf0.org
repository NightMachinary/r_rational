  Did portkeys even work two-way?

You probably did get this digg from HPMOR, but just in case:

  Moody had once seen an addicted Dark Wizard go to ridiculous lengths to get a victim to lay hands on a certain exact portkey, instead of just having someone toss the target a trapped Knut on their next visit to town; and after going to all that work, the addict had gone to the further effort to lay a second Portus, on the same portkey, which had, on a second touch, transported the victim back to safety. To this day, even taking the drug into account, Moody could not imagine what could have possibly been going through the man's mind at the time he had cast the second Portus.

For me, I value internal consistency. Take "The Expanse". Plot relies on having a working space proletariat that can't afford water/air, having mined out the asteroid Ceres. Thats just not feasible.

Or "The Smoke Ring" by Larry Niven has a tiny civilisation of a 1000 people use Wood on the magnitude of 1 km^{3} per year. Thats aboutish what modern earth uses! And those are huge plot points!
