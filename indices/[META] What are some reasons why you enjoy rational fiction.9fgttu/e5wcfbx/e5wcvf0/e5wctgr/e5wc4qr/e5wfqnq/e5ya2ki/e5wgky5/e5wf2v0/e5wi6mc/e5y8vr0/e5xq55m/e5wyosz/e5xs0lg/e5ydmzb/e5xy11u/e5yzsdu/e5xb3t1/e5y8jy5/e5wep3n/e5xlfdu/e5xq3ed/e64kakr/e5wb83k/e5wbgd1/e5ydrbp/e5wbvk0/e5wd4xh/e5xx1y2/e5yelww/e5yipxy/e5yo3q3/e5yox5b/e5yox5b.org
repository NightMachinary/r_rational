Okay, can you be a little specific? What about "Worth The Candle is bad because it's about the protagonist" is so valuable a discussion thread? Or did you mean "you're a hypocrite for criticizing a non-rational novel then being negative about my criticisms of a rational fic"? I honestly don't see anything worth pursuing in either of those. His complaint about WtC was blatantly just "I dislike Joon as a character" in code and his accusation of hypocrisy I already handily refuted. What else was there to say on either matter?
