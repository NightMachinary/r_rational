Honestly it sounded like valid criticism to me. Of course, we can disagree with him on his opinion or on how he expressed it.

But I don't think anybody here believes that any Rational fic is above any criticism, I understand nobody likes having the things they like criticized, but we should also know that if we downvote and shut down every opinion we disagree with we could end up like some kind of cult.

And I'm sure nobody here wants that..
