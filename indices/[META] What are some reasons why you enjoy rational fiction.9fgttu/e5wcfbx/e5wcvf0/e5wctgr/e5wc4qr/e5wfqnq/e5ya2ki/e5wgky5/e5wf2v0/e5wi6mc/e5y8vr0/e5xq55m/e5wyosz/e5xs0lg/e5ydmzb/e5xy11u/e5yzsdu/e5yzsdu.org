For me, it's mostly the indulgence in intellect. I'm more likely to learn something interesting, or make some connection that I can apply to something else. Rational fiction is (ideally) about the way the world is, rather than being about the way that the world makes you feel -- a certain amount of unreality and symbolism is accepted in other media as a way of making a stronger point.
