I really appreciate the intent here (saying nice-sounding things that don't work in practice to score internet points, that is) but assuming that all conversation is inherently worthwhile and fruitful is naive and idealistic to the point of flat absurdity, /especially/ on the internet. Sometimes the person you're talking to is arguing in bad faith, sometimes they're only in pursuit of emotional release and not meaningful discourse, and sometimes they're just too big a problem for you to solve. Shutting down actual, beneficial conversation is bad. But I said what I did precisely because it seemed obvious to me that that was not what was happening in this thread.

As an aside, if you often experience people telling you to shut up, it may have less to do with them than you think.
