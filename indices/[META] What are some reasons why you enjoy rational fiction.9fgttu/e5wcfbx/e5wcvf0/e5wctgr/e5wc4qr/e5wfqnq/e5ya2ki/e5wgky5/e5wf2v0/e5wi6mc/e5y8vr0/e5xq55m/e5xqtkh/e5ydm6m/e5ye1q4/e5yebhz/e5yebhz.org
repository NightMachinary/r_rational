In the context of mlp, that would be a /bad solution/, for thematic reasons. Making a mainstream fiction rational should not equal changing it's essence, because otherwise there's a very good reason for things not to be 'rational'. A rational /fanfiction/ is under no such restriction and is marvellously fun to read, specifically because they do not have the enormous audience of children (and smaller number of adults) that require Friendship and Ponies.
