In the episode it was said that the fruit bats help the trees grow more quickly and bear more fruit. They relocated the bats to an area of the orchard where the fruit was going to waste because the orchard is too large for the current generation to harvest fully. Also, all animals speak their own language and are able to hold a conversation with one of the main characters, except maybe fish. Furthermore, it was previously demonstrated that just changing the diet of a pest is a terrible idea when they tried this in an earlier episode, accidentally changing the diet of parasprites from fruits, specifically apples, to wood, causing the town, made out of wood, to be destroyed. We also see another magical accident from changing diets when a main character is turned into a fruit vampire, gaining fangs and bat wings. I can't remember if that was from the same episode though. So it really was the best plan they had.
