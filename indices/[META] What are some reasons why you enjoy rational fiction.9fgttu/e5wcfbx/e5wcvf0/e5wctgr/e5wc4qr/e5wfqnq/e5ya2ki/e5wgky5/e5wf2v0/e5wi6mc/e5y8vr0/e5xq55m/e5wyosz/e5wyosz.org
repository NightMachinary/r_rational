I really dislike moments in fiction where I can tell that some previously established aspect of the story universe is being ignored/changed/broken. Rational fiction has a lot less of that.

Ditto for when later added aspects aren't compatible with previous parts of the story. "If that new feature exists, it would have shown up or been used two and seven chapters ago!"
