It's definitely fun and satisfying to see a good solution to a conflict that seems naturally proceeding from established rules and not coming out of the author's ass. Since rational fiction basically commits to that kind of consistency, if well written it can deliver that sort of satisfaction. Of course this is not to say that it's the /only/ sort of narrative conflict that works that way, or that it can carry a story alone. But for example, that sort of grounded conflict is a good reason why I enjoyed "Hunter X Hunter" (which for manga/anime is probably as rational as it gets) as much as I did.

Another thing is that, in fanfiction, it's a good tool for deconstruction. You take narrative tropes and try to pass them through real world logic without simply glossing over some of the implications with a handwave and suddenly you see all their hidden sides. This can be just fun (works well for a parody!) or actually insightful. For example "The Metropolitan Man" puts in real perspective how it would feel like to live in a world in which Superman exists. To make another anime example - not the most rational, but certainly a deconstruction, "Evangelion" does exactly this to the trope of a boy piloting a big mecha robot in war, suggesting that if you apply rationality to it it'd turn out to be less of an awesome thing and more of a shell-shocked-traumatised-forever-possibly-driven-to-insanity thing.
