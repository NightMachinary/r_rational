it's not /explicit/ canon, but given that the crowd's response to one of the champions spontaneous appearance outside the maze was to cheer the victor, before they even noticed he was dragging a corpse behind him, strongly implies it, making it implicit canon, and not "just" fanon. The champion appearing by portkey was clearly anticipated, and it wasn't told explicitly because, first JKR didn't want the audience to know, and after, there was too much drama going on to derail with a post-hoc expositional aside.
