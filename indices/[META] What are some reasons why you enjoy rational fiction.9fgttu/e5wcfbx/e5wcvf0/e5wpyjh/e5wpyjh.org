honestly, that whole bit imo just feels like it contorts things to make the most outlandish assumptions possible to make it seem maximally ridiculous. The port key was supposed to teleport you out of the maze - that was the /first/ port key spell, the intended one. The one that sent him to the graveyard was the one overlaid on that, and it's not out of the realm of imagination that they could't just remove the original one without it being noticed, and instead had to overlay the new one with priority. A bit contrived, given we get no real explanation; certainly a bit /convenient/. But not /that/ absurd.

Mind you, that doesn't make the plan as a whole much less ridiculous - I mean, just the bullet-point summary of that plan is insane, "Our victim is in a secure location, so we will have to get him out of there first. So, we'll have an agent infiltrate that secure place, remain there for the entire school year, rig this international tournament so he can illegally enter, cheat to help him so he doesn't just die in that tournament, and cheat further to ensure he wins the final round..." I mean, on the face of it that's a terrible plan; it depends on an agent being able to infiltrate and remain inside the school for the whole damned school year, that you can pull that off but couldn't possibly find an opportunity to just kidnap the kid? Really?

All that said, the portkey itself, of course voldemort didn't deliberately put a second portkey spell to send him back to safety.
