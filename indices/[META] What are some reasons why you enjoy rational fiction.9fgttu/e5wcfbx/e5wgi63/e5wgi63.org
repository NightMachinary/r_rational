I think #4 is the biggest factor for me.

While I do enjoy reading characters who actually think their problems through, learn from their mistakes, and are introspective abut their faults, what really gets me interested is when the villain is a real person and not a caricature.

I think Mother of Learning is especially good at this; characters like Quatach-Ichl and Sudomir (and even, to some extent, Xvim) were introduced as antagonists who seemed just to be committed to evil for its own sake, but we later meet and talk to those characters, and they all have ends which could rationally (if not ethically) justify their means.
