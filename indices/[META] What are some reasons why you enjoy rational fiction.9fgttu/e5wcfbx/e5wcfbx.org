The main aspects that appeal to me (none of these are exclusive to ratfic, just more common):

1. It's more likely than other genres to involve certain themes I enjoy--transhumanism, "death bad", paperclip AI, weird alien morality, time shenanigans, meta exploitation, characters having long debates about ethics, etc.

2. The protagonists and antagonists tend to have grand ambitions. I enjoy reading about characters with strong motivations, and although that still applies to small-scale but passionate motivations like "I just want to go live a simple life in the forest and will do anything to make that happen," I /really/ enjoy stories where a character is trying to change things on a universal scale. Especially when they're trying to "break" something terrible that's widely considered inescapable in the real world, like death, and especially when that desire comes from a place of compassion. HJPEV in HPMOR, Bastion in Unsounded, etc. It's a wish fulfillment thing for me.

3. The protagonists tend to do more self-examination about whether their actions and goals are ethical. It bothers me when a protagonist does something that's realistic but still kind of fucked up (like risking many lives to save their loved one) and it's not examined at all. In ratfic, if a character does something like that, I can reasonably expect them or another character to at least acknowledge that it was ethically questionable and explore the reasons why, and what character's choice says about their decision-making process, and whether or not they should change their approach going forward.

4. The villains tend to be humanized and have believable motivations. I prefer conflicts where I can at least sympathize a little with both (or all) sides, because that makes it easier to get emotionally invested.
