Most other fiction is just lazy by comparison. I have plenty of complaints about characters in ratfic, but they more than make up for it. The Martian is probably the most mainstream ratfic I enjoy and it is a perfect example of why the genre is so good. The protagonist takes his time to think things through and not be driven by irrational, inexcusably reckless passion. He's realistic and clever. He really earns his wins, and the plot is not usually moved forward by idiot balls or unfair twists.
