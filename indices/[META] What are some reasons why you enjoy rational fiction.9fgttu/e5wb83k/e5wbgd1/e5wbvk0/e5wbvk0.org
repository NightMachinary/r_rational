I enjoy rational fiction because i appreciate the work done for it. I figured I can explain my rationale which you do not like at all. I guess i hit a nerve or something but i stand by what i said.

Edit:you were complaining about harry potter's irrationality and you expect people not to do the same with their rational reasons? kinda hypocritical don't you think?
