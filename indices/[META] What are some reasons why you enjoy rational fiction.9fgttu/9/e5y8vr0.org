I thought about this a fair amount when I realized that I don't actually care about most of what rational fiction defines itself off of. That's not to say I dislike it, just that I don't particularly value it.

The conclusion that I eventually came to is that I enjoy rational worldbuilding and munchkinry. I enjoy that in rational fiction (most of which is fantasy to a greater or lesser extent) it feels like the characters are more accurate representations of how a real person would react if they had some kind of unique ability.

Additionally, I'm much more of a fan of hard magic systems, and rational fiction almost universally has them. It's hard to be rational when the strength of magic is defined as being "as strong as must be at the time" or something vague like that.
