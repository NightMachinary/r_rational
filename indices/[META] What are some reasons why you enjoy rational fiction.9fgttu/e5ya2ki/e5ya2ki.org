This subreddit had a link to [[https://qntm.org/worldbuilding][a blogpost by Sam Hughes]] about the purpose of worldbuilding a few weeks back, and it had a line which stuck with me:

#+begin_quote
  The result is, hopefully, something resilient and consistent; a universe which rewards exploration rather than punishing it.
#+end_quote

This is, I think, a large part of the appeal for me. A big part of "rational" stories to me is that they put emphasis on creating a setting and a plot that holds up to scrutiny, which lets me dwell on a story or a world for a while and really ups the escapism aspect of fiction.

Plus I hate being distracted by gaping plotholes and inconsistencies.
