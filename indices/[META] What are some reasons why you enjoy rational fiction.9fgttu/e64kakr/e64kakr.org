A little late, but I want to point out that you're looking at this through the lens of Voldemort failing, rather than what Voldemort was planning to do. It's actually (mostly) a good plan.

Imagine if, in book 4 in the graveyard, Voldemort didn't crit-fail his murder of Harry Potter before he escaped. Voldemort would be secretly returned without anyone knowing, with his battle-ready death eaters, with a secret assassin right next to Dumbledore, with the minister of magic in attendance and other priority hostages all inside a teleport blocking zone. It's established in book 6 that getting into and out of Hogwarts is /really/ hard and the main plot of the book, and they had a successful key ready with the cup. Voldemort would have won the war immediately on the night of his return, if he'd just killed Harry instead of indulging in a duel.

Of course, he never thought about what would happen if he couldn't kill Harry. This is why pre-mortem analysis is so valuable.
