  I am intensely interested in narratives where the protagonist pushes themselves to the brink to protect something they value, only to find themselves broken on the other side. I am even more intensely interested in stories where they are given a chance to reflect, and a chance to heal.

Blackwing is really good. MC is a military general fallen from grace, turned drunken mercenary band leader, being forced to fight or die / to protect the lost love of his youth and his country..

Maybe this fits what you're looking for.

​

BTW is the manga for oregairu good? Or novel only ?
