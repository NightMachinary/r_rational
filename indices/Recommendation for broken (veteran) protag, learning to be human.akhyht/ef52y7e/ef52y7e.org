That is a character arc that I also like quite a bit, and I have a few recommendations that approximately fit that criteria.

First up, the most obvious one is *[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-trans-dimensional-overpowered-protagonist-harem-comedy-is-wrong-as-expected-oregairu-danmachi.367903][My Trans-Dimensional, Overpowered Protagonist, Harem Comedy is Wrong, as Expected]]*, an OreGairu/DanMachi crossover fic. It is quite fantastic, it's one of the best iterations of Hachiman out there. Has the protagonist and themes of OreGairu, with the plot and cast of DanMachi, set a couple of years after Hachiman is Isekai'd into DanMachi with a seriously powerful ability and the instruction to reach the end of the Dungeon if he ever wants to see his home again. While plot basically follows DanMachi canon, the true thematic focus on the story is on Hachiman's character arc and personal relationships. Hachiman has to deal with loss, figure out how much he wants to emotionally open up to people, and question how much of his own physical and mental wellness to sacrifice for the sake of the same loved ones who can't stand seeing him hurt. Fantastic stuff.

Secondly, we have the *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10236595/1/Learning-To-Feel][Learning to Feel]]* a Kill la Kill fic, so HEAVY SPOILERS FOR KLK. Post-canon, set a couple of years after the ending of the show. Getting right to fundamentals of this one, this is the story of Satsuki slowly learning how to experience physical intimacy in spite of the major traumas she suffered from her mother's pervasive sexual abuse of her as a child and teenager. Fits your criteria mainly for the part where Satsuki did in fact fight extremely hard, and she did experience great trauma, even if the two don't totally coincide. As this story is focused almost entirely on sexuality, it is NSFW, so Your Mileage May Vary. But I must recommend it because even if it is short and somewhat barebones, what is there is quite effective at making me feel deep empathy for a hurting person slowly rediscovering a piece of herself that has been shut away for far too long.

Thirdly, we have what is probably the most depressing piece of fanfiction I really like, is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5465572/1/Queen-of-Sorrow][Queen of Sorrows]]*, a Fire Emblem fic set in the Path of Radiance / Radiant Dawn continent, at the end of Book 2. In the wake of refusing to release the imprisoned leader of the newly vanquished rebellion in exchange for her kidnapped best friend Lucia, in this story Lucia is not rescued at the last moment, in this she is summarily executed in front of Elincia's own eyes. This is not the story of a broken hero trying to heal, this is the story of that person breaking, as she attempts to come to grips with both her own overwhelming grief, and the responsibility that comes unto a Queen faced with an immense array of threats to the livelihoods of her people. Elincia's character arc is marvelously done, the ending is a masterpiece, and damn this story bums me out. But it's the one and only Fire Emblem fic that I even slightly remember, and the one I always see rec'd whenever Fire Emblem comes up.

Outside of fanfiction, the somewhat recent Violet Evergarden is an anime about a young female soldier with severe PTSD slowly learning how to understand both herself and the people around her. Basically exactly what you're looking for, except the war is over and the story is all about Violet. I haven't finished this one yet, but I'm told it's just as amazing as it has appeared so far.
