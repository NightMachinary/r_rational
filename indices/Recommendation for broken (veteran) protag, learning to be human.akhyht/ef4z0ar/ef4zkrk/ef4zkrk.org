I didn't pick it up since it seemed like the main character's goals were very self-oriented. i.e. Revenge.

I tend to appreciate anime despite its many flaws, since we tend to get mc who fight for something they deeply (and sincerely!) believe in. Things such as friendship, and protecting something they deeply value, such as peace are more often the motivations of characters.

tl;dr Having the main character fight for something they deeply believe in is important.
