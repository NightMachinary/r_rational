[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2559745/1/Learning-to-Breathe][Learning to Breathe]] is a Harry Potter AU where Sirius Black learns of the prophecy and decides to turn Harry into a soldier. The story takes place after Voldemort's defeat, when Harry attends Hogwarts and has to learn how to be normal

This isn't precisely a rational fic, but it does offer some interesting ideas, like very efficient ways to kill with magic and invisibility pants (cloaks, after all, are visible from underneath).
