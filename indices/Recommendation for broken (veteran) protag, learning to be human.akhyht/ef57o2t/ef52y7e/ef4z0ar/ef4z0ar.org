Ann Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy sounds like it might suit you.

Perhaps also the following anime: - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam%3A_Iron-Blooded_Orphans][Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans]], specifically the arcs of Orga and (in season 2) Vidar. - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diebuster][Diebuster/Top wo Nerae 2]], specifically Lal'c's arc.
