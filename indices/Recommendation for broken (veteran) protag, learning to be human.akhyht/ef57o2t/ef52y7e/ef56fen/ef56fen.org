Really loved the first one.

I'll try out the second.

I'll tuck the last one away for later because I really don't know how to take my shots tragedy without some /hope/ as chaser right now.

Loved, adored, and was enraptured by Violet Evergarden. It was beautiful, though it lacked a bit of substance for me after episode 10. The quiet moments where Violet expresses herself in the minutia of her actions takes my breath away. (Though, to my annoyance it's the part that bores most people.)

To end it off: I think I'll move /Hope in a Dark World/ up to my core enjoyment criteria, since upon reflection that's the particular drug I'd like a fix of at the moment.
