This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but Full Metal Panic (light novel with an anime adaptation) ticks a lot of your boxes. Protag-kun is a child soldier who spent his early years as part of an insurgency in Afghanistan, then gets socialized as a Japanese teenager so that he can go undercover at a Japanese high school to protect an important military asset. (There's a bit of fish-out-of-water comedy aspect to the early seasons, as the skills he picked up as a child soldier are poorly suited to life as a Japanese high schooler, he's paranoid and has a bit of a hair trigger when it comes to reacting to situations with violence, which is mostly played for laughs.)

Full Metal Panic is set in an alternate history (alternate present?) based on a timeline where the Cold War never ended, and the US-Soviet arms race continued to the point where both sides developed mecha, and these mecha are the main tools of armed conflict around the world. In this alternate timeline, China (like Korea and Vietnam) had its own civil war, and is split into communist North China and democratic South China.

The mecha each sort of embody the ethos of certain kinds of weaponry and military, e.g. the Soviet Rk-92 is basically "What if the AK-47 was a robot": an ugly and heavy yet effective mass-produced mecha that's easy to pilot, exported en masse to North Korea and North China and serves as the backbone of many insurgencies around the world, while the United States M9 Gernsback is basically the embodiment of the Navy Seals in mecha form: special operations that are piloted by elite soldiers and require a lot of training to use effectively.

The military asset that Protag-kun guards is a female classmate who is one of a few people throughout the world who seem to possess supernaturally-high aptitude for science and engineering, to the point that most major advances of weapons research (e.g. the development of mecha) can be linked to government-run weapons programs effectively utilizing individuals who possess this ability. Unsurprisingly, this makes her a target for kidnappers (which is why Protag-kun is deployed to protect her in the first place).

In the early seasons, Protag-kun develops emotional connections to the people he spends time with during his undercover assignment (including the asset he was assigned to protect), and the later seasons deal with the consequences of that as he's unable to protect the people he cares about when the enemy proves to be too strong for his unit to handle. There's also the fact that the call of duty sometimes pulls him away from the people that he cares about, because the world has immediate pressing threats that are more important than "hang around in Japan and keep an eye on your friends."

The series probably wouldn't get a seal of approval from [[/r/rational]] for several reasons: in the early seasons, the show has some breaks in logic for the sake of comedy. As stated before, the fish-out-of-water aspect of a hardened soldier trying to adapt to life as a high school student is a big source of comedy early on, but the consequence of this is that if you take a step back, it becomes evident that Protag-kun is actually really bad at the whole "undercover" aspect of his assignment, which would lead one to question why he was selected for this mission in the first place. Later in the series, the villains' motivations also are sometimes clearly defined: their actions are always tactically sound (when the bad guys play, they play to win, and they're usually pretty good at it), but they're not always comprehensible from a strategic point of view. For example, the main antagonist of season 3 is explicitly insane and sometimes kills people just for the heck of it, which also sort of leads you to question the rationality of anyone who gave him that position of power.

That being said, I think there are a lot of things about it that would probably get a thumbs up, particularly the world building. Apart from the present-day Cold War setting being interesting on its own (and the design of the mechs reflecting the military ethos of the sides of the conflict that they represent in a way that I find to be very cool), it does a good job of making the robots feel like pieces of machinery that came out of a factory, rather than cool-looking characters that you'd see out of a Saturday morning cartoon meant to sell plastic toys. And when the robots do have extra "flair," it tends to have an in-universe explanation for these concessions to coolness. For example, the main character's mecha has a distinctive-looking head that distinguishes it from the standard-issue M9, but the purpose of the different head design is to hold an anti-tank dagger. The antagonist of the first arc has a mech with an attachment on the back of its head that looks sort of like hair that is bound into a ponytail, but this is explained as being a heat sink. And the series does acknowledge certain engineering limitations, like how the square-cube law basically places a limitation on how big a robot could be before it collapsed under its own weight, and how being really big at a certain point basically becomes a superpower that requires warping the laws of physics.

Probably my favorite thing about the series is that rather than succumbing to power creep, it often does the opposite: as the stakes grow higher and situations grow more desperate, the resources available to the main character tend to decrease and he has to complete his missions with /less/ powerful hardware. This is especially true in the latest season, where there's a real element of "Here's what we were able to scrounge up, hopefully your expertise as a pilot and your ability to use the terrain tactically will make up for it." It really does feel like he is surviving by his wits most of the time.

I recommend the anime, which adapts the light novels pretty faithfully; the animation quality sees a pretty significant uptick in quality after the first season, when KyoAni got the show. If you decide to read instead of watch, I'd still recommend watching The Wind Blows at Home (parts 1, 2, and 3) from the anime's first season (episodes 15-17) after reading the second volume of the light novel. Notably, this arc has a very "post 9/11" feel to it, as it was added in the anime adaptation that aired in 2002 (not part of the original light novels, which were written during the 90's), and it focuses on a story where the main character assists the US military as part of a mission to hunt down a terrorist in Afghanistan, which actually works really well with the story's fiction because Protag-kun is familiar with the geography of the area due to his childhood, and he has a personal connection to the terrorist they are hunting down. (The original story was written in the years following the Gulf War, so a lot of the groundwork was already laid.) There's also a manga which more loosely adapts the events of the light novels with some original side stories, the early events of the series are covered by the manga series written and illustrated by Retsu Tateo (simply titled "Full Metal Panic") and the later events of the series are covered in the manga series illustrated by Hiroshi Ueda (titled "Full Metal Panic Sigma"), which takes a few more liberties with the story. (Any other manga apart from these are sort of official fanworks and not really related to FMP canon.)
