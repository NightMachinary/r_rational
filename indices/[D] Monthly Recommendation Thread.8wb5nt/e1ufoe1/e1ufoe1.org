I'm going to reccomend the manga (and anime, although I haven't watched it) [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://myanimelist.net/manga/16765/Kingdom&ved=2ahUKEwiHv7KbyIjcAhUB4YMKHURQBT0QFjAlegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw2N7-2k5R5jQg-Un9TZG2lg][Kingdom]], which is in theory, a manga about the historical Qin dynasty's unication of china,and in practice a maximally hot blooded shonen violence fest with awesome, larger than life characters, devious plotters, and impressive art.

The main character is explicitly a-rational, but a number of the side characters and antagonists have INT as their primary stat.
