/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9209033/1/Breaking-the-Cycle][Breaking the Cycle]]/ (~400K WL) seemed to have good (if dry) prose, worldbuilding, and character designs. It just wasn't my idea of fun, so I've dropped it.

If you decide to give it a try, please reply to this comment of mine with your thoughts on it.
