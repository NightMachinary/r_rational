  Strunk and White; "comprised of" that discusses its frequent deprication by prescriptivists

Then it's a good thing I'm a descriptivist! "compromised" was obviously the wrong word so I changed it ,but "comprised" has a good-enough meaning, is widely understood to mean what it means, and doesn't pose any ambiguity.
