Sure, it's pretty simple.

The story has two separate parallel timelines. The first and original one is the "Paragon" timeline, and the second is the "Renegade" timeline. Initially the only difference between them is that the protagonist had a bad day at work before the events of the latter, and as a consequence was uncharacteristically impulsive and rude to the people he came across. That quickly snowballs like crazy leading to them being very different characters at this point of time, and the contrast between the two is entertaining.

The story is divided into episodes, and each episode is mostly from the viewpoint of either the Paragon character (indicated by white-colored date) or the Renegade (red-colored date). Episodes are further divided into chapters, with one chapter being released every day. Occasional a chapter will show what's going on at the same time in the other timeline. The color of the timestamp (again white/red) is used to indicate which of the two timelines is the focus of the current chapter.

So for example there could be an episode dealing with the Paragon investigating a series of crimes and how he solves them, with a single Renegade chapter at the end showing the aftermath of how he solved the problem.

I recommend reading both time lines. A lot of people get turned off of the Renegade segments because of how much of a jerk he acts like, but he gets a ton of character development and has some of the best parts of the story.
