Ok, so I've read this story and I like it.

Something I've never understood - The red chapter titles. So its like a timeline split? And most (all?) of the Red chapters are part of the "renegade" timeline (color/symbols from Mass Effect series)? However not all of the chapters seem to be part of the timeline? Or just some stuff gets ignored/retconnned without reference?

I've only read the story on the Story Only thread and... it is just weird. It detracts from my read, I want two "story only" threads if my interpretation of the Red/Not Red chapters is correct.

Anyway, I'm confused. Is it just me? Can anyone explain?
