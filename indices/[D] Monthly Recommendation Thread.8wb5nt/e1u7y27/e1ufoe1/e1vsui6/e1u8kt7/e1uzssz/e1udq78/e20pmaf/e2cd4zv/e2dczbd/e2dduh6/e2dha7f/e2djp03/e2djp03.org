Nope, no idea what checkpoints might be coming up. We're in uncharted waters. Finishing his year of service to the League was a big one, I guess, but that was over a (real) year ago, before I even started reading it.

However, since it updates daily without fail, my approach has simply been to follow it throughout the journey. There's never very long to wait for the next instalment.

I guess you could consider in-story April 1 to be a checkpoint of sorts? It got pretty crazy last time, and Mr Zoat has indicated that he has a bunch of ideas for the next one. But consider, there has only been one occurrence of that date thus far.
