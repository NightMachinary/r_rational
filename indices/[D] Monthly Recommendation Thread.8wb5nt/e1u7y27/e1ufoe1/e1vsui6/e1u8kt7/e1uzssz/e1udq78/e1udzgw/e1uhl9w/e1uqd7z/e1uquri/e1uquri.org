Orange lanterns never appear in the Young Justice show and I have no idea if they every appear in any other animated DC show (I doubt it, they are kind of obscure). But the author pulls a lot of content from the wider DC comic universe that wasn't in the show. It only lasted for two seasons so if he restricted himself to just what actually aired, it wouldn't have lasted very long.
