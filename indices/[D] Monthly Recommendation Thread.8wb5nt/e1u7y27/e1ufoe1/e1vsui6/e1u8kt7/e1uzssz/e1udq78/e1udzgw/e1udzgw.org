Not really. He is very good about linking to wikis for characters the first time he introduces them (and usually there is enough in story info to get their motiviations etc.). I have watched the TV show (it's great, you should watch it) but I have read nearly zero DC comics. Knowing a lot would add some slight depth to your understanding and probably help you guess upcoming twists better, but it is almost completely unnecessary to enjoy the story.
