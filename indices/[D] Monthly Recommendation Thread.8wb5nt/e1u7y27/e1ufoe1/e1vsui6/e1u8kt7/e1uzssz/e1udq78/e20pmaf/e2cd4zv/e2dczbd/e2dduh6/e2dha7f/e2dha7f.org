That is... damn.

If you're aware of the most recent "episodes", do you know if there is an important "checkpoint" coming soon, at least? Or one that has been reached relatively recently?

With a schedule like that the only thing I can think of is to re-read it again now, up to some important plot landmark, and then read once more 10-15 year from now (if the circumstances allow for it by then).

The last time I've read it was to somewhere around episodes 40-50.
