*Request*

I'm looking for stories which are *grimdark* and/or have very *gray morality* and/or have *villains* as the *protagonist*, while also having *smart/driven main characters*.

A few varied (but limited) examples:

[[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/][Ruthless]] (one of the best HP fanfics I've read - smart and depressing)

[[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/][Practical Guide to Evil]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man][Metropolitan Man]]

[[http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html][The Dark Wizard of Donkerk]]

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154798.Superman][Superman: Red Son]]

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/83726-how-to-succeed-in-evil][How To Succeed in Evil]]

[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917233-snow-glass-apples][Neil Gaiman's Snow, Glass, Apples]]

[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179186-the-dire-saga][The Dire Saga]] (Though I stopped reading after book 3)

[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/][The End of the F***ing World]]

I've also tried a few asian translated novels like [[https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world][Warlock of the Magus World]] but (possibly mainly because of the translation) to me they read like written by stereotypical overly excited 13 year old gamers though some of the concepts seem great at first. So maybe there's something that can sate my thirst there, although I am starting to doubt it.
