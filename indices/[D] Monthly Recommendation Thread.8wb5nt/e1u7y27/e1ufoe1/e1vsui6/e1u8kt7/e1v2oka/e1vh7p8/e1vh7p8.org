I would recommend Joe Abercrombie. [[https://www.joeabercrombie.com/books/best-served-cold/][Best Served Cold]] isa good place to start, but you could also start with the first book in the First Law series.

I feel like you must have tried [[https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/][A Practical Guide to Evil]], though it's not as grimdark as some of your others.

Another one to try is [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0052RERW8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1][Prince of Thorns]].
