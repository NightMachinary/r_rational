Seconding the recommendation for Joe Abercrombie's novels (and to a lesser extent the Mark Lawrence novel). Best Served Cold is, from the outset, the novel that most ticks the boxes but I would recommend starting with the first novel in that world, The Blade Itself, which is from a trilogy that develops in a very interesting way.
