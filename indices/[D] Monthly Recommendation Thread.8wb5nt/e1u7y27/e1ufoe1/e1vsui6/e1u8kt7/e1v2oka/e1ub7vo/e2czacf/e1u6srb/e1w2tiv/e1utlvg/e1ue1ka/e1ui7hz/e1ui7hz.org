I decided that I bloody well hated that on the grounds that it is just straight up carnography, the social setups make zero percent sense (.. Where are the cities with gun-focused classes? The societies that deal with monsters via organized armies? One of their initial neighbours had an infinite ammo source.. but nope instead we have societies with such toxic focus on violence that they have major to-the-death tournaments while under constant external attack..), and also there is no logic to the world building. Â¨

The casualty rates are much to high to work in the absence of resurrection magics (Everywhere. Not just on earth. Every society we see loose so many more people to combat than they can possibly get from reproduction that it is not funny) and the xp/ power curves are whatever makes the best masturbatory power fantasy.

Re; the last bit, the main character should start falling approximately infinitely behind when everyone else starts using dungeons, but this never happens. His initial edge in power was from spending time in a fast-time dungeon. He never enters another one, while everyone else makes use of them... but somehow he does not get left behind. ARRGH.
