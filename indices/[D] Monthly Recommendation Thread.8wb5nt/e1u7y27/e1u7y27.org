*Book recommendations:*

- I recently read [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant][/The Traitor Baru Cormorant/]] by Seth Dickinson, and found it to be a /marvelous/ rational story. Goodreads' summary is pretty good:

  #+begin_quote
    Tomorrow, on the beach, Baru Cormorant will look up from the sand of her home and see red sails on the horizon.

    The Empire of Masks is coming, armed with coin and ink, doctrine and compass, soap and lies. They'll conquer Baru's island, rewrite her culture, criminalize her customs, and dispose of one of her fathers. But Baru is patient. She'll swallow her hate, prove her talent, and join the Masquerade. She will learn the secrets of empire. She'll be exactly what they need. And she'll claw her way high enough up the rungs of power to set her people free.

    In a final test of her loyalty, the Masquerade will send Baru to bring order to distant Aurdwynn, a snakepit of rebels, informants, and seditious dukes. Aurdwynn kills everyone who tries to rule it. To survive, Baru will need to untangle this land's intricate web of treachery - and conceal her attraction to the dangerously fascinating Duchess Tain Hu.

    But Baru is a savant in games of power, as ruthless in her tactics as she is fixated on her goals. In the calculus of her schemes, all ledgers must be balanced, and the price of liberation paid in full.

  Its worldbuilding is excellent --- calling it "low-fantasy" would be an understatement: it has a "fantasy" feel, but everything is fully reducible to physics. It has a truly fascinating number of [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent][Level 2 Intelligent]] characters. Its themes, of power and well-intentioned extremism, would be very appealing to this subreddit.

  I'm somewhat surprised it's not more popular here.

  (Also, [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35485447-the-monster-baru-cormorant][the first sequel]] is scheduled to be released this October.)

- [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14][/14/]] by Peter Clines is not as good as the aforementioned book, but is still pretty interesting. Premise: A man moves into a new apartment building, and gradually discovers a lot of seemingly-supernatural or just weird anomalies. Lightbulbs in his kitchen shine black light, five-legged green cockroaches are running around the building, door to one of the other apartments lacks a doorknob, and so on.

  Naturally, he attempts to figure out what's going on.

  Characters generally act reasonable, and there's quite a few tropes [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would enjoy. It's not without flaws, though, [[#s][light spoiler]].

- [[https://thefifthdefiance.com/about/][/The Fifth Defiance/]] by [[/u/WalterTFD][u/WalterTFD]] is a rational story set in post-apocalyptic ruins of a "superheroes" setting. It has an interesting flavour, and a lot of high-power-levels conflicts. It's pretty grim, though.

*Film recommendations:*

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(film)][/Annihilation/]] follows a group of researchers set to investigate a strange, slowly-expanding anomaly, possibly of extraterrestrial origin. It's generally rational, and doesn't try to dumb anything down. It also [[#s][conceptual spoiler]], which is nearly unheard-of in movies.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Cloverfield_Lane][/10 Cloverfield Lane/]]. Premise: the protagonist wakes up in a bunker after suffering a car incident, with two men --- the bunker's owner, and his acquaintance. The owner tells her that he saved her life, that there has been "an attack", and that the air outside is "contaminated", so they all must stay there. She must figure out what to do and who to trust.

  The protagonist is pretty sensible, and the movie is pretty good at playing with an inquisitive viewer's expectations.
