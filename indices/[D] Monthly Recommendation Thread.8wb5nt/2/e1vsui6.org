/Oh my god/

Easily the best thing I've read this year.

About a chemist that winds up in a nasty invasion on an island in a pre-industrial world. World is consistent and interesting. Realistic populations, inventions, administration, and people. Author has a really nice writing style on top of that. I even bought the 4th book since I was so invested.
