The webcomic [[http://drmcninja.com/][The Adventures of Dr. McNinja]] is certainly not rational fic but I think it has some elements that readers here will enjoy.

/Dr. McNinja/ is about a man raised as a ninja, who dreamed of being like Batman, and now serves as a Vigilante crimefighter in the city of Cumberland while also running a medical practice that treats exotic ailments. All to the disappointment of his ninja family.

It's a very silly comic and ridiculous things happen all the time. It has some trappings familiar to us rational-fic readers: [[#s][spoiler]]

However, it's genuinely funny and it has a pretty well-constructed plot overall. Furthermore,

- The antagonist King Radical is definitely the hero of his own story. [[#s][spoiler]] He is also an intelligent villain, and he [[#s][spoiler]]
- The immortal Dracula [[#s][spoiler]]
- Franz Rayner is genre-savvy, even when the genre is absurd. [[#s][spoiler]]
