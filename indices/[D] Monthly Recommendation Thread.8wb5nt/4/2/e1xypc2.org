I think the most grimdark online rational serial I've read is a sailor moon story, sailor nothing.

Death Note was a fairly rational anime and is also pretty grim.

Grim videogames that I thought were good but may or may not be rational are Bioshock and Lisa.

I also want to add an anti-recommendation for Madoka. It's fairly dramatic and grim but most of the drama there happens because the protagonists are idiots.
