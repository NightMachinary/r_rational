Is there any hint at all about when it is going to get finished? I keep waiting and waiting, and the authur just keeps writing and writing.

On one hand, it's a good thing that the future me will be reading a longer story by this author (who, as you said, writes rather well). On the other hand, if it keeps going like this, the world as we know it may collapse sooner than the author gets done with the story.
