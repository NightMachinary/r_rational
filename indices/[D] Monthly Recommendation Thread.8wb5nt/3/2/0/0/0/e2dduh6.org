  So it would be another RL year for the 5th year, and then maybe another one for S02, seems like? Which gives an estimated completion date around 2020-ish?

Er, no. Read it again. He has taken 5 real years - since August 2013 - to write 1 year and nearly 4 months (4 July 2010 to 1 November 2011) in-story, and that rate doesn't seem to be changing. To reach the 5th year of the timeskip won't take one real year, it will take more like 20. Estimated completion 2030-ish, give or take 5 years each way.
