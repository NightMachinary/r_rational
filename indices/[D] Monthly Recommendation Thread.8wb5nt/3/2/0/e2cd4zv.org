There was a five year time skip between seasons one and two of canon. He plans to cover it /without/ a time skip.

His current rate is just under 4 real years to every story year - it's been nearly 5 years real, and nearly 1 year 4 months in-story, so that's about 15-20 years total.

A lot of this is because of the level of detail. "Show, don't tell" is a good writing principle for engaging your audience, but it makes a lot of work for the author and makes your story far too long for traditional publishing methods. In this case, he's just embraced it and to Vega with the costs. The estimate of 2 million words is actually low; I heard 2.3 a while ago, it would be more now.
