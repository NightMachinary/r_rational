I understand the confusion, since it really isn't explained in the story only, and only kind of explained in the main thread FAQ.

The divergence is actually before the story starts. The Renegade had a bad day at the office the day before he was transported to the DC universe, and was determined not to take shit from anyone. This was exacerbated by the orange ring, and later venombuster injection, meaning the Renegade will usually take the aggressive, less diplomatic options and the Paragon will take more diplomatic and generally longer term options. The author notes however that neither is strictly auperior to the other, unlike in the Mass Effect games that the system takes its name from. When the viewpoint character would normally take one option and suddenly changes their mind, that decision change is indicated by the paragon/renegade symbol. All actions taken in either timeline are internally consistent, but have no bearing on the other, so there's no retconning. Not intentionally anyways, the author may forget something occasionally. One bit you may have gotten confused on is that there were a few updates from the Red Lantern's perspective that also had the date colored red, but that was fairly distinctive. Maybe you're talking about when the episode title is in a different color than the date and time? The episode title's color indicates who will be the focus of the episode, the date and time color says who will be the focus of that single post.

The timelines can't be separated into different threads because you often need context from the other timeline in order to understand the current one. Otherwise details would have been written twice.

For the early part of the story, you can generally assume that the Renegade parts went about as the Paragon ones did except where otherwise noted.

If you have any other questions, I should be able to answer.
