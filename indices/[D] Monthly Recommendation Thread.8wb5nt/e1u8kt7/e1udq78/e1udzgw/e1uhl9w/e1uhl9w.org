Given how many different versions of DC there are, and how the author chooses which version to use in his story, not knowing DC as well can actually be helpful because you don't get confused as to various characters origins and histories, or how their powers work. Lanterns have been shown to have wildly varying power levels in the comics, so having a consistent knowledge of how they work in this one story where the author really tries for consistency is convenient.

It is nice to know what characters look like, but that's pretty easy to find out if they aren't given sufficient description in story.
