:D Well, I'm sure Mr Zoat would say that the first few chapters probably weren't his /best/ work. If I were (somehow) in his shoes, having written millions of words over nearly 5 years, I certainly hope that I'd be a better writer than when I started :D.

There is a lot of name dropping, yeah. He seems to have encyclopedic knowledge of all manner of mainstream and obscure characters. Still, as mentioned previously, he's pretty good about linking to wikis and snippets when introducing new names and faces. I'm sure I recognised even less than you, and still enjoyed it.

(Is there any particular reason why an Orange Lantern, powered by greed and avarice, should /not/ attempt to get ahead by collecting a huge stack of precious metal and buying a powerful artifact so he can keep drawing on more of the orange light? It seems to fit in just fine with the rules governing his powers.)

By the way, you might find that you prefer the Renegade episodes. Initially it's just an occasional retelling of a chapter with a bit more rudeness, but as the story progresses, he develops into a full-blown and quite independent character whom many people have come to appreciate. The Paragon and Renegade timelines no longer have much in common; different powers, different people, different challenges
