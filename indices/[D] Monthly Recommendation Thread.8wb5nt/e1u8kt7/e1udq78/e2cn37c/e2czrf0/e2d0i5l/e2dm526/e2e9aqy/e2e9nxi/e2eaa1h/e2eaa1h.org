Could be. It's certainly way too much story to read if you aren't enjoying it.

It's hard to describe the overall theme, because a) there's loads of it; b) in line with the source material, it's very episodic, full of smaller partly-self-contained stories. But it's basically an uplift story. The DC human race has loads of undeveloped and ignored potential, and the SI wants to develop it.
