He does have an end goal in mind. I think he's planning on writing through the events of the second season (including the intervening years). Last I heard, this was planned to take a couple more years to finish. I have no idea if this has been updated with the news of a new season or not. If you post on the discussion thread of sufficient velocity, I'm sure someone can give you a better answer.

In summary: he has an end goal I'm just not sure exactly when he'll reach it other than "in a while"
