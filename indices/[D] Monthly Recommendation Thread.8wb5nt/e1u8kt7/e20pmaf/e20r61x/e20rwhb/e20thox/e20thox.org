Umm, what do you consider recent? There have been the usual ups and downs with slow chapters but I don't think it's gotten any worse and there have been some pretty good story lines. There was one plot arc (which hasn't been finished quite yet, just put aside) that a lot of people weren't huge fans of but I thought it was fine.
