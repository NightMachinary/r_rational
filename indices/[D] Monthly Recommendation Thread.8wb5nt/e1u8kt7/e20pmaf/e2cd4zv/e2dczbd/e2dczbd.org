  There was a five year time skip between seasons one and two of canon. He plans to cover it without a time skip.

Oh, so /that's/ what's going on! I've tried once or twice to locate the story's current progress related to canon, but after canon's season one it felt like the two stories lost touch with each other. Which wasn't very helpful in figuring out when it would touch back with C!S02, and get finished.

  His current rate is just under 4 real years to every story year

So it would be another RL year for the 5th year, and then maybe another one for S02, seems like? Which gives an estimated completion date around 2020-ish?
