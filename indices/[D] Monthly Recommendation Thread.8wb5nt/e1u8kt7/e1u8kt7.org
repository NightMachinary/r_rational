Just because I haven't seen it posted here in a while, I'm going to recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/][With this Ring]].

It's a self insert fan fiction of the Young Justice animated tv show where the main character is given an Orange Power Ring (in case you are unfamiliar, Orange rings are fueled by avarice, and have a tendency to drive their users insane over time. Dealing with this and trying to still be a productive super hero is a major theme of the early chapters).

It updates every day (literally every day, he hasn't missed a single day in years, it's ~2 million words by my rough estimate). The protagonist is pretty rational but the world he is in (DC comics) is decidedly non-rational. I think the writing is pretty good (although there are definitely some quirks that the author does that take some getting used to), the characterization and growth of even side characters is generally engaging and interesting and there is also some pretty good munchinkry of power ring abilities.

The worst thing about it is that in my time zone (Pacific Time) new updates usually post between 10 and 11 pm and so I end up staying up too late waiting for the new chapter.
