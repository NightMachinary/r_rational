Comprised of isn't wrong, but sometimes frowned on in a Strunk and White sort of way. It's better to say comprises:

#+begin_quote
  As an aside, I was actually kind of surprised to see the movie and realize that women comprise the whole main cast.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't actually say composed of is any better than comprised of.

Compromised is right out.

There's a good Wikipedia article on "comprised of" that discusses its frequent deprication by prescriptivists. tl;dr, it's legit, but people frequently complain about it without much justification.
