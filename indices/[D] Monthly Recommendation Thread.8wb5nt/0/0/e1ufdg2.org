I very much second Annhihilation.

As an aside, I was actually kind of surprised to see the movie and realize the main cast was only comprised* of women. It was obvious in the trailer, but I guess it didn't register because they didn't make a big deal out of it. I thought that was pretty impressive; the characters weren't just /incidentally/ women, in that their gender did matter and affected the plot, but at the same time, they weren't /exclusively/ women, in that their gender was advertised as a primary trait. Basically, Annihilation was what the new ghostbusters should have been.

Also, the soundtrack was fucking dope.
