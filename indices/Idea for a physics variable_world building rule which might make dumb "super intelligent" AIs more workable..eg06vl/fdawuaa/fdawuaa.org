I mean you could make it physics by calling it some constant that only shows up when the result of a calculation would result in some predicted time line that is above some limit of entropy increase... I don't really remember all the math symbols anymore but for all energetic exchanges E add some energy amount X if Function(E, CurrentUniverse) results in more entropy than some constant P. X is scaled by Function(E, CurrentUniverse) - P. The magic is in Function(E, CurrentUniverse) but you can have people figure out the P but not understand how Function(E, CurrentUniverse) works. They can use it as an oracle and predict the future but you can just pretend that doesn't exist but it does give you a path to kill the "AI takes over the universe" path.
