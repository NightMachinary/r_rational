They're very different though. In A Fire Upon The Deep the force isn't aimed at superintelligences, and it's not selective on the basis of utility functions or anything like that, it's just a law of nature, impartial with respect to anything we could consider ethical principles. That is not hard to imagine for a fictional universe. What OP is asking is much harder, and not because of the bit about jamming intelligence.
