I read a story where humanity successfully built a Singularity in the distant past, and it immediately uplifted us to a post-scarcity, post-death, warp-capable, multi-system power over the course of about a day, then fucked off into higher dimensions never to be heard from again. All the story trappings of a society built by a benevolent deity without the lack of conflict inherent in the existence of such an entity.
