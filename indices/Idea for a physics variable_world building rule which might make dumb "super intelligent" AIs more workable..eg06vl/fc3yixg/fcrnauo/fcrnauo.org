Not exactly, in Fire Upon the Deep all you had was a change of physics laws between intergalactic space and space inside the galaxies. Basically, wherever there was more mass (or more dark matter? It's unclear what decides it), there also was a slower speed of light and general laws that supported less computational complexity /of any kind/. It had nothing to do with the intelligence's nature or intent. Intergalactic space was extremely flexible and allowed for physical gods. Galactic nuclei were extremely restrictive and wouldn't even allow ordinary intelligent life. And we live in sort of an intermediate zone.
