The question is I suppose how do you define a limitation in intelligence in terms of pure laws of physics. The way we understand it now, intelligence is simply the emergent property of an information-processing system. The only way I can see to limit it in whatever form it comes is to either limit the speed of light (so that information can't be transmitted faster than a certain threshold, even between neurons or transistors), or to limit the fidelity of such transmission (adding stochastic fluctuations to all signals - maybe this could be achieved by tweaking quantum mechanics, enhancing vacuum fluctuations and such, but I doubt it'd affect /only/ intelligence, it'd probably just wreck matter and life as we know it).

It gets easier if you postulate that general intelligence actually requires a very specific mechanism. If for example you said that only quantum computers could be truly intelligent, and that the brain is effectively one (a bit farfetched but something that we still occasionally see half serious claims for), then you open up new possibilities for specific fine-tuning that limits intelligence. For example, if you also adopted an objective collapse interpretation, speeding up the collapse would actively limit the ability of a quantum computer to carry out massively parallel evaluations of the same scenario. However that too would affect everyone, both AIs and living beings, unless the scope of the effect was ridiculously cherry-picked, in which case, why wouldn't this divine-like entity just blow up the CPU of any malicious AI to begin with?
