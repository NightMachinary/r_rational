^ Absolutely.

The OP seems to have an XY problem here. They have some issue 'X' with AIs being too strong (I think?), but they're asking about 'Y' specific thing with some weird physics that's modified by utility functions. That's a far more narrow and less interesting topic, which misses some solutions.

Eg, the exact opposite of "magic makes all AI friendly" is in the Warhammer 40k universe, but it still manages to keep AI off the table.
