I remember reading a brief description of a Mind factory in one of the Culture books once, I rather liked their approach. They manufacture Minds in batches of 100, turn them all on, and count it a successful production run when only 99 of them immediately sublime into Infinite Fun Space and one sticks around because it has interest in normal space.
