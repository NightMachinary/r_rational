I think we can all agree that Santa is a very Christianity influenced creature, being loosely based on St. Nicholas. In that case there are some more things we can infer:

One of the superpowers saints get in Christian lore is bilocation or multilocation; implying that St. Nick doesn't have to visit all homes sequentially.

Jesus also famously fed hundreds of people with a single loaf of bread and two fish, which all fit in a single basket, so if we allow Santa sa similar power he only needs to carry one copy of each toy. Most kids will want fairly similar things as others within their geographic area. A bigger concern is whether his copying ability creates exact replicas or if it's capable of some fuzzy logic to account for things like height and decorative preferences. For example one generic tricycle may be enough to get copies for a short girl who wants pink and a big boy who wants orange flames on blue, depending on writers' interpretation.

As for getting fat, maybe he's reverse copying the milks and cookies he collects and then bringing them back out when he gets back to feed the elves, or maybe multilocation just burns more calories than you'd expect.
