Might be whooshing, but the Santa /Cklause/ is alluding to the fact that the main character became Santa Claus, because of a clause stating that anyone putting on the suit becomes Santa Claus, thus it being called the "Santa Clause".

That, and the writers at Disney probably wanted to use the silly pun.
