But yea. If he was real, magic would be real, or I guess he could do that shit with tech too. So probably aliens or something instead, because it would be more probable than he figuring out all that tech himself.

UNLESS maybe if he was immortal and just had enough time, which could work, but he would really need some industry stuff because making shit from ground up yourself is /hard/. Like those youtubers making toasters etc from nothing have shown us.

But Santa has elves. Small little slaves slaving away. Made by magic? Are they aliens? Maybe Santa used his tech to gather the small elves that some countries traditional lore talks about. Like in Finland we had all kinds of elves, home elves, sauna elves...

So he might have enslaved them to work in his industry and that's why we don't see and believe in the elves anymore.

But... the toys kids get tend to be made by these huge corporations nowadays. No way elves make iphones and shit. So maybe the US army already got Santa. The spying game of elves is good as Santa kept lists of who is good and who is bad.
