No of course. Nothing against true dirty fighting skills. But currently he is learning how to mindshield. Using the spell is like learning self defense and then hiding behind some flimsy wall for a while. It doesn't add at all to the training part of the exercise. All it does is slow progress. If it was a test instead of training I'd understand it though.
