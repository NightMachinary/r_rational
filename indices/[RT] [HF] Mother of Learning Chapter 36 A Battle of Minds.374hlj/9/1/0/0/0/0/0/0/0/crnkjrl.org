Ah, it should be "I don't see there being spells that restore psychic energy". Psychic energy is just mana, albeit a specialized form used by mindmages. A spell that restores mana doesn't exist. Mana regen is based off a mage's ability to absorb and refine ambient mana, and the quantity of ambient mana. It why mages tend to live above above mana wells.
