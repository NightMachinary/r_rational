Think this chapter had big hints towards the Bakora gate stones.

Bakora gates an ancient teleportation network ... more like an ancient network of recall anchors.

Am thinking the Bakora gates as a recall network were abandoned as inconvenient once teleportation magic became widespread. Also, thinking they are the height of recall magic and will work much better than the current recall stone he just figured out.
