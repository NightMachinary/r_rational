If he had indeed spent weeks in constant contact with a psychic that would mean he would be likely to spill the secret but in actuality he just had daily lessons where he spent a short time with his teacher, and then collapsed later in a headache away.

At the start of chapter seventeen he notes the issue. As a mage he has had years of training to clear his mind of stray thoughts and can already do that well, but doing it for extended periods of time is tiring and leads to failure. He had short bursts with a psychic.

The alien mind issue also can't be discounted. Suppose after his defences were crushed he let out an involuntary thought "Next time in this month's loop I'll crush her back."

She isn't a human expert, she doesn't know human idioms or language that well. The idea of a time loop isn't even on her radar, unlike with the matriarch who was considering it due to the invaders. Many random emotions or thoughts aren't going to be clear enough for her to have any sort of idea of what he means. She's more likely to think "Hah, another uppity student. He won't be anywhere close to that in our next session this month. If he feels like it's getting repetitive though maybe I should call in another teacher to spice things up."

Suppose you heard someone say "This day feels like it never ends." would you think that meant they had a temporal stasis machine?
