I remember that there was a small impact. She was a device to show how small changes in behavior each loop can have huge repercussions. Specifically he decided to not go the path where he met the girl in most of his repeats. Then in one of the loops he passes the bridge and there is a scene where he notices a cat sadly looking out to the river or something like that. I took it as meaning that the girl tried to get the bicycle on her own and... failed. Actually gave me an emotional twinge.
