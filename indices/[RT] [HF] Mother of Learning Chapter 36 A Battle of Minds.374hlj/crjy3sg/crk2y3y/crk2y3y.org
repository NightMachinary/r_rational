I'm not sure if Chekov's guns actually work for Mother of Learning... For example the little girl in Cyora who lost her bicycle is mentioned completely at the beginning but nothings comes out of this and I don't think it will have an impact...

Actually what I like about this story is that a lot of little details are mentioned but contrarily to other work where details always end up having relevance to the story at hand, here it's not always the case. It makes it harder to guess what will happen...
