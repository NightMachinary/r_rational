Another fun chapter, I really like this series. Wish it updated more often, but I'll take what I'm given and be happy with it.

At this point it looks like I was wrong about the Sword Divers just being overly cautious/suspicious of Zorian, and that they're more likely just assholeish. Then again, even the IGC matriarch stated that there was no way to be completely sure of their motivations. The YCG are suspicious for their immediate denial to Zorian, but I'm wondering if they've been targeted by the invaders or Red Robe, which could be significant. Or it could be nothing.

It's amusing how easily the River Navigators accepted his offer. I wonder how many loops he'll spend in Mind Like Fire's tutelage before he decides to move on up to the Luminous Advocates for top tier training. I wonder if the story will start moving faster once he's able to read the minds of any invaders or other enemies he encounters.

Given Zorian's personality, if he makes it out of everything alive, he's going to be spending the next few years paying back people for assistance they gave him within the loop which they'll have absolutely no knowledge.
