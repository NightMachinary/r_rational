In chapter 17 the matriarch notes that Zorian is hard to read covertly as he's open and that he has impressive discipline with his surface thoughts. I suspect that applies. His teacher might catch the odd surface thought but invading his innermost memories would be obvious to him and as such his teacher avoids doing that. After all his training and practice this would be even more true.

Plus he has an alien mind, being human, so his mind is hard to read.

I'd also note that he is very obviously a dangerous and deadly wizard. Aranea are likely very nervous about deliberately pissing him off.
