I don't see there being spells don't restore psychic energy, since that's still just mana. Possibly there's a spell to refresh/restore mental acuity, some magical equivalent of caffeine.

There were a few other things I was wondering though, if psychic abilities fall under the category of "unstructured magic", does this current training count as a shaping exercise? We were told that mastering shaping exercises reduced the mana cost of related magics and increased effectiveness. Given that the mental abilities are already his most cost-efficient magic, does this mean they'll get a whole lot better as his training continues? In addition, we don't really know how Zorian compares in mana capacity to the Aranea, so it's even possible that his subpar human mana capacity is actually better than an Araneas.

More to the topic at hand, after a mind shield has been defeated once, it's possible that it is no longer particular effective. Take one of those interlinked blacksmith puzzles, at first you might have trouble with it, but after you've learned the trick it's easy to deal with. Even if Zorian had used his Mind Shield spell in the training against Mind Like Fire, she might be able to get around it much faster the more he attempts it.
