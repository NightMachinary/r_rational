I was hoping Zorian would be clever enough to use the mind shield spell to give him a moment to rebuild his defenses, but w/e.

Now I'm just waiting for more character interaction.

I suppose real long-term interaction will have to wait until Zorian is confident that no-one will be able to easily do damage to him that will last through resets.
