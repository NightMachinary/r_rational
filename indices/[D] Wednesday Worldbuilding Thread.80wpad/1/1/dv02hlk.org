I've wanted to take a crack at a "rational" Wakanda myself, but pretty sure some people would be grumpy at my approach.

Generally any country which has one singular, amazing resource is just going to be rich from outside money as others come to acquire it. On its own, however, it's just got a funky material that may be used commonly where everywhere else its non-existant (the movie mentioned them weaving Vibranium into their clothes, but we never saw much practical application of that).

Movie Wakanda isn't thought through very well. OK, so some meteorite landed in prehistoric times. It's also made of this nigh-invulnerable metal. So how did the tribes mine it in the first place? Did they already have metallurgy? Did they somehow spontaneously develop it from working with a material much more durable and damage resistant than, say, copper, tin, or iron?

How did their society advance so quickly? Just having a magic metal won't cause that. Being isolationist won't do much either, since, similar to various turn-based civilization building games, you're going to miss out on a /lot/ of possible developments simply because there aren't enough people to randomly discover all of them.

We have evidence of some 7th or 10th century Viranium weapons, but it's just an axe or pick looking thing. OK, why is that special? Iron was used anywhere up to a millennia before that. A melee weapon made of the stuff would be good against other weapons of 'standard' metals, but it's not as crazy as the Vibranium based blasters (nevermind how, if Cap has a shield of the stuff and Panther a suit, and it /absorbs kinetic energy/, it should be functionally useless as a weapon, because it would absorb the energy of its own impact).

Why are the herbs not eaten by everyone to turn them into an entire society of Superhumans? I mean, they won't be Kryptonians or anything, but they'd be much better off if everyone had the "power of the panther" than just one guy at a time. I get there's some mystical things going, but how does that tie in to an alien metal from the stars?

"Movie" Wakanda is hardly rational at all. It can be fixed, but it would change a /lot/ of the backstory to have it make sense.
