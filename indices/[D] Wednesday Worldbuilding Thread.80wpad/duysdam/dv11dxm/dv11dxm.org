Some quickfire plots/stories (I recommend this exercise for any large worldbuilding project):

- Due to an upcoming match and an ailing patriarch, a bastard is legitimized
- After the death of her brother and a separate social disgrace, an accountant marries the most martially proficient commoner she can find so that she has someone to defend her
- People begin selling stock in a company that's due for a trial that will almost certainly be adjudicated extremely unfavorably, shareholders attempting to escape with as little loss as possible. A fifth son buys up the stock for pennies on the dollar, gambling that he can win and make a name for himself.
- Two sons fight over which of them will defend their father, in a family drama type of situation (both were raised as fighters on the theory that one of them might not make it to adulthood)
- Due to some rather unusual circumstances, an adjudicator in a rural area is forced to adjudicate for a dispute that his own family is involved in, and must walk the line between family and justice
- An adjudicator makes what he believes is a just ruling in setting up a match, but background pressures mean that his censure is demanded, especially since otherwise the ruling he made might be cited as precedent. He's forced to fight for his life.
- In a high-profile case, members of the jury pool begin recusing themselves, until a single man must choose whether or not he will fight for what he believes are the correct politics, or bow to social pressure.
