Battle-school worldbuilding, pt. 4 ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vwof7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dtw306v/][pt. 1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xim6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/du8n1im/][pt. 2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z66gn/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dulzjqx/?context=3][pt 3]])

Now for some social stuff. I realized early on that I wanted trial-by-combat, but not in the form it takes in, say, /A Song of Ice and Fire/ where it's an exceptional or noteworthy thing. In the Fencer trilogy by K.J. Parker, there are fencers-at-law, which is an awesome title, but there they serve more as hired guns rather than people with an actual stake engaging in the combat/trial, and given that they're hired, fencers-at-law seem like they don't actually change the society /too/ much, in that the rich can still effectively buy their way out of problems with the poor.

Instead, I want the trial-by-combat to have personal stakes, so:

- Anyone fighting in your place must be a /direct/ blood relative (mother/father/sister/brother) or legally married to you.
- In certain extreme circumstances, the fights are "naked", e.g. without the magical arena putting you back together after

This means:

- People have a pretty large incentive to marry a skilled fighter, especially if they have a trial coming up
- Bastards are left out in the cold unless they're formally recognized
- Orphans are left to fend for themselves
- Parents have incentive to raise at least one strong fighter who can take care of them when they become to old to effective fight
- Parents have incentive to raise a large number of children, both in order to ensure that they will be legally protected, and to ensure that the children will be able to protect each other

All of which are probably good for the setting and the general martial culture it's intended to have. /However/, you might have noticed the immediate problem, which is that a good enough fighter could just steamroll their way through any legal problem, to the detriment of society as a whole (not really a problem) including the other elites (definitely a problem). To remedy that:

- Adjudicators exist as pseudo-judges, with a little bit of detective mixed in; they weigh evidence, listen to testimony, conduct investigations, and while they don't actually pass judgement, as that's the purpose of trial-by-combat, they /do/ set the terms of the trial, and are endowed with the power of setting asymmetric rules that favor one combatant or the other in especially egregious cases. This would never be to the point where one combatant is /assured/ of victory, only to the point where one is disadvantaged because some burden of proof has been met.
- Adjudicators come from the elite class, usually as third or fourth children that are of less value to the family, or as sickly, infirm, maimed, etc. that would never be more than a burden. (I don't think that there are enough elites in the setting relative to the commoners that there would be enough adjudicators for all the commoners, so perhaps there are two classes, with elite/commoner disputes being handled exclusively by the elite adjudicators.)
- Adjudicators also have wide latitude in setting the terms of the battles, but it's often expected that the battle will have some sort of theme or ironic twist such that the battle is representative of the legal conflict (e.g. if it's about fishing rights, both combatants might be forced to use nets or tridents). This might be a little too Rule of Cool though.
- Because there has to be some additional lever of power against the adjudicators, any individual adjudicator can be put into their own special trial-by-combat on the say-so of a quorum of adjudicators. Family loyalties /probably/ help to prevent the entire adjudicator class from going rogue.

And then there's one additional problem to be solved, which is that legal battles aren't just person against person, they're person against corporation, or person against state.

- In legal disputes between an individual and the state, the state combatant is selected from a "jury pool" made up of volunteers from among the elite. It is considered an honor to defend the state, combatants are given a generous influx of funds, and you are granted the goodwill of the adjudicators. Adjudicators can refuse members of the jury pool due to conflicts of interest, or for a few other reasons like being unfit for combat.
- In legal disputes against a corporation, any member of the corporation with at least 20% stake can fight for the corporation. In the absence of anyone having that much stake, the person with the highest stake will be selected.

I /think/ that both covers everything, and gives a lot of fodder for plot/story, as well as helping to hit on some of what I hope are the themes of the story, like inadequate equilibria and the difficulties inherent in changing entrenched systems (plus the way that those in power are the ones who benefit from the system being as it is).
