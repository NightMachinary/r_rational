Also inspired by Black Panther, I thought of a world where there is one organisation of rather smart people living together in communities at various places around the globe.

They want to stay hidden and occasionally vet & seek out potential new members that could contribute to them.

Their goal is to maximize the well-being of humanity. End things like suffering, exploitation etc. They have a moral code they adhere to, but they do break the law as they see fit.

Maybe a bit like a intelligence agency with their own goals in that way.

I suppose we need to add some villain or villain organisation which sees them as a great threat.

A story could begin from the perspective of an outsider that is being vetted and processed to join them...
