Just something I've been thinking of after seeing Black Panther.

Is there any way to build a rational Wakanda that keeps the outline of the movie world intact? Isolationist, highly advanced and so on?

Cause I can't see it. If, as the movie says, they've always been more advanced it seems like the most "rational" Wakanda pushes out from its home with the vibranium weapons and trying to pacify the tribes around it till it gets to the sea (or Egypt, depending on where it's located and...we just don't know). The mere possession of vibranium and time doesn't necessarily give Wakanda a hundred year head start on people. Especially given their steadfast refusal to sell it.

Or is there some use case for vibranium that I'm missing that makes what we see in the film possible?
