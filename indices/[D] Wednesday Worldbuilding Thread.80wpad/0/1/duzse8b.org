Re: adjudicators, you might be interested in /Legal Systems Very Different From Ours/, specifically this passage from the Slate Star Codex [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/][review]] of it:

#+begin_quote
  The Somali system seems to be somewhere around here: if two people have a dispute, they find a mutually agreeable judge to arbitrate; the judge will decide who's in the wrong and what fine they need to pay to make it right. If someone refuses to go to the judge, or refuses to abide by the judge's decision, then it's family-member-killing time. Needless to say, Somali judges' services remain popular. And since judges gain status by arbitrating, and since only judges who make widely-regarded-as-good decisions get invited to keep doing so, there's economic pressure for the judges to make good decisions (which then go down as precedent and inspire future cases).

TL;DR: 'Judge' is just another job on the open market. People can choose to arbitrate their disputes using a mutually acceptable judge, or they can refuse and make a blood-feud.
