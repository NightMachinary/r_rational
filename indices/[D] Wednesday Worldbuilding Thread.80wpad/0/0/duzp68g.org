Interesting, if only because it disincentivizes anyone from holding a particularly large stake in a corporation that is large enough to be sued. Another thing that could be exploited is insider trading. Suppose some people have information that a case against the company is coming up, then they have the opportunity to liquidate prior to the case being filed and maybe force some poor schmuck to fight to the death. I think there are some serious economic ramifications here.
