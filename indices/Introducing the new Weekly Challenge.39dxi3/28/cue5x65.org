Thinking about next week's challenge (Dueling Time Travelers).

There's a lot of different models of time travel, and it's easy to come up with more. (I'm contemplating writing an entry around a Groundhog Day time loop.) But I'm worried that there won't be a convenient way to explain the rules of the model, /or/ to explore their full implications, within the span of the one to two thousand word short stories that we usually have.

Is there a time travel mechanic that remains simple and intuitive, even when two rational enemies are both using it against one another?
