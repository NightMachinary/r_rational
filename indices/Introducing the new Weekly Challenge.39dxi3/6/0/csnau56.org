Blegh.

That's mostly how I feel about it.

The /intent/ of the challenge is to have a fun community thing, with the secondary effect of stimulating people to create rational fiction. This works well in a number of other subs, who have rules that are substantially similar to what we use, and those subs have substantially larger contests with more entries.

The challenge is not meant to be about marketing, or about gaming the system, and what rules there are (those which aren't just clarifications or common sense) exist in order to reduce those advantages.

So ... yes, there are definite advantages that are conferred by posting your story in this subreddit, or by advertising it elsewhere, like on your personal website, your blog, Facebook, or whatever. There is a strong possibility that this will make the contest more about marketing than actual writing skill, which is not at all what I want, because it then pushes out people who know they can't win a war fought with marketing. (There are benefits to marketing, such as growing the subreddit and increasing exposure to rational fiction.)

On the other hand, I totally get the impulse to share what you've written with as wide an audience as possible. I get how it might feel stifling to have this awesome story you've written consigned to contest mode in the weekly challenge thread. If your primary motivation in writing is to get your writing read, why chose to write for a contest that's going to limit that exposure? If we implemented perfectly anonymous posting and strict rules on cross-posting, I would expect participation to drop. I would expect that if /I/ were thinking of writing for that contest, I would be less inclined.

And no, I don't want the front page clogged with people making duplicates of their entry, though we've only got five entries right now, so ... that's not really that much of a concern.

I'm disinclined to making rule changes, just on principle (well, also because there are frictional costs associated with doing so). And we've only got 1.5 challenges as our sample size, with the first being won by someone who opted /not/ to post elsewhere, for whatever reason. I would prefer for there to just be a community understanding, but doubt that's going to happen. So far, there has not been a real problem.
