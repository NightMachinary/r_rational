Re: the change from weekly to biweekly contest, I don't think it will have the effect you desire. Probably nearly everyone who was going to post at all will have posted within a week, but it rather cuts down on the momentum of the contests. This is the fourth time I've checked back on the current contest for new reading material only to realize we're still on the same prompt and it's still the same 3 entries.
