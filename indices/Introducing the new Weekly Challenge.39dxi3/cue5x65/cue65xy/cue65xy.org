One of the things that Sam Hughes did in Fine Structure was to just lay out the rules in three quick bullet points at the beginning. Check [[http://qntm.org/power][this early chapter]] for an example.

There are mechanics that are simple and intuitive, but I don't think that the /results/ of those mechanics tend to be unless you're dealing with a simpler case (such as one with only one or two actual instances of time travel).

You can also begin the story in medias res and leave enough clues for the audience without having to be explicit about the rules, but that can be a little dicey.

Edit: You can also make a post about this in [[/r/rational]]!
