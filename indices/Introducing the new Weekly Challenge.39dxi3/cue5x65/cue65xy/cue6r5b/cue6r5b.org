I might do that last one, this thread isn't the best place to get advice.

It sometimes seems like you're the only other person posting in this thread. Most likely because you get an orangered every time somebody replies to it - nobody else has any reason to notice a 2-month-old thread, and Reddit's algorithms make sure they don't stumble across it by accident.
