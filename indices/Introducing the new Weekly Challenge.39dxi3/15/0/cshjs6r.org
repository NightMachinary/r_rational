Maybe? I'll think on it. So far it's just going to be curated (by me), but I would be open to doing a straw poll. I'll put that in my "weekly challenge" notes. I'll be a little more open to variation after we've got the challenge running smoothly for a few weeks.

(Right now I'm kind of anxious to see what effect injecting money into the contest will have - hopefully good.)
