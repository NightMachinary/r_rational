So what's the deal with people posting their contest entries to the [[/r/rational]] main page? It seems like it confers a huge advantage over people who don't so it kind of forces people who want to win to post as well. Plus people who are good at redditing (e.g. they know what times of day to post and other techniques like that) get additional advantage. Should it just be a given that you post both to the thread and to the main? Doesn't this have some of the downsides that the random contest mode is meant to avoid? Also it raises questions like how much are we allowed to market our stories? Is it ok to post it in other subreddits? Other websites? It just feels kind of inelegant but maybe I'm just being neurotic. There definitely are some benefits: it encourages more discussion, provides more content for [[/r/rational]], and increases overall visibility to those who don't want to dig through the contest thread. On the other hand those benefits would still mostly be there if the stories were posted after the competition

There might also be an issue with clutter on the main page, but I think that's either minor or even a positive.
