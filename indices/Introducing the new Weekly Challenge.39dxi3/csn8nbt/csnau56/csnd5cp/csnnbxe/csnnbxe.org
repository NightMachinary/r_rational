I will probably add it to the rules, more as a strong suggestion than something anyone is going to get policed for. It's a balance of incentives thing; I don't want people to be unable to share a cool thing they made with a wider audience, but I also don't want people to think that there's something unfair going on, or that there's a need to compete on some level other than writing.

(Posting to [[/r/rational]] after the contest is over is probably my preference? I do really like "A Man and His Dog", and obviously it's the sort of thing that [[/r/rational]] enjoys, and I think it's good to post to the main subreddit, because people might otherwise miss it.)
