Submissions won't be policed; I'm not going to remove anything for a violation of the rules (except maybe single-line, low-effort responses that clog up contest mode, or meta questions that shouldn't be top-level responses).

The primary thing that you need to worry about is how you think other people will vote. If you want to write a story about, say, a team of scientists trying to pull Hitler through from an alternate world where the Axis won, you're perfectly free to submit that. The story doesn't even have to feature someone going through to another world. It's just a question of whether people will think it's fair play. Generally speaking, I think a solid story/idea can make up for straying from the theme. I sort of expect (and hope) that people will take things in their own direction.
