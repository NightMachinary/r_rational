So, a small question about next week's prompt.

Usually "Portal Fantasy" in typical media contains a transportation of the character(s) to another world, and then the characters "handling" the rules of that world. Is this the idea behind this prompt?

Because I have a couple of other ideas/details that I think would be interesting to analyze from a purely rational perspective of the process of how that(the transportation) would happen but which don't fit with the idea of evaluating what comes afterwards. Would this be ok, or would I do better in saving it for a latter competition?
