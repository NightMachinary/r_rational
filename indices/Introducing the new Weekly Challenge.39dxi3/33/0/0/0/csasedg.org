  It'd be awkward if someone had a higher liked ratio but lost because more people has read/voted on the other one.

Other way around. Winner is determined by "best" ranking (the default for reddit), which is partially determined by ratio. "Top" ranking is just raw upvotes minus downvotes.

So in the case that "top" and "best" show a different post at the top (they currently don't), the winner will be the one with the higher liked ratio (after confidence is taken into account).

Edit: Because I'm afraid this isn't clear, let's say there are three posts:

- Post A has 1,000 upvotes, 900 downvotes, for 100 total.
- Post B has 100 upvotes, 1 downvote, for 99 total.
- Post C has 1 upvote, 0 downvotes, for 1 total.

*Top ranking:* A, B, C

*Best (confidence) ranking:* B, C, A

*Average (upvotes/downvotes) ranking:* C, B, A

Reddit doesn't have strict average ranking implemented, because as you can see, it sort of sucks.
