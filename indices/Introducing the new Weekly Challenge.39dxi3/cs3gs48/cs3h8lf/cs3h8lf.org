I just asked. There's not a formal process in place, and there aren't really that many mod duties on a sub of this size (no real harassment, no real need for an iron fist, not that many things getting caught in the spam filter). The only thing that I really anticipate doing with mod powers is running this contest. If I had to list qualities that I think a mod should have ... don't get in heated arguments with people, try your best to be helpful and nice, show some initiative from time to time?
