Second rule already got added this week:

#+begin_quote

  - In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3/introducing_the_new_weekly_challenge/csn8nbt][Following the discussion here.]] It's my hope that the community will self-enforce this, because otherwise I have to get reports about people doing it, and decide what to do with them, and police everything myself, which I really don't want to do given how subjective that might end up being, and how easy it is to skirt that rule anyway.

First rule ... it's been talked about. I don't want to make people write blurbs, because that greatly increases the barrier for entry; as you've said, many people are terrible at it, and some of them will just opt not to write anything rather than putting in the effort of learning to write a blurb.

And next week we're switching over to links only for longer works anyway - it's already strongly encouraged. (Looking at the results by voting for long/short analysis, it doesn't appear that shorter works /do/ have an advantage, though that might be because there's less effort involved.)
