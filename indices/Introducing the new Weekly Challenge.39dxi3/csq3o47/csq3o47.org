I've got two suggestions for new rules:

1. Each entry should consist of a no-more-than three paragraph blurb and a link.
2. Entries should not be linked to from elsewhere until the contest ends, after which go nuts.

The second rule is there to make the contest about writing instead of advertising.

The first rule is there because it teaches people to write good blurbs, which is an essential skill for anything beyond casual writing. It will also reduce the 'wall of text' look for the page and mean that people will scroll farther and see more entries. Finally, it will even out the advantage that short pieces have -- if it fits in the text box more people will read it than if they have to click.
