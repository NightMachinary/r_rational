  My mental model anticipates that any monetary rewards can used more effectively by one large competition with a longer timespan, multiple substantial rewards, and lots of hype. Either that, or advertising.

I think I generally agree. Next week's challenge ("Ever After") will then be the last challenge to offer a cash reward, but that brings the question of what to do with the money.

- If we do a "big" challenge with it, we'll have to figure out some rules, and I don't know the best way to structure it. Longer word count minimum, for one thing. Probably not decided by upvotes or downvotes, which are easy to game, and which might not produce good results if lots of people are coming in from outside. Panel of judges willing to read lots of entries?
- If we do advertising, we'll have to figure out the best way to do that. I'll talk to my wife about it; she works for an SEO company. If you want to advertise within reddit specifically, we could put up ads for a contest targeted against most of the larger writing subreddits ([[/r/writing]], [[/r/WritingPrompts]], etc.). Or I can talk to some of the mods there. (We also need to get a submission for [[/r/subredditads]]. And probably talk to what I see as a spiritual sister-sub in [[/r/AskScienceFiction]].)

I'll do some more thinking on it over the weekend, and talk to my wife (and some of her coworkers) about advertising, click-through-rates, and all that sort of stuff. In the meantime, let me know your thoughts.
