Taking a look at the number of submissions for "Ever After", I think it's probably a good idea to hold on to the cash for future contests and figure out a better way to organize it. After a couple weeks of no-cash-reward prompts, having something that's advertised to reddit as a whole (probably with a longer writing period) to get people writing rational fiction is a good idea. We should try to like, maybe make a document with a summary of what we think rational(ist) fiction is and a link to a couple short examples. This way, someone completely unfamiliar with [[/r/rational][r/rational]] but who likes to write can jump right in if they see an ad for the competition
