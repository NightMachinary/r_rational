Hmm, another thought on the cash thing: The reason I submitted an entry (besides it just being fun) was the prestige just of being a winner or getting the sweet custom flair. Cash might be better used to draw people in from other subreddits.

Also, what are people doing for their voting? I've been doing three-tiered voting (upvote, downvote, no vote) with about a third in each category, but would it be better to do like a two-tiered thing (upvote, no vote) to encourage people to compete more cause their scores will be higher?
