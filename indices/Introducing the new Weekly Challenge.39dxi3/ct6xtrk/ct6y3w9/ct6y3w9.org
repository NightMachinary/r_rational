We're cash-free starting this week (there's no cash prize for "Chosen One"). So we'll see whether this has much impact or not.

I personally use the two-tiered system (upvotes and no-votes), because upvotes are encouraging to people. Downvotes are for low-effort posts, people who violate the rules, or people who aren't even trying to be rational. I also go pretty heavy on the upvotes, because of the power of positive reinforcement.
