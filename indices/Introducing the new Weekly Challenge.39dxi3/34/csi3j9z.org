The multiple comments for long stories goes against your own strategy for winning competitions/contests and I wonder if it is the best way to run things.

As you say people are far less likely to read over multiple comments but surely there has to be some way like linking to a pastebin or something that can be held standard for everyone that doesn't punish longer stories even more than them just being long.
