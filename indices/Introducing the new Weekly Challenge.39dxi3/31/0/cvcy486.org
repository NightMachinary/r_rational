Install [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]], which will give you a javascript link to hide all child comments, along with a bunch of other functionality. Other than that ... if you read the submissions when they're in contest mode (when the contest is running) all child comments should automatically be hidden.
