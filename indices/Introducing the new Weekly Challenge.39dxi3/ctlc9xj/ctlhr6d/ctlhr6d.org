As a mod, I can see (fuzzed) upvote totals while the thread is in contest mode, as well as sort results however I want. The only way to make a graph would be to set up a bot with mod privileges that checked the thread periodically, and even then there would be some fuzzing involved (that's if you want to see how voting evolves over the week). If you instead want to see entries per week, you'd have to go manually (or programmatically) counting them. Same for "total upvotes per week" or something. That sounds like a pain to me, and not terribly rewarding.
