Well first I was thinking of hot rather than best, but second your example doesn't seem to justify using best over top, I would also be more worried about people not voting on posts and more likely to vote on incensive ones regardless of in what way, but I suppose that's a function of story telling. I feel like you would want to post earlier with top for the purpose of getting more exposure and views which was my original point when I thought best=hot. So they are the same expect whether you value raw votes or want to weight in favour of popularity/activity. Personally I doubt the random person is different enough that a) 5 votes isn't enough to represent populace or b) that 5 isn't but 10 is. Though I know statistically you only need like 30 before it becomes nigh on perfect for any size population and I imagine that's what the reddit link is but I can't read that at the moment.

I hope that the winner holds the top in both categories. It'd be awkward if someone had a higher liked ratio but lost because more people has read /voted on the other one.
