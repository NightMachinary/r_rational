There is no explicit time component to best sorting. To the extent that there is a benefit to submitting first, that benefit also exists in top sorting.

I'll change the rule to be a suggestion to think before you downvote rather than a blanket "don't do this". That was partly a holdover from the old contest rules that these were copied from. I do think that there are legitimate reasons to downvote a submission; there will inevitably be people who completely disregard the prompt, for example.
