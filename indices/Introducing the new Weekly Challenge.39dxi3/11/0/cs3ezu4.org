I might change the format slightly after this week; I do think it would be cool to see a short film, though I think that's somewhat unlikely to happen with only a week's time. Comics would be more feasible. Mostly the "prose" descriptor is there because I don't want people to just lay out their /idea/ without actually turning it into a prose story.

I'll add a rule to limit it to a single entry per account, though there's nothing I could really do if someone wanted to submit from multiple accounts. I'm doubtful that making multiple submissions would greatly increase the chances of winning, as compared to simply putting more work into a single submission.
