There's a prompt for next week, which is "Portal Fantasy". Prompts will always be given a week in advance. So when the submissions thread for "Portal Fantasy" comes there will be a section at the bottom of the post that tells you what the prompt is for the week after.

- This week (6/10): prompt given for Portal Fantasy
- Next week (6/17): submissions thread for Portal Fantasy, also Prompt X given
- Week after that (6/24): winner declared for Portal Fantasy, submissions thread for Prompt X, also Prompt Y given
- Week after that (7/1): winner declared for Prompt X, submissions thread for Prompt Y, also Prompt Z given

It's done like that mostly to give you time to get writing /now/, and to cut away some of the benefits of just being the first one to see the thread and push something out fast (so hopefully you spend /tonight/ writing up your Portal Fantasy and have it ready for next week, giving better content than something just dashed off in the spur of the moment). Of course, you're free to dash something off in the spur of the moment a week from now if you really want.

Edit: That also allows for this to be a meta thread, in case there are any glaring errors in the setup, questions, comments, clarifications, or things of that nature.
