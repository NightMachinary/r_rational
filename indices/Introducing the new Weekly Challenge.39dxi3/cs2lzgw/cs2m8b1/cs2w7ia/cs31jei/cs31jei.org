Timing is always going to be a (minor) problem. There are a couple solutions that negate it entirely; for example, it would be possible to set up a bot that you can submit to at any time during the week that's set to disgorge all of the submissions into the submission thread the moment it goes live. Alternately, I could try to write some open-source script so that people can make their own bots that poll for "[Weekly Challenge]" in the title.

For now, I think contest mode negates the majority of the benefits of posting first, and having the threads go up at a set, predictable time means that no one has to be refreshing the page throughout the day, and (ideally) means that submission can be something that you do during a five minute break from work, or from your phone. If you /really/ want that minor edge and the thread goes up when you're sleeping, you can set an alarm on your phone, wake up for the handful of minutes it takes to post what you've written, then go back to bed. That's not a perfect solution, but the alternative seems to be that the thread would go up while you're sleeping and you wouldn't know about it until you woke up.

I'll watch this first challenge closely though, and try to get some sense of how much impact timing /actually/ has; after the fact it will be possible to grab all the timestamps and scores and see what the correlation is.

(We'll also have to see how many submissions we get; if it's three, then trying to totally level the playing field is probably not worth it.)
