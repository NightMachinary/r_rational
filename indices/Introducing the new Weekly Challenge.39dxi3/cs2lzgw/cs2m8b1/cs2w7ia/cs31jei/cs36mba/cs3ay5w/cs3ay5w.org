The big argument in favor of having users submit their own content directly to the thread is that this works well within reddit. It gives users a chance to edit their own story after the fact, and it allows use of the comment/reply system so you can talk with whoever wrote it and give them feeback directly to their inbox.

We'll see how it goes the first time around though.
