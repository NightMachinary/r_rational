I am concerned that the cash rewards are not really helping to the extent I hoped for. Only 2.something data points, but the trend is worrying. At least, there doesn't seem to be any strong effect on quality or quantity of submissions due to the reward. For certain, the first contest's hype was enough to overcome any effect it might have.

I actually predicted this in the other thread where we were discussing competitions and cash rewards -- in hindsight I probably shouldn't have deleted that post (I just did not want to be the naysayer...)

My mental model anticipates a long stream of short contests with small rewards won't entice many new people to join in. The flair + bragging rights is sufficient to push most people who would participate to do so; there aren't many people who would not participate for that, but who would if you added a chance of a small monetary reward. Also, anyone entering is already going to put forth their best effort in the time they feel like allotting. Again, an additional chance at a small monetary reward isn't going to have much effect on their level of effort or the time spent.

In my previous post, I mentioned how I did not believe that many smaller competitions would have much effect on participation or on bringing in new people to the sub. It certainly should (and does!) result in the creation of interesting stories, and in motivating more existing members to write. That is a great thing, and I am very much in favor.

I do believe, however, that regarding resource expenditure, our interests are best served in increasing exposure to rational fiction and in getting /more/ people interested. If the goal is more and better quality works, this is limited by the 1% rule. You can only entice existing members to contribute so much, but there is a long, long ways to go before you hit diminishing returns on resources put towards growing the member base.

My mental model anticipates that any monetary rewards can used more effectively by one large competition with a longer timespan, multiple substantial rewards, and lots of hype. Either that, or advertising.

As I stated before, ultimately I trust your discretion. I think this is something to consider at least.
