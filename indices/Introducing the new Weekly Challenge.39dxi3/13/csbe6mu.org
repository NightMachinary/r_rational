Reddit is such an incredibly HORRIBLE and tiny writing interface.

My entire story fits in a single top-post, but it's horribly mangled and broken into tiny bits when I try to put it in the contest post.

Sorry, if it upsets people, but I'm going to just link to where people can read the story properly without me needing to butcher it to make it fit as a comment.
