It's somewhat up to you. Reddit comments have a character limit of 10000, which comes out to be around 2,000 words (give or take, depending on vocabulary). If that's not enough, feel free to continue in a child comment (the best way to do that is usually to do something like *(1/2)* at the bottom), or to just link to Google Docs, a Wordpress site, or something like that.

I will say that I think keeping it within reddit is /most likely/ to get you votes, and failing that, most people follow Google Docs links. There's no preferred standard, though one might develop later.
