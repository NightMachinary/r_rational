[[/u/alexanderwales]]; It is a pain to scroll past every entry every time a new comment is posted to see if that comment was a new entry.

Suggestions:

- Have entrants make one top level comment (perhaps with a title, word count, optional short description), and submit their entry as a reply to that comment. All voting should be done on the top level comment. This makes it many times easier to sort through posts and see if anything new has been posted, while not affecting much else. It would also allow longer entries, as the author could post multiple numbered replies under the same top level comment.

- Create a second thread for discussion of entries. No comments should be posted in the contest thread unless they are entries (this isn't as necessary if you go the first route, but still useful).
