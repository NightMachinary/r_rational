I would /suggest/ that you install [[http://redditenhancementsuite.com/][Reddit Enhancement Suite]], which (among other things) has a feature called "Comment Hide Persistor" which will make it so that every comment you minimize (using the minus symbol next to the voting buttons) will stay minimized the next time you visit the thread. It took me some time to realize that this wasn't default reddit behavior. By collapsing every top-level comment that you've read, the only expanded ones should be ones that you haven't seen before.

Let me know if that works as a solution for you. (I understand it doesn't do much if you can't install RES, if you're using AlienBlue or RedditIsFun.) It's possible that I'll just decide to switch over to top-level comments being a link to Google Docs or off-site, which is what [[/r/fantasywriters]] does, but that would be the week after next, as the rules have already been posted for next week.

(If anyone else is having issues with this, let me know so I can see how much of a problem this is.)
