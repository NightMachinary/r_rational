We only get to follow one perspective. I don't think you could advance the story like you have, keeping a strong pace, if you tried to cram more worldbuilding detail in. Certainly not with the same word count.

Someone like Brandon Sanderson has multiple perspectives and a ton more words to explore his worlds. Word for word, your story's plot moves quicker. I think every author has to find where they are happy.

For a web serial example, Delphic spends a lot more time world and character building than you do, and thus the plot advances much more slowly.
