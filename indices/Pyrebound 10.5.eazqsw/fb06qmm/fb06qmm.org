Just finished reading the story so far. I quite like it. The worldbuilding is interesting, and seems pretty deep, albeit it doesn't feel quite as deep as it seems to be. I like the ubiquitousness of broken systems. Not just the system of the society, but the magic system itself is stuck propagating a cycle of injustice. Defeating evil empires is easy compared to building good ones, and all that.
