I'm afraid you've stumped me on that one. Ram gets indwelt at the end of Chapter 5. He picks up his family at the end of Chapter 6, has them in Dul Misishi (the mining pyre where Darun grew up) by the start of Chapter 7, and leaves them there before the start of Chapter 8 (when they hijack the tax assessment). They've been there ever since. There's no point after 8.1 where he's going anywhere with his family. He's returning to Dul Karagi via skybarque at the start of 9.1--is that what you're thinking of? Or you might mean 9.5, when he's just survived the ambush by the moonchildren and is going back to Dul Karagi to confront Jushur about it. Those are the only recent updates I can think of where Ram is returning anywhere he's been before. Sorry I can't be more help.
