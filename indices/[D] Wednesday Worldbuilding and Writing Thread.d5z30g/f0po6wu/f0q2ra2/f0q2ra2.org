Wikipedia has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_evacuations][list of mass evacuations]] that you might want to look at for inspiration. Ideally, you want an evacuation that happens suddenly, so there's little time to take everything with. Your options for war are a bit limited, because you also don't want the other side to be occupying, presumably. That said, a major biological or chemical attack would probably do it, since it would make the area unsafe for both sides. Alternately, maybe it's not an attack, but the /threat/ of attack, or, as has historically happened sometimes, an area becoming abandoned because of a peace treaty or other agreement.
