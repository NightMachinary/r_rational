This is basically what happened to the Dwemer in the Elder Scrolls universe. They performed an experiment with the heart of a god, and the moment they touched it with their tools every member of their species on the plane of existence vanished. They left behind everything, were definitely malevolent towards other races, and their ruins are full of inscrutable, still-operating contraptions which do things thought impossible by the surface world.

The only clue about where they went is a speculation that they were "subsumed into the skin of the Numidium." The Numidium is a sort of artificial deity in the form of a giant robot, and its activation causes the same temporal phenomenon as what happens when a player character is active in their world. It's called a Dragon Break, and it's said all possibilities are both true and false during one, though the timeline does solidify after.
