Mines of Moria. They dug too deep/went too far and unearthed some type of great calamity and had to leave in a hurry. Then they do the same thing to their new world and end up hopping back (maybe they have spies in our world to let them know everything's died down, or maybe the player characters accidentally signal to them so they know people are alive).

For the war with an alternate universe: maybe they jumped ship to feint that they had blow themselves up, then continued to fight the war behind the shadows. Once the war is won they come home.

Another idea would be that they went too far trying to research pocket dimension tech or something similar and ended up accidentally trapping their whole civilization in stasis in some cube. The PCs find the cube and meddle with it until a whole ancient civilization pops out
