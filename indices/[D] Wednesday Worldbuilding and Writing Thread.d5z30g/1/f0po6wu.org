I'm trying to build a world for a D&D campaign and I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

Is there any particular reason an evil hyper-advanced precursor civilisation might

- Suddenly abandon their home universe?

- Leave a whole bunch of their stuff behind?

- Possibly (but not necessarily) involving a war they were having with another universe?

- Ideally allowing them to suddenly return in a dramatic and climactic fashion?
