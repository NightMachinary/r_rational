All in all I had fun thinking about your creations, thanks for sharing them!

*Drop Bear*- An ambush hunter that I could see in a jungle, other than that a pretty standard mishmash of normal animals.

*Six second snail*- This would be hell if they were a pack hunting hive mind, or if not a hive mind than a collective like ants or wasps but if they were they might end up having to move a lot due to over eating an area.

*Land octopus*- With a internal skeleton it would mess with their shapeshifting? Terror bird sized beak may get in the way of moving? While a terror bird shaped beak should probably be alright. Seeing that they have low stamina I see them being a lot like Drop Bears and hanging in trees or being like a Trapdoor Spider.

If that's the case I can see how a large beak and a better ability to grapple would be useful. Possibly using the over large beak to dig?

*Trolls*- I read this and I think giant plant bears lol. Wicked claws and something that switches around between four and two legs.

*Slimes*- A horribly slow and painful way to die. I see magic and medicine dedicated towards eliminating slimes from the body. Also this being used in warfare as a bioweapon if cures are costly and or impractical to implement on a large scale.

I read "spores" and I think plant and fungus. So eh, I got nothing much other than that. Oh how would they develop underground without sunlight or possibly whatever they react with in the air? Or underwater? If they react in some way to water than fill the stomach with water and throw up, if with any air than purposefully swallow air and then burp.

*Fortran*- A scavengers that eats rotting animals or is a herbivore. Could possibly inhabit any environments where a turtle/tortoise can be found: tropics, deserts and the sea. Basically an extreme testudine like you said lol. I have no idea how a poisonous shell would work. Poison spikes? Then how does the spike get the poison? A poison coating? How is the shell coated, and is it all the time or only when in danger?

*Razor weaver*- [[https://youtube.com/watch?v=Nq8fgEZIH-g][Piano wire]] seems legit. Would they cut themselves though?

*Razorback*- I imagine a porcupine combined with a dog? Though with possibly shorter thicker quills? Unless you mean it literally has thin edges sticking out from its skin all over, in which case I'd love to hear how they keep the numerous blades/edges sharp.

*Corpse creeper*- A plant that plays at being an animal by taking the bones of animals. Matter that makes up thorns covering the teeth to keep them in place, parts of the skin hardens into bark plates, the nose and parts of the ear staying much the same as the original vine to be able to smell and hear.

Though I gotta ask if it grows organs in the rib cage and such or if its just a big Venus trap acid bath inside?

*Corpse creeper^{2}*- I mean... bones are typically harder than wood or anything other than what could possibly be found. Plus there's the added bonus of the inherit symmetry found in skeletons while this plant will have to start from scratch if it wants equally long limbs. Unless its a shambling mass of vines, branches and twigs.

*Land whale*- Do they group up in pods and make moving island chains lol? Also breeding. Breeding HAS to be underwater (how else would it?) so everytime they get frisky it's a salt water bath for anything hitching a ride.

*Hydra*- Eight headed snake. How big? And its eight heads possibly sending a bunch of commands to one body. Then there's eight heads smelling/tasting eight times with its tongues. Plus it'd have a harder time going into burrows with eight heads, assuming of course that it is normal sized.

  The hydra subspecies injects venom through its fangs that will liquify the target

That's an acid.

Blood sucking sounds like a good way to get disease (think mosquito or flea) while on the side it involves filtering all that water from the blood to get at the stuff you actually want. A fast metabolism is not a snake thing. The use of some heads for walking is lol

*Chamelee*- Seen these. Or at least something similar in a story a while back, they were interesting. Yours have the added kick of being based off of chameleons with the added kickes of stretchy poison tongue, belly pouch and tetra eyed.

Again very fun to think about for me!üòÅ
