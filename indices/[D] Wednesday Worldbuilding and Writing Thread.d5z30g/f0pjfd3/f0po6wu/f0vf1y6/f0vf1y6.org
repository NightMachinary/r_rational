Here's a few fun fantasy creatures I've been thinking about, comments welcome. Some of them aren't original, and some aren't fleshed out yet, but I've had fun thinking of all of them. This is very much a rough draft and there are bound to be mistakes.

*Drop Bear*

A catlike quadruped about the size of a dog. Its body resembles a panther, and it has a long tail and non-retractable claws. It has a face more like a koala, and has a powerful oversized jaw. It typically makes use of its fantastic climbing abilities to scale trees. It then drops down on its prey, killing it instantly with a bite to the neck or throat. It's like a mix of a hyena, cat, dog, and bear.

*Slayer snail/speedy snail/gonzales' snail/six second snail/swift snail etc*

A giant gastropod that camouflages itself. Capable of extreme speed in quick bursts, but lacks stamina. Has a lamprey-like mouth, filled with teeth on all angles. There are snail types and slug types. Snail types camouflage as rocks, plants or bushes (stone-shell, bushy shell etc) and have dozens of centipede legs. Slug types camouflage in bushes, as roots or logs, as dirt, or underground. Slug types have no shell, are much longer, and locomote as a snake does. Both make a hissing/screeching sound as they pursue their prey.

*Land octopus*

Effectively an octopus adapted for the land. They have an actual internal skeleton. The skeleton inside their arms is effectively similar to a spine or a tail, with the addition of extra rods of bone that can lock the vertebrae together in order form a straight arm, useful for added strength and leverage. They are about the size of a dog. They breathe air and have iron based blood, but have poor stamina. They still have the shapeshifting and colour changing abilities of a normal octopus. Their skin is voluminous and loosely attached, and possesses and integrated layer of muscle to aid in its configuration. They have an overdeveloped beak compared to normal octopuses, more akin to that of a terror bird than anything else. The beak can shoot out very quickly like the jaw of a goblin shark or a dragonfly nymph. The jaw muscles are very strong, and some species are venomous. They have primitive feet, with both suction cups and settae. They can extrude prehensile hair through their skin, and change the colour of it. This hair is only mobile enough to serve as configurable camouflage, and is not a weapon. Some species have claws and toes, and some species have mandibles.

*Trolls*

In fiction, trolls regenerate and are weak to fire. The same is true here. They regenerate quickly due to their plant-based nature (and a bit of magic) and are weak to fire due to same. The skin of mature trolls hardens into wood-like flesh. Many species grow leaves and twigs. They can range from the size of a man to the size of 3 men. They have 4 limbs, wicked claws, and are comfortable on 4 legs or 2 in equal measure.

*Slimes*

Slimes are a parasitic organism that infests the stomach of their victim. They generally start off very tiny, attached to edible material. They are then ingested, and cling to the stomach walls. Immune to practically any stomach acid, they are free to steal sustenance from the creature they're inhabiting. Eventually, they grow so large that they completely stop their host from gaining anything from food at all. The host then starves to death, and the slime eats its way through them from the inside out. Upon exposure to air/sunlight, a reaction builds up in the slime and they explode into many gobbets of a slime and spores. Thus the life cycle begins anew. Some species might do a xenomorph.

*Onehol/cloacan/fortran* (I thought about calling it an onahole but that's too far)

This is an animal that takes the concept of a cloaca being an “everything hole” and the defensiveness of a turtle up to the highest degree. Their body is almost entirely encased in their shell, with only one opening. To sense the world around them, they have eyes on stalks and antennae that they stick out of the hole. To move, they have six insectoid legs that can be deployed and fully hidden. They have a single hole, through which they eat, breathe, drink, mate, urinate and defecate. Internally there is more separation between these functions, and it often extends these tubes slightly out of the hole. At the end of each leg they have four toes in a cross formation, with sharp claws on the ends and strong muscles. They are quite slow. They also have a powerful regenerative ability, and can stockpile enough energy and are so efficient that they can remain holed up in their shell for a preposterous amount of time - more than long enough for any predator to get bored. If they are injured, they can fully regenerate any body part in a matter of days - so long as they're still alive. Some species have spiky or poisonous shells. Some species have a hatch that they can slide into place to seal their hole, while others have hard holeparts that form an aperture. It is an extremely hardy creature.

*Razor weaver*

These social spiders are pack hunters. Rather intelligent, but not sentient. They are about the size of a housecat. In addition to standard webbing, they also possess the ability to weave what is basically piano wire. Razor sharp, this thread can cut through all manner of things. They typical hunting strategy consists of setting up a web, then running the prey into it. Razor thread is practically invisible, and by the time the victim sees it it is usually too late and they promptly get sliced to pieces by their own momentum. They have lungs, iron based blood, and a skeleton.

*Razorback*

An omnivorous quadruped, this animal is a persistence hunter. Razor sharp blade line its body all over. An anticoagulant oozes out near the base of the blades and covers them. It typically rushes its prey and then waits for it to bleed out. A cross between a canine and a pig, varies from dog size to larger. Sometimes forms groups. Lacking in strength compared to some, but possesses great stamina.

*Corpse creeper*

A mobile, predatory vine. It has eyes, but smells and hears through its skin. It anchors onto dead animals and uses their skeleton as its own. By having a frame to work with, its body effectively acts as muscles, and it becomes much more capable of movement and action.

*Copse creeper*

Like a corpse creeper, but smarter. Instead of using actual animal skeletons, they make their own skeleton out of sticks and branches they gather themselves.

*Land whale*

Rather than being a whale on land, this whale IS land. These massive creatures are plant-animal hybrids. Using the plant-like growths on their back, they soak up the rays of the sun. They can range greatly in size, even growing to the size of large islands. And indeed, they often might as well be, with entire ecosystems regularly springing up on their backs. They are often on the move, and also eat anything they can get their mouth on. Curiously, they rarely submerge.

*Hydra / Dehydra*

A serpentine lizard that consists of 8 heads on long necks, meeting at a central body that houses other organs and orifices. It has no legs, or tail or anything, because why would it need it? It's already got 8 heads. The hydra subspecies injects venom through its fangs that will liquify the target, while the dehydra injects anticoagulant and at the same time uses its hollow fangs to suck out blood and other fluid - it does this supernaturally fast, to the point that the target can often die of dehydration in under a minute. They have a tough muzzle, often covered in armoured plating, that they use as stand ins for feet.

*Chamelee*

Sentient lizardmen. They have 4 eyes, 4 limbs, and walk mostly upright. They have a somewhat prehensile tail that naturally curls up in a spiral. They have hands/feet like that of normal chameleons, but with greater separation between each finger. They have the same vocal capabilities as normal chameleons, which means their language is communicated via colour changing. The pattern of the colours, the location of them, and the sequence thereof all have an effect on the meaning, making chamelee language quite complex. They are omnivorous, and have somewhat humanlike teeth, only generally more sharp. They have a slight hunched over posture. They have two large, highly mobile eyes on the sides of their heads, and two smaller eyes at the front that are better for detail and focus. They have short, somewhat blunt claws that are non-retractable. They are slightly physically weaker and less dexterous than humans. Because they are sentient, they can use their colour changing abilities deliberately as camouflage. Chamelee performance art often consists of various uses of their colour changing ability. They have a barbed tongue that has paralyzing nematocysts on it, and they can extend it with great range and speed. They have a pouch on their belly. They have extremely good vision, and especially potent ability to see and distinguish colour and other wavelengths of light. They have only average hearing.
