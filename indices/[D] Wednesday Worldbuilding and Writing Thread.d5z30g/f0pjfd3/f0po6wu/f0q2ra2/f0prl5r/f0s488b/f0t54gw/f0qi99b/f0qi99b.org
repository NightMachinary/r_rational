Some thoughts, since I'm not sure if this is D&D fantasy or D&D fantasy in space:

A very specific kind of Magically Self-Replicating Targeted Curse meant to infect and kill off the civilization's race that would just so happen to meet your criteria.

Once unleashed, it would wreak havoc rapidly through say, 40% of their army/population and upon realization, they used their experimental universe-hopping to get the fuck out. Some percentage managed to get out and isolate themselves.

The experimental universe-hopping would have restrictions on how much they could bring and how quickly they could do so, and the curse is spreading.

The main civilization was at war with a slightly weaker civilization. The main civilization focused on say, technological advances, while the weaker civilization focused on biological advances. The civilization gradually choked out the weaker civilization through some means, then won a crucial victory that essentially sealed the other's fate.

Since this would have been a war to the death, the weaker civilization went MADD and the remnant forces sacrificed themselves in the final battle. The news of their victory and successful genocide spread throughout the civilization when after a week or so, the Curse hit. The armies/messengers were unaware that the remnant forces were a means to deliver the Curse, a spell so extreme since its cost they were only willing to take once all was lost. (The cost should be the guaranteed end of their race. The curse also affects their race)

Since they didn't expect the Curse, they allowed it to spread to a good percentage during the victory parades or whatnot.

You could work out the Curse's exact mechanics based on your setting.

It magically spreads, but its self-replication slowly degrades over time. After some time, it has devolved to the point where they can easily deal with its effects.
