Simple- they were never a /precursor/ civilization to begin with. They were from the far future, and intentionally went back in time to set up elaborately-constructed ruins with just enough of their future-tech left behind that it can later be used to reverse-engineer the technology in the first place, thus creating a stable time loop.

This also serves to explain how there could be a very advanced precursor civilization that hasn't had a significant impact on modern life- they intentionally didn't leave behind anything that would seriously alter the course of history.

Plus, it makes for a cool reveal, and it definitely leaves the possibility of them returning suddenly on the table.
