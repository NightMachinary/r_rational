I mean, I think that place is where claimants went to try for the name, if there's any elements of ritual to namings that don't have a prior claimant alive. That this is the holy place where you could become Warlord, and while the name might still be around, the orc's traditional acquisition source has just been killed.

A more terrifying possibility is that Captain is a corrupted form of Warlord, which means the name is closer to returning than ever before, and only held down by Captain. On the other hand, it means the name won't be back for a while. It looked like she was going to become a Warlord in there, after all.
