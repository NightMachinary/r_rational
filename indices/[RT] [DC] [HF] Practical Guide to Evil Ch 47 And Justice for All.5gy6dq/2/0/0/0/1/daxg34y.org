After chapter 45, the author replied in the comments on the site when someone impled the same about Warlord

"Warlord is an orc Name, now used as a courtesy title by some greenskins the same way “Tyrant” is for Dread Emperors/Empresses. Catherine is not an orc, not particularly well versed in their culture and numerically speaking the majority of her followers are humans."
