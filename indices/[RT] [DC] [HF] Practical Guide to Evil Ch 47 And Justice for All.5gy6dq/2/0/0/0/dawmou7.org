In chapter 15, Catherine brings up that there are no goblins or orcs with Names, and Black says that the Miezans are responsible for the orcs' lack of names since they dismantled orc cultures that give names. He also says that their main name was Warlord. I'm guessing that you're right, but there was nobody to give the name to without being noticed previously.

On a sidenote, in chapter 16, there's the promise between Catherine and Hakram where he names her Warlord and she names him Adjutant. Maybe Catherine will grow into the name of Warlord, especially with the aspect of Take.
