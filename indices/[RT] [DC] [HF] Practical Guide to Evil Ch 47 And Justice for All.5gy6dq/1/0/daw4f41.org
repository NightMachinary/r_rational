Presumably the universe has a similar story to the Arthurian legend of the sword in the stone. In it, only the "true king" can take the sword.

I'm guessing that Catherine made a play at being the heir to the king of Callow and that the sword is on Callowan land. If so, she can pull out the sword and presumably use the angelic magic within the sword / ritual to restore her life. The Angels owe her because she set up the story to take the claim the sword, so denying her the magic inside it would be like the sword rejecting her. (As was mentioned previously, only angelic magic can truly restore life.)
