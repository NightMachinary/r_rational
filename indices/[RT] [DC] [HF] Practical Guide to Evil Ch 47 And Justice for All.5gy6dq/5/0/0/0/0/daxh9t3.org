Quote from the author: "Queen of Blades was a nickname for Elizabeth Alban, and was only ever applied to her. Her actual Name was Queen of Callow.". So technically, yes a Queen of Blades role could be created, but if the woman called that couldn't make the role happen, it seems unlikely. And considering her character, if she were to become a queen Queen of Callow would be a much more appropriate for Catherine than Queen of Blades
