Heiress made a claim:

  “This is my house now,” she said. “And the only rules here are mine.”
#+end_quote

which leads to Catherine claiming it's actually Callowan ground and gets the Lone Swordsman to back her up. This is what Catherine needed.

If Catherine had tried to bring this up without the Heiress's claim, she wouldn't have gotten backing from the Lone Swordsman.
