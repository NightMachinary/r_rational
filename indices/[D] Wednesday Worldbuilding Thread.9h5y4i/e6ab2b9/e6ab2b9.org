I used to watch /True Blood/ (an urban fantasy show) back when it was on, and there's a time where one of the vampire characters remarks: "We've got Louis Pasteur working on this scientific problem we're facing."

Made me realise, with vampires being A Thing, probably one or two historical figures got Turned.

So, are there any historical figures who might have been made into vampires? Ideally, they'd have to have weird behaviour in their later years, or suddenly disappear from the record with no body.

Of course, depending on the number of vampires, it's unlikely that many historical figures got turned; but I thought it would be fun to think about, but I don't know much about any particular historical figures to make suppositions myself.
