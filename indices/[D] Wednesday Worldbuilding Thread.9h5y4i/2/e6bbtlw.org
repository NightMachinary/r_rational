Also: I had the idea for a rational /Babysitters Club/. I didn't really have an actual idea, just the idea that a rational babysitters club should happen. I suppose I could do it. Anyone have ideas? Anyone excited? Was anyone else a tween girl in the '90s before the word tween existed?

EDIT: Thoughts: Stacy would be the rationalist, Kristy would be an economist, Claudia would be a social engineer/PUA, Mary-Anne would be ????.
