Couldn't they just eat the bears? (assuming they're not poisonous or whatever)

The problem with relying on hunting/breeding for food is that the animals you're eating need to eat a lot of food themselves, and oftentimes you'd be better off feeding the food directly to people. Magic bears that appear out of nowhere don't have this problem.
