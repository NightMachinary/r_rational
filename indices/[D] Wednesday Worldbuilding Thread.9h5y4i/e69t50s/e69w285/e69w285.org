It's /possible/ that society breaks down.

The big problem is that either /everything/ needs to be grizzly-proofed, there need to be grizzly kill-squads, or society needs to have near-total control of when and how people die. That's a whole lot of load added to society in the space of a few weeks, which doesn't necessarily cause societal collapse, but which /does/ put pressure on sensitive parts of society that are already load-bearing (pun not intended).

Big cities are probably one of the weakest points. New York City doesn't have enough food supply to feed everyone in it if the logistic disruption is severe enough, and it's /already/ got ~400 deaths per day, though most of those are probably in hospitals. It's not /impossible/ that there would be runaway feedback loops that took out a major city like that, which would result in waves of refugees impacting other places and creating logistics disruptions elsewhere.

Mostly likely that doesn't take out the government, and the wasteland would be unevenly distributed, with "clear zones" that are assumed not to have any grizzlies (and policies and procedures in place to keep them that way) and "wasteland" that's been essentially condemned.
