  Do these bears need to eat things other than humans? The biosphere is going to collapse really hard, if so.

Any squirrel or moth or cow or whatever that dies is instantly replaced with a grizzly bear, colored green to distinguish it from the other bears.

Bears resulting from grizzly cannibalism are denoted blue. Bears that die of natural causes, starvation or being crushed by a tsunami of multi-colored bears, reappear completely black.
