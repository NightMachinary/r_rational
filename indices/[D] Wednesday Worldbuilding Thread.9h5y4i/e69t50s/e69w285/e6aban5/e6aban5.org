Maybe it's my true crime brain kicking in, but it's going to put some unique challenges for murderers.

I can see it now:

"HONEY! It's not what it looks like!"

"I think it's exactly what it looks like!" *two gunshots*

*two inhuman roars*

"AAAAAAHHHHHH! OH MY GOD!!!"

*three inhuman roars*

---- several hours later ----

"Mummy? Daddy?" *bedroom door opens* "AHHHHH"

*four inhuman roars, heavy footsteps*
