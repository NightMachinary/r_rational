I think the bigger issue would be that the "wasteland" would also be a significant percentage of the world's economic activity. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/us-gdp-map-2014-2][Just take a look at this map.]] if the largest cities, like New York, all have this runaway effect causing the city to collapse, then we'd easily see a quarter of the country's economy simply falling apart. Companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon, would be severely damaged as their headquarters become inaccessible. Not to mention the New York Stock exchange would have to shut down for an unforeseeable length of time. More than likely the world would go into economic collapse. Internet services and power grids would slowly fail as the centralized systems have no one to control them anymore.

I also highly disagree that it wouldn't take out the government. DC is a massive economic area. The things that are true for New York are true for DC, but instead of just taking out some businesses, it's congress, and the FBI, Homeland Security, the EPA, and NSA. Of course the president would get out, along with much of the high level white house staff, but they wouldn't have the infrastructure to manage the whole country anymore. The parts that they could manage would be run essentially like a dictatorship as well.

I'm not sure how the rest of the world would fair though. I expect similarly.
