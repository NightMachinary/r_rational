Rasputin seems a likely candidate.

How about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_FitzGerald,_11th_Earl_of_Kildare][Gerald FitzGerald]], wizard inheriting from a suspicious number of ancestors with the exact same name? All charismatic, all intelligent and well-read. Well, for at least three generations, and maybe the 8th was hot-headed.

There's also this creepy serial [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kiss][murderer]].

I'm getting these from a list of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_occultists][Occultists]] on the Wikipedia.

Edit: Just thought of Nikola Tesla. This line from the Wikipedia stands out: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla#Birthday_press_conferences]["Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom."]] Although... since he was known to age, maybe he isn't such a natural choice.
