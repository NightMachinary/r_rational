Zombie Related Hypothetical:

A genie announces that, a week from now, everyone who dies will have their body vanish and be replaced with an adult grizzly bear.

The grizzly bears are like normal bears, except they have a bright-red-coloring (to distinguish them from mundane wildlife) and a violently aggressive disposition. The bears will attack people, within the normal ability of bears.

Does society break down? And how much of the breakdown would be due to bears, and not everyone suddenly learning that magic is real?

I'm asking because I really like the 'mood' of Zombie stories; it's cool to think of how a few people might survive in a wasteland populated by strong, but not-particularly-smart foes.

A the same time, it's hard to imagine how we get from here to there, without a bunch of authorial handwaving.
