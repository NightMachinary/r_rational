Logistics is still a huge question mark. You get ~400 bears (before bear murders) that have to be cleaned and butchered so that their meat can be distributed to the people who need it, and that's assuming that you can actually /get/ the meat while it's still good, because slaughtering a bear properly without its willing compliance is probably pretty tough.

(Some math on caloric needs: 400 bears times 600 pounds times 600 calories per pound = 144,000,000 calories, which is enough for 72,000 people per day assuming a 2,000 calorie diet. Population of New York City is ~8.5 million. Not entirely sure that the numbers I grabbed are for the same statistical areas though.)
