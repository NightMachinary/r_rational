I'm thinking there will a terrible period of adjustment, before the surviving outposts of civilization settle on norms that involve everyone wearing steel rings around their necks.

Unless the transformation is an instant replacement of all nearby matter, in which case... I expect death-by-bear doesn't often lead to a net increase in bears, since the one doing the mauling will get its head and paws truncated.

Do these bears need to eat things other than humans? The biosphere is going to collapse really hard, if so. It may be that the only land animals that survive are those of Antarctica and insects. Almost any plant edible to humans is going to be driven to extinction as well.

The color red is going to get new connotations, whatever happens.
