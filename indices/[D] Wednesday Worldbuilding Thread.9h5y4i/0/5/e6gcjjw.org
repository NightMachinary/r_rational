Advance warning we take serious?\\
Bears are no problem.

There shouldn't be too many deads because of bears.

Just give everyone a necklace big enough for humans, too small for bears. You will get rid of all red bears. (For Zombies, we would wear helmets, no bites.)

And for the long term, change how houses are built. Make doors impossible to open for bears and hard to break.

In places with many dying, like hospitals, have security/bear guards.

Personally, I think we could have still our civilization, even if we turn into zombies/grizzly bears after we die.
