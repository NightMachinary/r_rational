I wasn't a tween girl in the 90s, but my sister was, and I read a lot of the books since I was a voracious reader and they were around. I'm not sure that I remember them well enough that I could ape them though, and I'd probably have to read the wiki that probably exists. It would be interesting though - I'd read it if someone else wrote it.

In a somewhat (but not really that much) similar vein, there was a series of articles that were Babysitters Club in the style of Bret Easton Ellis that I remember enjoying, [[http://www.alloy.com/lifestyle/baby-sitters-club-by-bret-easton-ellis-chapter-1/][link here]].
