Non-science of Myers-Briggs aside, if you're looking for examples the first that comes to mind is Peter Wiggan (E) from Orson Scott Card. He's focussed on a lot more in the Ender's Shadow sub-series. Tiffany Aching (P) from Terry Pratchett is another example in deliberate /Rationalist/ fiction.

I think the reason for this lack is that the rationalist crowd is small and new and the kernel is from a group overrepresented by "INTJ" cluster individuals. People write what they know best, particularly in how their characters think.
