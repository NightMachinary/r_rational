The concept that you can store correlated information using shorter symbols as lossy compression is a provable theorem in modern information theory. If I ask you about a bunch of questions and ask if you do the extroverted thing, and then if most of them you do the extroverted thing, and then label you 'E' that is perfectly valid information theory. If you want information beyond what you put in, you will need modern psychology and neuroscience, but if you want a cheap compression algorithm then it works fine.
