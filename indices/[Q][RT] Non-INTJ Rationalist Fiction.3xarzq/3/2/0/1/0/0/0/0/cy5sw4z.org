The key question is though is if you are trying to extract new information via inference, or compress information for easier use. You said you are an Aquarius. If I wanted to try to extract new information from that via inference, I would need some correlation between your birthday and other factors. If I want to extract the fact that your birthday is in the range January 20 - February 18, then THAT is perfectly legal. Knowing that someone is an INTJ tells me something about how they answered the questions on the test, does it not? And if I know something about how they answered the questions on the test, I may know something about their personality. If I give you a test "Do you prefer chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice cream, or are indifferent" and then label you 'C', 'V', or 'I' based that, then concluding if you are an introvert based on that label would be highly questionable. If I want to figure out if you prefer chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice cream, or are indifferent based on if you are a 'C', 'V', or 'I' then that is perfectly legal. Suppose instead of giving you the label, someone gave you the entire set of answers they gave in the test-would you be able to determine anything about their personality? If so, then depending on the form the compressed version of the answers take, you might be able to learn something about their personality. Where as knowing your starsign doesn't help me, since even if I knew your exact birth second I still wouldn't know more about your personality, and your star sign is a lossy compression of your birthtime down to the second.
