My best bet for what date range your birthday is in is that date range. Do you disagree with this? It might not be a very good bet, but no other star sign date range would be a better bet. And how do you define 'useful, scientifically studied'? Anything done by a professional scientist? Anything said by Einstein? Anything published in a journal? Anything published in Nature? I can predict with confidence that most people who participate in this subreddit will score INTJ-this is true regardless of what pointless names you assign to things.
