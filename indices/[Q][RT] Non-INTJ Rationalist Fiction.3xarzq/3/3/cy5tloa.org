I was using Myers-Briggs as an example because, as I said, it is "well-known". Upon looking up some of its criticisms, they seem pretty convincing, and obviously "well-known" != "epistemologically sound". I did remember learning about it in introductory psych classes in college, but the also teach Freud, so..... Regardless, point taken.

That said, it was used as just that, an example; it's pretty tangential to my question(s). And as your point was raised more eloquently and more charitably by others, your comment was a mostly unconstructive criticism of a minor point in the opening post. Downvoted.
