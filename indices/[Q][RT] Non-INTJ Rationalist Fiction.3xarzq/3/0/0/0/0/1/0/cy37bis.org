  Well, there are many versions of the test, some have better formulated questions than others. Try [[http://www.16personalities.com/]]

Will my life be noticeably better if I know that 16personalities classifies me as XXXX instead of YYYY? If I don't trust the assumptions behind the test, there isn't a reason for me to take it.

  Are you often chased by bears? Do you take exams every day? It asks if there's a specific tendency in your normal actions in day-to-day life, like when you're grocery shopping or whatever.

Again, that has more to do with what situations I find myself in, not my personality. I can't conceive of a neutral situation in which you do exactly as good using type 1 thinking as you do using type 2 thinking. But that's exactly the kind of situation you need in order to answer a question like that... at which point, my answer would be "Either," and I imagine that most people's would be the same, unless they like Type 1 or Type 2 thinking for the sake of itself.

  And if you consider yourself doing a little of both, great, there's a neutral option which you should take on that question.

Which is good, but effectively makes the question pointless, because it doesn't add to your score for one side or the other.

  And the results shouldn't be seen as dichotomy by the way, just on what half of the spectrums you seem to lie. It will also tell you whether you are close to the 50/50 mark or at an extreme, even though that information isn't conveyed by the four-letter combination.

If they didn't want it to be taken as a dichotomy, then they have a terrible way of presenting the data. It wouldn't be difficult to use percentages
