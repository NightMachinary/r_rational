Well, there are many versions of the test, some have better formulated questions than others. Try [[http://www.16personalities.com/]]

Though the question "Do you tend to think things through or act on impulse?" probably comes up anyway. In your post it sounds like you're purposefully misunderstanding the question in order to sound clever. It asks "do you /tend/ to?" While you're perfectly correct that one would act on impulse when chased by a bear and think things through when doing a math test, /every single person/ on the planet would do that. That's rather obvious, and hence clearly not what they're asking, or there would be no point. Are you often chased by bears? Do you take exams every day? It asks if there's a specific tendency in your normal actions in day-to-day life, like when you're grocery shopping or whatever. And if you consider yourself doing a little of both, great, there's a neutral option which you should take on that question.

And the results shouldn't be seen as dichotomy by the way, just on what half of the spectrums you seem to lie. It will also tell you whether you are close to the 50/50 mark or at an extreme, even though that information isn't conveyed by the four-letter combination.
