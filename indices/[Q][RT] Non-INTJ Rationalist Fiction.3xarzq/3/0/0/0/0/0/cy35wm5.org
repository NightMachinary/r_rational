  Note that the terms used for each dichotomy have specific technical meanings relating to the MBTI which differ from their everyday usage. For example, people who prefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more /judgmental/ or less /perceptive/. Nor does the MBTI instrument measure aptitude; it simply indicates for one preference over another. Someone reporting a high score for extraversion over introversion cannot be correctly described as /more/ extraverted: they simply have a clear /preference/.

I think a large part of the problem with MBTI is that it's been endlessly watered down by a combination of people who don't actually understand it (lots of freshman psych students), the difficulty of making a test that actually measures what it's trying to measure, and the proliferation of less-than-certified tests, all of which are compounded by the fact that they're using terms in nonstandard ways which are also quite close to their everyday usage (and also heavily correlated -- you're more likely to display aptitude at skills you prefer using because you use them more often).

I agree that there's a large degree of "why would I use a hammer when the situation calls for a screwdriver?" but that's something that exceedingly hard to get away from for some of the dichotomies, especially because the concepts are so abstract and adding in more details to the questions just results in confounding factors creeping in. It's one of the many reasons that I think MBTI is lacking as a diagnostic tool -- but that doesn't mean that it can't offer insights into characters.
