The primary difference between MBTI and a horoscope is that a horoscope doesn't take in any information and in theory (and practice) it's indistinguishable from random chance. The same can't be said for MBTI. Go find someone who doesn't know their MBTI type, or better, has never heard of MBTI, then have them take three different tests without letting them know the results until all the tests have been completed.

It would be ludicrous to think that the results are going to be no better than random chance. MBTI sucks for a number of reasons, but the classification scheme it uses still classifies things in a way that (for example) blood type theory, astrological signs, etc. do not.

The two big problems with MBTI is that its four dimensions were chosen through intuition rather than factor analysis, and that it proposes a bimodal distribution that's not there. The latter is a serious problem, but it's not "means whatever the user wants". If we were talking about /height/ which has a normal distribution, and I was some kind of moron who only classified people into "tall" or "short", my descriptions would still be useful to you, even though I would have all sorts of measurement error, especially when I was looking at someone who was of medium height. Me telling you that someone is "short" is worth a lot less if I can't actually express /how/ short, and obviously it would be more optimal for me to be able to give you a measurement in centimeters, /but that doesn't mean that my stupid bimodal "short" and "tall" system is meaningless or nonuseful./ It's both meaningful and useful, while also being unscientific, suboptimal, error-prone, and removing important information about variability. That's MBTI.

Edit: If you want to read a study about the problems with MBTI, [[http://melindabrackett.com/Myers%20Briggs%20article.pdf][read this one,]] which goes over test-retest reliability, problems with applying bimodal categories to traits with normal distribution, and factor analysis.
