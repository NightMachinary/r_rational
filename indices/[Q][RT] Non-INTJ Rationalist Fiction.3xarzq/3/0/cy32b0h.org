It's still useful for description. The E-I axis is just extraversion-introversion, which is useful for description. Same goes for T-F, which is just thinking-feeling, which is also useful. I think that saying "INTJ" is helpful because it sums up a lot of things about a character very quickly. So ... trash non-science or no, I don't think there's much sense in just throwing it out, any more than you should throw out other quick descriptive tools.
