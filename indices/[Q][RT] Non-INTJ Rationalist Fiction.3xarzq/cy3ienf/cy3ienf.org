So, I pretty firmly identify as extroverted, but my definitions may be a little wonky. I'm much more productive alone, and I hate being unproductive, so I have to spend some time alone. But the highest level of satisfaction I can obtain comes from social interaction, and I'm well aware of this. Furthermore, when I'm in my element, I tend to be the initiator of social interaction.
