  More practically, how does one go about writing rationalist characters with intentionally different personality types?
#+end_quote

- Extroversion-Introversion is pretty easy, and I would say that a number of rational protagonists tend toward E, not I, mostly in terms of throwing themselves into political situations and talking their problems out (which is one of the ways authors have of delivering exposition and/or thoughts). The introverted rationalist is a watcher/spider archetype, while the extroverted rationalist just throws himself into the thick of it and trusts in his abilities to see him through and react better than others do.
- Sensing-Intuition is a little harder. I would say that you'd maybe want to make it a split of tactics and strategy? A good rationalist does both, but you can still express a preference or an aptitude. Sensing rationalists tend to focus on the micro and follow a munchkin or engineer archetype. Intuitive rationalists tend to focus on the macro and follow a scholar archetype. This is more about /preferences/ than anything else. You can be good at the big picture of grand strategy while still preferring the small, concrete things.
- Thinking-Feeling is the hardest, but I think it could still be done. You have to keep in mind that it's still a preference. The feeling rationalist is a peacemaker, always trying to mend bridges or use the principle of charity. They're probably more introspective and pay more attention to their feelings, asking themselves "What's causing me to feel this way?" They're probably more emotionally focused and when dealing with an opponent will be more inclined to get to the root of the emotional arguments rather than the logical ones (which can still be a good path toward winning).
- Judging-Perceiving is another easy one. Improvisation is already a strong rationalist skill and plays well with the extroversion traits. A perceiving rationalist might make for a chessmaster who favors speed chess and generating chaos that they can exploit better than their opponents.

So if our counter-type rationalist hero is ESFP, they're probably outgoing, heavily involved in politics, make decisions on the fly, generate chaos in their wake, and go for the emotional weak spots in their opponents (or aim for conversion). Their advantage is probably moving quickly or moving erratically rather than sitting down for a long time to think things through. When they /do/ sit down for long analysis, it's because it's necessary for winning rather than because they take any joy from it.
