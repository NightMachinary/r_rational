  Tattletale doesn't receive insight via rationalism, she receives it via magic

Pretty sure that's wrong. Look at how Tt's power works. Remember it's weaknesses and restrictions? That doesn't really look like magic intuition powers to me. That looks like something with ungodly amounts of processing power and a great grasp of heuristics and reasoning making connections in seconds that would require hours or days for a normal human.

I think Tt's power is extremely rapid deduction and hypothesis generation (with heuristics) or more concisely, Tt's power allows her to /think/ better. It's not magic and it /is/ fallible.

It's just headcanon, but I find this explanation far more satisfying than proposing that Tt's shard somehow being able to accurately deduce mental dispositions, floor layouts, and facilitate computer hacking, while at the same time making mistakes often enough that Tt has to work around it (remember the bank robbery?).

That said, good deduction skills and super-thinking doesn't make someone a rationalist, and Tt's isn't one by any stretch of the imagination (although, one might make a case for her shard).
