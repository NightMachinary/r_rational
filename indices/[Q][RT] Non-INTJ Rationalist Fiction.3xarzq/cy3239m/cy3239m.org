It'd be pretty hard to get a RATIONALIST HERO that is not xNTx. (going for the "visionary" definition of the iNtuitive, no offense to any senSers out there.)

It'd also be pretty difficult to get a RATIONAL character that is not xxTx.

Personally I'm ENTP and I'm going to make an extra effort to write character that aren't INTJ or ENTP.
