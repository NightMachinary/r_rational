I agree. Emotional characters are realistic.

I'm just saying that if someone's preferential way of interacting with others is by problem solving and rational application of concepts, they are more likely to identify with being a Thinker, rather than a Feeler.

A Rational Feeler may take the emotions of others into great consideration, but if we drift into social manipulation territory, there could be arguments that they are actually a Thinker. (a Socially Savvy Thinker as opposed to an emotionally-blind Thinker, but still.)
