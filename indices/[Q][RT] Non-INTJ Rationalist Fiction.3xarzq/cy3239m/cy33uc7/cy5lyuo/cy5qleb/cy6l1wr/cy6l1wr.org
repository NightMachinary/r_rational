Thanks for helping explore my assumptions on MBTI.

I'll withdraw my statement that "rational" heroes cant be Feelers. You're right about MBTI. Its the equivalent to horoscopes in that it is just hazy enough in its descriptors that you may find something to identify with in your own personality, regardless of the initial label.
