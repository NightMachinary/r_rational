I was a temp for years. This resulted in me taking these kind of tests a total of over 30 times. Sometime after take 12 I started just fucking with the tests, partially because I got different results depending what I had for breakfast that morning anyway. Made absolutely no difference as far as my jobs or interactions with my bosses went. They do nothing.
