This is pretty basic stuff. Using phrases like "information theory" and "compression algorithm" doesn't make your point better, especially when you have such extreme issues with methodology.

You want more, give me something other than a link to a rambling blog article and some misused technical terminology. /You/ explain why /your/ poorly formed argument means anything useful at all, instead of just placing declarative statements with keywords next to your poorly formed thesis.
