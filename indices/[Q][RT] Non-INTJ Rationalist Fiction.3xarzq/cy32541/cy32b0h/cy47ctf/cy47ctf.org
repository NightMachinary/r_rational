No. It is not. As they aren't scientifically /grounded/ in any way, the terms mean whatever the user wants. It is like tarot or horoscopes. Just another way of casting bones to reveal what the user and audience are already thinking in a socially acceptable way--along with the usual witch hunts that always happen when +stupid+ average people get ahold of powerful memes.

Sure. That's a /use/, but that doesn't make it provably better than coming up with something less blatantly unscientific than using Myers-Briggs terms. Or, you know, even better than just /not/ making sloppy generalizations at all, and thus having more clarity of thought and communication in general.
