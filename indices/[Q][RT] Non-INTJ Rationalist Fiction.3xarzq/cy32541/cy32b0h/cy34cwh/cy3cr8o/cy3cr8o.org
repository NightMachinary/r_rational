Don't forget, E/I is not by modern use of the word. A lot of people use these incorrectly and misattribute themselves or others. I am quite extroverted/ bold. I am a solid MB Introvert/ solitary worker. I am happiest if I get my own downtime, and would happily work solo for days on end. My actually shy Extroverted husband would be depressed and lackluster if he didn't have human contact after about 2 hours.
