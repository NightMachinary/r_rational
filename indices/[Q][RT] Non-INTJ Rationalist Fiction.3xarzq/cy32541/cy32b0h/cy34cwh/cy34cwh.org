Extroversion versus introversion is very much a spectrum. The dichotomy Myers-Brigs presents is a reduction, but a somewhat useful one.

Sensory versus Intuition seems particularly bad, in that I can't think of anyone outside of 1-dimensional personalities in fiction who don't do both, and few who could even be considered leaning to one side or the other.

The thinking versus feeling seems... weird. It's basically asking if you generally use Type 1 or 2 reasoning, but kind of not. I'd imagine that in the vast majority of cases, your results from your previous two categories would pretty much determine the result of this one. Yay, multicollinearity!

Judging versus perceiving, also weird. Very few people would actually include anything that could be described by this category when describing someone's personality. It's like they /really/ wanted a 4 letter system, and this was the best they could come up with.

At the end, when you're looking at all the personality types, they pretty much are a mix between horoscopes, and a straw-man factory for what personalities are actually like.

My opinion? If you mean extroverted/introverted, use the words. Anything else on the list seems to have either poor definitions, or isn't really all that useful when describing someone's personality.
