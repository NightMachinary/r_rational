  /It asks if there's a specific tendency in your normal actions in day-to-day life, like when you're grocery shopping or whatever./

  Again, that has more to do with what situations I find myself in, not my personality. I can't conceive of a neutral situation in which you do exactly as good using type 1 thinking as you do using type 2 thinking. But that's exactly the kind of situation you need in order to answer a question like that... at which point, my answer would be "Either," and I imagine that most people's would be the same, unless they like Type 1 or Type 2 thinking for the sake of itself.

I'll try again: don't try to come up with a situation. Don't imagine being chased by bears, don't try to imagine some hypothetical true neutral situation, or any other situation that only exists in your head. Answer truthfully about actual situations that /tend to happen/ in your actual life, that's why I talked about grocery shopping. Think back on your days, and the types of things you usually do, and try to decide how you usually think when you take decisions. If we, for the argument's sake, scale this down to you making only three decisions in a day, and make two of them fast and intuitively and the last one after careful logical consideration, you'd answer closer to "impulsive" than "thought through."

I can assure you that there are millions of people out there who know that have a strong (or weaker) /tendency/ to take impulsive decisions, a pattern that they can't break out of. The tendency can so strong that they and others clearly notice this trait in themselves, and maybe even consider it a bit of a problem that they'd like to address, in the extremest cases. Vice versa, there are millions of people who know that they spend too much time thinking things through too deeply, decisions that others would just take in the blink of an eye. Perhaps these persons do this because they're afraid of decisions, perhaps they are perfectionists, perhaps they're just very calm and analytical compared to most. Either way, most people would instantly recognise themselves as described by a place on this scale. If you, after this explanation, still can't understand why anyone would answer anything but in the middle I strongly suggest you answer neutrally, since I guess that means that you're so much in the middle that you can't even imagine being any other way (it would also mean that you have a slightly lacking imagination/empathy, but that's a question for another test).

  /And if you consider yourself doing a little of both, great, there's a neutral option which you should take on that question./

  Which is good, but effectively makes the question pointless, because it doesn't add to your score for one side or the other.
#+end_quote

Maybe that particular question seems pointless to you if you answer neutrally on that question, but you are wrong for two reasons: 1) there exists other persons than you, who will answer otherwise, and 2) your "score" can as I said be between 0% and 100%, and if you answer neutrally on that question that will count towards a middle score, around 50%, which is a score like any other.

  If they didn't want it to be taken as a dichotomy, then they have a terrible way of presenting the data. It wouldn't be difficult to use percentages.
#+end_quote

I told you in my last post that they will present percentages. The data or the presentation of it isn't a big problem to me (the only one of us who seems to know how it's presented), the problem might lie in people misunderstanding it and thinking the four-letter combination is the only information they're given. The four letters is a quick-and-dirty way to sum up their percentages, but to us at least it's clear that only presenting that represents a loss of information. I'm not surprised by this, as people in general aren't good at presenting or understanding data given in a statistical fashion.
