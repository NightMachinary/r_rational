  It's one of the many reasons that I think MBTI is lacking as a diagnostic tool -- but that doesn't mean that it can't offer insights into characters.

If by characters you mean fictional characters, than I'd agree. It might actually work for them. That's what these 4 letter codes are, personalities for fictional characters.

Fictional characters have these types of personalities because it's much easier to conceptualize a personality than to conceptualize an entire person, so I can agree with you there. People are complicated.

However, while it does have use, it seems oddly restrictive. Rather than saying "An introverted person who plans ahead of time" it forces a 4 letter code that, as you note, has been endlessly watered down.

Why not just describe what you want to describe instead of using Myers Briggs?
