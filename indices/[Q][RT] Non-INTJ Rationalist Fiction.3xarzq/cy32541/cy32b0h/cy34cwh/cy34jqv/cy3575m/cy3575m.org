  While I largely agree with you, Meyers-Briggs isn't about what you use, it's about what you prefer to use, to the extent you have a preference.

Really? The one I took asked what I /tended/ to use.

In any case, I don't think that that is very indicative of my personality.

Pretty much every question on that test had me saying, "Well, that would depend on the situation."

Ex: "Do you tend to think things through, or act on impluse?"

Me: "I don't know. Am I fighting a bear, or doing a math problem, because that's gonna pretty heavily influence my answer.

Another example "Do you tend to plan things out, or figure it out as you go."

Me: "I don't know. How much is the event in question stressing me out?"

If it had asked me what I'd prefer to use, the results wouldn't have really been much different. I prefer to use whatever fits the situation, and that's also what I tend to use.

Some questions basically had me flipping a coin, because both answers were wrong. I don't see how useful the result could possibly be.
