[[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] if you want to use big 5, replace INTJ with high openness, low extraversion, low agreeableness (I think) and the question still stands. For or against MB is /mostly/ besides the point. But [[/u/cyril957]] you might want to check out the arguments against MB. /I am not an expert/ but I have heard that it is less useful/consistent/supported than the big 5.
