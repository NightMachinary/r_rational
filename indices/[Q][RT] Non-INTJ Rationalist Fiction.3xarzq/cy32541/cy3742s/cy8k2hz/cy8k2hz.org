That sounds about right as far as the correlations are concerned (such as they are). It makes me really curious as to how a low Openness rational character might learn. I have a story idea that's been banging around in my head for a while about a gentleman with OCPD (which could be oversimplified as an extreme lack of Openness), and then the question becomes how do you start nudging them in the right direction. In this case when there's something clinical going on, medical assistance would hopefully be first, but a lot of OCPD people especially don't like getting help from what I've read. Hmmm...
