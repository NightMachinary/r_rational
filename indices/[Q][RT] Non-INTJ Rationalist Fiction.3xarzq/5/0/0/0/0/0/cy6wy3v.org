I took a look at [[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Uji2P-HjUCc/ThX5qS2vn-I/AAAAAAAABo4/IpAg-ReSvI4/s1600/Myers_Briggs_Pony-%2528n1309917846337%2529.jpg][the square]] again (cw: ponis), and while I'm categorized as INTP, I could see myself described very well as INFP, ISTP, ENTP (surprisingly enough), and even INTJ and ESFJ, the polar opposite, save my relatively small but growing pool of conscientiousness. It really is a horoscope.
