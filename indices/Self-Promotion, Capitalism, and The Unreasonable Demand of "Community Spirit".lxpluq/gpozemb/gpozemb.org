Aggrieved tone aside, I'm sympathetic to the idea that the audience who benefits from the work is also blissfully unaware of the grind and hostile to being directly exposed to it. Every mildly successful creator has had a conversation that goes like this:

Diehard fan: Oh my gosh I love your work so much it changed my life I set an alarm for each new chapter and even left my wife in the middle of giving birth just to stay up-to-date on the latest release, I literally would have killed myself if not for your writing and instead I am now the President of Harvard and also CEO of Big Company Inc. thanks to how inspiring you are!!!!

Creator: Awesome, that makes me so happy to hear that! I do it all for my readers. ...Incidentally, I've been living on rice and beans for the past three years, I don't know if you could possibly...?

Diehard fan: What?

Creator: /coughs/ Uh, there's a tiny little “donate” button in the very upper left hand corner of my homepage, it's basically invisible, but if you, maybe, you know....

Diehard fan: Ohhhhh yeah well I would but I clicked on it and it was way too complicated so yeah. :(

Creator: Well it's literally been designed to be as simple as possible, you just put in your credit card number and the amount....

Diehard fan: Yeahhhh way too hard to figure out sorry. I tried!

Creator: I...need...money.

Diehard fan: WHOOOAAA slow down there Gordon Gekko, I didn't realize this was all about greed.

Creator: /waving hands defensively/ No no no, not for me, it's just that I can't afford the electricity to keep my laptop on or the Internet bill to publish my work. I'm not asking money for /me/, just to support the work.

Diehard fan: So the money won't make your life better in any way?

Creator: Of course not, I'm not some kind of monster! /sweating nervously, hating self/

Diehard fan: If you need Internet, go to a coffee shop.

Creator: I can't afford coffee.

Diehard fan: Well yeah that's the problem, I would donate, but my budget is pretty tight right now. Maybe next year!

Creator: What's that in your hand?

Diehard fan: What, this? This is a Venti Frappu-spresso with a triple caramel shot and extra whipped cream.

Creator: You got that for free?

Diehard fan: No, it cost twelve bucks.

Creator: What if you bought a drink that only cost eleven bucks and gave me one? If just forty of my five thousand fans did that /once a month/, I'd be able to keep my lights on! It doesn't even have to be the same fans each month, you could work out a schedule or something!

Diehard fan: I'm going to need you to pull your ass out of whatever Ayn Rand novel you think you're living in. You don't have a right to reach into my pocket and leave my children destitute and starving so that you can buy another Ferrari. No one owes you anything, and frankly, it's sickening to learn that you only view art as a way of ripping people off.

Creator: /is being gaslit by the entire fucking community and having a mental breakdown/ I'm so sorry, I let my greed blind me, I can see now how deeply fucked up it is to have the value of what I do represented by any kind of flow of dollars. Of course a drug dealer or someone who makes ads for obesity-causing sodas should make money, but an artist who asks for enough money to patch the massive the hole in the wall in their bedroom where the wind and rain and rats come in through every night is perverting the entire concept of art and exploiting their community with all of the vicious single-mindedness of BP pouring oil down penguins' throats because their accountants calculated that it would boost quarterly profits.

Diehard fan: I'm glad you learned your lesson. Can't wait for the next chapter!

There's a tone we take toward people who ask for money in exchange for services, especially services we're used to getting for free, that makes it very hard to ask for money in exchange for services! There's nothing more shameful for an artist than having to ---puke---/market/ one's work. That's just one step away from shilling for major corporations and getting kids addicted to harmful crap in exchange for a paycheck.

(Incidentally, Doritos has just launched their new 3D Doritos Crunch, with more dimensions of flavor and crunch than ever before! Be a part of the sensation that's satisfying the nation!)

Where I disconnect from most artists on this point is that I have no trouble accepting that most art isn't worth anything to most people. Like, look at the most upvoted stuff on [[/r/art]], how much would you really pay to own a copy? I wouldn't want to pay five bucks for most of them. They're not bad, it's just...what am I going to do with it? It'll become part of the background two days after I hang it up on a wall, and I'll never really notice it again. I sure as hell wouldn't want to pay for an article about The Five Types of Gamers (That You Game With Right Now!). Readers should be more tolerant of writers asking for money, but writers should be more open to the idea that 99.99999% of humanity really does value their work less than junk food.

So I think it's simultaneously true that creators ought to be able to scream “GIVE ME MONEY YOU UNGRATEFUL FUCKS!” at their audience on a daily basis, and also that most art has the same emotional depth and lasting impact as a bag of Doritos.

Which are fucking delicious.
