  The most common requirement you see from these groups is that you need to be an "active participant" in the community. What they mean, of course, is that you have to make posts that are completely separate from your actual work in order to balance the scales.

Terrible take. The community wants entertaining content and interesting discussion. Promoting someone else's work is usually good because the person wouldn't promote it unless they liked it and thought others in the community will also like it. That's just obvious.

On the other hand, self-promotion bypasses the initial filters of liking the work and thinking the community will like it. A self-promoter is biased and will usually think their work is good regardless of if it actually is good, but that's not the worst part. The worst is that the self-promoter can be motivated by their own financial self-interest, which is obviously not something the rest of the community will usually care about. Basically this means a self promoter has reason to shill their work even if it's bad, and even if it's not a good fit for the community because they want to make money.

It's unfortunate for the content creator that it's hard for them to live off of their work, but it's not the community's problem, and it shouldn't be made the communities problem. And it's possible for self-promoters to recommend good content, but it's sadly kinda rare.

TLDR: Self-promoters have bills to pay, so they'll promote their content regardless of quality. Community members don't get paid for recommending other people's content, so their recommendations are usually better.
