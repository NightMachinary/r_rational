  how so many people on it treat creators who are just trying to pay their rent

Most of those people likewise have to pay the rent, but they got themselves a waged job to do it, and left any creative endeavours to their leisure hours. And don't appreciate being given the hard sell by someone who "has to make rent off this". Maybe you shouldn't have quit your day job, eh? Why is your rent anyone's problem except yours?
