OP is entirely free to be an author, and to starve as a result. Everyone else is entirely free to tell him that they don't want his spam on their fora, and if he wants to sell books he needs to Git Gud, not optimise his marketing posts for how closely he can shave the posting guidelines in fifteen different places. This seems to me like all the freedom anyone could possibly need, whether fortunate or not.
