I was gonna reply before and changed my mind because it didn't add to the conversation, but now that the post has been removed...

  Doritos... are fucking delicious.

I strongly prefer store-brand Doritos knock-offs. They taste nostalgic, probably because skating rinks and bowling alleys in the '90s probably served the knock-offs instead of real Doritos. But yeah, real Doritos don't taste like rollerblades, so I prefer the knock-offs. Except for the Spicy Sweet Chili Doritos in the purple bag, those are pretty dope.
