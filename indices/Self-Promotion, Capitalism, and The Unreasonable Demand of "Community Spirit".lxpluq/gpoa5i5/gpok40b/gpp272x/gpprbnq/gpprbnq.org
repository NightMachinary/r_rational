Can I take a sec to point out that "community that wants more X content refusing to hear about X content depending on the source" seems like a good way to stifle new works, authors, and interest? Like yeah there's the times "LitRPG Isekai Harem writer on Royalroad #682" shills his work anywhere and everywhere, but there's also other authors who don't interact with every community they could (they lack time, are branching out into new genres, or didn't know a niche community would enjoy their work beforehand and wants to join and contribute), and community lurkers deciding to start on their own works, and a blanket ban stops that.

Give avenues for self-promotion that have limits. Make a weekly/monthly discussion for self-promotion, make people tag all works and have a setting for self-promoted work (so people know it going in, or can filter it out), have a group of volunteers/members that can be messaged work from an author to see if they want to recommend it to the broader community or not. There are pathways other than a straight ban.
