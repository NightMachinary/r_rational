Because the nature of communities and society as a whole leaves us all interconnected and benefitting from one another. If we cut every author out of the world we'd lose a huge source of entertainment, enjoyment, and stress relief. Same for many other jobs that aren't arguably essential to living. Specialisation across a community improves outcomes for everyone, I'd rather see a doctor for my health or a plumber for my pipes than a jack of all trades just doing their best after all.

There's a disconnect here where starting to take steps towards giving people freedom to chase their own goals under our current economic paradigm results in a clusterfuck of spam and bullshit, look at the weird clickbait formatting people looking for Youtube success have to use to compete after all. But the other suggestion of "hey fuck this iteration of capitalism we should do X instead" is a messy discussion in and of itself.

Edit: also arguing "no I just mean this one guy shouldn't be an author not the entire occupation up and quitting" kinda misses the different chances and fortunes that drastically effect whether someone is successful or not, beyond individual ability. Initial opportunities also play a huge role, but if you argue people without a strong foundation shouldn't take risks then you're condemning less fortunate people to a disappointing life for reasons out of their control (background, upbringing, family, country of birth, discrimination, etc). Judging someone's capability as an author (or anything at all) purely on results and irrespective of the way the wider world worked out is a bad idea, and giving freedom only to the already fortunate seems really horrific.
