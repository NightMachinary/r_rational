Literally starving kind of limits your options, and thus freedom, doesn't it?

Like yeah you can slippery slope and strawman that perspective towards "how free am I without a government-funded gold-plated toilet?" and argue giving people things for free means they won't do anything themselves. But you can do the same for the other side of "how free am I if the government says I can't stab who I want?" and you've got people benefitting from the misery of others.

"Lets stop people from experiencing preventable suffering" (starving, homelessness, victim of intentional abuse/violence, lack of medical care, etc.) is where I fall on that spectrum at least.
