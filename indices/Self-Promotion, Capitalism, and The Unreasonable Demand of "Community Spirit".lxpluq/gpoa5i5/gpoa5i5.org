I think you are working under a fundamental misunderstanding here.

You don't have a right to make money as an author. Specialized communities don't owe you anything. They aren't here for you to sell books or w/e you make.

People understand how it is trying to be an independent creator. They aren't confused or ignorant. They just don't want to get hit with self promotion spam all the time. They want to engage in the actual purpose of whatever community they love.

Most people have actually terrible intellectual product. 90% of everything is shit as the saying goes. Then like 8-9% of stuff is good but only for a small subset of people. Niche content. Then 1-2% is generally good and nearly everyone would benefit from being exposed to it.

The number of people with a desire to subsist materially on their intellectual product is much larger than the market for the products overall. That is, even if everything was objectively amazing it couldn't all pay the bills because there is a limit on consumption.
