Intriguing. Thoughts:

Why not combine the 7-coins and all-eternity into a single proposal? Why not lead with the all-eternity as part of the first forced redistribution, in case of an upset later? Since the coins are worthless/valueless if you already have a coin and aren't depriving another of their last coin, yet one was enough as a bribe to pass the all-eternity by itself, why not go straight to an all-eternity proposal for pennies, or cupcakes, or even just grains of burning sand from underfoot?
