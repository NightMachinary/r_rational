The "consul for all eternity" could be appended to one of the earlier proposals, I just broke it out for the dramatic reveal, and because the vote that passed it demonstrated the trick of moving the single silver coin back and forth to buy votes. The coins are inherently valuable because each entitles you to a tenth of the souls in the circle of greed, I should probably have made that part a little clearer. You're right that I sort of hand-waved exactly how stupidly greedy the other demons are -- would their nature require them to elect Mammon consul for live in exchange for one more rock than they had before? -- but the rough conceit is that the only things valuable enough to get them to ignore all other considerations are the silver coins.
