The demons who don't have the ability of forbearance (the ability to leave a cookie for the promise of 2 later) are not able to use that ability.

Therefore they can only act to move their own utility function toward the nearest local peak, never toward a higher peak that requires bypassing or moving away from a closer but smaller local peak.

Even without the soul ownership aspect each coin has a token value that is higher than not having the coin (each is worth its weight in silver), so having the third coin is a local peak.
