...This would work really well if your protagonist is a fish out of temporal water.

In Transmetropolitan, people who were awoken from cryogenic suspension generally suffered from massive, debilitating culture shock. However, "reservations" are a thing that exists. The government doesn't seem to care all that much about its citizens, but if it did then a pretty quick solution would be to wake up cryosleepers on appropriate reservations and slowly acclimate them to the future.

In a setting without preexisting reservations, these might be set up for the express purpose of helping people to adjust, so our protagonist wakes up, finds that the world is only a little different, and...the onion starts getting peeled back, layer by layer, as quickly as our protagonist can adjust to it.
