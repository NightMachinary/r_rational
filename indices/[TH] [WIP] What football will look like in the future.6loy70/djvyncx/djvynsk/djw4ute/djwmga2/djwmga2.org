  so far none of the characters have made any actions or decisions that are unjustifiably stupid.

Ten's initial messages to Nine did not make a first impression that seemed intelligent...

#+begin_quote
  Nine? Can you hear me? If you can, please be patient. I promise that I will answer you. I understand that you might be afraid.
#+end_quote

126 characters to say not much of anything. This does not seem smart. But perhaps psychology was important. After that, though, the second message? Or the third? Ten had 217 days to think about it. But instead seems to have spent about 10 seconds composing it.
