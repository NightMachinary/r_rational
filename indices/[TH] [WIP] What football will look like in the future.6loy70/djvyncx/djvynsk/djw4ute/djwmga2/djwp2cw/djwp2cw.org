I agree they didn't pick the best message, but I think part of that can be blamed on the lack of urgency.Time pretty much means nothing to them in the long run. And I get the feeling that she was sending messages like these long before she got her first response.

But yeah ultimately the opening could have been handled better. The author milked it a bit for the sake of dramatics. Though I'd say this one instance doesn't really detract much from the story.
