It hits on many of the themes found in lots of rational fiction and so far none of the characters have made any actions or decisions that are unjustifiably stupid.

I'd say it could very well be a rational story, though it doesn't seem like it will be a rationalist story. It meets the qualifications listed in the sidebar. It's just really unconventional.
