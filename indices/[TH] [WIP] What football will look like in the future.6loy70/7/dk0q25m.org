I found this really interesting towards the beginning when Nine and Ten were first coming into contact, but then it seemed to lose some of what originally made it exciting later on.

One part that did keep my attention was the people trying to collect every autographed Koy Detmer ball; this seems like exactly the kind of thing people would do for fun in a future where everyone is immortal. It sort of reminded me of Alicorn's short story [[http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/will.shtml][Will]], in the sense that when people have all the time in the world then they have the time to explore every obscure thing that interests them, rather than focusing on things they think are important.

Anything that uses media in creative ways like this is a good thing, though, and I'll probably keep reading to see where it goes!
