I mean, I don't think we actually know what humans are like in an environment where all of their needs are met and they live forever and there are never any new generations to shake things up. It's a fairly /bleak/ take on immortality, sure, and you're well within your rights to find that unpleasant to read about, but I don't think we can accuse it of being unrealistic. It's just speculative fiction that is speculating a scenario that doesn't appeal to you. I also don't think it's necessarily true that "people aren't built to be complacent"; there are all kinds of circumstances where people become complacent.
