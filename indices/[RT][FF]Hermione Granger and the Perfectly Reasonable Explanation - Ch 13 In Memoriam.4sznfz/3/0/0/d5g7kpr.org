Gotcha on the first one, thanks!

On the second - when I write dialogue (or internal monologue), I always write it as it sounds, which I think helps with voice and characterization. I agree the sentence is a little clumsy - I did ponder for a while on how best to phrase "missed the dosage" - but in the end I left it...Nurse Wainscott has multiple excuses to be less polished in her delivery. :)
