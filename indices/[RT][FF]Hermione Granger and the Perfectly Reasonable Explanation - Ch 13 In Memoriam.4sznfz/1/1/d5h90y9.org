Circa 1991, Hogwarts' two in 50 years is pretty solid. If you count physical safety, anyway, and not becoming-a-Dark-Lord, in which case there's another casualty. ;)

A lot of Beauxbatons' black marks might be experimental cosmetic Potion or Transfiguration mishaps. Not everyone can be part-Veela, the pressure could be pretty intense.

Edit: Increased the total above, forgot I'd added poor Moira to that list.
