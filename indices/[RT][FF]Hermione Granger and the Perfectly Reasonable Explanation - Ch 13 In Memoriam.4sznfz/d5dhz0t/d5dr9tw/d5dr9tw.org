I think accidentally speaking out loud IRL is probably less correlated with the seriousness of the content than with the level of /surprise/ at the thought - or it least it has been for me personally. Validation would be tricky though - it might be impractical to get a valid statistical sample of people IRL having come to sudden realizations about murders. :)

That said, I admit that bit was likely inspired more by drama than "naturally follows from everything preceding", but it still seemed plausible enough to me.
