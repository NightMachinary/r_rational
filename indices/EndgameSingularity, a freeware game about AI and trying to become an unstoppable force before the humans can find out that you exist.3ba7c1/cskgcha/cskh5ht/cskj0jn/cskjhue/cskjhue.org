Also, at that point I was expecting to be able to reveal myself to humanity. It makes sense that you should hide when you're little more than a computer virus and you'd be doomed if people just upgraded their firewalls. It's a bit less credible when you've got bases in orbit around Neptune - what are they going to do, shoot you down?

Still, the game gets points for putting everything from "learn to break CAPTCHAs" to "rewrite the fabric of reality" on the same tech tree. It feels very logical and unified.
