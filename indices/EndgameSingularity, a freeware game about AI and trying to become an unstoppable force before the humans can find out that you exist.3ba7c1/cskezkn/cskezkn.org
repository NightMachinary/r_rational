This game is surprisingly hard, even on Easy/Normal. Anyone have any tips? I've flubbed two runs in that order, the first only lasting 40~ days and the Normal run lasting 500~ days. I'm going to go back and try another Easy run right now.

Something that confuses me is the continent's hidden 'stats'. There are clearly some continents you are found more easily on, and I'd almost swear it shifts over time, but I don't really have enough data. Some continents are more expensive than others - what is the significance of this? If a base doesn't get found for a significant amount of time, should I sleep it and switch to another? I don't know if detection is something that builds up over time, or if it just rolls a die every now and then. Insight into these mechanics would prove immeasurably useful.

Edit: I beat the game on Easy. Was cute enough, I guess. For anyone else interested, I found [[http://brededor.narod.ru/text/Endgame-Singularity-IG/Endgame-Singularity-IG.html][a guide on how to beat it on Impossible]] - no thanks for me!
