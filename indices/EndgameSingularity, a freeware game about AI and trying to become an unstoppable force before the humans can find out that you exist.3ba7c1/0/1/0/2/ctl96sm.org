They're actually /less/ likely to get caught; the prob is that they only add 1CPU while even a server is 10 - which means even though you get less attention for them, you'll get much more attention from 10 of them than for one server lease, the other way to get 10CPU fast (and that's faster - if more expensive - than 10 hacks).

They're good for one thing: survival. Hack someone and Sleep the CPU to halve its discovery risk, unless you get lucky and it's a gaming Pc (5 CPU).
