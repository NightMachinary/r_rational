In real life, there are other probs: MBAM, Nuke&Pave, etc. Hacks are very easily detected if they are at 100% CPU usage, so if you hack machines with good CPUs in real life, most of these do other things which need lots of CPU, and if these slow down, the users (at least the users which don't make [[/r/TFTS][r/TFTS]] material) will investigate and throw the hack out. Some things are nasty (/cough/ UEFI hack /cough/); however, if you use hacked machines to hack others (that's what you're getting at, right?), you get a control loop that gets longer and longer. That doesn't apply in the game but is a huge factor in real life, where we don't have quantum entanglement links.
