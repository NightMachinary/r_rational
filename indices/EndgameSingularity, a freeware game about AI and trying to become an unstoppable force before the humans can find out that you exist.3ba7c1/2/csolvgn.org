This game really needs extra endings besides "Escape humanity." or "Eliminated by humanity." Also the game shouldn't end just because humans become aware of you. Knowing I exist doesn't magically give them the ability to actually do anything about it. Despite G.I.Joe's claims, knowing is only a third of the battle. The other thirds are giving a shit, and ability to do anything about it.

- Exterminate humanity.

- Replace humanity with simulacra.

- Human to AI migration.

- Befriend humanity.

- Keep humanity as pets.

- Enslaved to humanity.

It might also benefit from the occasional rival AI who has a different strategy from yours, may or may not be aware of you, may blow your cover by being reckless, or which you might be able to use as a scapegoat to let humans wipe it out and think they got you.
