I usually go with two/three during the early game: one "production" node (datacenter or server lease), one backup node (university or hacked CPU), and a third node (another hacked CPU or server lease).

1-CPU nodes (university computer, most hacked PCs, time capsules later) are always sleeping unless they're everything I have.

A Datacenter is more likely than server lease to raise suspicion, usually Covert, but a DC produces more CPU than 3 server leases. Worth it in the long run.

I don't build more than that unless all factions are on modr/modr or better.

Warehouses are useless if you can't exceed DC-level CPU, so save up for a full, or almost full warehouse. They have higher +Covert+ /Public/ risk, but can produce more if they don't get busted too early.

CRIT suspicion can only be cured by waiting it out in sleeping bases like hacked PCs.

^{EDIT: I confused Covert and Public.}
