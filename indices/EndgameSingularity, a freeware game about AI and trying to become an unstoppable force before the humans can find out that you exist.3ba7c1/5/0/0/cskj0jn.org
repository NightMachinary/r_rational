Only things that /really/ look potentially beyond the pale are some of the 'quantum' things (May or may not be breaking the speed of light for communications) and the final couple of 'god-tech' researches you have to do, which involve creating [[http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4609cb6a051a4][basement universes]] and some sort of not-well-defined 'apotheosis' which finally makes you invincible and omnipresent and transdimensional or some shit.

Other than that, the technology tops out at fusion reactors/torchdrives and building underground moon bases, all pretty realistic stuff. Though the timescale seems a little off. Play the game well, and you can go from renting cheap web servers to unraveling the final secrets of the universe in /less than a year./
