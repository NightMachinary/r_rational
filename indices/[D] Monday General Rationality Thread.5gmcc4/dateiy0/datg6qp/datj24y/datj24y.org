The bit about Steelmanning positions you disagree with is pretty important regardless. I had a long conversation last week with a long-time friend of mine who gotten more conservative in the last several years, often in ways I don't really understand of think he's properly thought through.

It got started after he suggested that people who collect more money from the government than they pay in shouldn't be allowed to vote (and yeah, he falls into that category right now, given his current federal student loan balance). I ended up stifling my first response ("are you sure you haven't become an idiot") and instead spent my time split between arguing against his positions, and suggesting that various reasons he claimed he held positions could be made a lot clearer and stronger.

I didn't convince him he was totally wrong (original reason for believing it would be a useful thing was still held), but he did admit "My solution is a fire bomb" and that it was probably likely to cause more problems than it solved.

Was this worth 2 hours of my time? Probably not, although I was only supposed to be working at the time, so ¯_(ツ)_/¯. Still, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere if I hadn't been willing to start by rebuilding parts of his premises-- arguing against "so you're saying poor people shouldn't get a vote?" would have just made him dig in.
