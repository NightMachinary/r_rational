  I have never found it harder to view my political opponents as human than I do now. Every day something new infuriates me, to the point where it's starting to feel completely rational to see people I disagree with as inhuman monsters or brain-dead sheep.

I will not repeat the points that other people have made, but I am compelled to strongly emphasize this: viewing other people as inhuman is often if not always first step on the path to genocide. Whatever else you do, guard yourself against this impulse.
