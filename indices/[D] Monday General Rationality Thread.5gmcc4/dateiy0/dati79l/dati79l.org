Same here, I'm not even American. Every day I see something hatefull on Reddit, I try to understand where they're coming from and I just end up hating them more. I'd love to understand what and why they think what they do, and then disagree with their position because of incompatible values I hold. But even that has proved impossible till now, I simply cannot comprehend their thought processes.
