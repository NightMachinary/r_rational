I think rather than nonhuman, it's probably more healthy to at the very least think of people who aren't as smart as you as childlike. Imagine that stupidity or irrationality is some sort of disease that causes children to stop growing mentally and get stuck with the same level of intellectual and/or emotional maturity. Their bodies get older and they end up getting jobs and responsibilities that perhaps they shouldn't, but people can't read their minds so for the most part can't tell the difference, they can't read other peoples' minds so they can't tell the difference either. So they go around pretending to be adults and they often succeed, but sometimes they don't. Some people make it all the way to adulthood, or "rationality", some people get closer than others.

The point is it's not really their fault. It's not anyone's fault. That's just how they are. It sucks when their condition ends up harming or inconveniencing other people, but it also sucks that a bunch of tax money goes towards modifying structures or paying for healthcare for disabled people. But we don't hate them for it.
