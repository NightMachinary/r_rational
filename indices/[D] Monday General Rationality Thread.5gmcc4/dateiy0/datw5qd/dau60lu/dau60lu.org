That doesn't work. Even if I was comfortable with having such a dim view of people I'm supposed to treat as equal, it encourages me to think of them as mentally deficient and incapable of making good decisions for themselves. I may disagree with what they believe and think they made bad decisions, but to think of them as inherently stupid is not just disrespectful, it's discriminatory.
