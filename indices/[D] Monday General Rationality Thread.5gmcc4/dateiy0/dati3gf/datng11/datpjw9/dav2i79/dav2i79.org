If the Muslim registry does wind up happening (it won't for a variety of reasons, but it's worth thinking about), be sure to sign up. I know I will be.

The idea is that there aren't all that many actual Muslims in the country, and given a population of 320 million, it's entirely possible that we could get more nonmuslims claiming to be Muslim on the registry than actual Muslims, rendering the entire thing worthless. They couldn't even come after you for it as perjury, either, as /technically/ the only thing required to become a Muslim is to say "There is one God and Muhammad is his prophet," and it's impossible to check whether you actually believe that.

Which is another reason it won't happen, actually.
