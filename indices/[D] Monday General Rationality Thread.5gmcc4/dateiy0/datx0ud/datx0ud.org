  What I'm asking is for a way to psychologically survive the current political climate.
#+end_quote

Advice on surviving atomic weapons seems highly applicable: /"The best advice for surviving a nuclear bomb is to be somewhere else when it goes off"./ So it goes with politics. Be somewhere else.

Obsessing over ongoing politics is not /useful/. Our political leaders may act, feel, and look like Cthulhu-spawn hovering perpetually in the skyline, their tentacled monstrosities blotting out the sun, but their actions are distant and their interest is diffuse. The chances of +politics+ Cthulhu reaching out and eating /you/ in particular is vanishing small. Sure, the +current political elite+ Cthulhu and ilk may issue policy decrees from above that could inconvenience you, but then again it might not. There is no single action you can take to change +politicians+ Cthulhu plan's for you, if any even exist. However, if you go intentionally poking at +Republicans+ Cthulhu and his cult-worshippers, that may end badly for you. It is best to just abide Cthulhu's brief reign, and vote for the +Democrats+ Elder Gods in a few years.

Our +politicians+ gods are distant creatures who don't deserve much of your time or interest. They will never go out of their way to aid you, but also, unless you challenge them, they will never go out of their way to crush you either. You are simply made of atoms, which may or may not be a useful configuration for them.
