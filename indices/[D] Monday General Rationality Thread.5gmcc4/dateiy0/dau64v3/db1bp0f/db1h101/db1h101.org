I think people do become more fiscally conservative as they age but not more socially conservative. Also, part of the problem is that minorities are mainly concentrated in urban areas which, considering the electoral college, makes things difficult. But considering that nowadays less than 50% of newborns are white, the Republicans will have to drop some of their more socially conservative issues in order to survive.
