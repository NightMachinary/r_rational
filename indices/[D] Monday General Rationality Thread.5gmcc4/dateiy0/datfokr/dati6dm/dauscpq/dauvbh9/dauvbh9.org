  Meditate on this: would you rather that rash of hate crimes actually exist, or not? Emotionally, would you be more gratified to be right about Trump supporters? Or wrong?

I'd really rather that the attacks don't actually exist, and I'd be far more gratified to be wrong about incipient fascism (which is a separate thing from merely voting Trump). When it's /my/ life on the line, I'd damn well prefer less violence.
