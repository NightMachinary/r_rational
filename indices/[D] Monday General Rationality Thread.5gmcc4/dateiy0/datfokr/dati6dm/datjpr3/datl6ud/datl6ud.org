I try to only follow reliable, mainstream news too. I live in a safe "bubble" of Sanctuary Cities in Massachusetts, and I have up-to-date passports to leave if necessary.

But when I hear about hate crimes in New York, my city of birth, against Muslims and Jews, I get very worried. Chasing a woman from her metro train because she was wearing a hijab is bad, and nobody stopping the perpetrator before the police could be called is worse.

One terrorist attack on the level of Orlando or San Bernardino is going to be all the excuse the new government needs to suppress innocent people's human rights for security theater. We're going to be asked to be afraid and hateful rather than safe, and the state is going to try to direct some of the blame towards those of us objecting to the new policies.
