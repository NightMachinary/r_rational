I have never found it harder to view my political opponents as human than I do now. Every day something new infuriates me, to the point where it's starting to feel completely rational to see people I disagree with as inhuman monsters or brain-dead sheep. I used to despise the vitriol that has pervaded politics, yet now I embrace it and can't convince myself that it isn't warranted even when I know it's irrational.

My anxiety and depression are having a field day nearly every day. I'm either too worried to sleep or too cynical to get out of bed. This isn't just because of the news, this is due to actual civil discussions with people who I disagree with. No matter how hard I try, I can't find a middle ground and just end up hating them more. They probably feel the same way, but that just makes me more worried and cynical about politics.

I'm not asking for a way to reach an agreement with my opponents, that's a pipe dream right now. What I'm asking is for a way to psychologically survive the current political climate. I'm obsessing over every controversy and its eating at me. I can't go on like this, but I can't stop caring about politics and I can't stop myself from feeling the way I do. Is there any way to escape this incredibly unhealthy situation?

Before you suggest it, I'm already looking for a therapist.
