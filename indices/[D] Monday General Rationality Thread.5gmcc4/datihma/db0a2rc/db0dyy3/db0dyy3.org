OpenAI Universe? I think that connectionism and reinforcement learning are the wrong approach to AI, but I do agree with much of what's [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/md2/the_brain_as_a_universal_learning_machine/][written here]] about the potential to use video-games as a relatively safe training environment for increasingly general learners.

/That said/, if you had some proper solution to naturalized induction (building in naturalist reductionism as an /a priori/ mode of thought for the AI rather than an /a posteriori/ conclusion given certain data), it would still be potentially dangerous to train your agent in that kind of environment. Maybe? I can imagine ways it would be, and I would not want to try it without lots of safety assurances.
