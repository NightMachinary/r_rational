I didn't do it /just/ for the joke...

There's some evidence that using blue-tinted lenses can have interesting effects on the brain, including the potential for reducing migraines and accelerating recovery from them. I've had migraines, on occasion, and they suck, so if wearing odd-coloured lenses can fend them off, I'm willing to set my schedule to have a blue shift by day, and red shift by night.
