There is no 'correct' answer. I'm fine with the compromise where we draw a line at 20ish weeks, and don't limit it before that.

I also think abortion is icky and costs money. Since I'm in favour of universal, tax funded health care, I dislike wasting money. So people should use birth control and not be stupid, but then most women obviously don't go through abortions for fun, so. Condoms and other forms of birth control should be free and readily available. Such a program would pay for itself through fewer abortions and fewer unwanted children.

I also think we should allow late term abortions if we discover something wrong with the fetus, but that's just me.

Life begins... I mean, it's alive at conception, but so is your appendix. It ends when resurrection becomes impossible.
