Even though it is illegal to force people to donate blood or organs, and even though it's the smartest policy to have, I'm not certain it's the most ethical outcome.

If some omniscient benevolent agent told me that I had to donate blood or someone would die, that there was no third option, and I said no with no particular counterargument, I think it would actually be ethical for that agent to forcibly extract blood from me in order to save the life. However, when talking about governments and companies and anyone else who might be interested in managing such a process, we know they're not omniscient and benevolent. It's awfully dangerous to give someone the institutional power to violate your bodily autonomy if you aren't very sure that they won't abuse it.

With abortion, the situation is significantly different. At least, if you're considering the particular fetus a person it's significantly different. When the procedure is all about ending the life of the fetus, the odds that forcing a woman to carry the fetus to term saves a life exactly equals the odds that the fetus would survive through birth. As for benevolence, that's solved by the nature of the situation. If a malicious entity had the power to force people to donate organs, they could abuse that to target people they don't like and force them to undergo surgery and loss of an organ. Regarding pregnant women, the only entity who can potentially decide who has to undergo the pregnancy is the father, so there's no risk of the government or another such entity choosing a woman and forcing a pregnancy on her.

All in all, the reasons why it should be illegal to force organ donations don't hold up when aborting a fetus considered a person. Instead, the ethical situation would indeed boil down to whether one person's right to bodily autonomy overrides the other's right to live at all. Personally, though, I'm hoping that this will only be a question for a short while, until we have the technology to grow a fetus to sustainability inside an incubator so that instead of aborting the fetus the woman can just get it taken out of her and given up for adoption when it reaches the age it can survive at.
