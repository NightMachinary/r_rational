  such a law could still have serious terrible corner case potential, and we won't know about those corner cases until some poor girl commits suicide or something else awful happens which the writers of the law didn't foresee.

Much of criminal law has terrible corner cases. Should those corner cases outweigh the harm prevented in the vast majority of normal cases. Does that pregnant girl committing suicide negate all the "unborn yet feeling babies" (named for the sake of argument) saved by preventing a non-trivial amount of women from deciding to have a late abortion?

The argument in favor of legalizing late term abortions must be a stronger one than just "what if something very specific happens to a single person". Especially in any system that uses jury trials.
