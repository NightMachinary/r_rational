Yeah, but how does a system of laws measure that?

That's my ultimate issue with this whole thing, actually. Laws are a lot like programming languages for governments, and the problem with both of those is that the computer or government will always do exactly what you tell it to do (more or lesss), regardless of if that makes sense. And, as the good folks at MIRI have proven, it's really, really hard to tell a computer "figure out what the right thing to do is, then do as much of that as possible."

Laws are attempts to codify human morality just as much as Yudkowsky's attempts to do so, and they get it wrong a lot. Of course, governments aren't practically omnipotent FAIs, so the impact of laws being wrong isn't as terrible, but they are similar. Since we can't get it right every time, we have to write laws which are either sufficiently lax as to provide human leeway in situations where they obviously (to human eyes) should, or to write laws which are strict, but narrow enough to avoid terrible outcomes most of the time.

That's where abortion legislation comes in. If you write a law that says 'no abortions past 28 weeks ever,' that has obvious problems. But if you write a law that says 'no abortion past 28 weeks unless the life of the mother is in danger, or the mother was raped/incested, or the baby is malformed and is dead/will die or have serious problems,' such a law could /still/ have serious terrible corner case potential, and we won't know about those corner cases until some poor girl commits suicide or something else awful happens which the writers of the law didn't foresee.

So. You have to make laws which are really lax, which give both doctors and patients the tools necessary to make the right decisions for everyone involved (including hypothetical future people), and you just can't do that by agreeing to the draconian terms set by evangelicals. Because they believe in souls and that blastocysts have them, which is not a position you can argue them out of.

And besides, in the US the vast majority of abortions are performed before the 20 week mark anyway, well before any scientist would tell you that the fetus was meaningfully sapient. The vast majority of the ones performed after that mark are done for medical reasons, which no reasonable person would argue against either. The whole 'woman at 30 weeks doesn't like being fat any more' situation just doesn't happen at any significant rate, and doctors basically everywhere are empowered to refuse such requests when they do come up.
