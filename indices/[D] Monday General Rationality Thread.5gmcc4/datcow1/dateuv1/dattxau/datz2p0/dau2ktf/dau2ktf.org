  you're saying that the rights of potential people in the future are more important than the rights of actual people now

If they were the /same/ rights - if it were a choice between the mother's survival and the baby's survival - then I wouldn't object to choosing the mother.

If you're weighing the mother's /convenience/ against the baby's survival, though, then I would certainly give priority to the baby's right to live, even if you consider it to be only, say, 50% sentient at the time.
