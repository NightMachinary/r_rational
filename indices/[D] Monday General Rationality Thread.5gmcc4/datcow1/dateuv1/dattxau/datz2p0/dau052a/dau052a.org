Even if it is easier, though, it's not an answer. If we are to believe that morality has some objective grounding to it, that the question of whether fetuses have rights or not does not depend on whether we think they do or not, then fetuses could be people. and based on that, if we assume fetuses aren't people we could be slaughtering people by the millions because it's /easier/. In order to support abortion, you must either be confident that fetuses are not people or be willing to say that you didn't care if they were people or not, since it was easier to kill them than to let them live.

I don't have a concrete metric of what makes a person. You've admitted that you don't either. I'm not willing to support abortion if it means I'm risking supporting the deaths of millions of people for the sake of convenience.
