Honestly, the one child policy sounds really reasonable if we do end up facing crippling overpopulation. But even then, the amount of aborted children, while massive, is not a very significant impact on global population. When you say that we should support abortion because of the risk of resource wars, I would say that it is extremely unlikely that the amount of aborted babies would make the difference between resource wars happening or not happening.

And that assumes the resource wars would happen like that. China did its one child policy, I wouldn't be opposed to something similar if overpopulation does become an issue. Overall, I think that resource wars are an unlikely thing to happen, and that the more likely alternative is for these resources to begin to cost more as alternative but more expensive sources become needed (think fresh water from desalination) and the cost of living goes up, quality of life goes down, but nothing apocalyptic, and most likely nothing worth throwing aside any and all ethical considerations of abortion for a tiny chance that the change in birth rate would matter.
