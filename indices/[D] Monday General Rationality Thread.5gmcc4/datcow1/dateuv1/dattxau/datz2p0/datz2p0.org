And all of /that/ is why it's easier to just say that fetuses aren't as human as their adult mothers, and that therefore they do not deserve the same rights as a full human would, which is also a conclusion that can be borne of evidence.

Abortion opponents say that fetuses can feel pain. I don't doubt that, but so do cows, and you'd be hard pressed to find a vegetarian pro-lifer. Cows even seem to have complex feelings and personalities, and I still don't feel too bad about eating them because my neurology isn't designed to feel bad about eating nonhuman things. If your threshold for sufficiently human is "feels pain," then you can't in good conscience use mousetraps.

They say that things which have the potential to be human are human. You can say that, but then you're saying that the rights of potential people in the future are more important than the rights of actual people now, and that really quickly spirals down a logical rabbit hole ending in enslaving the entire human population to construct a utopian future because a greater number of people will enjoy it than be harmed in the process.

Other, less rigorous arguments such as keying humanity off having human DNA are even more spurious. Cancer cells have human DNA. Chimpanzees are 98% human, genetically, does that mean they should have 98% of the rights? Or are you arbitrarily cutting it off somewhere? What about people with chromosomal disorders, whose genetic code is actually different from most humans?

There just isn't a non-arbitrary means of defining when something goes from non-human and not deserving of human rights to fully human. There's obviously a point where it /should/ happen, but it's a philosophical problem and not a scientific one. So the easiest thing to do is just keep doing what we've been doing forever and define human as having been born. Much easier, doesn't create awful corner cases like pregnant cancer patients dying for lack of chemotherapy, is what we would instinctually do anyway.
