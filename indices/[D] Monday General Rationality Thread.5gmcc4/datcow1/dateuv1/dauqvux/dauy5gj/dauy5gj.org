Many political ideologies distinguish between different contexts when it comes to rights. American liberals tend to favor social autonomy but economic collectivism, while conservatives tend to favor the opposite. Health and safety are yet another context that is usually considered separately from others. Libertarians and authoritarians are the only ideologies I've seen that apply the same basic philosophy to every context.
