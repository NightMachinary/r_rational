I support abortion because it's a question of autonomy. You don't force someone to adopt a child then why should it be different for childbirth? No one benefits from being saddled with an unwanted offspring, neither the parents nor the child. So it's best to end the foetus rather than make it live a life of misery. They aren't self-aware yet, you aren't committing murder. Albeit it would be better to take precautions and avoid unwanted pregnancy altogether.
