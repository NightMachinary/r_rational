Um... your argument has a severe problem.

Consider, by analogy, the death penalty. Sometimes people are ordered to be killed by a court for some offense (such as murder). So, the court needs to calculate the risk of someone staying alive in some manner.

And yes, the court's system of adjudicating who gets to live and who gets to die will, on occasion, lead to some fairly drastic mistakes (and has done so in the past). But the solution is /not/ to give the victim of any crime a gun and ten consequence-free minutes alone with the accused, because that will lead to even /more/ mistakes being made.

Similarly, just giving abortions to anyone who asks is certain to lead to /more/ mistakes than actually making the attempt to decide who does or does not get to abort. No system of decision will be perfect, but it's not hard to be better than not having a system at all.
