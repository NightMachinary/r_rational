You made my argument better than I did. My point was that there is a tradeoff, like in the death penalty you might let some criminals live to prevent wrongly convicted innocents from dying, or vice-versa, depending on your values. If you value the lives of innocents more than retribution to criminals (like we do) then death penalty will be either not allowed or be severely restricted.

The relative value of a woman's life vs an unborn's life is less clear, because they are both very valuable depending on who you ask. If you ask me the woman is more valuable and it's better that 10 safe unborn die rather from abortion than 1 woman die from some complication caused by a pregnancy wrongly considered safe. Other people have different values and reach different conclusions.
