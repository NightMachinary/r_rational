The devil is in the details. You accept abortions for medical necessity but not for convenience. How much risk do you think would constitute a necessity? Fifty percent chance of complications? Five percent? Also who calculates that risk and how?

In the end I think any system of adjudicating who gets to abort and who does not will end up making mistakes. It might be worth it to just give abortions to anyone who asks, paying the cost of some abortions for bad reasons to prevent the cost of denying abortions for bad reasons.
