I'm for legal abortion, and personally think anyone who cares about less abortions should focus on improving contraception availability and sex-ed first. If they don't, their arguments for being anti-abortion is mostly just faith-based beliefs and virtue signalling rather than a thought-out, careful examination of the data and ethics involved.

The reason arguments about the sanctity of life don't apply to potential people, aka fetuses, for me, is that people who make such arguments rarely ever seem to consider the potential-potential people that abortions bring into being.

Maybe because it seems too abstract for most, but for me it's anything but. My mom had two pregnancies before my older brother and I were born. If those two pregnancies had gone to term, my brother and I wouldn't exist. My parents wanted two kids, and they got two kids.

Sometimes I wonder about my potential siblings, and sure, in a perfect world all four of us would exist and live our lives together and no one would go hungry or struggle to pay the bills as a result of having 4 kids when you could barely afford 2, but in the real world I'm pretty happy with being alive and think it was sensible for my parents to wait until they could afford kids.
