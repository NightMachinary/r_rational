I meant to say that the analogy of "Just say no," which is "abstinence," doesn't work, while the better analogy, meaning the one that does apply, is the one comparing condoms and sterile needles.

I don't actually know if "Just say no" fails at the same level that "Abstinence" does, but if it does, we should similarly stop investing time and money into it.
