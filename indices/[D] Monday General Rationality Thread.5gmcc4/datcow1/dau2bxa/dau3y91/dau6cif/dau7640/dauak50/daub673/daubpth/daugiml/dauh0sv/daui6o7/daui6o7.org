  it's specifically about pregnancy, the chance of STDs, and the ways to avoid both.

No, same definition here. I just distinguish between education about them vs promoting increased access to them.

#+begin_quote
  I really don't see what the better option is.

Like I said, it's more a difference of emphasis than of principle. Yes, I think it's important for people to know about their options; but for those not yet in a permanently-committed relationship, I would always /recommend/ the "wait" option. If someone isn't going to take that advice, then yes, they're less likely to cause themselves long-term problems by reducing the risk of unwanted pregnancy, but in that case, we've already established that they weren't taking my advice anyway...
