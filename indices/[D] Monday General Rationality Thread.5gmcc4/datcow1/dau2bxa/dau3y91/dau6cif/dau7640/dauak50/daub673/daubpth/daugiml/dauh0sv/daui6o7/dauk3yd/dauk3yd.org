  No, same definition here. I just distinguish between education about them vs promoting increased access to them.

The education itself is actually important too, distinct from the information about contraceptives. Believe it or not, there are quite a lot of people, teenagers and older, who engage in sex without actually understanding how pregnancy occurs, or how STDs are spread, and even the most basic things that can help avoid it.

  Like I said, it's more a difference of emphasis than of principle. Yes, I think it's important for people to know about their options; but for those not yet in a permanently-committed relationship, I would always recommend the "wait" option. If someone isn't going to take that advice, then yes, they're less likely to cause themselves long-term problems by reducing the risk of unwanted pregnancy, but in that case, we've already established that they weren't taking my advice anyway...

Agreed, on a one-on-one basis, I'm more likely to advise against random, casual encounters, especially for the very young. But as an educational policy and for use of government funds, abstinence-education has been proven repeatedly to be less effective in reducing pregnancies and STDs, and as far as I'm aware, hasn't shown to significantly reduce the time until first intercourse.
