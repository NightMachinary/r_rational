  Actually, no, I only said that about contraceptive use.

Ahh, sorry, we were operating off different definitions: you don't consider sex-ed a form of contraceptive practice, I take it, whereas to me the two go hand-in-hand. Sex-ed isn't "This is how to arouse your partner and achieve a mind-blowing orgasm," after all: it's specifically about pregnancy, the chance of STDs, and the ways to avoid both.

  And more specifically, reliance on contraceptives in such a way that it increases sexual activity. If that hasn't been the case in the cited studies, great. It can happen and has happened in other places at other times, as some of your own links show, which makes me wary.

Again, "increased sexual activity" should only matter if that's a separate value you want to address in the argument. If the point is to reduce abortion rates and STD rates, then obviously sexual activity is a factor, but it shouldn't count as a negative on its own.

  Well, I just never think it's actually safe, you know?
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I get what you mean by this. Unless you mean it the same way you might say "I just never think riding a roller-coaster is actually safe," in which case, true, but at what point does a small enough possibility of danger become not worth worrying about?

Again, not speaking from the perspective of someone who engaged in casual sex (or rides roller-coasters, for that matter) but we're talking about these things as a matter of social policy, not personal life choices.

  I'm OK with (age-appropriate) education about the nature and efficacy of various contraceptive methods, but I couldn't go so far as to endorse them to any audience that would have serious problems if those methods failed.
#+end_quote

When the most popular alternative (ignoring the issue, or telling people to just not have casual sex and hoping they don't) has been proven to be less effective, I really don't see what the better option is.
