  should focus on improving contraception availability and sex-ed first

Does it count if I belong to a church that promotes abstinence before marriage?

I'm not convinced that contraceptive availability is actually a good solution. The primary target is those who are not yet prepared for children (as you said yourself), most especially teenagers, and it's an inevitable fact that if teenagers even pay attention to the existence of contraceptives and use them, some (many?) of them will feel free to engage in more casual sex, with more partners, as a result - and then you get STDs, contraceptive failure rates, etc. And that's not even beginning to consider the psychological/emotional ramifications.

If contraceptives were an unambiguous good, I'd promote them, and I don't flatly object to them, but in the context of preventing unwanted pregnancies among those who might otherwise abort, I see them as incentivising a behavior that /remains quite risky/.
