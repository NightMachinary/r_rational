Personally I like the Peter Singer point of view. I think it does a very interesting thing to the "but where do you draw the line" argument - he draws it /after/ birth, not before. Here's a summary of it: [[http://lightupthedarkness.net/peter-singer-the-ethics-of-infanticide/]]

Peter Singer is all about seperating /personhood/ from /humanity/. A /person/ is a being that has preferences, desires, etc - say a cow, pig, goat, dog, cat, galah, human, chimp, dolphin, or porcupine. A human is a member of the species /homo sapiens/. In ethics, he says you should care about people.

I like it for three main reasons:

1. A one week old baby, to me, is less of a sentient being than a fully grown cow is. A dairy cow will mourn her calf when it gets taken away; a week old baby really seems to be food-in-poop-out.

2. It bites the bullet that although a zygote is /human/, it's not yet a /person/.

3. It says abortion is OK because infanticide is OK.

Now, this doesn't mean that I can go to visit a newborn baby in hospital and snap her neck and that's ethical; her parents would no doubt be distraught by this, and her parents are people who should have their preference for not having their baby murdered satisfied. So you can't just go murdering babies left and right, but that's because of the /parents/ rather than the babies themselves.

But say me and my husband have a baby and we find out upon birth that it has a rare condition that will result in it being confined to a bed for its short life. So we think long and hard about it and are making a considered, rational decision, can't we make the decision to give this baby (humane) euthanasia rather than let it live such a life?

As for where to draw the line, I'm not sure. I'm not a baby-ologist and it's never going to come up as I don't see infanticide legalised any time soon. I would say two years old is *definitely* old enough to be safe from my infanticidal ways. Probably the line would be somewhere around 1-6 months, but leave that for the babyologists.

I feel it would be remiss of me not to add that, by the way, I'm a woman with a functional uterus as I suspect the vast majority of people in this already very crowded thread cannot say the same thing.
