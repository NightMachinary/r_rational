I disagree that you need full sentences in order to determine sentience. Partial sentences and even one word expressions can often be enough of a sign that there is an independent agent with experience, goals, learning capabilities and the ability to recognize their own existence. Then there are cases like severe autism which prevent talking but still leave skills and abilities that very clearly denote some form of sentience. To think otherwise is to assume that every non-cooperative human that doesn't speak your language is not a person, something that would go against overwhelming evidence.
