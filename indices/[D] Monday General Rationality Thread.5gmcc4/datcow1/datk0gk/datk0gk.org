I think that abortion should be completely legal during the first trimester, and strongly discouraged though perhaps not entirely criminalized afterward (with emphasis on adoption if a late-term baby is no longer desired). With some late-term exceptions for life of the mother and extreme or fatal fetal defects.

My criteria include the mental development of the fetus and the value of the future person. In the early stages, a fetus is a potential person but without mental life, and I don't think unconscious potential people automatically have the right to be instantiated. Later on, the fetus acquires more and more mental attributes, and these should be considered valuable. Even though we slaughter animals all the time which are probably even more conscious, there is still an argument to be made that a proto-human should be valued more strongly than an animal due to the person it could grow up to be (whereas an animal will not exceed a certain limited capacity of mind). Since I don't believe in infanticide, and I don't believe in making arbitrary distinctions between a fully-formed baby inside and outside the womb, I am forced to conclude that late-term abortions are just as wrong as killing babies. (Whereas early term abortions are just as wrong as using contraceptives, that is, not at all).

Regardless of the other issues, I think all abortions are unaesthetic and should be generally discouraged, especially through contraception, although we should also try our hardest to not stigmatize women who have had abortions. Doing both of these things at the same time seems difficult, however.
