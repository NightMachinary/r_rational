If you assume the first argument to be valid (i.e. AI is very powerful), doesn't that also serve as an argument for an Ethical Path to immortality? If AI is so powerful, it shouldn't need to resort to unethical research in the first place.

You can turn this around: if AI isn't powerful enough to ethically research human immortality, maybe it wouldn't be powerful enough to quickly colonise the solar system.
