*The Problem of Having Children*

As soon as we have strong friendly AI (plus travel time), we should be able to have a large presence elsewhere in the solar system and the galaxy. Definitely much sooner than the timeframe of filling up the Earth with children.

I think you're underestimating the strength of an AI that can make humans immortal.

*The Problem of Ethical Paths to Immortality*

Assuming utilitarianism, the calculation of lost life years versus gained life years from immortality is pretty simply in favor of immortality.

It's a bit more difficult to show in other morality systems.
