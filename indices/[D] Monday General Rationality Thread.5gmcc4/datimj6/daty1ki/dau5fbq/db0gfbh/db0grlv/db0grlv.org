I'm on a mobile so I can't link right now, but India's had some success with paying people to be sterilized.

I'm also fine, in this scenario, with switching out tax breaks for children with additional tax burdens for children. I'm not totally sure how well it would work, since nobody has ever done such a thing, but increasing taxes on e.g. cigarettes leads to decreased consumption.
