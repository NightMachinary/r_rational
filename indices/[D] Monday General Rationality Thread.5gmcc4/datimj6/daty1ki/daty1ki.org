The Problem of Having Children

Well, assuming that I'm the All-Powerful God King of Everything and can enforce this, you could mandate sterilization as part of the immortality process. Worst-case scenario is non-exponential growth as each generation has exactly one batch of children and then becomes immortal, leading to somewhere between three and twenty billion more people per year. I'm confident that our technology would increase fast enough to keep up with the expansion, especially if (as we would if I were God-Emperor) we abolished parking lots, minimum floor spaces for dwellings, and about nine-tenths of our zoning regulations.

The Problem of Ethical Paths to Immortality

Absent moralizers making everything unnecessarily complicated, economics would solve this problem. For example, if you allowed people to take debts with their lives as collateral, I'm confident we'd have plenty of (admittedly short-sighted) volunteers in short order. Unfortunately, we're far too quick to take away fundamental freedoms in the pursuit of coating everything on Earth in metaphorical bubble-wrap, so instead we'll have to rely on dumb luck or black swan technologies.
