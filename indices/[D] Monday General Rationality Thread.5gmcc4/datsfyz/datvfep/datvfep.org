Just as a FYI, a couple days ago I wrote around 200 words, the other day I wrote ~800, and yesterday I wrote ~1600. Not quite as good as my initial 4k/day sprints, but outside of my depressive bout last week, I think I'm making progress. And just today I got a review on the draft that included the phrase "I got a serious case of existential dread", which is giving me some pride in my accomplishment-so-far and motivation to finish the job.

That said, I do know I could be doing better, so if anyone's got a reasonable idea (with the limit for "reasonable" being defined as somewhere inside the realm of "doesn't negatively impact the resources I need for my physical survival"), I'm willing to entertain such notions, and am well-disposed to going along with them.
