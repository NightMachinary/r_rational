I generally don't have a problem with such distractions while I'm in the middle of a day's writing. It's more staying in the habit of /starting/ to do some writing every day, and arranging the timing so I can keep writing for a few hours without interruptions. Particularly when I've hit a depressive bout; I kept chugging along pretty good on my own for most of November, and am trying to kick my own tail to get back into that same habit again, though right now I feel like I'm one of those cartoon cars with the stuttering engines.
