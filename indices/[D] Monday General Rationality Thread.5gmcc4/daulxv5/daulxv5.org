*Red Eyes At Night, Sleeper's Delight?*

It's said that cutting down on the amount of blue light your eyes see before you try to fall asleep can help you get to sleep faster. I've been using an [[http://www.dx.com/p/marsing-r3-e27-3w-200lm-cob-led-rgb-bulb-w-remote-control-white-90-260v-331312][RGB light bulb]] set to 'red' and the [[http://jonls.dk/redshift/][Redshift app]] on my computer; and just today in the mail, I received my brand-new pair of [[http://www.zennioptical.com/550011-metal-alloy-full-rim-frame-with-spring-hinge][prescription glasses]] with reddish-tinted lenses ($10 for the frames, $5 for the tinting, $10 for shipping a half-dozen different pairs).

In other words - in order to sleep more soundly, I'm literally looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses.
