I'm seeing a therapist/psychologist on Wednesday for the same reason.

Our opponents are human, but they're humans operating under optimism bias, tribal thinking biases, and probably very low signal precision. All the intelligence in the world doesn't mitigate the basic limitations built into our cognitive architecture.

Try to stay safe and sane. Keep an eye out for the degradation of social and legal norms that protect us common citizens from authoritarian leaders and mob hatred. Resist the degradation of those norms. Try to agitate, educate, and organize the ordinary people around you: we need a more active civil society and activist corps now than ever.

Keep your friends, loved ones, and coworkers close. Support the civil institutions you can: reliable news, civil liberties advocates, labor organizations.

And frankly, look for ways to leave the country or protect yourself physically if necessary. If you're in computers like a lot of people here, work visas to other countries can sometimes be had by finding a job abroad. I was looking at New Zealand's immigration website last night and saw that they offer some visa options for youngish, educated software and hardware engineers.

Hate and fear are negative emotions: they signal to our brains, /get away from this state and causal trajectory/, or /destroy that influence over your causal trajectory/. As such, they don't give precise information: we already know to avoid this situation, but we're here nonetheless. Figure out a positive program for your life, something that puts you on a safer, more dignified causal trajectory, and work towards that, both personally and politically. Positive programs are more statistically precise, and even angry, afraid people on "the other side" like to talk about them. Remember, for instance, that the same Rust Belt communities who supported Donald Trump also supported Bernie Sanders.

Lastly, I'd be open towards starting a collective rationalist Patreon or whatever towards funding people's travel expenses to safer places in these dangerous times. I didn't fund MultiBuffer's escape from Russia when I had the opportunity, and now I regret that.
