... For an instant, I thought you said "to Russia" and my mind was blown.

Also, I think you're being a bit pessimistic. I don't think the USA are going to become some 1933-Germany-style fascist nightmare in the next few years. I don't know quite how to make that point, because I'm not actually /that/ confident and "things are going to be mostly fine" really, really sounds like "I'm sheltered and I'm burying my head in the sand" to anxious people. The USA are a very stable, powerful country, with a lot of "not turning into an autocracy and trying to treat minorities better" inertia. There are reasons to be afraid, but, probably not physically afraid; if you're in a peaceful neighbourhood, then your life isn't in danger, and neither is your livelihood.
