We'll see. Rationally I judge that we're not going to end up in 1933 for a while, but ending up like Putin's Russia or authoritarian-capitalist China is not /that much/ better.

And frankly, whatever reasons I don't have for being physically afraid, black people, non-passig Hispanics, and Muslims /are/ in real, physical danger, and they're only one or two places in front of me in the danger queue.

What is human is /mine/, and so when anyone in the same community is injured by a hateful force, I know that I'm next.
