Okay, this might seem incredibly ignorant and epistemically irrational, but to maintain my mental health and productivity I've consciously secluded myself from all the information about politics except what is on the reddit frontpage, in the mainstream news sites I check or rationalisty sites. For example, I've unfollowed everyone on Facebook who talks about politics. Why? Because I'll be able to do much more good if I stay mentally stable, productive and nondistracted. But it's important to note I don't live in the States and the situation over there might be much more dire, so I can't even suggest you take my approach.

I'd kinda like to hear a summary of what has happened, why the situation is so dire (I read your longer post), and what evidence you base your belief on.
