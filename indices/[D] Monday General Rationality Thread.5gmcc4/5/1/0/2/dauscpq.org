Consider looking into some of that rash. [[http://www.forbes.com/sites/maureensullivan/2016/11/29/are-there-really-more-hate-crimes-at-schools-following-donald-trumps-election/#420010d188ef][Here's an example]]. Much of it is unverified heresay in situations where someone really ought to have had a cellphone. Remember, the ADL's list involved /absolutely no vetting/. An increasing number are now admitted hoaxes from your fellow travelers, which should not be surprising considering how many of the high profile hate crimes of the last decade have turned out the same way. /This is a good thing/. There's reason to believe that we now have more demand for hate than supply. That there are more people whose self-image relies on being a stalwart defender against hate than there are vicious haters. Meditate on this: would you rather that rash of hate crimes actually exist, or not? Emotionally, would you be more gratified to be right about Trump supporters? Or wrong?

And while the vitriol spewing from this election's losers is certainly extreme, it's much more likely to produce a trip to a therapist than to a gun shop. And there's reason to be optimistic that agitators and activists have reached a saturation point for how much divisiveness and rancor they can gin up.
