Well, "rational" is just a word we use to describe actions that are most likely to achieve one's values and methods of thinking most likely to form true beliefs. If it's irrational to hate everybody who disagrees with you politically (which it definitely is), that means that something you believe is false which is making you hate them. Have you always been as rational, ethically-minded and unsheep-like as you are now? I wasn't until I started reading rationalist literature and drastically improved my diet.

It's not the sheep's fault that they're sheep. Or rather, it's their fault but they don't know that it's their fault and it's not their fault that they don't know that it's their fault, and because of that it's going to be really hard for them to change.

Also, how many political opinions do you have which you have researched thoroughly and which you understand very well? Have you tried steelmanning positions you disagree with? And in regards to /very specific/ positions that you disagree with, what evidence would you need to see to believe that you are wrong and they are right? Because there always needs to be hypothetical evidence that would change your mind if you saw it. For instance, if single-celled organisms were found to have social interactions and civilization, that evidence would make it much more likely to me that the supernatural concept of a "soul" exists, and that human zygotes have them and are therefore sapient beings.

If I saw such evidence, it would probably be single celled organisms that acted like this:

But my point is that there's always the chance that you're wrong about something. So it doesn't make sense to base your judgement of other people's or your own sanity merely on what their/your political opinions are.

What specific political opinions do you hate people for holding, and why?
