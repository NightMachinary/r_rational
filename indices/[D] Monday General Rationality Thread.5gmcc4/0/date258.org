[[http://lesswrong.com/lw/70u/rationality_lessons_learned_from_irrational/][So, this is one of the funniest things]] ever written on Less Wrong in terms of how much I laughed when I read it:

  So I broke up with Alice over a long conversation that included an hour-long primer on evolutionary psychology in which I explained how natural selection had built me to be attracted to certain features that she lacked. I thought she would appreciate this because she had previously expressed admiration for detailed honesty. Now I realize that there's hardly a /more/ damaging way to break up with someone. She asked that I kindly never speak to her again, and I can't blame her.

But later on I began to think about this in light of my own break-up experiences, especially the detailed honesty thing, since I'm a firm believer in honesty, especially in romantic relationships.

It's not the detailed honesty that was bad, it was the way Luke did it. It has to be done with good intentions. When you give honest critique of someone, it has to be about something important and you have to make sure that the other person really benefits from it. This is why it's often advised when giving critique that you pepper it with good things about the person or what the person did as to make sure that you don't devastate the other person and she gets the feeling that you still accept her as a person.

By â€˜certain features' Luke probably meant her body, and there are many things about our bodies that we cannot really change. So, talking detailedly for an hour (hours?) about something she can't change feels incredibly cruel to me, and it's not really even useful for her. (Note, this was about 10 years ago, Luke is probably much wiser now.)

On the other hand, I was really glad that when we broke up with my last girlfriend, she told me honestly and even detailedly what she thought were the reasons for this break-up. There were several things: I couldn't keep things that were supposed to stay between us from going to other people, she felt that sometimes we didn't really understand each other and I sometimes hurt her about things she was sensitive about. We and I tried to foster an environment of honesty in our relationship, even about critique. All the time we talked about why we should break up, I was really glad she talked about it so honestly because these are the kind of things I could change and have since changed about my behavior when interacting with potential partners and friends later on. And of course it was also due to the way she did it, which is totally opposite from how Luke did it.

This is what I believe even though I also believe that when we describe why we feel the way we do, those descriptions don't usually capture the whole picture or the real reason for those feelings. [[http://www.people.virginia.edu/%7Etdw/wilson,advances.1989.pdf][See this study.]] In the case of our break-up, I think the real reason was something like I wasn't accustomed enough to behave like people behaved in her social sphere and I wasn't confident or high status enough at the end of our relationship -- not literally, but something along those lines. Still, that doesn't change the fact that her critique benefited me.
