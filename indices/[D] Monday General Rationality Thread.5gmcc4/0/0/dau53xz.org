You know, it's funny you post that today--for several reasons. First, it /is/ already funny by itself. Second, I've done that (or something quite similar) before, and it went about as well as you'd expect. I had the best of intentions: I just wanted to show how our relationship had become toxic to both us and our friend group, but in hindsight it was a bad move. Finally, I took this into account on this very day, as a friend confessed to fancying me (though, to be fair, I had long since worked it out).

Basically, all this to say, I enjoyed the read and found it quite relevant to my current situation.
