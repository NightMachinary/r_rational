  Does it count if I belong to a church that promotes abstinence before marriage?

No, if anything that makes things worse, since it seems to go hand-in-hand with denying the value of sex-ed and contraceptive availability :P Meaning, it's still about faith in a deontological belief, not an examination of the data and consequences of that belief.

  I'm not convinced that contraceptive availability is actually a good solution. The primary target is those who are not yet prepared for children (as you said yourself), most especially teenagers, and it's an inevitable fact that if teenagers even pay attention to the existence of contraceptives and use them, some (many?) of them will feel free to engage in more casual sex, with more partners, as a result - and then you get STDs, contraceptive failure rates, etc. And that's not even beginning to consider the psychological/emotional ramifications.

If there's anything that decades of abstinence-only education in the most religious states has shown, it's that casual sex is going to happen anyway. Whether it increases or decreases by some minor amount doesn't really interest me.

What does is the notion that somehow the introduction of sex-ed and contraception /increases/ the rates of pregnancy and STD spread, when the best evidence I've seen says the opposite. Some quick googling:

[[https://www.guttmacher.org/about/journals/ipsrh/2003/03/relationships-between-contraception-and-abortion-review-evidence]]

There's tons more out there. As far as I'm aware there's no evidence that doesn't come from blatantly religious sources that doesn't show a reduction in pregnancies and STDs due to improved access to contraception and sex-ed, not just in the USA but in every country where they've been introduced.

If you have any evidence that you think shows the opposite, please feel free to provide it.
