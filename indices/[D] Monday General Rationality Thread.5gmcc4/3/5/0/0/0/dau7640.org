OK, I just took a look at one of them (the Slate article), and it appears to be saying, Yes, contraceptives that need repeated use can actually increase abortion rates, but long-acting ones can reduce them.

On the other hand, those long-acting contraceptives don't give any protection at all against STDs, not even the limited protection of a condom (which will stop HIV, but not, for example, chlamydia).

So my above point about contraceptives incentivising risky behavior stands, with the nature of the risk being determined by the nature of the contraceptive.

I can look through the others later, but will they say something different? Is there a contraceptive that /doesn't/, in practice, lead to increased abortion or STD rates?

Still haven't even begun to discuss the impact on psychology/relationships.
