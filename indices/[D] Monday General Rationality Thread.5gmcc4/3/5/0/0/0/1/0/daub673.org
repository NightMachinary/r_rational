Actually the SIECUS link indicated that sex ed /doesn't/ have any significant impact on STD rates (I tend to block JavaScript, so I didn't read the other). What /did/ have a fourfold impact was a non-intact family structure. Which could, I suppose, be used as an argument for increased availability of contraceptives - but could hardly be used as an argument against abstinence.

Anyway, my overall point is, I don't think I'm being a hypocrite by opposing both abortion and contraception, and advocating sex-/after/-permanent-commitment instead.
