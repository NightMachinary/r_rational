First, your point was that sex-ed might /increase/ risk of STDs. I didn't have to show that it would decrease them: just disprove that it would increase them.

But that's just from the first link. The second does indeed indicate the benefits:

  Advocates for Youth undertook exhaustive reviews of existing programs to compile a list of programs that have been proven effective by rigorous evaluation. Twenty-six effective programs were identified, twenty-three of which included comprehensive sex education as at least one component of the program. The other programs were early childhood interventions. Of the 23 effective, comprehensive sex education programs:

  Fourteen programs demonstrated a statistically significant delay in the timing of first sex.

  13 programs showed statistically significant declines in teen pregnancy, HIV, or other STIs.

Which means more than half of the comprehensive sex-ed programs were found to reduce HIV and other STIs.

  Anyway, my overall point is, I don't think I'm being a hypocrite by opposing both abortion and contraception, and advocating sex-after-permanent-commitment instead.

Most people don't believe they're being hypocritical, in general :P I'm not trying to attack you or your life choices, just your beliefs about "what's best for society" and maybe your epistemology, if it's based on deontological ethics rather than ethics that look at the data and care about the consequences.

I believe that you believe that advocating sex-after-permanent-commitment is a better option, but as I've shown, all the most comprehensive research has consistently shown that to be untrue for decades, if our goals are to unwanted reduce pregnancy/abortion and STDs.

From my own personal life and perspective, I'm the last person to advocate for casual sex, and obviously if people actually reduce casual sex and confine themselves to sex with long term, serious partners, STDs and unwanted pregnancies would go down. But that's the world as we want it to be. The reality we live in is that people are going to have sex even if they're told not to, and in that reality the most effective ways to reduce the negatives associated with it seem to be to educate them about safe sex and promote protection from STDs and pregnancy.

If you oppose abortion and contraception and ignore the evidence that contraception is effective at reducing abortion rates because you dislike the the implications of increased contraception use, then you're not necessarily being hypocritical, but you aren't being fully honest about what you value, whether to yourself or to others.

Meaning if it's more important to you that people aren't encouraged to have casual sex, even if it's safe, than it is to reduce the negatives of people having casual sex, then there's the answer to what you really value.
