  First, your point was that sex-ed might increase risk of STDs
#+end_quote

Actually, no, I only said that about contraceptive use. And more specifically, reliance on contraceptives in such a way that it increases sexual activity. If that hasn't been the case in the cited studies, great. It can happen and has happened in other places at other times, as some of your own links show, which makes me wary.

  if people actually reduce casual sex and confine themselves to sex with long term, serious partners, STDs and unwanted pregnancies would go down. But that's the world as we want it to be.

Then I'd say we largely agree in principle, we just differ in emphasis.

#+begin_quote
  if it's more important to you that people aren't encouraged to have casual sex, even if it's safe, than it is to reduce the negatives of people having casual sex
#+end_quote

Well, I just never think it's actually safe, you know?

I'm OK with (age-appropriate) education about the nature and efficacy of various contraceptive methods, but I couldn't go so far as to /endorse/ them to any audience that would have serious problems if those methods failed.
