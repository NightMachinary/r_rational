  Still haven't even begun to discuss the impact on psychology/relationships.

Judging by how many young religious people marry early for reasons like lust and infatuation just to regret it afterwards I'd say that that's a plus against abstinence as well. In fact I think it is downright irresponsible for two people to marry if they aren't already sharing a household, and how often do couples sharing a household still stay abstinent?

And beyond that there is the case of sexual incompatibility. So even if they could share a household but not be sexually active that still ends wrongly too often for comfort. Which means that marrying someone you haven't had sex with is only a smart idea if you're both asexual or asexual-adjacent.

  OK, I just took a look at one of them (the Slate article), and it appears to be saying, Yes, contraceptives that need repeated use can actually increase abortion rates, but long-acting ones can reduce them.

From what I read all of those cases were due to human error. Do you believe that someone who usually uses a condom but is okay with "just this once" foregoing it would not have any sex if there hadn't been any condoms available in the first place? I mean they have already proven themselves to be okay with condomless sex.

Then there is something the studies don't explore, which is stable or even married couples that don't want children (yet or ever) and are willing to abort a pregnancy for that reason. What are the chances that with the copious amounts of sex that young adult couples have they wouldn't have been pregnant many times over if not for contraceptives?

The idea that contraceptives and abortions have a negative effect on relationships seems wrong to me even just on an anecdotal level. My family definitely wouldn't have been better off if I had a bunch of siblings instead of just one sister. Neither would my parents have stayed together for very long if they had foregone most sex in order to prevent having more children.
