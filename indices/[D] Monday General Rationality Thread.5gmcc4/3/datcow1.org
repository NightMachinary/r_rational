Okay, so I know this is probably opening a can of snakes, but I'm genuinely interested in your thoughts and reasons. What do you guys think about abortion? And, tangent to that, when do you think a human life begins and when do you think a human life ends?

Personally, while I see the arguments for it, I'm against it (barring any sort of medical life-or-death scenario where the life of the child must be weighed against the life of the mother). Not being sure where to classify life beginning, I think it makes sense to take the safest route and say at conception, given that at that point the zygote has the capacity to grow into a fully independent human. And ending a human's life for no reason other than convenience's sake seems wrong to me.

But those are my thoughts. What are yours?
