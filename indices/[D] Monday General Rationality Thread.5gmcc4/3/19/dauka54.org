My thoughts?

Before conception, the baby is two packets of separate genetic material (one in the father, one in the mother). It is not yet a person.

At birth, the baby is a person, and should be treated as having basic human rights, particularly the right to life.

Between those two times it's a bit more tricky. There isn't a simple, binary switch from not-a-person to a person. It's a bit like a painting - you start out with a blank canvas, which is not a painting, and after a lot of effort from the artist, you end up with a painting, but there's no particular stroke of the brush which makes it suddenly jump from 0% Painting to 100% Painting.

So. For nine months, the baby is a... /fractional/ person, I think is the best way to put it. With that fraction monotonically increasing. There might, one day, with better medical science, be a way to quantify that function exactly, but until that time I tend to assume it's more or less linear. (That's not quite right. Babies born a month early can still survive, so they're already full people. But it's a vague approximation which can be built on).

So. Under what circumstances is it moral to end a /fractional/ life? There's a good argument to be made when there's some medical complication that threatens the (non-fractional) life of the mother; ending the life of a fractional human to save the life of a full human. But, given that it's pretty much impossible for the baby to do anything that would earn the death penalty in any court, I don't think that it's really worthwhile in other circumstances.
