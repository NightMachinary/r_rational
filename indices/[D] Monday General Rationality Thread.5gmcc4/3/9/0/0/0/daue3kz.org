At least I'm not literary Voldemort.

But yes, when it comes to animals I sometimes do Evil actions for Evil reasons, at least from an utilitarian standpoint. Eating unhealthy/processed meat for no reason other than flavor is one of them. Dealing lethally with insect nuisances another. A third would be partaking in unethically sourced luxury goods that do not improve my mental health through constructive comfort. And the most Evil part is that I do not actively try to change or even strongly regret most of the above even though I am consciously aware of their Evilness, sometimes even as I am doing them.

On the plus side it makes it very very easy for me to be in favor of pretty much all voluntary pre-natal abortions. For post-natal ones I am still too queasy and sentimental :P
