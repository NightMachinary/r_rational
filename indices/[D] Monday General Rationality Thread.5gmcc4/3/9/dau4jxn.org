I am against abortion for the sake of convenience, but I am also against swatting flies just because it is more convenient to swat than to spend five or ten minutes trying to shoo it outside.

However, there does come a point where the cost/benefit breaks down in favor of "swat the damn fly already." For example, if the fly is going to cost me a sizable portion of my income, time, and other resources for the next two decades or thereabouts, then it's swatting time.

So, I'm against killing fetuses for trivial reasons, but convenience isn't always a trivial thing.

Into the third trimester I'm more reluctant because it looks like humans may become properly conscious past that point (though we don't know exactly when), but it's still pretty easy for me to weigh in favor of the mother. You're killing something, and that something is genetically human, but I don't ascribe special status to humans on the basis of being human. It's about the mind, for me.

EDIT: I am also suspicious in general of anti-abortion arguments because, both times that abortion became a big issue in the United States, there were political and/or racial motivations behind it (the first craze was in the late 1800s, early 1900s, when some people were concerned that that the white population would be overtaken by minorities because too many of them were having abortions).
