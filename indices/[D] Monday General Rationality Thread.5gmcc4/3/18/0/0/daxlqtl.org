how can you say you're against Abortion when you don't even finish the sentence before adding caveats.

You are against the use of Abortion in ways that contradict your view of things. You're not against it as a thing.

I am against treating people differently for race. I am for treating people differently for circumstances. If 100% of people from a race are need that treatment, that's okay too, as long as every other race has the same access if needed. That's a blanket I am against something. I don't think there's any loopholes or ifs, or buts, or maybes, or excepts there. Race should not be used to define what access some people have to help or so on.

Anyway, now my example is over. you've seen why I think you're not actually against Abortion, just the use of it.

As to Abortion? I think it's a wonderful thing. It reduces the amount of child abuse, it reduces rape, it reduces a bunch of crap that can be inflicted on children in bad situations.

I think the vast majority of people who complain about abortion do not research it enough to have an opinion on it. And those that do and still complain are generally very emotional about it. the only real group who can say anything on the subject are Vegans. Not vegetarians cause they eat Eggs, but Vegans.

The brain can't even operate at 12 weeks. It's just a cluster of random shitty cells that can eventually make the connections and jump to an operational brain. After that, I can see issues. Though it's not until week 24 or so that you can demonstrate anything.
