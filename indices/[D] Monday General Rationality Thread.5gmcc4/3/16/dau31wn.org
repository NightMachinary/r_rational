I think it's very dangerous for us to make a firm judgement call about when humanity begins, which makes abortion a big risk. If the unborn have human DNA and are steadily growing into human beings, then the default assumption should be that they are human, and to decide otherwise runs the risk of destroying human lives - in the millions.

If we assume that human rights start at conception, when there isn't really any need for that, what happens? Potentially more babies are born to unprepared mothers. There are options available - social security, adoption, etc.

Conversely, if we decide that humanity begins at birth, and if that's actually a mistake, what happens? Slaughter on a larger scale than the Holocaust, millions upon millions.

If there is even a 10% chance that future science will prove the unborn to be fully deserving of human rights, then that should be compelling. Do we have such irrefutable evidence of their /non/-humanity that we should assign a lower probability than that?

(And if you examine the statistics, the situation may even be more complex than that; permitting abortion may actually encourage risky sexual behavior and thus lead to /more/ unwanted pregnancies.)
