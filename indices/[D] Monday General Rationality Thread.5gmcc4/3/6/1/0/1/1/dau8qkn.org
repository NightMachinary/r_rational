  If we are to believe that morality has some objective grounding to it

What do you mean by objective grounding? There's a difference between the idea that there are definite ways to further well-being and reduce suffering, including ways we haven't figured out yet, and the idea that there is some platonic set of rules that somehow trumps everything humans could ever come up with. The second is not only unprovable but also ultimately irrelevant except if you believe that there are higher level beings whose opinions /inherently/ trump the opinions of members of our own species.
