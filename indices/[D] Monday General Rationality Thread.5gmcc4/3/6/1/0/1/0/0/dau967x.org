That is not completely fair. Abortions being illegal, dangerous and hard to get /definitely/ reduces the overall amount of abortions gotten. Just think about all the stories of people having children they didn't want. Then there's also the factor that by making it legal and not "demonizing" it, fewer people will believe it to be ethically wrong and thus more and more people will go through with abortions for reasons as simple as "it currently fits my lifestyle better". And zero limits on abortion also lead to things like selective abortions where you get rid of fetuses that don't have your preferred characteristics.

I personally am completely in favor of abortions but if one believes that a fetus has human or near-human moral weight then it does make a certain amount of sense to at least restrict abortions as much as is possible without empowering the black market too much.

To give an example, alcohol prohibition caused a lot of bad things but it did in fact reduce the overall instances of drunkenness and accidents under the influence of alcohol.
