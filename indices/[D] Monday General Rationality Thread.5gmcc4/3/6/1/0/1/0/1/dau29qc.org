I'm sorry, but the solution to not knowing whether a policy kills millions of people is not to decide you don't care and say it must not, because that would be bad. The solution is to /stop/, because when you're putting human lives in the balance you err on the side of caution.

What you say about the demand for not having a baby strongly resembles the concepts behind prohibition and the war on drugs. Specifically, when you ban alcohol or drugs, the demand for alcohol and drugs is supplied by black market suppliers instead, and the whole situation becomes more deadly and hostile to everyone involved. Much better, in the end, to just let them get their alcohol or drugs legally and provide support for people struggling with them.

But again, abortion isn't the same. With alcohol and drugs, partaking in them does no one any harm. With abortion, getting one risks killing a person. If 90% of women who get abortions still go and get illegal abortions, that's still 10%, hundreds of thousands of lives, in the balance. I also suspect that 90% of women continuing to abort is a rather high percentage, and that even more fetuses are in question here. The situation would get worse for the women, but since we can't say with confidence that the fetuses aren't people, we're again weighing lives against things that are not lives.

In fact, the answer here, since we /don't know/ if our actions are murder on an enormous scale or not, should be to try and minimize the total number of attempted abortions. Campaigns to promote the /idea/ that fetuses are people, in order to hopefully sway some women to carry the child to term and put it up for adoption. Again I stress, it would be incredibly irresponsible to ignore the very real odds that human people are being murdered by the millions just because it's more convenient to do nothing. The fact that we can't know which is true, whether a fetus is a person or isn't, doesn't mean we get to pick whichever one's nicer to believe. It means we have to assume either can be true, and act in such a way to minimize the tragedy of each one.
