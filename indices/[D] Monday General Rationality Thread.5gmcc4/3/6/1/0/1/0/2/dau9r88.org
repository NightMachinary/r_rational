This sounds to me like an act of desperation by someone who has more problems than just an unexpected pregnancy, and abortion as opposed to adoption will not make those problems go away. The appropriate response is to provide the needed support. Does a prospective single mother need housing? An income? Safety from the father, from her family, or from someone else? A friend who understands her situation? I'm pretty sure that pregnancy alone rarely drives anyone to desperation; fix the other problems, and her push to abort may be less absolute.

Women have been abused by their husbands since before recorded history, too, but that doesn't mean we should /legalise/ or regulate abuse, it means we should target the root causes and reduce or remove them as much as we can.
