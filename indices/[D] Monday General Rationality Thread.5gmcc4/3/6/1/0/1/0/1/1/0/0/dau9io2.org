Sure. I'm not going to contest the idea that people have rights here, but *why* do we think that they have rights? Why do humans have value?

I hold that humans have value because of our minds, that animals have value inasmuch as they have minds and subjective experiences, and that a hypothetical being with a more complex mind and more complex inner life would have more value than a human, in the same way that a bee, though valuable (bees have emotions!), is not as valuable as a human.

Put this way, I don't see a huge issue with, to crib from Christian terminology, a massacre of the (pre-)infants. It's, well, undesirable, to the same extent that I don't desire that a fly be swatted to save me the five or fifteen minutes it takes to shoo it outside instead, and if getting an abortion were somehow able to get you to the supermarket a little more quickly then I'd disapprove of abortions for that purpose, but thousands of insects and other small animals get killed on any given plot of land that's used for farming, and I really doubt that those lives are worth so much that we should find other method of farming in order to prevent those deaths.

Similarly, there's a part of me that feels bad even that /microbes/ have to die, but the value of a rhinovirus is not so great that I won't fight a cold, even though colds won't kill me, just be bothersome. In other words, on one side of the scale there's "value of life" and other side, "value of convenience," and these can be balanced against each other. Some things, because of the complexity of their minds, are so valuable that I doubt that any realistic amount of convenience would be worth their deaths, but that cutoff point is closer to "dogs" than "pre-conscious fetuses."
