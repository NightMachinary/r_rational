I haven't done too much research into ethics, but consequentialist seems like an appropriate label. Regarding rights, that humans have them is one of those things we tend to assume as a species. I don't think I've honestly heard anyone argue that human lives have no value, from one source or another, so I take from that the idea that we are generally in agreement that humans have rights.
