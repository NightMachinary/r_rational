Except that there is another issue here that we haven't touched on yet.

Overpopulation.

The fact of the matter is that many experts in relevant fields will tell you that Very Bad Things will begin happening once there are too many humans on the planet for current technology to support, and that with the threat of climate change we have possibly already overshot that mark by a billion or so. Sure, technology might improve and increase that mark, and we might become a multiplanetary species fast enough to mitigate the effects, but both of those eventualities are as hypothetical as the idea that 20 week or less old fetuses are sapient (which is when or before the majority of abortions are performed anyway).

Obviously, the best way to combat that is with proper sex ed and free access to birth control, but birth control does fail some small percentage of the time and unwanted babies are always going to be a problem, which leaves legal abortion as the ironically third least obviously immoral means of controlling population growth, followed by codified population controls like China's defunct one child policy. (Aside: an argument could be made that increasing national standards of living generally decreases birth rates dramatically as well, but since the problem with overpopulation is resource expenditure and increased standards of living increase resource expenditure, this doesn't actually solve anything)

Once hard limiters on the number of humans who can exist are lifted one way or another, this is a much more reasonable conversation to be having. Before then, though, we risk the possible deaths of /billions/ in nuclear powered resource wars between developed countries starved by massive populations, which is a much more important thing to be worrying about, IMO, than whether the few million fetuses being terminated globally each year might possibly be sapient enough to warrant full personhood rights.
