You'd still have millions of humans dying no matter what if you assume fetuses are human. If a woman doesn't want to have a baby hard enough, /she ain't having that baby/, no matter your moralistic quibbling. There has always been and always will be a demand for a way to not have a baby, and absolutely nothing you can do or say will change that.

People have been aborting pregnancies since before recorded history. It doesn't matter the culture or what taboos are in place, it happens. You don't get a choice in that matter. The only choice you get to make is whether the people who seek this can do it legitimately in regulated medical facilities. And if you would say that you think they should be forced underground to do something that they absolutely will do either way, I have no words to describe how completely wrong that feels to me.

Now. Maybe you think it should be legal but don't support it yourself. That's fine. Try to convince people not to get one, do whatever you want on that front. But there are fetuses which effectively start dead because their carriers don't want or can't support them for whatever reason, and you cannot change that.

So. Either believe something which is unprovable which causes you personal and unpreventable mental agony, or believe something equally unprovable which does not. Neither of us has solid evidence either way, but I have chosen to believe something which doesn't make me worry about millions of people being inadvertently murdered, which at the very least improves my quality of life. Until better evidence exists, that's the only thing I can do.
