  What does that even mean?
#+end_quote

I was just referring to the criterion used in this discussion of a fetus being less sentient than it will be later. If I should have used better terminology, please correct me.

  many animals, including some of those that we consume as food, could be considered more sentient

They could, and they might also be more sentient than a human being who is comatose, or severely mentally handicapped. And in the latter case, the human being is probably not going to recover and reach a regular level of sentience, either. So from a purely utilitarian standpoint, I suppose that his/her life may have no more value than that of a cow.

However, if you're going to have /any/ deontological rule, I think "thou shalt not kill" is a pretty good one. Don't pick and choose which human lives have value; humans have the right to live, period.

(I'm willing to make an exception in cases where brain activity has ceased to the point where we cannot expect the person to ever be conscious again. That's not really life, is it?)
