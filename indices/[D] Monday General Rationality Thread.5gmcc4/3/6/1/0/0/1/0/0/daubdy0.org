  And in the latter case, the human being is probably not going to recover and reach a regular level of sentience, either. So from a purely utilitarian standpoint, I suppose that his/her life may have no more value than that of a cow.

That only applies if they are so severely mentally handicapped that they can't signal that they would rather live when asked. That said, there is also the sentimental value to those that know the person as a human being. Killing someone you knew has a much bigger psychological impact on anyone involved than snuffing out a faceless zygote.

  However, if you're going to have any deontological rule, I think "thou shalt not kill" is a pretty good one. Don't pick and choose which human lives have value; humans have the right to live, period.

  (I'm willing to make an exception in cases where brain activity has ceased to the point where we cannot expect the person to ever be conscious again. That's not really life, is it?)

How is an exception there consistent? In both cases it has human DNA and little else of value.
