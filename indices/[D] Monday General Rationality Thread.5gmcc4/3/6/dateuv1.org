The main argument I've heard for eliminating any restrictions on abortion is to give women complete autonomy over their body. It's illegal to force someone to donate blood or organs even when it would save a live, so why should it be legal to force a woman to give birth when she doesn't want to?

On the other hand, I have some reservations towards late-term abortion since that is the point at which the brain begins forming and I've /heard/ that there's evidence the fetus is capable of feeling pain at that point. On the other other hand, I don't instinctively consider a fetus to be human until it's born.
