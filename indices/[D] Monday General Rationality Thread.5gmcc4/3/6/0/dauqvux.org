What I find infuriating is that many people who accept the complete autonomy argument reject it in any other capacity. If people have a constitutional and moral right to complete bodily autonomy in the context of taking a potential human life, then they should have that same right in the context of drugs (medical or recreational). This would imply the FDA should be gutted down to a mere advisory board. Similarly, if I have the right to completel bodily autonomy, that seems like it must include things like the option to see the use my my body's labor for less than a minimum wage, or in whatever conditions I choose. Yet, most proponents of that argument also seem to be strong proponents of FDA regulations, high minimum wages, and OSHA regulations.
