I haven't thought much about the subject, so my feelings are vague. I'm generally in favor of it, even though I feel a bit icky about the subject: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion#Surgical][how brutal the actual operation often is]] and how it often upsets the mother both physically and mentally. My understanding is that it sometimes causes a lot of mental issues like depression.*

I don't think that a fetus or an embryo is capable of feeling very deep and complex feelings during the time abortion is most often done ([[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2009/06/02/GR2009060200592.html][0-15 weeks?]]), so I mostly think about the well-being of the mother when thinking about this subject. I also consider whether having more unwanted children, or children the mother or the parents aren't capable of properly caring for makes the world a better or worse place, but haven't reached a conclusion yet.

Some notes (*): I did some searching and it seems that at least the mental health effects are a bit exaggerated: [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014789]] so it could be that the other effects are too since you have to remember there is a lot of propaganda regarding this subject.
