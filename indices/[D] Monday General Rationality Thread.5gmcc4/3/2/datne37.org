I think that abortions are necessary to ensure women have bodily autonomy, and while they're not exactly a good thing, they do have net positive effects.

  Not being sure where to classify life beginning, I think it makes sense to take the safest route and say at conception, given that at that point the zygote has the capacity to grow into a fully independent human.

But it doesn't really have that potential at that point. It's just a cluster of cells, a human still has to incubate and nurture this cluster of cells for months on end before it even gets a heartbeat, and then a human has to invest years more teaching them how to human.

Now, conception is by far the safest place to say that a human life starts, since that's the point that they begin existing as a genetically unique entity, however, every bug is also a genetically unique entity and genetic uniqueness isn't really something I consider an important trait for defining a cluster of cells as a person or not.

The problem really stems from the fact that there's no discrete point where the brain 'turns on.' If there was, you could just point to that point and say 'and now they're a person' but brain development isn't polar, it's a gradual bootstrapping up from first principles that continue in the form of learning even after birth, so that's not useful either. We eat pigs and have no problem with that, yet pigs have the intelligence of three-year-olds^{[[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/opinion/thinking-about-pigs-before-theyre-food.html][[1]]].} Obviously, the idea of eating three-year-olds is utterly abhorrent, but the fact we consider it abhorrent really is just neural programming on our part, since our species uses K-pattern selection.

But given the pig thing, we're being pretty hypocritical in the way we treat other species versus ourselves, and we don't ever really think about it. We eat creatures that are more aware, more conscious, more capable of feeling pain, and more capable of emotions, that do have the mental capacity developed to code for long-term memories, than any of the fetuses we're aborting, and yet abortions are this huge horrible thing simply because the fetus /could/ someday be more of a person than the animals we eat.

But you know? Fine, I get that. We're humans, scope insensitivity is a thing and if humans experience less empathy for people of other ethnic groups than the ones they grew up exposed to, they most certainly feel less empathy for animals than they're capable of feeling towards humans. Maybe it is hypocritical, but its also sort of a required survival trait of any species that they put their own survival first.

I do think the question of abortion is one of autonomy, not one about the fetus at all. It's really a question of whether we should force women who get pregnant to be baby incubators for 9 months, followed by caring for a child for 18 years until society has decided they're an adult. When I talk about this with conservative people, is that this is usually the part of the conversation we're having that they tell me that pregnancy is the result of sex, and sex has consequences, and if you didn't want to get pregnant you shouldn't be going around having sex. I really hate that argument because it flies completely in the face of billions of successive years of evolution telling us to go fuck each other, and all the powerful biochemical and neurological signals that have been honed by thousands of generations of natural selection to put a powerful urge in us to do just that. It's also really annoying because if those people really want to reduce the number of abortions, the best way to do that would be with safe sex education and easier access to contraceptives. But instead, the same people who are against abortions are also against birth control, which really shows to me that the majority of them aren't coming from a desire to prevent death, or improve the world, but instead to punish women who deviate from the cultural values. They tell women they can't get abortions, make it harder, closer clinics, regardless of whether they can take care of the child after they're born or not, and then when they end up having the child, those same people are working to cut funding from WIC and other programs designed to help poor families. Planned Parenthood may be the largest abortion provider in the country, but they're also the largest abortion /preventer/ in the country. If you don't get pregnant in the first place, you don't need an abortion. For people who want to reduce abortions, they're spending a lot of time attacking Planned Parenthood and contraceptive access.

But Sage, you say, this is the rationalist community and we /do/ care about those things. We /do/ want to prevent death and improve the world. Right now, given that, supporting pro-choice policies is, at least from my perspective, the best way to go about minimizing harm. The thing about abortions is that they happen whether they are legal or not, safe or not. In Texas in the last year, there were between 100,000 and 250,000 home abortions performed after conservative lawmakers forced over half the Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas to close^{[[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/100000-texas-women-have-tried-to-self-induce-abortion/][[2]]].} How many of those pregnancies would have just never happened in the first place if those Planned Parenthoods had stayed open to provide access to contraceptives? To add to that, home abortions are much more dangerous to the life of the women since they have no medical supervision and are in many cases just buying pills offline and hoping for the best, or drinking a fuckton and hoping they'll miscarry, or any number of things like that. As long as the question is 'which is more important, the fetus XOR the autonomy of the woman?' The answer should always be the person who exists right now, not the distant potential for personhood.

But that might not always be the question. Right now, there is a certain range of premature births that can be survived using equipment like incubators. We can also generate zygotes outside of the body in the first place. So there are just a certain range months that currently require a human to be the incubator, and that range is shrinking. In fifty more years, if we manage to shrink that range to zero, and have full blown womb tanks, then the act of producing a child won't require a human incubator at all. Once that shift happens, it's not a XOR statement, and you can have autonomy for the woman, and life for the fetus. When the tech shift allows it, I expect cultural attitudes to swing back towards considering abortion to be a bad thing, if for no other reason than that I suspect our neural hardware would compel us to behave in that manner.
