In fifty years or less, we'll all still be eating delicious meat-type protein, but rather then grow and butcher animals, we'll culture and grow the cells in vats with no attached processing organs, then butcher the flesh cubes and eat bits of those.

Meat is damned delicious, in my opinion. I can see us moving towards obtaining meat from a more morally positive source, but not abandoning it altogether.
