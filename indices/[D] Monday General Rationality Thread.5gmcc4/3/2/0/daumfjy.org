I think slatestarcodex had an article precisely about the "people who say they want [nice-sounding thing], actually really really want [evil thing]" reasoning. I can't find the article right now, but please don't use that reasoning.

First, it's really arrogant (in a "Harry JPEV telling McGonagall she can't think for herself" way), and second, it's usually wrong. People have very developed internal justifications for their beliefs which usually aren't "I want to hurt people".

Also, your reasoning mostly fails because not everyone is a consequentialist (and it sucks).
