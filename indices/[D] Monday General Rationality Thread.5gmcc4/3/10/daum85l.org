Personally, I feel no attachment to newborn humans *simply because they are new young of the species*. I feel attachment to humans based on personality and shared histories.

By my understanding of neurological development, a baby human doesn't really achieve a level of neurological complexity necessary to begin the formation of a personality through data aggregation and retention until they are at least two years of age. Until that point, they are basically running on automatic instinctual impulses common to any higher mammal.

IF hunger = 1 THEN seek food. WHEN find food LIFEFUNCTION_EAT

IF thirst = 1 THEN seek water/ WHEN find water LIFEFUNCTION_DRINK

Etc.

As such, I have no issues with either the male or female of a parent-pair choosing to abort the nascent human at any stage of the process pre-partum, and post-partum if significant mental disability is detected that would prevent the baby human from maturing properly into an adult human with a full set of mental faculties.

I recognize that this is not a popular viewpoint. Most people tend to be emotionally attached to young of our species because of survival-favoring hardwired chemical triggers in the brain. See baby, protect baby. Species goes on.

Hell, I myself get those irrational "oh, look, it smiled at me." dopamine injections, and I can recognize it as it happens. I just don't let primitive, "worked pretty well in the ancestral environment" chemical triggers affect my thinking. To the best of my ability, anyway. I'm trying to analyze the code from the inside, so to speak.
