  By your argument a newborn baby is only worth something because of the potential of the human being it will become.

I never said this. What I meant is that all humans have inherent value. We're not trying to maximize "amount of money humans can earn" or "stuff humans can produce" or "amount a human can bring happiness to other humans" for their own sake. but rather, we're trying to maximize the amount of happiness/prosperity/health etc of each human. Thus a person doesn't just have value conditional on them being able to contribute to society. They themselves are part of group we're trying to maximize, they have some part of the utility pie.

If all humans were simultaneously and painlessly murdered, nobody would be sad, nobody would suffer, nobody would care that the economy doesn't exist anymore, but I think most people can agree that this would be absolutely terrible and something that we don't want to happen. Because someone dying has a negative value on the utility function.

Additionally, if you murder someone and then have an extra child to replace them, I think most people will agree that this doesn't cancel it out. Killing someone isn't bad just because it reduces the amount of people in the world, but because it is bad. The utility function has a negative weight attached to death.

I think a utility function which only seeks to maximize value for adult humans is fundamentally flawed and open to all sorts of dystopian exploitations.

It's not about potential human, it's about that they are now. You can try to argue that fetuses aren't entirely human because they don't have all of the same features, but I think it's much much harder to argue that they aren't human at all even when they have many of the same features. Thus as at least partial humans they deserve some nonzero weight in the utility function.
