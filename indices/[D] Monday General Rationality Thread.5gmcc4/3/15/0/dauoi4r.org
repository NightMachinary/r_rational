Let me throw a controversial opinion by continuing your argument is a newborn baby worth 100% of a young adult? After all it's not really useful yet, it's hardly much more intelligent than a pig. While parents will grieve if their baby die they tend to grieve less over a one year old dying than over a teenage kid. By your argument a newborn baby is only worth something because of the potential of the human being it will become.

I think looking at percentages is the wrong way to look at it because there actually are discontinuities. There's, for example, the time the baby starts interacting the environment by hearing from the womb (which has been proven conclusively in week 24 since the baby reacts to noise but is estimated to start happening at week 16). Likewise the first kick happens around week 16. Before that, the unborn baby doesn't actually have any interaction with the outside world. So an argument could be made to allow abortion up till then since before that there's no interaction between the unborn baby and the outside world.

Another discontinuity would be the development of the brain with the first synapses developing around week 8. Can an unborn baby without synapses be considered a human being? Before that, it doesn't think.

One argument is that the unborn baby has value because of it's potential to be a fully developed human being. If we say that it must absolutely be preserved because of that potential, then why shouldn't we go on to say that the sperms and eggs need to be preserved because of their potential of becoming a human being. By that logic, contraceptives are murder (we prevent the creation of a human being), masturbating for men would be murder too (wasting sperms) and not procreating as often as possible would be murder since the sperm is renewed every 3 days. It doesn't really make sense in the end.

So, I don't think that talking about the potential of being a human being makes any sense and I think that allowing abortion until a certain date defined by our current knowledge of the development of the fetus makes the most sense. I'm not sure where to place the limit. We can place it when the baby first develop synapses, or when it first starts hearing or when a baby is first capable of making choices which would be after it's born. Placing the line is a matter for debate.

I do think that any abortion is a suboptimal solution and that contraceptives make much more sense but I think that from a society point of view abortion is a good thing because it reduces the number of children that will be born in families that cannot give them the support they need.
