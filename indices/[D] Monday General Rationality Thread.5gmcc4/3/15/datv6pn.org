Definitely agree.

I'm not entirely sure the following idea is the best, but it could be useful as an approximationg, would be to having a sliding scale of "human value" that says how much a person is worth compared to a full adult human. Instead of saying a fetus is worth 0% of a human and has no rights and then once it's born it instantly jumps to 100%, we could say that at conception it starts at 0% (or some small constant like 5%) and then its value gradually increases until it reaches 100% either at birth or even several years later if you want. The details aren't important, the point is that it makes no sense for it to discontinuously jump from 0% to 100% all of a sudden, and that if it's morally wrong to kill newborn babies, it should be morally wrong to kill them immediately beforehand.

A sliding scale would still force us to answer questions about "how much value does autonomy have versus human life?" If a 2 month baby is given 20% value does that outweigh a woman's desire to not be pregnant for 7 more months? Or in other words, would it be justifiable to allow 5 women that freedom if an adult had to be killed for it? I don't know, if not then maybe we need to change the values around, but at least we can start asking and measuring.
