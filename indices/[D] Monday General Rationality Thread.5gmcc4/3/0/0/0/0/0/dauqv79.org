Of course not. Countries without death penalty don't give zero value to retributive justice. They just give the lives of innocents much more value.

For example, if a fertility clinic caught fire and I had to choose between saving a fridge full of well-preserved fertilized in-vitro eggs or saving a random adult woman I would save the woman, but I obviously would prefer to save both.
