Okay, so we're agreed on what should happen in the 0% case, then. It now seems that the central point of our disagreement in how to deal with abortion is that you consider the value of the unborn baby to be /significantly/ less than the value of the mother (nearly infinitesimal in comparison, but non-zero) while I consider the value of the unborn baby (especially late in the pregnancy) to be a very large fraction of the value of the mother. Would this be a fair characterisation of your position?
