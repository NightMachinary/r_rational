Well, if we really want a threshold for when a member of the species /homo sapiens/ becomes a "person," I agree that birth is pretty arbitrary, and the third trimester even moreso. On the other hand, I don't personally oppose the killing of nonsentient lifeforms. Therefore, taking this to its logical conclusion, I think that the final cutoff for abortion should be when the baby starts speaking in full sentences.
