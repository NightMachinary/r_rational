Over a month ago, I made a post where I played Devil's advocate with the subject of long-term immortality.

In this post, I'd like to instead raise some more practical questions about the subject. People in this community just seem to take it as a given that immortality is a good idea, and while I agree in principle, there are still some major problems that need to be addressed.

I'll assume here that it is highly likely that we will achieve effective immortality within the next 100-200 years, /conditional/ on the development of friendly AI within that time frame. This implies that we will become immortal long before we have a large presence elsewhere in the solar system, and very long before we finish terraforming Mars and start going to other stars.

*The Problem of Having Children*

You cannot have a planet full of immortals all having immortal children without some plan for avoiding the Malthusian cycle that this will inevitably cause. Assuming that moving many people off-planet will not be feasible for at least a couple of hundred years, you will essentially have to prohibit immortal people from raising families. You cannot both have a right to life and a right to your own biological children. One way of implementing this would be to require that everyone who becomes immortal must also be sterilized (or gay). I expect that such a solution would not sit well with most ordinary people.

Now, you might say, "Wait a minute. If everyone is immortal, they have all the time in the universe. Just have people wait to have children until moving off-planet is feasible." This is not as good of a solution as it sounds. I expect that due to the inhospitableness of outer space and other planets, the quality of life on a space station or on Mars will not match the quality of life on earth for a very long time (thousands of years at least, until terraforming is effective). People who are born on earth will argue that they have a right to live where they are born, and that they have a right not to be forcibly deported to a place with a lower quality of life. So if you allow too many immortal people to have immortal families, you may still have a problem even if it is feasible to move off-planet. Perhaps you could cycle people around so that everyone gets to spend some time on earth - but the more people there are, the less time each person gets to spend on earth.

It seems that whatever happens, you will have to modify people's values so that they have less desire to have children, and also so that they are better adapted to less hospitable environments.

*The Problem of Ethical Paths to Immortality*

To raise a completely different issue: how exactly do you do the necessary science to achieve immortality in an /ethical/ way? There must inevitably be /lots/ of dangerous human experimentation, of the sort that is entirely prohibited today. Theory can only get you so far - you have to eventually do experiments building real immortal people, and some of these will go horribly wrong, either killing or maiming their subjects, and perhaps doing irreversible mental damage. For example, suppose you insert a chromosome that stops aging, but after 200 years it turns out that this causes people's brains to stop forming new memories and enter a permanent state of semi-dementia. You could back up everyone's mind to a computer, maybe, but this process is likely to kill or damage the first so many people who try it.

The best bet is probably to experiment on terminally ill volunteers (assuming the problem of disease hasn't yet been solved!). But as per the above example, you might not notice bad effects for decades, and people will not want to wait that long.

So: any thoughts on these questions?
