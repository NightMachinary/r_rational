Forced destructive brain scans, tho'...

I mean, yeah, a version of you gets to live on as a mind-raped former human being turned pony...thing, but...

No, you know what?

A large part of your human identity is tied up with the morphic form of your hominid body. Two legs, two arms, one torso, one head, some hair, ten fingers, ten toes, two eyes, etc.

The copy of you is a new life template-based on human!you. The deviations from the scan begin pretty damned fast when the morphic structure of the body is shifted and the simulated neurology adjusted to find this normal.

That's a pretty solid case for identity death, even if you fall in the camp of "some version of me running around is good enough as immortality".
