Frankly, the writing in the show is so bad that I can't imagine any individual or group could intentionally assert what this article criticizes.

Of course half of the things these characters and villains do, don't make sense. Because the writers themselves are only trying to connect horribly contrived plot points together, not pushing some sexist, centrist, anti-transhumanist agenda. At the most, some biases, traditionalist ideas, and fears might peek through the crappy writing once in a while, but nothing near the level that is claimed.

The article reaches way too far in trying to find hidden political agendas or meaning in simple bad writing.

Not to say that there aren't people who might think that way, and fear/loathe transhumanist ideas. But they certainly aren't writing Arrow that way, or at least not on purpose.
