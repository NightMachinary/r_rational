THIS. This is why I always tell people I'm a mad, evil villain. It's not lying, it's just phrasing things in terms they understand. I want to save lives and improve quality of life via organized social cooperation; /ergo/, I must be a Stalin waiting to happen. Everyone knows that anyone who makes a large change to the status quo in the process of helping people was not actually helping and is actually evil.

/Everyone knows./
