That is only one interpretation of why a character acts without reason. That doesn't mean everyone else is picking up on the same thing or even considers his motivations at all, since they don't make sense.

It could be possible that the writers intended to portray something like how the article interprets things. Even if they didn't intend it, it still might be there as you say.

And it also might be possible JK Rowling intended to spread satanism through Harry Potter. And even if she didn't intend it, it still might be there.

But just because someone asserts an interpretation and a few others might see it as well, doesn't mean everyone else sees the same thing. To claim one interpretation is the only one others will see, is quite a stretch.
