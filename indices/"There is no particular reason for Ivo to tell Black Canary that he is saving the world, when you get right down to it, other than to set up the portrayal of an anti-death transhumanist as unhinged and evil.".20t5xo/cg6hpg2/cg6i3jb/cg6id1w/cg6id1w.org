Ivo is obsessed with trying to save his wife to the point where he tortures and kills innocent people. He justifies his horrible actions by insisting he is the Messiah who will save the human race. It's all pretty straight forward. He doesn't actually care about saving humanity. That much is very clear in the show.

I do understand the criticism, but the way Ivo is built just doesn't come off as a criticism of transhumanism. It comes off as a criticism of the uberman, that people who use their will to power to sacrifice others to themselves are ultimately broken, powerless individuals. Ivo is driven by a similar obsession as Oliver, but the difference is his willingness to sacrifice others to his own alter. He is a criticism of Nietzsche.
