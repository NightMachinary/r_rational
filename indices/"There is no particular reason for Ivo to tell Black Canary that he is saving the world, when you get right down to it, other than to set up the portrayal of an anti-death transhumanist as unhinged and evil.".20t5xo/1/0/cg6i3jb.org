  Which is exactly what he is in the comics.

The blogger actually addresses the "but that's how it is in the comics!" objection, noting that /Iron Man 3/ went and changed the Mandarin from his comics portrayal to match the real world more closely.

The blogger also points out that the character apparently (I've only just now heard of the show, but thought the analysis was interesting if possibly wrong) does not act /consistently/ from episode to episode, but instead just seems to be pegged with the Villain Ball.

To be fair, so is Arrow -- almost all superheroes are, /especially/ in the "dark, gritty, realist" genre of superhero story. And this accusation is at least /leveled/ at almost everyone who proposes or carries out any large-scale plan of action, whether good or bad. To continue the article's themes of both contemporary sociopolitics and transhumanism, I've heard both Elizabeth Warren and our very own [[/u/EliezerYudkowsky]] accused of being psychotic egotists with a messiah complex.

No really. In fact, the general fact that these accusations can get leveled against even the most milquetoast do-gooders actually weakens them when thrown against EY or Ivo.
