  I do understand the criticism, but the way Ivo is built just doesn't come off as a criticism of transhumanism. It comes off as a criticism of the uberman, that people who use their will to power to sacrifice others to themselves are ultimately broken, powerless individuals. Ivo is driven by a similar obsession as Oliver, but the difference is his willingness to sacrifice others to his own alter. He is a criticism of Nietzsche.

Ok, but I think that raises another question: was there a valid literary reason to build the character that way, or is his transhumanism just a [[http://stormingtheivorytower.blogspot.co.il/2013/07/the-girls-who-walk-away-from-kyubee.html][pointlessly Satanic bargain]]? What valid reason is there to tie saving lives to sacrificing lives?

It's just one of those tropes that I can't help but notice everywhere, now that I've been told about it.
