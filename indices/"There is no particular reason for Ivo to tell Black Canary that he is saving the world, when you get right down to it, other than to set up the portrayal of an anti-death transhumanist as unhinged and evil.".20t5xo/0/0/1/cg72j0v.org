Can I ask what exactly determines a person's 'rights' other than the de-facto laws and organizations in a society enforcing them? I mean, you seem to be using the word in a way that indicates you believe that rights are something we possess without the context of a larger society granting those rights (from the bit about the majority vote you don't care about). I have heard others express this view before, but when pressed on this point I haven't heard very convincing explainations. One hopes that on a subreddit like this one the participants will have examined their own viewpoints in detail, so would you consider explaining this in a few more words?

1) What exactly you consider a 'right' that can be violated that is not granted by a larger social system?

2) Examples of such 'rights'.

3) Why it is a moral absolute that no-one's 'right's be violated, no matter the degree of violation or the potential benefits.
