I agree that rights in general are good Schelling points when used as codes, as you say. These would seem to be more optimal /to me/ when rights change over time to reflect society's moral compass - so that you can get new rights over time, for example, such as freedom from persecution on the basis of sexual orientation or race, which are rights we've seen developing and growing over time in the recent past in the western world, and you can lose rights which we decide aren't so important after all, like how the right to bear arms has been limited and made less absolute over time as the technology of arms changed. However, the person I was originally replying to (who hasn't replied) was writing about rights that are /independent of human codes/ as far as I could tell which isn't even a really coherent idea by itself IMO - and presumably if these rights are not the result of a society or laws they wouldn't change over time and would have to be eternally inviolate, I guess? Unless wherever the rights were coming from (not a vote or other democratic process, apparantly) could change those rights over time. Though they never came back to clarify their thoughts.
