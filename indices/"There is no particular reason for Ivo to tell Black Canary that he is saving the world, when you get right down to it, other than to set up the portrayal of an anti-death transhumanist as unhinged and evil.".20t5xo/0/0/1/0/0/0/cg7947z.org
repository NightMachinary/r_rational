Double-triple-check: get both an average five-year-old child /and/ an average forty-something adult. Preferably from multiple cultures, in fact. Many of the standard "dude you're a Stalinist" Utopia Justifies the Means evil-doings will get past the five-year-old, but the forty-something will chew you out. And vice-versa: the five-year-old will call you on overcaution and over-conservatism when the forty-something is darkly alluding that you can never really improve anything at all and people just suck.
