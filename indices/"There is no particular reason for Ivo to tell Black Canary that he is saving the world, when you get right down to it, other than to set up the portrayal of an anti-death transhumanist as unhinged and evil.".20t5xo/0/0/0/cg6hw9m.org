To quote myself:

#+begin_quote
  via organized social cooperation
#+end_quote

Or in other words, things like /elections/ and /publicly-accountable institutions/, which are much, much eviller than lone heroes determining what's right for everyone, apparently.

To be entirely serious, I do agree with the blogger that our culture has taken a really /bizarre/ turn towards thinking that lone self-appointed ubermenschen are saviors of the human race rather than reactionary wannabe-dictators. It's especially bizarre when men like, say, Elon Musk come out and /say/ that they actually kinda /like/ this whole "society" thing themselves.

Go ahead and quote MoR!Quirrell at me, but do remember that Quirrell is presenting a view on society that is deliberately biased towards the negative, not only by the speaker's mind but by his intention that the listener should abandon society and draw closer to Quirrell. Quirrell's IRL counterpart, Michael Vassar, has been described as expressing /nearly/ that degree of cynicism but "with a phoenix on his shoulder".

So yeah, the "ultra-Slytherin" view that we need ubermensch heroes to help us because we /cannot/ help ourselves is just kinda... not really well-evidenced.

  ... If you do it by violating people's individual rights, you're evil.

Lastly, the term "individual rights" is /very/ contested. Not in the card-carryingly evil "No you don't have any rights" way, just in the way that some people believe they've got a right to anti-death serum and some people believe that they've got a right not to be taxed to provide others with anti-death serum. You have to agree on what the individual/human rights /are/ before you can use them as a moral argument.
