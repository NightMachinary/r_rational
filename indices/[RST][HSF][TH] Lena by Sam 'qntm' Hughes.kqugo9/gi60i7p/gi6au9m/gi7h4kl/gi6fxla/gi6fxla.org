I either disagree on the definition of "capitalism" used here, or on historical, social and philosophical grounds. I can certainly think of ways for abolitionism, in the story context, leading to better gains than keeping the images enslaved, in much the same ways teaching people to use better and more expensive tools is more productive than throwing more bodies at the same task. For one the story does not broach what happens when the virtual ones interconnect with in-the-flesh people - surely someone will, at some point, connect the images to the Internet.

Dealing with entropy or scarcity is not the same as having the product or value of your work being owned by someone else. The former is natural, the latter is man-made.

And in the context of the story here, scarcity can be practically removed from the simulations...
