I'm wrong on what? I'm not denying anything of what you're saying; I'm denying that it is an inherent problem with capitalism. In fact, while capitalism has had slavery (and to an extent, still does today), slavery vastly predates it. Feudalism was based on serfdom, which while not being slavery still required some significant restrictions of personal freedom. And before that, the Roman Empire had something that's hard to define if not as a servile economy; an economy whose very foundation was the enslavement of large groups of people and the plunder of their resources, to the point that it basically started collapsing when it ran out of lands to conquer. And the reduction in economic efficiency is subjective. Sure, you're doing less work than you would with two willing laborers. But the slave is the one who suffers a net loss, while you still get a gain. Slavery, like theft or murder, exists as long as the opportunity for it is there and someone with no scruples takes advantage of it.
