I was objecting to the 'obvious benefits' bit. Slavery actually benefits nobody because of how much it holds humanity back. How many potential brilliant scientists have died in a ditch somewhere because they were born to slaves? What could they have produced, which would have pushed humanity further than it is even now? I honestly, truly believe, that even the slaveholders of the American traitor states would have been /better off/ if slavery had never been a thing, because we might be centuries ahead of where we were by then.

These systems manage to even oppress the oppressors, is what I'm saying. It binds them to a status quo which is worse than what it could be even for them.
