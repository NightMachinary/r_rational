  But this is exactly what you expect of capitalism.

I think this is a problem that runs a bit deeper than capitalism. In any economic system, having free human labor accessible even at the individual level would provide obvious benefits. You get more labor, hence more stuff done, which raises your standards of living. If such a thing is possible and cheap, the only thing stopping you would be morals. Reasonably, a certain percentage of people will not let morals stop them. Especially if there are no actual social consequences for the infractions, or if you can easily get away with it anyway.
