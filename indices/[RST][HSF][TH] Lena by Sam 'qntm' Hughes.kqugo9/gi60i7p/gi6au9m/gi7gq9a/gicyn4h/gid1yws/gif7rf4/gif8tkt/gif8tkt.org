This is a bit different though, you're reasoning in terms of "we evolved so and so and are optimised for certain conditions". But for example we did NOT co-evolve with SARS-CoV-2, so aspiring to developing natural immunity for it is nonsense, vaccines are obviously the way to go. The naturalistic fallacy is seeing nature as better by default, or worse, investing it of some kind of superior moral quality. Which leads to genius takes such as "no AI could possibly be as worthy of rights as a human because it's not natural" or "you should just keep the sex you were born with regardless of how shit that makes you feel".
