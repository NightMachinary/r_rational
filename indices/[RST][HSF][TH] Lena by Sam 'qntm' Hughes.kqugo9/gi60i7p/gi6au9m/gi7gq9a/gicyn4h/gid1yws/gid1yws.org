  how much the Overton window is established on the balance of the idea that an uploads is a person vs a upload is a arbitrarially long number.

I really wouldn't hold my breath there. We're deep to our neck into "machines can't possibly be people" rhetoric. Everyone who's religious and believes in a soul has all reasons to believe in organic supremacy, so to speak. Naturalistic fallacies are incredibly hard to kill, and worse, in some cases even progressive forces have opted to roll with them (and thus feed them) rather than run counter the tremendous cultural barrier that they constitute - arguably one of the worst beliefs weighing us down. Consider how many people keep arguing in all seriousness something as stupid as "we should let ourselves catch diseases because natural immunity is TEH BEST". You would have a really really hard time convincing anyone that simulated brains are people. It took various centuries to convince most whites that black people are people, and even then, not everyone is convinced yet.

Consider this - for all we know, we might have /right now/ machines that edge on sentience. We don't really know what sentience even is, after all. Is a cat sentient? Is a mouse? A bug, in a very simple, basic way? We certainly have neural networks that exceed the complexity of some of the simpler invertebrates. Didn't they simulate the full connectome of a worm some time ago and put it into a LEGO robotic body? Depending on where the line is drawn, we could already be doing whatever the hell we want with things that, were they made of neurons and flesh, would already be subject to basic animal rights protection laws if for example used for experiments.
