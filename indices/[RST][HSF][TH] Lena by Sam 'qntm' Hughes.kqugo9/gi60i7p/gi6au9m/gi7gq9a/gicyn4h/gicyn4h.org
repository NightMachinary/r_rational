  Dunno, in this scenario, isn't that as hard as abolishing digital piracy? Slave plantations are harder to hide than a few files on a PC.

I bet a lot of it will depend on: how legally protected the digital slavery is, how many free uploads there are, and how much the Overton window is established on the balance of the idea that an uploads is a person vs a upload is a arbitrarially long number.

On the plus side this is one of the few times I'm heartened by the idea of cooperate personhood. A corporation that owns your upload and is responsible to a trust established to execute per your uploads wishes, with a lot of additional safeties in place so the executor cant act against your upload's wishes and measures for copy-clan arbitration may cost more than your runtime, but it's at least a path to functional personhood, if you secure the original IP rights and that's a hell of an if.
