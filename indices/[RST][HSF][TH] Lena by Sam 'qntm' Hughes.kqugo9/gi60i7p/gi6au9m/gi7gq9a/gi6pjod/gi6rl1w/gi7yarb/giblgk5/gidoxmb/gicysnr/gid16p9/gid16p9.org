I don't know the details of Roko's arguments besides the Basilisk. My point is - if there is no way to avert this sort of outcome (namely: if human brains or equivalent sapient AGIs are indeed possible to mass produce and run on relatively cheap hardware, and then simple economics will do the rest), then there's actually a serious ethical argument for why technological process is intrinsically and unavoidably evil. Not for the minority of fleshy human beings who might as well live in a post-scarcity paradise at that point, but for the infinitely larger amount of digital entities who would slave away and suffer at their whim (though that might not be the case if said entities are true AIs and not uploaded human brains).
