My point is you're giving too much importance to the opinions of individuals. Bezos may not be outright pro-slavery but he's not especially active in fighting it either, or work conditions in his company wouldn't be so shitty. That's not slavery but it doesn't show great concern for the well-being of the masses either, or for business ethics. But regardless of that - take Bill Gates, who I think is more unequivocally a pretty okay guy. It's not like he can somehow prevent people from doing bad shit by himself. He funded vaccine development like crazy but that alone doesn't solve COVID-19, right?

In the scenario depicted by this story or any equivalent one, it doesn't really matter what a number of powerful and rich individuals think. Even if they all were horrified by these sort of applications, enough to actually put resources towards stopping them - not just exclaiming "oh, the humanity!" and then going on about their day - well, it's still not enough. Even just straight up criminal underworld applications would be enough to accrue hundreds of billions of subjective slavery-hours, much more misery than all sweatshops and sex slavery rings can create right now. And that's the best case scenario, where only the worst scum of the Earth uses these methods, and I don't believe that would be the case.
