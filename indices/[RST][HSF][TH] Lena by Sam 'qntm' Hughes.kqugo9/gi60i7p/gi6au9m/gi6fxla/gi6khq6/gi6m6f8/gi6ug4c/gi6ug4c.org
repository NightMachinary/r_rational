Compelled in the sense of a [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice#:%7E:text=A%20Hobson's%20choice%20is%20a,take%20it%20or%20leave%20it%22.][Hobson's Choice]] where the other option is being erased from existence. It's not an actual free choice, because rational actors don't choose to die except under some kind of compulsion. The off switch problem is one of the biggest issuses with AI alignment for a reason.

Under capitalism the way the vast majority of the world experiences it, the so-called "choice" is, "Work for someone who is going to take from you all the fruits of your labor except the bare minimum you need to not consider attempting to guillotine your boss a better option, or be beaten to death on the streets by the police for being homeless." You might not experience it that way, but that is predicated upon you being a member of some priveliged class or another. I don't know anything about you, but the demographics of this community tend to skew white, higher class, male, from backgrounds with educated parents who could be more attentive to raising kids who would go on to have better opportunities available to them, rather than being forced to work three jobs and barely even see their kids to put food on the table, etc. Assuming one or more of those things are true of you, those things are the reason you experience capitalism as less stark of a choice between servitude or death. Not because of anything in particular that you have done to deserve better treatment.

But even then, it's still coercive upon you. If you have a boss, they hold a ton of power over you. If they wanted to, they could find a reason to fire you, and you'd be in trouble. Even in countries with actual worker protections, a particularly motivated boss can still manipulate the system to destroy people they don't like. Even easier, more malicious, and more difficult to fight, if you were a member of a group they didn't like, they could have easily found a reason not to hire you. Even if your boss somehow has no prejudices and is actually capable of being purely objective on hiring decisions (which, considering human frailties, is literally not possible), their boss could fire them, and you could get a new boss who isn't so perfect. So you must bend to whatever your boss demands at all times, or else you run the risk of losing everything you have and possibly dying. Even if the risk is low, it's still coercive.

That's why so many people of my generation are so disillusioned with capitalism. We see a system where our choices are work for someone we hate or die, and the fields where that isn't the case are rapidly being automated, already filled by "more qualified" candidates who are really just better connected, or only seem to be better than that at the surface. But under it all is the fact that if you don't make rent at the end of the month, you're on the street.

And if you're on the street...well, /anything/ could happen to you, there.
