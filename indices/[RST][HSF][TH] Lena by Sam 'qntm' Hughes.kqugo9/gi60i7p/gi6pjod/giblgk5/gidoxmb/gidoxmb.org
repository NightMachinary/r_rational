TBF it's all talk about worst-case scenarios and assumptions of maximal malice. People, in general, probably wouldn't set up ~eternal torture of an mind upload even if they were able to do so.

Present is already pretty /scary/ with this mindset. If someone wanted to torture people, just for the sake of it, they'd have high chance of success if they're minimally competent.

We're just mostly relying on trust that people around us aren't going to kidnap us for no reason.

'Kidnapping" a mind upload is of course much, much worse through.

Also, ethically, world can be unfathomably bad anyway, and there might be nothing possible to do to fix it. If many-words interpretation of QM is correct, and identity/consciousness doesn't work in a surprising way, quantum immortality is true. Which, if you couple it with heat death of the universe means inevitable personal hell for everyone. Even ignoring consequences of many-words QM, there's nature of existence problem; what if all possible universes exist?
