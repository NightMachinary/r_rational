Eh lets flip that; what Billionaire can you name who is pro slavery? I didn't follow up when I the headhunters from Amazon came but even with the poor fulfillment center metric driven working conditions I think we have a open and shut case that Musk and Besos don't support slavery.

The more important thing is Musk is a believer Neuralink is a few generations from anything useful IMHO, but Musk is paving a path to being an upload. Getting recognition that you are still a human will probably be important to him personally, and any other plutocrat that wants to extend their life indefinitely while still controlling the power they have built.
