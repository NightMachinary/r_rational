For those of us signed up for cryonics or planning that way, what legal machinery have you set up to preclude this, or other forms of mind capture?

I see all of this discussion of capitalism, but I see a basic failure in lawafare where the logical extension of rights never happened implied in a few short phrases: "who had been scanned involuntarily" "A series of landmark U.S. court decisions found that Acevedo did not have the right to control how his brain image was used, with the result that MMAcevedo is now by far the most widely distributed, frequently copied, and closely analysed human brain image." (US 5th amendment; if your intellect isn't your intellectual property well. . ., and probably a 1st amendment violation if Catholicism goes the anti-upload way most authors expect it will); "red-washing, blue-washing," (yup no personhood recognition for uploads so no 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment).

A more hopeful counterpoint is of course DataPacRat's: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/mobilebasic][FAQ on LoadBear's Instrument of Precommitment]]
