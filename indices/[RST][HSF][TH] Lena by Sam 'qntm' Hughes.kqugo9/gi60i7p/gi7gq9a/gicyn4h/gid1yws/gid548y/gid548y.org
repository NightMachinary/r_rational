Here's hoping the trend of Sci-Fi leading societal change a-la [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_and_Uhura%27s_kiss][Kirk and Uhuru's kiss]] continues. We have: Upload, Altered Carbon, The Good place, and many other shows starting to explore these plots; and I hope to live long enough to see Glasshouse make it to the small screen.
