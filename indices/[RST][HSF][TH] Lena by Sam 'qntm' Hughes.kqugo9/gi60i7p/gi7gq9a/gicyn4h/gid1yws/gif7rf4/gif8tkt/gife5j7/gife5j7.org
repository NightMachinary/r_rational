It's a heuristic. Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. (Or more importantly, it can be 'wrong' most of the time, but right the one time that the 'unnatural' (i.e. new) thing would have killed you. Again, someone reluctant to take new medicines takes large opportunity costs... until they're the one who refuses thalidomide.)

"The farmer won't eat what he doesn't know", because the people in this region too fond of eating/trying new things died.

(To be extra cold, someone running "you should keep the sex you were born with" is more likely to pass on their genes than someone running the counterexample.)

It doesn't matter if they're right or wrong, what matters is how well the strategies work and thus why these heuristics exist and persist in people. Viewing things in this light seems more interesting than taking moralizing rationalizations at face value.
