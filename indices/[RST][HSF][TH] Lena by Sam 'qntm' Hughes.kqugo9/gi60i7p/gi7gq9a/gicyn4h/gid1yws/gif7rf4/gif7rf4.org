  we should let ourselves catch diseases because natural immunity is TEH BEST
#+end_quote

Kids raised in sterile environments have their immune systems grow malformed, which is why allergy rates in developed countries are vastly above developing ones- we're calibrated for a certain rate of pathogen-invasion, and if the immune system doesn't see that, it oversensitizes.

You should let your kids roll around in the mud every now and again if you don't want them to die from eating a peanut. The naturalistic heuristic exists because it's sometimes/often right- or rather, there's low-probability but high-severity risks in novelty.\\
Most of the new things might be fine, but it only takes one- say you get a job painting radium clocks- to kill you. Most of those foreign tribes are fine, but it only takes one to give you a disease you're not resistant to and wipe you out.
