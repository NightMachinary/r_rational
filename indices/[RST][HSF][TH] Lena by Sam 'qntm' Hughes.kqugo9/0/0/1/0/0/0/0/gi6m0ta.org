Personally, I oppose the concept of 'intellectual property' precisely because of the artificiality of the scarcity it causes. Others may have utilitarian arguments for that too but I'm not familiar with them.

Note I don't dispute [[/u/Frommerman]]'s stating slavery still exists in several forms nor that it's taken advantage of by capitalist economies.
