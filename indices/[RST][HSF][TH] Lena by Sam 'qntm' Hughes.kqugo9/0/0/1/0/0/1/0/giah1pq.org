#+begin_quote
  unnecessary packaging
#+end_quote

Is it really all unnecessary ? Mind that it might be performing more functions than you think (and not just as packaging).

#+begin_quote
  use of resources to feed luxury foods to a few people instead
#+end_quote

Instead, or in addition to, or as well as ?

#+begin_quote
  hoarding of certain metals and minerals to inflate prices
#+end_quote

In my experience the banking sector has no need for stockpiles of gold, haven't had any such need for decades now, and has even invented virtual stockpiles through ETFs. They can manipulate metal prices just fine already.

#+begin_quote
  stalling in the automation sector
#+end_quote

How so ? I would be interested to read more on this.

(Edit) it's funny that you left out the cartelization of finance as an example of hoarding causing higher prices. I can't wait for decentralized finance solutions to wipe the banksters off the face of Earth.
