I can think of rational reasons to want to cease existing, but that involves metaphysics.

  you experience capitalism as less stark of a choice between servitude or death.

I have been homeless and jobless and basically "socially non-existent" in my 20s, for months on. I consider myself an anarchist, I have defied authorities and got in trouble for it before. I agree that there is a continuum from servitude to the salaried position I have at the moment. However I attribute the 'dead on the pavement' option more as a consequence of the persistent willingness, among my fellow primates, to take by force at all, than any rationalization or institutionalization of the same urge. In other words we only have the rights we're willing to escalate for.

I think ownership of the production means has been largely [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture][regulatorily recaptured]] by a socially-reproducing undeserving elite.
