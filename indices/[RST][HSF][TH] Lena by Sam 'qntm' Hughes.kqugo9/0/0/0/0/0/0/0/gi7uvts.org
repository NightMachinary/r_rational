  Slavery actually benefits nobody because of how much it holds humanity back. How many potential brilliant scientists have died in a ditch somewhere because they were born to slaves?

Ehh, that's kind of a game theory thing. Yes, collectively, humanity might benefit without it (I'm not sure that's always precisely the case, especially in antiquity, for example, when even without slavery it's likely there would have been a large underclass in subsistence conditions anyway). But the individual gets an immediate edge. Is it short-term? Sure. But short term individual gains over long term collective ones are a bane of our history again and again. It's kind of a variant of the tragedy of the commons, where the commons are less technologically or politically advanced people that you can just coerce at minimal cost to yourself.
