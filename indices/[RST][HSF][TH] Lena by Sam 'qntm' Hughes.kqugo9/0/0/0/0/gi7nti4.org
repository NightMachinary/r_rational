I think you're just wrong here. You can't get free human labor except through coercion, and that coercion represents both a reduction in economic efficiency and an obvious moral failing. In this example, the coercion comes from the fact that you can threaten to torture the sim for subjective centuries if they fail to comply, and it's obviously true that this threat is a real one.
