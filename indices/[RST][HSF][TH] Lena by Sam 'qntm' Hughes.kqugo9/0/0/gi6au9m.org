But this is exactly what you expect of capitalism. If they can create a workforce which necessarily subsists on a substrate entirely controlled by the ownership class, you can fucking bet they'll make exactly that.

Remember that we haven't even abolished slavery. Not really. For one, effective slavery is still entirely legal in many countries, and many of our consumer goods are made in those places. Second, we're still allowed to enslave prisoners in the US, even when the only conceivable beneficiary of the enslavement is a private corporation. Third, chattel slavery by birth or race may have been abolished, but nearly everyone is still compelled to work on pain of starvation. We have enough resources not to need so many workers, as has been conclusively proven by employment statistics during the pandemic, but our society is structured such that automation of positions /hurts people./
