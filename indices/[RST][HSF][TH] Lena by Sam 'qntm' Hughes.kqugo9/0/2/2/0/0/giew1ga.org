  People, in general, probably wouldn't set up ~eternal torture of an mind upload even if they were able to do so.
#+end_quote

No, but they would do it for funsies or to see what happens for a while. And others would simply put the mind to work for them, reassured by the thought that "it's not a real person".

Look at what we do to farm animals. Pigs are quite smart. And if it was possible and useful to us, we'd do it to dolphins and chimpanzees on a similar scale, even though they have awareness high enough to be comparable to ours.

  We're just mostly relying on trust that people around us aren't going to kidnap us for no reason.
#+end_quote

Trust but also a very high barrier to access. Keeping someone kidnapped, hidden, fed, unable to escape, and getting away with it is hard. Keeping a file on your hard drive is much easier. The bigger the crime, the more people need to be in on the conspiracy or at least willing to let it slide, and thus the harder for the crime to be committed. How many people might own pedopornographic material and we will never even know about it?

  Also, ethically, world can be unfathomably bad anyway, and there might be nothing possible to do to fix it. If many-words interpretation of QM is correct, and identity/consciousness doesn't work in a surprising way, quantum immortality is true. Which, if you couple it with heat death of the universe means inevitable personal hell for everyone. Even ignoring consequences of many-words QM, there's nature of existence problem; what if all possible universes exist?

That is a different issue, and one that would be out of our control. Though thinking about this made me go on a different tangent. Suppose MW is true. Then there are certainly infinite (albeit an infinitesimal fraction of the total) futures in which I keep surviving, against all odds, billions of years old, in an empty universe. However there are also infinite (albeit an even smaller infinitesimal fraction of the total) futures in which entropy spontaneously reverses and I exist on an Earth-like planet, quite well off. Now, while /getting/ there is a lot more unlikely, /staying/ in that branch of the wavefunction is a lot easier, because now we don't need to offset the instant-by-instant near certainty of me dying in the vacuum of space. My wavefunction is vanishing exponentially in the "heat death" branch, but propagates steadily in time and branches out in the "entropy reversed" branch, thus causing it to weigh a lot more in the total. Enough to offset its initial improbability? Hard to say. The final outcome is one of those tricky sums over an infinite number of infinitesimally small terms, and in cases like this, the actual functions matter.
