Oof i don't see how you could you possibly prepare for that other than perhaps a simple will stating what you'd like to happen in a bunch of hypothetical scenarios.. Doing cryo is a bet that the future is either alive-and-good, or dead.

If we have the future where you get revived but with a legal system which is as insane as our current one is, it would be pretty tough to predict what specific forms that insanity would take and to guard against it.

It would be pretty surprising and disappointing to me if humans couldn't manage to make a reasonably good future /even with/ brain uploading level tech. We should be well into post scarcity by then.
