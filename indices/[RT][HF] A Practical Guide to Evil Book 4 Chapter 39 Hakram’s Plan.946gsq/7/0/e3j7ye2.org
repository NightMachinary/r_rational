Well, let's piece together what we know.

Malicia is presumed to be in Keter to negotiate with The Dead King. Cat's negotiations cannot win over hers, so they choose to find Malicia, assassinate her, and usurp her bargaining power. They have a number of problems to overcome. First, where is Malicia? In Chapter 37, the crew figures out she's in a neighboring palace set aside for visitors, called The Threefold Reflection:

#+begin_quote
  There were five in whole, forming a circle interrupted by the same number of avenues going into the city-fortress. The Silent Palace, our own, was slightly to the left of the gates into the Hall.

  “Which one?” I asked.

  Indrani jabbed her finger onto the parchment. Slightly to the right, on the opposite side of the black stone spire.

  “The Threefold Reflection,” I said.
#+end_quote

The first problem is that the palace has some wizardly bullshit at work making navigating it a pain:

#+begin_quote
  “The place is... unsettling,” Archer said, grabbing the seat across from me. “The layout is wrong. Hallways lead where they shouldn't: I went through the same threshold twice and ended up in different places both times. I'd call it a maze, but you can map out a maze. There's wizardly bullshit at play here I think might rule that out.”
#+end_quote

The second issue is that it's defended by a Revenant, a necromanced dead Named. When Cat meets Edward VII, he reveals this, though not the name of the Named who now guards The Threefold Reflection (which is a pyramid shape):

#+begin_quote
  “So there's a former Named guarding all five palaces,” I said.

  “Indeed,” he agreed. “Though the Abomination changes the watchers at a whim. The Bloody Sword once kept vigil over the *that unpleasant pyramid* beyond the Garden, but has since been replaced. Other than I, the only one who has remained for more than a century is *the Thief of Stars.*”
#+end_quote

This conversation reveals a third problem. Not only does a Named Revenant guard Malicia's temporary abode, one guards the Woe's as well. This is the Thief of Stars, which Cat notes with a chill, they haven't even seen yet.

#+begin_quote
  So we'd had a heroine with a talent for discretion breathing down our neck the entire time without a single one of us noticing. Lovely. This assassination plot was already getting off to a great start.
#+end_quote

So those are the problems the Woe face: they need to take out the Thief of Stars so she can't sound an alarm when they make their move; they need to find out who the Named in charge of The Threefold Reflection is and counter it; they need to navigate the pyramid, and they need to kill Malicia once they get to her.

The plan to do this isn't revealed (because revealing a plan means it's doomed to fail, [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnspokenPlanGuarantee][according to tropes]]). But we can assume some things:

The Woe discover that one of the Revenants is Named Skein, and another is Named Spellblade. Per chapter 38:

#+begin_quote
  */Skein/*/./ */Thief of/* /--/ that was probably meant to be a star, but I wasn't exactly an artist. Shoddy work, Past Catherine, you could have asked Hakram for help. And, to end it, */Spellblade/*/./
#+end_quote

We don't know how they discovered this, but it sounds like they did a first run, got caught by Skein's prophetic powers right away, and then retooled the plan to try and bypass the seer's foresight by executing a plan hidden even to themselves.

#+begin_quote
  That did explain why apparently whatever the plan was it had to be kept secret even from us. Maybe they could only predict through conscious decisions?
#+end_quote

The plan thus far seems to be this:

- The details of the plan are forgotten by the Woe to avoid Skein's ability to predict their movements. Or at least they are forgotten by Adjutant, Thief, Hierophant, and Cat herself. Cat has some cards hidden in black ice that open at later points to guide them forward, with one still remaining.
- To counter the Thief of Stars, Cat gathers the Woe together, ices the room to reveal her, and then had Thief +Yoink!+ *Hold* her in her pocket dimension of stolen booty.
- Archer and Akua are away elsewhere doing... something. Presumably they are either meant to counter one of the other problems, find more information, or run interference. My guess is that Akua is working on the enchantments of The Threefold Reflection, being an awesome magic user, while Archer is probably going to counter Spellblade, being an awesome fighter.
- The remaining members of the Woe set fire to their own palace, which pulls away the patrols that would otherwise see them entering The Threefold Reflection, as well as giving them an excuse to leave their palace together and head to another one for temporary accommodations.
- Thief leaves right after, likely to work another angle like Akua and Archer.
- The remaining members enter The Threefold Reflection, which has three gates. While it only mentions Hakram and Cat splitting up to enter through different gates, presumably Masego will take the last one. My guess here is that The Threefold Reflection, besides having non-Euclidean magicky bullshit going on (which Akua will be trying to counter), probably is three different versions of the palace overlapped. By each of the Woe taking separate gates, the odds are one of them will get to Malicia. Narrative says it's Cat, but we'll have to see. No idea what the plan is to take her out once there, but I'm guessing the last card Cat has will help with it.

I think that's about it... any clearer?
