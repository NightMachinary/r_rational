Anyone else think the bit with the cards is more than just a plan? Shuffling some of them up before distributing them could make for a plan so chaotic it couldn't be predicted: the plan only forms as they learn what card they have.

Set up a series of tasks that could be performed by multiple members of the Woe, and have some cards be conditional (like the card Cat had about "go find Archer if you don't have the Thief of Stars") to let some of the cards essentially inform each other.

You wind up with a plan with many "points of failure," but with conditionals you could have built in contingencies against failure.

Obviously some tasks are limited to a few members, but this theory would explain why the plan wasn't "have Hierophant set fire to the building;" it was not certain that he would be present.
