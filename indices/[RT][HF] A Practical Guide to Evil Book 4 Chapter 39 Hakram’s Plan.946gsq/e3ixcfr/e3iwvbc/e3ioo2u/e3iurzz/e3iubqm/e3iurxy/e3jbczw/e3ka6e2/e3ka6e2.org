I think she playing a Role. There are plenty of stories where a character is a part of a plan they do not know and slowly learns how it all fits together like a detective story. Only instead of being a pawn or unwitting third party she is also the mastermind of the plan. Basically she gets the benefits of making a plan with the added condition that she also has to learn the plan, which she can only do by successfully progressing the steps. Thus Fate makes sure she can progress until all is revealed because not learning what the actual plot was is practically unheard of in stories.

Archer and Akua act like the controller and hidden dagger respectively, meaning they have someone to nudge the story in the right course and another one to be the hidden trump card that wins the day. And Cat has basically told herself with the first rune that Akua is the controller and Archer the trump, but it's actually opposite which means everything has to succeed for that reveal. Thus she has weight on her success in every single part of the endeavor and even if something fails she has to get her memories back the way she planned it. So she has to come to the finishing stretch where the hidden dagger twist will give her weight to kill Malicia/The Simulacrum.
