i just want it on record that the plan is that there actually is no plan at all, they've just given themselves random tasks and busy work to appear like there's a plot afoot and then when malicia the master planner "figures out" their plan and pre-emptively ambushes or attacks them before they can pull it off, that was all according to plan and then they all gang up on her outside the dead kings protection somehow.
