Reminds me of that clich√© in movies/books where if the plan is explained to the viewer directly before it is carried out, then the plan will fail. However, if the plan is being explained to the viewer /as/ it's being carried out then it will succeed

EDIT: Just saw that the comment right below me has a link to that specific trope (Unspoken Plan Guarantee)
