Oh, I must have misread it. Looks like each volume uses a single semester, not a year. That still makes simulacrum use up more than 4 years given the prerequisite, but I think it's the only one like that.

Given the way that the defensive magic seems to work, I think the best combo against human mages is strength plus telekinetic hand. Become stronger, then punch people at range. Both spells have unlimited use, so you can pretty quickly exhaust all their defenses. After that, mobility is all that can be used as a defense, and there aren't that many mobility spells.

Edit: Nevermind, the time stop spell and deport object are both monstrously overpowered. Blink plus time stop gives you a few unobstructed seconds to attack someone from above or behind. Deport object means you can teleport a bomb behind their shield.
