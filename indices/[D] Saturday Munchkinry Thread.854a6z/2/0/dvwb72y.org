That's a lot of options to choose from.

Blink seems like it would be good regardless of what you're doing. Dodging an attack, getting past an obstacle, teleporting behind someone. The long range teleport would only be good if there's no good transportation technology.

Mind blank seems like it is essentially required. A single skill to block an entire section of offensive abilities? Simple choice. If you want an offensive ability in the mind magic tree, fury seems like it would be good. Otherwise it's a weak tree if it's so easily blocked.

The two shield abilities are necessary for anyone who might want to go into combat. Absorption seems extremely useful for everyone, because it hard counters lots of abilities and then you have additional offensive options. It also allows you to use an ally's abilities if they cast a spell on you for you to use later.

Self healing seems like another necessary skill to learn.

Telekinetic hand seems really good. Reach things that are too far away, grab things in dangerous location, slap/strangle someone from a distance. Really good utility from a single spell.

I'm really unsure on directly offensive magic. Way too many choices with not enough detail. Given the way the shield magic works, I think simple and highly recastable magics are the best. You can exhaust their defensive options before you run out yourself. Extremely destructive magics would be highly situational.

I think this list needs to be rebalanced and cut down a lot. For one thing, some abilities take too long to learn for the given college style curriculum. Self healing is 2 years, healing touch another three, and then there are abilities that have healing touch as a prerequisite? You need to attend an additional year just to learn the first move that heals someone else. There are other spells that are 3 years to learn and have a two year spell as a prerequisite. Second, some of these spells are obviously not useful or just completely not worth the opportunity cost. Two years for freshness? The memo spell? Unearth? Grow tentacles? Seeing in the dark is an okay ability that can be made obsolete by someone bringing a torch or flashlight. Throwing lightning bolts isn't. Remove the redundant and mostly useless spells, and you'd have a much more manageable list, because some spells simply aren't worth the investment given the costs and other options.
