I'm not sure what the limits of miniaturization are--the device shouldn't be noticeable if it's going to work. The harder part might be convincing enough likely targets to take the device.

If his spies inform him of the device's existence, he would hesitate to take new bodies in the field. That's successful hindrance, if it doesn't succeed in stopping him outright.
