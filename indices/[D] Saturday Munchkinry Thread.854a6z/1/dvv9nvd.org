*Reverse Munchkin: Probability control*

A character in my RPG universe might come to be at odds with the players. How can they beat this guy?

- Can control probability to nigh incalculable degrees. Can make something astronomically improbable a certainty by mere will alone. This has a limit, which is his own awareness. As an example, he can stir his finger in a cup of room temperature water, coalesce all of the coldest molecules into ice cubes, then remove the ice cubes leaving a cup of hot water behind.
- Can see all probable outcomes of any event out to some arbitrary deviation, say z=10.
- Can impose superpositions on the macro scale; can be in multiple places at once, doing multiple things at once. This has no spatial limit - can be anywhere in the universe of which the character is aware. Each superposition of himself is aware of everything each superposition is doing. His abilities maintain full potency with each superposition, though there is a limit to how many he can maintain at once (he is not infinitely aware).
- He is hundreds of millions of years old and leads the most powerful intergalactic civilization in the observable universe. He is extremely experienced, extremely intelligent, and has almost limitless resources.
