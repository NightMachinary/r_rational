- It would be very easy to use the power to negatively affect people's mental health (e.g. horrific nightmares every night) which could be used to remove them from positions of power. However this would require the ability to be kept secret unless the target has no way of negatively affecting me
- Selling good dreams to people would be an easy source of income, especially if I can target groups like "everyone who paid me online today"
- The dreams could be used as inexpensive training, especially for dangerous situations that are hard to train for normally. If the power can induce lucid dreaming this would be even more effective
- Having full control over people's perceptions could be a useful tool to treat mental problems
- With unlimited group targeting ability I could eliminate negative dreams entirely from humanity, though this could have effects on mental development
