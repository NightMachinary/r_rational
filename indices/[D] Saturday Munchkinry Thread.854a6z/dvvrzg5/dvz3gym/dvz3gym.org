This build: is permanently guarded by both an animated shadow and guardian spirit augmented by alertness and excellent vision, has a full suite of permanent body enhancements, is capable of surviving comfortably in most environments both on land and aquatic, is capable of traveling quickly over water via Water Walking and Crashing Wave, is capable of attacking at short range via telekinetically wielded daggers drawn from a holding space and obscured via bright lights and covering illusions, and is difficult to attack via non-homing means thanks to the combination of after images and covering illusions.

Major weaknesses I've noticed include a lack of teleportation to escape from binds or traps, and a lack of antimagic or shields to counter attacks that the baffles don't stop.
