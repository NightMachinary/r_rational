  Selling good dreams to people would be an easy source of income

Yes! Once you've proved to the public that your power is legit, you'll be an overnight millionaire. Each time a purchase goes through, the customer gets a "dream token" specific to the dream they purchased. You can go through the list of dream tokens targeting the group of people who possess that token. The way I envision the power to work, it would be like this: you maintain a list of about 80 different dream storylines that people can purchase online. I say 80 because, assuming that it takes at most 3 minutes to use your power on one set of people for one dream storyline, you can work about 4 hours a day. You can have different subscription models, too. People can make one-time purchases for a higher price, or experience regular dreams for a monthly fee. You can rotate the dream storylines and put them into categories like adventure, lucid, sexual, etc. You can hire dream writers to make dream series with ongoing storylines. You can reserve some slots for high-paying clients who want to craft their own custom dream storylines.

Aaaand now I want an actual story involving this, because this sounds awesome.
