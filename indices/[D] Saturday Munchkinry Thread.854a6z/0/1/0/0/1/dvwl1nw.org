If only I had time to write such a story!

Other uses of the power, sorted by good vs. evil:

*Good*

Attempt to mend human divisions and create world peace by giving groups that hate each other positive dreams about each other. In fact, just give such positive dreams to everyone. It may help to make the dreams seem like they are coming from God, though that may lead to other problems.

Use dreams as an emergency broadcast system. Send instructions to people in regions without power or communication. Send instructions or messages to people who have gone missing, in the hopes of helping them out of whatever situation they are in. Give the entire world population advice on problem-solving and mental models for rational decision-making.

Use dreams therapeutically to treat criminals and people with mental illness.

Help neuroscientists perform experiments via dreams.

*Somewhat evil*

See how much you can mess with random people. Give people the most insane dreams you can think of, and laugh at their confusion. Give your childhood bully horrifying nightmares. Give homophobic conservatives gay sex dreams. Give your friends prophetic dreams about what will happen the next day, and make those things happen.

Give everyone on earth dreams from "God," establish a new religion, and see how many ridiculous things you can make people do.

*Very evil*

Hold nations hostage by giving them horrific dreams until they do something for you, or vote a certain way.

Give everyone layered dreams in which they seem to wake up many times within the dream. See how long it takes for everyone to always think they are in a dream.
