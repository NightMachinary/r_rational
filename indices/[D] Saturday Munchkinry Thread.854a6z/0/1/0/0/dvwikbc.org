You could write an interesting Death Note type story as long as The Dreamweaver kept their identity secret. They prove their powers to people by asking them what they want to dream, then making them dream it, all over the Dark Web, using numerous layers of security, and only communicating over free WiFi. Knowledge of your capabilities will spread rapidly, rapidly giving you a customer base and tons of money.

Then, you start giving constant horrific nightmares to the leaders of terrorist and criminal organizations. Ideally, the content would be something like being tortured for as long as you can dilate time, by their chosen deities, in penance for their sins. Every time someone steps up to replace the gibbering mess of the old leader, the curse passes to them. Eventually, the organizations would implode for lack of leadership.

This would get you in the good books of normals everywhere, but it would terrify all world governments. Once you start going political, you should cease all online communication with your customers. People can still make requests on a public forum, but you would have discretion. You'd probably grant dreams to, say, pedophiles asking for release in dreams, or other clear net-good situations. However, using dreams to communicate with people directly is dangerous because you would have to make sure your language can't be traced back to you, so all further dreams must only be for the purposes you set forth.

From there, you start slowly nudging society into the shape you want, one nightmare (or absurdly pleasant dream) at a time. You never go after people in prisons with the nightmare campaigns, always leadership only, to minimize contact points and make it far harder for them to perform experiments on you.

Of course, every intelligence agency everywhere is now on the hunt for you. You can avoid the Silkroad problem by never communicating electronically, but they might still be able to hack your former electronic communications. You have money now, so you can disappear in your current identity, get plastic surgery to look like someone else, and buy a nice house in a sleepy town somewhere.
