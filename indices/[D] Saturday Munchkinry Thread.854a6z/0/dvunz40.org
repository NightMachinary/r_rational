You now have "Inception Power." You can exert complete control over the content of people's dreams. Assume initially that there is no limit on your ability to exert this power: you can control the dreams of anyone or everyone in the world, as many times as you want. You can't exceed the normal range of physiological effects of dreams - for example, you can't overwrite people's minds, cause their hearts to stop if they are otherwise healthy, or force people to remember dreams that they would normally forget - but otherwise you have full control. (So for example, you could get people to remember a specific dream by turning the ending into a nightmare, forcing them to wake up early).

What fun and interesting things can you do with this? Feel free to strengthen or weaken the power to give the most interesting results.
