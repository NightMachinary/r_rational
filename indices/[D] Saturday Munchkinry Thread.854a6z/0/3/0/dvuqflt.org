My intent with the "feel free to strengthen or weaken" sentence was to allow you to make up your own answer to this, and proceed from there.

I'm assuming by default that you do not have superintelligent enhancement when using the power, just your own ordinary intelligence. You can target sets of people that you can coherently specify in your mind. For example, you can target everyone, or a specific person, or people on a specific continent, or people of a specific gender, etc. (the power takes care of fuzzy edge cases for you automatically, but not necessarily in a way that you would approve of). As for dream content, you can spend some time crafting a story that's as elaborate as you want, and then each dreamer fills in the rest of the details. You can form a queue of dreams: e.g., "Group 1 dreams X tonight, group 2 dreams Y tonight." Each use of the power on a group takes a few minutes to complete, so the limit on this queueing is your own mental exhaustion.
