Set up an online store selling some self-help ebook. Buy high ad placement just for 1 day, tomorrow. Then, targeting people in first-world countries, send them dreams of clicking on my book ad and living lives of luxury and success. The next morning, a ton of these people will see this exact ad on Facebook, Google, etc. They recognize it, and a reasonable percentage, 5%? buy it. Tada, millions of dollars.

Even better alternative, if you have time: Start marketing agency. Refuse to specify your methods, contracts pay you a % of sales difference between last year and this year. Very cheap, so people will take the risk. When hired, start giving a random 1% of target market dreams of this amazing product each night. Within a year, get a reputation for being mysterious but highly effective. Again, make millions.
