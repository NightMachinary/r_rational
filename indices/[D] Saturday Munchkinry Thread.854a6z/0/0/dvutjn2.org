It would give you lots of influence over religious leaders, since you can convince them that their deity told them to do something/not do something in a dream. Similarly for anyone particularly religious in a position of power.

Aside from people liable to give credence to information or instructions in dreams, you could possibly subtly influence how people react by having them experience nightmares where whatever they had previously decided on goes horribly wrong. For a positive example, showing someone nightmares about a life of financial ruin because they got caught up in a pyramid scheme or time share.

For influencing groups, you could cause some effect by giving huge numbers of people a very specific dream all at once. How would the world react to every single person in France having the exact same dream of a stock market crash, or a natural disaster? Like the effect literally stops at the border. It would be interesting to watch the analysis on that.

Finally, you could give your friends/family/pets dreams of nice things you intend to do to them. Give your dog dreams of steak, and then give him one the next day.
