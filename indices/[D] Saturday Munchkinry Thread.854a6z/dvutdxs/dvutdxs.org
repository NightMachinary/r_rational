You have the ability to switch minds with people. In order to do this you must be touching the person (skin contact or better) and you must will for it to happen (so you can't accidentally switch). The ability works by instantly overwriting the connections in the brain, therefore if the target doesn't have a similar enough brain structure for your mind to be accurately replicated (e.g. has had parts of their brain removed or has a mental disease) then the ability won't work. The ability is also transferred with your mind. How do you best utilize this?
