Personally, I'm in the "a copy is not the original" school and as nice as it might be to imagine a sequence of versions of myself living on in other bodies, a murder/suicide pair every time I use this power is quite discouraging.

Ignoring that, this is still a /very/ difficult power to use in morally sound ways. If you swap forever only to people who consent completely, the advantages are largely in how the change allows deception on your part or theirs. If they don't consent, the situation gets monstrous fast... as you have to figure out how to either overpower your old body or restrain it beforehand.

At best, I suppose, you can facilitate permanent swaps between consenting people who want to relieve whatever complementary dysphorias they possess.
