Continuity of consciousness. I'm not satisfied that there's another mind that thinks like me. I'm not satisfied that my body lives on without my memories. I want the particular continuous conscious experience my memory outlines.

I can imagine, theoretically, having my brain swapped /and then swapped back/ as a very strange case of dreaming and amnesia... a bit of forgotten experience as someone else and a bit of added memory of whatever "I' experienced in somebody else's body. But I definitely cannot be myself in somebody else's body. I'm them, temporarily convinced they're me. If I never return to my original body, this particular sense of continuity never returns to this particular set of hardware. I, the body, fall asleep and never wake again as the person I truly was.

I'm not sure it's inherently logical, but it's the way things seem to me.
