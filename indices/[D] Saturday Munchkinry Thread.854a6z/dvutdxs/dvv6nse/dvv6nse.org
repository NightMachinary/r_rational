Not being evil prevents some of the most egregious uses of this power. So...

The evil Dr. Capgras is quietly terrorizing the world. He constructed a cabal of fanatic followers by rescuing the crippled and aging from their bodily prisons (while simultaneously dooming many 'innocents'--some not so innocent--to be trapped in the bodies of those liberated). He maintains a rotation with at least twenty of his most trusted lieutenants so that the man himself is difficult to pin down. The bodies they wear change often. He keeps four bases across the United States, with people coming and going from them constantly and using their organization's thorough handshake at every meeting and parting.

Dr. Capgras offers a body-transfer service to any who can pay. His most frequent customers are the powerful and aging rich who wish to be young again. They simply provide a victim and compensation, and Capgras's followers put them through a ritual lasting five hours.

During the ritual the two bodies to be switched lie alongside one of the Dr.'s followers in sealed steel coffins with their feet sticking out. Their right legs are imprisoned and touching in a triangle; their left legs are held by other assistants. Nerve blocks are typically used on the exposed limbs. The follower in the third coffin furthermore has his arms exposed. During the ritual he holds hands with fifty of Capgras's associates, two people at a time every twelve minutes or so. Every associate has a destination after the interaction. When the coffins are opened at the end, the bodies have been switched. Previously-chosen code phrases confirm it.

The ritual is overseen by well-compensated guards who know they will never be able to trust their loved ones again if they somehow defect and survive. Dr. Capgras is not above scrambling families. Furthermore, many evil and rich people in the world know that Capgras is their only ticket to immortality. They provide resources and security to maintain his organization.

He is currently converting all world leaders to his point of view (live forever with my help or be replaced by someone who will). Dr. Capgras has spies everywhere. Of course, the Dr. uses less secure methods when he wants to take a body in the field. He typically swallows an anesthetic pill with the body to be abandoned just before he steals the body of someone who doesn't expect it. Altercations are short, and his followers are always ready for orders to head out and collect unconscious, discarded bodies.

How can Dr. Capgras and his evil clientele be stopped? If not stopped outright, how can they be hindered?
