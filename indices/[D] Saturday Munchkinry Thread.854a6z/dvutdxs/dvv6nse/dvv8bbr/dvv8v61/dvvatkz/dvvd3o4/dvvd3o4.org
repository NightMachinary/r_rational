I agree. Paranoia is the biggest benefit.

Although, I think it might be easy to circumvent such devices. Say it uses magnetic fields--in that case, a small emp sets it off. If the device has error-checking, it can be outran with rapid switching during the ritual. If a examiner can spot it, it is neutralized.

It would be hard to make a device with all those constraints. What mechanism does it use to detect changed minds?

If he rejuvenates one person a week, he can keep five hundred people within ten years of their prime. They can afford to be thorough in their safeguards during the ritual. I'd be inclined to target random body snatching outside of it... despite the difficulty of applying the device to many people.
