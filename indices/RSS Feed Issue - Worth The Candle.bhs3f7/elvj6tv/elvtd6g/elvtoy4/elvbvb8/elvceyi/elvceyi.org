So there are multiple types of tags, some of which that get a RSS feed and some that don't?

The genre-related tag /LitRPG/ doesn't get a RSS feed. The specific work tag /Naruto/ gets a RSS feed. Is there a minimum amount of works necessary to get a RSS feed? Is there a minimum number of authors?

Edit: It looks like the number of works or authors in a tag [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alternate%20Universe%20-%20Fantasy/works][don't have any effect]]. This enormous tag doesn't get one.
