Naruto is not a specific work, it's a fandom that includes 39891 works. (the WtC tag you linked is /also/ not a specific work - it's a tag that happens to only include WtC).

I don't know how exactly the taxonomy of tags works. I know you also don't get the "sort and filter" sidebar on some tags, and I think the AO3 admins pick which ones are popular enough to provide those features for (I assume it involves a fuckton of extra server-side indexing).

Either way, none of this is what you're asking for. These RSS feeds - including the one you linked - are updated when a /new work is posted within the given tag/, not when a /new chapter is posted within a specific work/. As far as I can tell, AO3 does not provide RSS feeds for that.
