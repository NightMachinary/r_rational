[[#s][Spoilers for the end]]

I agree with you that from what was described, there are strong elements of dystopia rather than utopia. But our viewing window was very narrowly aimed and focused.

Edit: Perhaps the term you were searching for is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia][Eudaimonia]]? One of the ideas being that in a true utopia, people should grow wiser and nobler. But, perhaps, did that happen at the end of the story anyway?
