Nah, you missed it. Kit is bizarrely accessible to people from our era; it's explicitly not even close to the norm in that future.

It's not that universe doesn't have those people, it's that the story doesn't feature them.

Also, although I'd definitely say we've /more/ wiser and nobler people today (per capita) than a couple thousand years ago, it's not like everyone's gotten that way. Why would you expect it to be any different at an arbitrary point in the future? Or is there some singularity of nobility?
