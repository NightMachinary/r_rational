  The rest of the universe isn't a delicately balanced ecosystem which represents our ancestral environment such that altering it generally leads to negative consequences from a human perspective.

To be clear, I didn't mean what [[/u/eaturbrainz]] is saying re: overharvesting / environmental degradation.

By all means, go beyond Sol, tear apart the very stars, and process them all into utiliton.

My issue is that I intuitively prefer a relatively small number of people having experiences for eons, to a humongous number of people having experiences for a few million years. "There's only so many stars to give" i.e. eventually the exponential growth means each new human only gets a tiny share of the available starpower.

  Not the "humanity lost control of the steering wheel" part?

Eh. I'm with Scott Alexander here; to defeat Moloch we'll eventually have to put something non-human (or so seriously post-human it makes no difference) in charge.

(Charles might disagree, unclear.)
