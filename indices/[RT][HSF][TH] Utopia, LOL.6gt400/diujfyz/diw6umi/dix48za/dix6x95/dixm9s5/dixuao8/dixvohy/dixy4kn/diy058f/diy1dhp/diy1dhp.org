  And AFAIK, we are heading for EXTINCTION, with a significantly high chance. Complex animal life goes bye-bye, including us.
#+end_quote

Yes, what's the intended point of that statement though? I repeat again, weigh that against the probability of life extinction /without/ humans and their actions, and I think you'll find it compares favorably.

#+begin_quote
  I'm just no longer sure that leaving the complete extinction of life as we know it an open possibility in the name of agency is acceptable.
#+end_quote

"No longer" sure ?? O_o weren't you /always/ sure of that? (strawman)

#+begin_quote
  agency over what?
#+end_quote

Yourself. Your mind. Access to all the data at hand, and how you are going to respond to it.

  It's this really heavy sensation that most U's will sort of mute for you. The moment when you realize something big. Out here, I feel it full force...I should have realized. But there was no way for me to realize, because if that was possible, Allocator would have done something different. I wipe at my eyes.

As in, not that.

Of course, this scene could easily play out in a good society, someone might have given up a shard of themselves for this role, to have this experience, etc and obviously a loss of agency is necessary when rehabilitating someone. But there's a reason Charles was wistful and sad and Kit outraged at the manipulation (he, not being outraged because he recognized the need for it).
