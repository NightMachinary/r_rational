Warning: actual critique.

I guess what I find disappointing about this story is that a long time into the future, people are sort of stuck playing around with today's internet memes. That's their lives. Lulz and deconstructions and elf-sex.

It's the future. /What have you learned?/ How are you now wiser and more noble than our present day? In what ways have you become stronger? Where's the progress? Where's the utopia in your utopia?

Or I dunno, [[#s][spoiler for the end]].
