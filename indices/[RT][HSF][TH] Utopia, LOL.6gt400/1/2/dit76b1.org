The utopia is the happiness we feel inside. (for the record I didn't downvote you).

Charles feels happy being productive and having elf-sex. Kit feels happy making others happy and also having lulz.

Personally, I like this utopia because happiness. In addition, for more serious concerns it seems like existential risks are reduced. It's likely any problems that come up that the AI can't handle can be worked on by people like Charles who want to be productive.
