  Yes, what's the intended point of that statement though? I repeat again, weigh that against the probability of life extinction without humans and their actions, and I think you'll find it compares favorably.

I'm not saying we should roll back to the Stone Age. May the gods strike me dead should I ever advocate primitivism.

I am saying that it's worth trading a piece of my later agency to precommit to avoiding the extinction of life.

  "No longer" sure ?? O_o weren't you always sure of that? (strawman)
#+end_quote

No, I wasn't. I'm really big into personal freedom and important choices being a thing. I would still say, for example, that a person ought to have the freedom and agency to murder themselves in as grisly a way as they please.

  Yourself. Your mind. Access to all the data at hand, and how you are going to respond to it.
#+end_quote

Ah, here's the clash of intuitive concepts. I don't think of control over /oneself/ as agency, in the absence of affordances outside myself. I can imagine being in full control of myself, and yet feeling utterly powerless and trapped. In fact, this happens on a semi-regular basis.

    It's this really heavy sensation that most U's will sort of mute for you. The moment when you realize something big. Out here, I feel it full force...I should have realized. But there was no way for me to realize, because if that was possible, Allocator would have done something different. I wipe at my eyes.

  As in, not that.

Oh shit, I'd forgotten about that bit. That bit is just so extremely fucking stupid. It's honestly hard to believe Allocator is that /blunt/ if the manipulation is the actual point -- or in general! Hell, it makes me think the point is to get Kit outraged.

On the other hand, Allocator could be mentally crippled when it comes to social skills, but that would be really over-elaborate given the whole ruse in the first place.

This might be a plot hole. Like seriously, you've got people living with their emotions blunted? This is considered normal? That's really fucked-up and I'm honestly wondering what the purpose behind it is.
