  There are extinctions and then there is EXTINCTION.
#+end_quote

And AFAIK, we are heading for EXTINCTION, with a significantly high chance. Complex animal life goes bye-bye, including us.

  Really, I think increasing human agency is the only way to go at least for now / given that we don't have capable non-human agencies yet.
#+end_quote

Definitely.

  unless we're just throwing our hands up and saying it's impossible to preserve that value without sacrificing too many others.
#+end_quote

Not to jump straight to the offensive part, but three words: President Donald Trump. I really have very little faith that human agency doesn't mean /fucking up/ when it's /actually important/ and we /really need/ a specific outcome. No, not fucking up. People deciding to /shit all over/ the important outcomes, because they just want to spite other people.

#+begin_quote
  That means you've judged, and we agree, right?
#+end_quote

/Mostly./

#+begin_quote
  (Except that I don't see agency in terms of usefulness or being instrumental to another value, but as an end in itself.)
#+end_quote

What's agency without being agency /over/ something, towards some end? What does it mean to hold the steering wheel if you're not steering between meaningfully different outcomes? Agency over chocolate versus vanilla isn't agency.

And again, agency /over what/? I definitely feel like "humanity" is in the driver's seat right now, but that's an abstraction. Individual humans make decisions, those decisions combine into results. Nobody is really /planning/ anything; shit just /happens/. What can it /mean/ for /everyone/ to have full agency (causal influence) at the same time?

I think there can certainly be tolerances within which completely fucking up is an acceptable proposition if it means we've made our own choices. I'm just no longer sure that leaving the complete extinction of life as we know it /an open possibility/ in the name of agency is acceptable. That feels too over-compensated in the other direction.

Sometimes the choice is more important; sometimes the outcome is more important. I don't always know which one, especially these days.
