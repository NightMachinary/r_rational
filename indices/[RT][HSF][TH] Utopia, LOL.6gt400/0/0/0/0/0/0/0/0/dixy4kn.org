  Mass extinction is not relative. We are causing one. This is fucking up.

Yes it is relative! There are extinctions and then there is EXTINCTION. Without humanity, life itself is unlikely to outlive our star. It could be better. It could be /way/ worse.

And, I mean, at least when it comes to mega-fauna the holocene extinction predates modern tech, I'm not entirely sure not having the technological revolution would've fixed the situation...hunter gatherers and subsistence agriculturalists are pretty capable of fucking up the ecology even without...all this other stuff we have now. Really, I think increasing human agency is the only way to go at least for now / given that we don't have capable non-human agencies yet.

  End of history
#+end_quote

The end of ideoogical conflict is not the end of /everything requiring human agency/, it's only the end of ideological conflict. "Doing the right thing" /means/ preserving human agency in my opinion, unless we're just throwing our hands up and saying it's impossible to preserve that value without sacrificing too many others.

  there may come a time when high-level agency just isn't useful for much. *I kinda hope not*
#+end_quote

That means you've judged, and we agree, right? (Except that I don't see agency in terms of usefulness or being instrumental to another value, but as an end in itself.)
