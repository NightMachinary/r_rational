/shrug/ fucking up is also relative. Staying hunter gatherers until the next asteroid, famine, plague, whatever wiped us (and, eventually, all life) out would be a worse sort of fucking up than what is currently happening. But whatever the optimum worlds are, there /are/ optimums, and the AI in that story feels like being on the "too little control" end of one. (Granted, we don't know the world, just this micro interaction. But these individual humans clearly have very little agency.)
