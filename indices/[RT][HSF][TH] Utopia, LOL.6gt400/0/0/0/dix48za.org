  Not the "humanity lost control of the steering wheel" part?
#+end_quote

I feel like we should spend some time unpacking what it means to have humans or humanity /holding/ the steering wheel in the first place. I mean, do we have the steering wheel right now?

I kinda feel like /I/ definitely /don't/, and neither does anyone else I know or know of. Even the people who are officially denoted as leaders, whose notional job is to hold the steering wheel, don't seem to have it under control. Hell, a /certain/ bunch of them seem to be almost /deliberately/ letting go of the damn wheel.

So who's holding the wheel? Nobody, it seems. Is that better than having a nonhuman holding the wheel? Is there a way for the immense number of actually-existing humans to share the wheel? I mean, I hold to the ideal of democracy as much as anyone, but it still seems like if you spread control democratically through /seven billion people/, each person will still have almost no control over humanity's fate as a whole.

This is kinda making me think that utopia ought to be Bookchinist :-p.
