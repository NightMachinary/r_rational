There are ways around that.

Anything nasty enough (Say, continent-shattering explosion) may create enough problems for other loopers to prevent them from finding the cause in time.

Anything done near the end of the loop (hours or even minutes before reset) may be erased too quickly for other loopers to investigate meaningfully.

I agree with [[/u/derefr]] that Zorian is not utilizing loop's full potential.
