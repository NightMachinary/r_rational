Zorian is suffering from a lot of cached thoughts---specifically, things he decided were either too hard or "ugh" at some point, and then never re-evaluated.

For instance, he's probably better at heroing than his eldest brother is, now, but this hasn't caused him to re-evaluate whether his jealousy-inspired aversion to him makes sense. If it doesn't, then his brother becomes a very useful asset in solving his problems.

To quote DataPacRat's /S.I./:

  I was reeling [my rope] back for another try [at lassoing an object on the other side of the canal], wondering if I should ask Bun-Bun if she had any secret skills, when Joe put his hand on my shoulder. He pointed to the gate of the lock, holding the water back from running down the canal. "Why can we not walk on those?"

  "Because it's for canal personnel only and I'm an idiot who still needs to unlearn a few things. I guess it takes more than a month to un-do three decades of living near the canal..."

I feel like Zorian is just constantly doing that sort of thing. Break the "people" rules already! You're in a time loop! As long as nobody is a mind/soul mage, the worst you can do is restart! Against non-mages, you don't even need that much; you can just teleport away! Spy on politicians! Use your riches to hire a huge mercenary force from neighbouring cities to multiply whatever effort you want to get up to! Put truth serum in the water supply! Go big!
