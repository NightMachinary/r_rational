  I agree with [[/u/derefr]] that Zorian is not utilizing loop's full potential.
#+end_quote

I agree with /that/, but not with his suggestions of things Zorian could better spend his time on. Because those examples were all things likely to put him on peoples' radar, and at present the antagonists seem to have no idea he's still there looping. The worst he can do /isn't/ to force a restart. The worst he can do is /become someone they know about and are actively looking for/. Which he could well do by leaving a body for people to investigate during the rest of that iteration of the loop.

Finding out more about Black Rooms, on the other hand, could give him more time to train, or a better understanding of the nature of the time loops.
