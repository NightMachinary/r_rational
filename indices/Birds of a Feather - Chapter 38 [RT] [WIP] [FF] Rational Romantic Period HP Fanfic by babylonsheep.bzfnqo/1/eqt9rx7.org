The chapter where Tom Riddle discovers he's too rational for the wizarding world, lol. A big part of the appeal of these stories is protagonists who can succeed through their use of Facts & Logicâ„¢, and so far, this is how Tom has made progress in his ultimate goal of becoming the Emperor of Britain or whatever. But the Harry Potter magical world doesn't run on basic logical rules, or have people who are inherently logical, so it's somewhat amusing to see Tom puzzled by people who don't think the same way he does, ie, in terms of 100% efficiency and pragmatism.
