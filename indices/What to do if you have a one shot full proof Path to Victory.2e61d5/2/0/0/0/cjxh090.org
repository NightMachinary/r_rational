I don't know, but rigorously defining perfection is essentially equivalent to creating an FAI. Or at least, it's equivalent to writing the utility function that will make the difference between an UFAI and an FAI.

Creating FAI is a step in a process, not the end-goal. The end-goal is to *SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE*, and if that sounds poorly-defined, I think FAI is poorly-defined too.

If you get one wish, why would you ask for something that will get you what you want, rather than asking for what you want directly? It seems to add an unnecessary step to the plan, and a possible point of failure.
