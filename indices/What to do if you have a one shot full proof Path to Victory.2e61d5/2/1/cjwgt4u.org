No. The thing I would attempt is to create a strong general friendly recursively-self-improving AI, running on Amazon / Google / Microsoft Web services. I figure that it should be able to pay for its running costs pretty quickly, become absurdly resilient, and turn into something well beyond a Culture Mind.

This is only because I'm not sure how one would go about trying to make a 0 percent chance of failure on the next action a permanent effect. It might even be /stronger/ than Path to Victory in the very short term, though it doesn't have the Thinker part that helps formulate goals and that would probably ruin the long game.
