There are two main families of drawbacks in these situations: unintended consequences and randomly interjected punishments. Unintended consequences are fun to think about. They're sometimes reasonable things to be concerned about when actually implementing things like you wished for or envisioned. Random punishments are just annoyances.

Examples:

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I had a huge fortune!"

  "Done. You got it when all your friends and relatives died simultaneously. Also, the IRS is investigating you."
#+end_quote

Versus:

#+begin_quote
  "I wish I had a huge fortune!"

  "Done. Now you have cancer."
