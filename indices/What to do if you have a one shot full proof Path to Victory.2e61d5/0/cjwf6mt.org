Giving the drug to a thousand people, because you think you can determine who deserves to live and who deserves to die? permaTruth is thinking along the right lines, but he overestimates his own intelligence.

Give the drug out for free to everybody? Better, but that would start the mother of all wars. Last chance to assassinate your enemies, everybody! Better hurry up and nuke Pyongyang, it won't work this time next week!

So, make everybody immortal, at the same time, in secret with no warning. Oh, and as quickly as possible. I think that would be my wish.
