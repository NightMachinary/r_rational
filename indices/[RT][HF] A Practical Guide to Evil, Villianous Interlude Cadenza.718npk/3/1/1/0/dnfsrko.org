We know Malicia is totally into the idea of subverting the story. (Also, is Dread Empress a Name?) This is why they keep killing the Chancellor.

Wekesa should be into it. He has an evil name. His destiny, until quite recently, was to be murdered by Masego, much like the story favors Cat murdering Black.

But, thanks to Cat, Masego graduates into an equally powerful name without having to kill the previous Warlock.

Assassin, we don't know enough about to comment on her/his motives.

Captain seems to follow Black because Black brings victory and she appreciates that. Even though "Captain" is a neutral sounding name, it's established that she is a villain... if the Story runs its course, villains lose. So she has as much interest in subverting the story as anyone.

Ranger is the only one who doesn't lose if the Story plays out. Her Name is neutral. That said, my read on her is that she's found being "The Ranger" for the past 100 years very boring. She had no reason to join the Calamities. She's not Praesi, she rules her own independent domain, and she is already the deadliest person on Calernia.

It's strongly hinted in her interlude that Ranger was not a true believer when she met Black. However, that she took her initial, "we can get into Callow" jaunt and became one of the Calamities suggests that she was won over by Black to the cause of subverting the story.
