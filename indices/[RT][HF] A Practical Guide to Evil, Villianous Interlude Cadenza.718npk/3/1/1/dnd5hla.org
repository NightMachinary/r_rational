Black is trying to subvert the story, but are the other Calamities trying to really? Or are they just along for the ride? Also Malicia's turn towards a super weapon is problematic for her ability to avoid the story. Why do you peg Wekesa as being meta-goal oriented rather than simply power acquiring(albeit more rationally than his predecesors)?

Edit: Additionally, is The Story really the enemy? What if it is merely The Story (written by the Gods Above/Below) that is the problem and story can be used for mortals, and not just by them?
