I kind of hope the Ashen Priestess's death was a fake out, but I doubt it. :( I really liked her for some reason. Even if I kind of saw her death coming ever since she used her third aspect to gank some generic no-names.

Tyrant actually did betray both parties, if in a roundabout way! He must be so happy with yours development. I can't help but think of the Tyrant going "everything's coming up Tyrant!" in a Milhouse voice.

I really enjoy chapters from Black's perspective, he's so businesslike and like. Not snarky at all. Sometimes Cat has a bit of a smarm overload, and it's nice to get a contrast. Hopefully we get another hero chapter about the aftermath soon.
