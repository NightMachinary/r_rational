So this ritual requires knowledge of high arcana, a weird planar perception, and the killing of not nine people but nine caravans of people. In addition to a hair (likely of the Named in question).\\
I'd say this isn't common usage because of the large amount of resource investment and strange knowledge required to put it together.
