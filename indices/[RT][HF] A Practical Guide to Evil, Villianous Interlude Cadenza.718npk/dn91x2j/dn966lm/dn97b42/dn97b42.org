It also requires a Named to do the killing. Warlock just redirected a ritual to target someone else, but without Sabah there to do the killing it wouldn't have worked at all.

So at the minimum you need two Named, one with a caster-like name and another with a murdery name, as well as a dozen casters capable of high arcana. Villains don't really ally with other villains much, and the murdering villain won't trust the casting villain to redirect the ritual at the last moment. Heroes aren't really thematically alined with mass sacrificial rituals in the first place. Finally, a group of alined villains like Calamities that tried to abuse the method is just asking for a Hero to interrupt the process somehow, for horrific results. And it doesn't even work on all Named apparently-white knight would have survived.
