I'll repost my comment from below the actual wordpress....

There is no way that the Calamities haven't worked out that the Story is set up with "Evil will be forced to kill evil" built in rule. That Scribe seems to want to follow the story tropes if Cat follows story tropes seems to be putting another failure on top of an existing one.

The question is can Black subvert “the story?” The whole goal for Black and the empress has been to make Praes no longer a name based empire but an institutional one. We already have an example of that in Procer which is nominally good, but names are just the cherries on top rather than being crucial to its governing structure.

As such, both Black and the empress have to know that retiring the Calamities eventually was always part of the plan.

The “story” sets up the villainous names in such a way that even the most successful villains will be killed by their own side eventually. That is if Good fails to win directly.

There is no way that Black and the Calamities haven't discussed this and have not figured out a way to say “Screw that!”

Having the Woes fight the Calamities is a victory for “the Story.” Having Black kill the Calamities preemptively to save the Woes is still a victory for “the Story.”

Black is not going to let “the Story” win. I am also reasonably sure that the Empress and Warlock are on the same page about not letting “the Story” win. Scribe should be on the same page as well. They all know that they are fighting “the Story.” Cat killing Black would represent a tactical setback for our forces of free will and institutionalism. There is no way that Wekesa and Malicia would let it become a strategic defeat for their entire side retaliating against the Woes.

Hell, that would be a great reveal.

Bard's plan is to sew dissension in the ranks by forcing Cat to kill Black through some circumstance, setting up the Calamity vs. Woe showdown which would doom the new Praes... Only to find out that Malicia, Wekesa, Sabah, and Hye are all pre committed to not retaliating over this because their whole bit is using rationality... (though never those words) to subvert and defeat “The Story.”
