So, I was writing up some rules for a tabletop game that takes place within the litRPG story I'm writing, which is surely a good use of my time, and came up with the following mechanic:

- Basic conflict resolution is determined by drawing from a deck of 15 cards, adding one of your four attributes to it, and then comparing it against the numeric difficulty of the task as predetermined by the GM.
- An enate can, at the start of the day, draw cards from the top of their deck and "lock in" a card that they'll use for some specific skill.
- Skills are chosen before the card is set aside (face up).
- That card is then used for that skill for the rest of the day, and shuffled back into the deck only at the start of the next day.
- That skill will use your Wits attribute instead of what it normally would.
- Because that card is now out of your 15-card deck, you've changed the probability for every other draw, meaning that if you pull out a King (numeric value of 13), you will be really good at whatever skill you declared that card for, but less good at everything else.
- You need at least 4 Wits to become an enate, and can set aside cards up to your Wits (which has a maximum starting value of 7). Each card you set aside will be declared for a different skill.

I think that's all well and good for a gameplay mechanic; it's got what I think is a neat dynamic to it where there's some tension about whether you'll make a skill good, weakening your deck, or make it bad, strengthening your deck, and I don't /think/ there's a clearly dominant strategy, aside from maybe waiting day after day until you get the cards you want (which a good GM can handle). There's also some fuzziness on what constitutes a "skill", but this is a rules-light system that doesn't actually have distinct skills, so I think that's also fine.

The question I have is more about how this mechanic gets flavored. Obviously in the real world, there's some baseline of competency, and if the deck is essentially equivalent to rolling a 1d15, success and failure for most things will not land on the knife-edge. It's not entirely clear to me what "chance of success" should be conceptualized, and in practice, most GMs for tabletop games will vary description as appropriate, so sometimes you miss your attack because the other guy was too fast, sometimes your attack bounces off the armor, sometimes you simply fumble, etc.

My first pass is that the enate is restructuring their mind day-by-day, and what pulling out a King and putting it toward swordfighting represents is making yourself a better swordfighter at the expense of all your other skills. Contrarily, pulling out a Two and putting it toward sewing would strengthening the mind at the expense of that one skill, giving yourself a weak spot in exchange for making the rest of the mind stronger. Of course, the card flips aren't just for the mind, they're for the body as well, so you either have to have a conceptual framework that says those are the same thing, or similar enough, or figure out some other sort of handwave.
