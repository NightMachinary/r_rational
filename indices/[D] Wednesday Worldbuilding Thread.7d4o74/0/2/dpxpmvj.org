  That skill will use your Wits attribute instead of what it normally would.

I would remove this clause and then flavor the ability as self induced obsessions.

Typically in rpgs, your skill value in, say, *lifting things* represents your innate abilities in that skill, and the die roll represents the chaos of the real world. Maybe you slip. Maybe you mess up your hold, and can't get the leverage right. In D&D, you can 'take 10' when you aren't under time pressure, and 'take 20' if you can repeatedly try the task without penalty. This represents that "a character who is free to work without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple mistakes [and a] character who has lots of time can try over and over again, thereby assuring the best outcome."

So if an enate locks in a King in *lifting things*, then for the rest of the day, they are obsessed with looking for things that can be used as levers, hyperaware of which spots on the ground have good grip. If it is possible, even in principle, for them to lift something, they instinctively know how to lift it. The meet a new person and immediately begin looking them over to find the best handholds. This obviously interferes a little with their diplomacy skills.

And if the enate locks in a 1 in *lifting things*, then they have placed a mental block preventing themselves from even /thinking/ about how to lift things. Someone says "Yosef! Lift that rock!", and the enate walks over to the boulder, and tries to lift it with one hand like they would a pencil. They are completely baffled about why this doesn't work. And so for the entire day, they can only lift things that are so trivially liftable that they can lift it without thought. But this frees up their mind to think about other things.

So why do I think this flavor makes more sense if you remove the above clause?

If you lock in a one, and add your wit, then your ability to lift things is constrained entirely by your cleverness. But you have mentally blocked yourself from thinking about lifting things, so how does your cleverness help you?

Whereas if you add the normal ability score, then your ability to lift things now represents the worst case scenario for what you normally could do. A strongman can lift a chair without thinking about it, while Tiny Tim can only lift half an apple without shifting his weight about.
