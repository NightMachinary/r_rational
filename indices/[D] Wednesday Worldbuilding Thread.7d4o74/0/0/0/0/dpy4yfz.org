One relatively new and still pretty obscure game that uses cards instead of dice is Upwind, where the players each have two decks and hands for normal actions and supernatural powers to use against the GM's deck and hands.

It's designed to emulate high concept adventures in a Treasure Planet-esque setting, so each play of the cards can resolve entire scenes and a single session can cover as much ground as a whole campaign in other games.

When I looked into it months ago I wasn't able to find much information about it other than an interview with the designer and several examples of play from Role Playing Public Radio, though you can skip to their comments at the end of the episodes.
