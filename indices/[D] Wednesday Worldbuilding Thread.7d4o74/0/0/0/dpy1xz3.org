There have been a few card-based tabletop games over the years, and I think they can do some really neat things that dice-based systems can't (though I haven't found one that's as robust or inventive as I'd like, and the ones that I've actually played have been a little half-baked).

There are so many ways to split a card, either by its identity, its suit, its numeric value, or its color, which means that you can effectively do the equivalent of having someone roll a d13 and a d4 at the same time, at no extra cost. You can key abilities off whether a face card came up too, or have some interaction when the deck gets shuffled, or based on how many cards are in the discard, or removing or putting cards back in the deck. Because the discard is a stack, you can track sequences pretty easily, giving a bonus so long as you keep drawing cards, or if you're on a streak of suits. And that's without even considering the mechanical possibilities that you have if the player has a hand that they can play from.

But I spent a lot of time playing Magic as well as immersed in tabletop games, so "cards instead of dice" is especially resonant for me.
