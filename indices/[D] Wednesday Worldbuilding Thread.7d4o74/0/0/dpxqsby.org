I'm leaving a separate comment because the more I think about it, the more I become convinced that using cards for the randomness in an rpg is /really interesting/.

Consider what happens if you have a character who doesn't shuffle their deck between draws. They instead keep a discard pile, and only reshuffle when they run out of cards. This could be the ability of a mystic who is 'karmically balanced'. And strings of good luck would allow them to anticipate the coming bad luck and burn it off.

Or consider the even more powerful ability of having a hand of cards which you only refresh after using them all. This could be an advancement on the above mystic's ability, allowing them to not just predict, but also control the tides of fate.

If you have a whole bunch of cheap bicyle playing cards lying around (Like I do. I'm into magic tricks), and you 'roll' for damage, then you could give unique weapons their own damage decks, with unique distributions.

Maybe a quest reward could replace cards from the character's personal deck, permanently adding an extra 10, or swapping the king and ace for two 8s.

Maybe a mage could precommit to 'burning' some of their energy when casting a spell in exchange for extra oompf. (If the spell draw succeeds, set aside the drawn card. It is not shuffled back in until a long rest.) Because the card is only set aside on successes, a successful cast will usually render the mage worse for the rest of the day.
