What about locking in weak cards for skills that either you don't care about or someone else in your party can do better? It seems like there's no downside to putting a 2 towards, say, thieving, if you've got a specialised thief in the party. Likewise, you can put a 2 towards horseriding if you know you're going to be staying in the dungeon you're in for the next few days.

It's still /possible/ for this to backfire if it turns out your specific character needs to use that skill, but that'll either be by GM fiat and get kinda obvious after a while - in which case this is potentially a way to steer the entire course of the game - or random chance, which is overall weighted in your favour.
