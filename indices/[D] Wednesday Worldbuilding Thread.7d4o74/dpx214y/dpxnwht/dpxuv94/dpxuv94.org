The intent of this line:

#+begin_quote
  Skills are chosen before the card is set aside (face up).
#+end_quote

-- is that you don't know going in what card you're going to get. I can see where that line might be ambiguous and this is probably a better rendition of that:

#+begin_quote
  Skills are chosen before the card is drawn. The card then gets set aside, face up.
#+end_quote

That leaves you with a fair amount to balance, though I think the GM would have to make sure that skills weren't so specialized that you could guarantee that you had a good melee combat skill; the idea behind the class is that you lock yourself into either specialties or generalities, but in a way that's not as simple or choiceless as having skill points randomly distributed at the start of the day.
