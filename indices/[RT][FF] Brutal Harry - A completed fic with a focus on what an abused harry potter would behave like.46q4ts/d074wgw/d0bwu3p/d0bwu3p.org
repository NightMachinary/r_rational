Thanks for warning me. I thought the first was enjoyable, but flawed. Obviously Harry is extremely ridiculously unbelievably overpowered - but that can be fun in a mindless sort of way. Will gladly skip over the sequel if it is worse in any way though.

I didn't read many of the author's notes, but the one I read where he talked about how much better his writing was made me cringe pretty hard, almost stopped reading right there.
