It's a shame the author can't write credible adults. I enjoyed the fic in the early chapters where Harry hogs the spotlight while being asocial. But then McGonagall crushes a wineglass in anger at a faculty meeting, Dumbledore is casually cruel, McGonagall explains Harry's life story in public without his consent, everything about Petunia, etc. etc. I see what the author is going for, and it could work. But they don't have the skill to do more than cartoonish stereotypes.
