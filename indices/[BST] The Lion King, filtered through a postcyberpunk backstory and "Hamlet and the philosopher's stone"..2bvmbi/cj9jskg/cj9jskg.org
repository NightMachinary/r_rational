Sounds pretty cool.

  Are hyenas so environmentally destructive, or is that just the lion-biased viewpoint? Or is it post-hoc reasoning, and it's just a drought?

The clear thematic interpretation is that the king somehow magically makes the land better by their presence and commoners ruling it makes it worse, causing a drought.

So why not incorporate that into the story?

Mufasa is killed

He takes control of the attack routines in that and uses them to deny cloud access to the evil interloper, forcing Nala to come for food and love.

She returns Simba, the hyenas turn on Scar, and Mufasa restarts the rain. Mufasa, as always, has the last laugh.

I think it would be quite interesting to explore the circle of life/ religious implications. In redwood Martin the Warrior continually possesses people, forever making people into copies of him. Mufasa is presumably doing something similar to Simba. The plot is driven by Mufasa mass murdering herbivores because he hates Scar.

A sort of combination of the matrix and the lion king.
