Oh, sure, Scar won't be explicitly evil, any more than both versions of Mufasa would be explicitly good. Heck, Scar could be painted in a pretty good light if he's earnest about his attempts to "civilize" the hyenas.

If your morality is tailored for an obligate carnivore, it wouldn't be that hard to reach the moral epiphany that the hyenas deserve hunting territory just as much as the lions. A carnivore-biased version of humanism, I suppose. (which, as a sci-fi nut, always seemed like a far too restrictive name for a philosophy which could easily expand its empathic sphere from "the human species" to "intelligent beings")

  Oh - and if Simba can imperfectly access Lion King memory database don't leave Scar standing. He could have the full power of the Lion King like his brother. One sided fights are always interesting.

I don't get this. If Scar is also amplified, it wouldn't be a one-sided fight?
