I am thinking that with the role of Lion King comes mass mind influencing power. An irresistible presence of command, something to do with syncing in with the nanites to make the targets lose volition, and prostrate. With only the members of the Pride being more or less immune to this Ruler effect.

You could also make the Hyenas more than just mooks. Turning them more like Ringwraiths, the creatures of nightmares that they were meant to be. A significant shunned powerbase for which Scar approached them in the first place.

Simba's synchronization like you said was incomplete. So maybe he can only sporadically use the King's power like the Avatar state, only have limited access to the well of memories for short unreliable and uncontrollable periods of time. This way he'll have to rely more on tactics. You can have him trying to rally the common animal folk to the coup he makes against Scar.

An opportunity to write about leadership, which is not a bad thing to put the focus on. The victory could then be seen as the Kingdom's not just Simba's. A better message and more about what being a King actually about is - for the +pe+animals.

There is just so much possibilities with this setting. I can't wait to see what you come up with :P
