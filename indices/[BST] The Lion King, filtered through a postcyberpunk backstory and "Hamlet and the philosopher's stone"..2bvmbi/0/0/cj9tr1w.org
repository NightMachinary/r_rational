Hehe, uploaded into the cloud.

I think the big difference between Martin and Mufasa would be that Martin is simply borrowing bodies, and eventually releasing them, while Mufasa is the end of a long chain of father-son connections, each one imperfectly making the descendent into a personality copy of the father. And then Timon and Pumbaa come along, and totally break the chain.

I wouldn't exactly say that Mufasa turning off the rain would be mass murder of herbivores, it's explicitly said that the herbivores moved on to greener pastures, and it's just Scar's stubborn refusal to abandon a throne that keeps them there.

I really enjoyed The Lion King as a kid, but one major flaw in the cinematography left me confused for a long time. It honestly looks like that during the stampede, after being rescued, Simba climbs up the cliff, and sees Scar betraying his brother. It took a long time to realize that no, apparently he didn't, even though he managed to yell the big no when Mufasa falls.

I'm thinking that this would be an ideal point of departure for the fic, as it would allow the canon plot to actually be set up, but with the primary change that his exile isn't tinged with guilt about Mufasa's death, but guilt about being so easily manipulated and insufficiently analytical about others' motives.
