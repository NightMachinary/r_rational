  I wouldn't exactly say that Mufasa turning off the rain would be mass murder of herbivores, it's explicitly said that the herbivores moved on to greener pastures, and it's just Scar's stubborn refusal to abandon a throne that keeps them there.

There were skeletons all around, so some likely died, some moved on.

Scar was stubborn, though if Mufasa caused the drought as is implied him moving to another land likely wouldn't solve the issue. It would be interesting to see if he could try and resolve the issue independently- perhaps he could try to find other monkeys like Rafiki who can hack into the cloud? Perhaps as primates they get a higher access level.

You can see Simba ran behind a rock, he can't see any more.

That would be a good departure point.
