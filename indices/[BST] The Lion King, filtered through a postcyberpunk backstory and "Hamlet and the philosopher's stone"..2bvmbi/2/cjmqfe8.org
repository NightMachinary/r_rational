  What exactly is up with the River King aspect of the pridelands? Are hyenas so environmentally destructive, or is that just the lion-biased viewpoint? Or is it post-hoc reasoning, and it's just a drought?

This is child-me reasoning so I'm not sure how well it fits in the actual story, but I thought the food shortage was because the Hyenas were eating everything - which makes sense, actually. After Scar introduced the hyenas, there were two apex predators in one region...though that doesn't explain the drought.

Now that I think back on the memory of the movie with an adult's eye, I think the writers did tend to imply that Scar somehow caused environmental decay / the herds to move on. But I'm also getting a very Red Scare / communist vibe from the canon - like somehow Scar's power grab via redistribution of resources to Hyenas caused economic collapse. (Remember when the Hyenas were like, "No king lalalala" and Scar was like "IDIOTS!"? They were definitely thinking about politics.)

Even if the original authors did sort-of write the story such that it's easy to conclude via literal interpretation that the True King magically brought on the rain, I think the /intention/ was definitely to say that Scar was a bad ruler somehow, rather than simply lacking the magic or something.

A non-magical hybrid between the two would be to have the Lion King be a farmer-king, generally managing environmental resources and culling herbivore populations when they got too large. If lions really /did/ get smarter, you'd expect them to start becoming successful enough to really strain against resource constraints and then find ways out of them...and, just as with human farmers, this necessitates careful resource management. That would further explain the "Circle of Life" ideology. Alternatively, it could go in a "law of the jungle" direction - as in, "we can't show mercy to the old and weak animals because there's limited resources here".
