Oh yes. Yes, yess! I knew the second I wandered off into [[/r/rational][r/rational]] that this place and me was meant to be. Take that Deconstruction Stick and make thorough use of it D:<

I think the best thing you could do for the story is not to make Scar explicitly evil. Make his motivations bigger and grander than just becoming king. Throw in a sci-fi element like say Dune's Spice ecosystem or something, only involving nanites. The planet becoming inhospitable to plant life could be side effect of him doing this. But there is a genuine reason for him resorting to something like this, to the point the readers can even sympathise with him. Necessary evil and all that. This becoming a clash of values.

I absolutely love the idea about Mufasa being the collective mind of all the Lion Kings that ever was - that totally fits. Don't villainize him though. It just doesn't sit well - too much of a thematic departure from canon. It could be that the collective king in the cloud makes a hard choice for the kingdom. Or performs hard calculation and projects a scenario for Simba. Or something..

Oh - and if Simba can imperfectly access Lion King memory database don't leave Scar standing. He could have the full power of the Lion King like his brother. One sided fights are always interesting.
