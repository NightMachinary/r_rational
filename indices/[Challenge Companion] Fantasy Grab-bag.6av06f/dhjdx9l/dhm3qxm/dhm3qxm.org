That's definitely one that I've had my eye on. I'm not really a fan of the show, in part because I don't find their character work to be that compelling, but one of the good things about it is that if you wanted to you could just translate the magic system to a completely different cast of characters of your choosing.

(I'm actually curious whether anyone has done a multi-character fanfic crossover where eight people from different canons become linked with each other. I assume someone's working on that somewhere.)
