Sens8, for sure. A group of eight people, each with different skills who live in different locations around the world, all psychically linked in a way that is loosely defined. One's a scientist, one's a business executive, one's a hacker, etc. I enjoy the show, but it focuses much more on characters than the "magic system". I'd love to read a rationalist take on it.
