I'd even take it a step further and say it would be a fun (if extremely impractical) idea to make it a collaborative effort among multiple rational fic authors, each one taking a single character. I've been thinking for a while about how that could be a fun concept for a rational fic in general, and it would fit exceptionally well for a fic about Sens8 in particular.

Like, what if you wrote for the German gangster, and another fic author did the Indian chemist, and someone else did the British DJ, and the African bus driver, etc... I think it would be extremely complicated and difficult, but also a lot of fun.

I'm also generally thinking along these paths because I started reading Animorphs: The Reckoning last week and caught up to the most recent post a few days ago, and I'm a bit obsessed with using multiple perspectives to their full potential.
