  There are only two rules: it must be fanfic, and it must be of something recent (within the last year or two).
#+end_quote

Just for clarification, this is saying that the submission has to be a fanfic of a book/movie/show/game/whatever that was released recently, right? Because later in the thread:

#+begin_quote
  If you want hard mode, write fan fic of the last thing you watched or read, whatever it is.
#+end_quote

The last few books I've read are all older than I am, which is why I'm asking for clarification.

I'm not going to be participating (I'm too busy working on something else), but I figured I'd ask in case anyone else had the same question.
