Why is the title here "Fantasy Grab-bag" when the challenge is "Fanfic Grab-bag"?

I've been wanting to see a rational No Game No Life, which looks like it was designed to be a rationalist fanfic if it weren't for the fact that the majority of it is bad advice.

Rational Touhou would be interesting. Especially if you manage it without making it grimdark, which is difficult considering that the majority of the cast is man-eating monsters.
