I've been playing /Prey/, which is a pretty classic "things go horribly wrong in an isolated environment" type of game, which makes a lot of sense given that it's a spiritual successor to System Shock. There's a definite undercurrent of "Science is Bad" and "Things Man was Not Meant to Know", which I'm not hugely fond of, but it's fun enough despite that, and some of it is more of the Jurassic Park variety coordination problems, planning fallacy, failure to be properly paranoid, etc.. (I have not finished the game, so can't yet speak to what it's actually trying to say, but I do think it's probably good fodder.)
