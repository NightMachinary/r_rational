My intent is that it would be relatively newer stuff, but I'm not going to be policing it at all, so if the last book you read was Mary Shelley's /Frankenstein/, then go right ahead. (I can't promise that people voting will be so laissez faire, so maybe include that it was the last thing you read, even if it's the opposite of recent.)
