The first reason I have to drop something is lack of engagement. If it's not fun, why am I reading it? But more specifically there's a laundry list of 'sins' fiction can commit that will just immediately cause me to lose interest.

I will say that if you hate WoT now, it will only get much, much worse for you. I'd recommend dropping it ASAP.
