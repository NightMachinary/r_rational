I stop reading (or start skimming if I'm invested in the end of the story already) when...

1. The story is spending lots of time explaining something that's not interesting. (i.e. I skimmed through some of the speeches in Atlas Shrugged.)
2. The emotions that are too painful like in [[#s][Hunger Games:]] [[#s][Harry Potter:]] or the awkwardness of pretty much every sitcom episode ever.
3. The story simply isn't believable. Some authors completely skip the crisis in their plot. A story of constant success gets old quick. Some authors just suck at dialogue or give characters reactions that real people simply wouldn't have.
4. The grammar and diction are wrong, horrible and/or repetitive. I can't read more than one or two books in a row from most authors because they have favorite words and phrases that they reuse a lot. I notice those and start cringing. Change stuff up! Explore new styles! (this causes me problems with some people IRL too)

From a time perspective, I'll rarely slog through more than half an hour of any of the above before giving up. If someone I respect recommended the book I might make it twice that, but ultimately things have to pick up or I'm out.
