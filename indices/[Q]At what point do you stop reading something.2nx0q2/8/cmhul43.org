If it's been recommended I'm more likely to stick with it, but for example I ditched Joe Abercrombie's First Law series after the first book because I didn't care about the plot, and the only characters I found interesting probably only had work put into them so that bad stuff could happen to them later.

On the other hand, I did enjoy the Wheel of Time. But hey, if it doesn't float your boat, that's fine. I'd recommend taking a break with the intent of finishing the first book, but I don't know your specifics.

I'll admit my experience is colored by my brother and (step)sister, who both had read The Colour of Magic, and both disliked Terry Pratchett. And then I got them Thief of Time and Going Postal for christmas and they decided that maybe there was something to this fellow after all.
