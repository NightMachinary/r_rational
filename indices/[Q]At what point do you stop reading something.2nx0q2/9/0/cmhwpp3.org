It's a dead tree series by Robert Jordan. The first book is "The Eye of the World"; there's...16?...books in the series and they are HUGE. IIRC, the shortest is 600 pages.

When I read them, the first 50 pages were mind-shatteringly boring. I was about to put it down when things suddenly picked up and got very engaging.

Fair warning: Jordan has a phobia about paying off plot coupons. He just keeps handing out new ones without ever resolving the old ones. Sometimes he forgets about things too -- Perrin, a main character in 1-3, is not even mentioned in book 4. And so on. It gets annoying after a while, but at least the whole series is out now.
