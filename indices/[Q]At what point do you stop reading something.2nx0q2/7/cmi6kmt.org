When the expected utility gain from continuing to read is less than the opportunity cost incurred by the time spent reading.

Sure, it may be a good story, and I may enjoy it more if I continue reading (as others may insist). But is it at present the best way of fulfilling my literary desires? Usually this isn't an explicit calculation, but more of a gut feel.

I tend to juggle books around when they slow down, but as I finish more engaging stories I usually come back if I have a reasonable expectation of enjoyment. Case in point, I've been worming my way through Worm for a few months now.

Goes the same for other media as well.
