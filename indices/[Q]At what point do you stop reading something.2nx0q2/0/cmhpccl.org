It depends on a lot of things. If I've been forewarned that the early parts are bad/boring, I'm more likely to stick it out. If it's something that I've spent money on (or otherwise expended some kind of effort on), I'm more likely to try to see it through. If I'm expected to report back (usually because I borrowed a book, and you can't do that without the question of whether you liked it) I'm more likely to give it longer. And I tend to read in "chunks", so the end of the first book of a trilogy is a much more likely stopping place.

As far as reading goes, my time is valuable, and wasting it on something that I don't enjoy is not something I'm willing to do. I haven't been without a backlog of books in a decade. I don't stop reading things without thinking about it first, but I don't tend to hesitate too much when there's something that I'm not enjoying - usually when I'm bored, but also sometimes when I don't like a character. I stopped reading /The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant/ when he [[#s][]], because that shredded the last of my interest in the main character.

I had intended to read /The Wheel of Time/, and just like you, I stopped midway through the first book, because it didn't seem like anything was happening. I was also motivated by the fact that people had said that somewhere between four and eight books in the series were boring, which shifted the cost-benefit analysis.

Sometimes when people say to just keep reading something that's unenjoyable, I feel like they're suffering from the literary equivalent of Stockholm Syndrome.
