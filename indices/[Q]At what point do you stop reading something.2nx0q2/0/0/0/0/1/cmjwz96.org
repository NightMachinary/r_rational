I made it halfway through it before I couldn't stand it any more, which was farther than I expected.

I am now much better at monitoring how much I'm enjoying something, and stopping if it has become a waste of time. I don't know if I'd make it more than 30 pages, plus or minus 20 or so, if I tried again.
