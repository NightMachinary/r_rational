I've gone through periods in my life where I've been so bored that I've read mind shatteringly boring stuff for so long I don't remember what an interesting book is like. I generally have to force myself to put the thing down and purge it from my memory, backtracking like several books/authors/recommendations to get out of the dark and terrifying path I've found myself on and find something I like. Most of the time, I don't even notice if it's boring.

Though, I don't actually find WOT boring. I consider it one of the best things I've every read. Eh. Whatever floats your boat.
