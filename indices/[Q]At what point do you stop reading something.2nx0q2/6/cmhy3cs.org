I asked for the first three books last Christmas. I got about halfway or a third of the way through the first one and then stopped (Christmas break had ended so I was back to school and had less time, and they were boring). I had pinged through Worm that September I recall. It kept occurring to me that Worm had managed to keep me up till the wee hours of the morning every night I had read it, and the wheel of time books just seemed to pointlessly drag on in comparison.
