Finishing boring books is an example of the sunk cost fallacy. So from a utilitarian point of view, it makes sense to drop a book as soon as the expected joy is greater elsewhere.

Social pressure is a big factor. I only read the first book of the Divergent trilogy, although my family are a big fans. I will watch the movies with my wife. After the Hunger Games, Divergent feels like just more of the same to me. Maybe it's an age thing. Maybe reading into LessWrong spoiled the genre for me.
