There's 14 books in the series. There were also /plans/ to make 2 more (smaller) series(serii?) that focused on Mat and Perrin after the normal plot was over, but one of history's most tragic cases of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure][Author Existence Failure]] in history has cut that off for good. Tragic. Though I probably wouldn't have read the Perrin one.
