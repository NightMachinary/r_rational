I have a very hard time dropping a story after I've gotten into it, mostly because no matter how boring it is, I keep needing to know how it's going to end. If I'm more then 5 chapters in, the chance of me giving it up are very slim. It takes a truly horrendous turn for the worse for me to give up on a story halfway, and even then, I still need to find out what happens (good thing there's a wiki for almost anything these days).

It's even worse if it's a series of books that start really good and get progressively worse as they go. Dropping a series of books I've gotten into is nearly impossible, what with all the loose ends and hooks and everything else. So far the only series that got so bad I had to drop it was Anita Blake, and even then, I still read the summary of every book when it comes out.

One thing I do to sort of counter this is to put it on hold. I can't do it indefinitely, but if a book is really boring and I can't drop it, I'll put it aside for while and go read something better, than come back to it at a latter time (the crossing Mordor part at the end of Return of the King made me put it on hold for almost six months).
