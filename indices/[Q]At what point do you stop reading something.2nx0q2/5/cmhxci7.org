I stop reading when I no longer care what happens next, and there are no burning questions I want to find the answer to.

Usually those go hand in hand, but occasionally I don't care about the story and continue on just so that I'll learn more about the world.

This backfires when I get a question that the author never even intends to answer. I read the entire belgariad et al series by David Eddings just so I could get more information on what the gods of that setting were. There were so intriguing by the few details, like how apparently they couldn't heal themselves, so the rare attack that hurt them was always permanent, and how one went mad from grief, and a bunch of characterization about the few gods that actually got on stage for a while.

And once the story ends, they just up and leave for no good reason.
