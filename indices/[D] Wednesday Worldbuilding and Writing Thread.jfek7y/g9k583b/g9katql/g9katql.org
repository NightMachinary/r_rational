A low mountain pass or valley would probably do the trick. In summer, moist air would rise along the nearby slope, the water would condense and then the raindrops would fall on the slope, leaving the valley dry. However, in winter, the same would happen except that snowflakes would be more easily carried by the wind further up the slope, over the peak, and then down into the valley. Any snow which settles on the peak would also tend to eventually get blown off the peak into the valley.

For a real-world model, I found [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood,_California][Kirkwood, California]] (and the nearby [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_Mountain_Resort][Kirkwood Mountain Resort]] which sees an average of 39.4 feet of snow per year). To quote Wikipedia:
