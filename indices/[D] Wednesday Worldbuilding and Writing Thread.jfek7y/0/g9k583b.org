What's the right biome for a place with dry, mild summers and wet, cold winters?

In an area with eastward prevailing winds, I have, going east to west, ocean, temperate rainforest, mountains big enough to act as a rain shadow, and my problem region. Think Washington State, with the problem being in Yakima. For the last thousand plus years, the problem region has been under a magical effect that enforces heavy snowfall during the winter. This means total yearly precipitation is much higher than it should be, but it's seasonal, and all snow. I don't know any real-world analogues - I'd appreciate those or other guidance.
