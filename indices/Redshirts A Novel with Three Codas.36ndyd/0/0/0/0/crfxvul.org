Oh man, that Tarzan one is going to be great. I have the first three chapters written, it's just one of those things that's been sitting on the back burner.

  *Foreword*

  I have endeavored to keep this story as accurate as possible, but I must admit that where the truth could only be guessed at, I have made my guesses. I shall also caution that this story has not been kept free of outright fabrications. There were places where a flourish was needed, and where dramatic license was taken. Do not mistake me though; I have pored over a multitude of documents, including those taken from the trials, and where possible I have spoken with the survivors. It may seem to the reader that I want it both ways --- that I want the story to be seen as accurate but not find myself beholden to the truth of history --- and it may be that the reader is correct. When I was approached to write this book, I was given the task of turning a pivotal event in Britannia's history into a personal one. If a few useful lies needed to be told along the way, so be it.

  Our story begins with a young girl on a steamship off the coast of Africa, and ends with the crucible in which the modern world was forged.
