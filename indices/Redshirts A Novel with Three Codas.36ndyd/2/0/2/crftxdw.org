I personally love all of Scalzi's work. In terms of sort of light sci-fi in the same vein as "Redshirts", try "Agent to the Stars" or "The Androids Dream". They're both stand alone sci-fi with great humor and amusing premises.

The Androids dream actually starts with a chapter long fart joke. Swear to god. It's hilarious!

I actually read Agent to the Stars back before he was even a published author - he posted it as a "Shareware Book" on his blog.
