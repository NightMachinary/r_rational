Ask your wife-to-be, but you can do a pretty tasteful non-denominational wedding. All you really need is an exchange of rings, some vows, and a few readings. My wife and I picked these three readings:

  *Goodridge v Department of Public Health*

  "The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. ... Without question, ... marriage enhances the welfare of the community. It is a social institution of the highest importance. ... Marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Because it fulfils yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, ... marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life's momentous acts of self-definition."

  *Excerpt from Timequake by Kurt Vonnegut*

  My uncle Alex Vonnegut, a Harvard-educated life insurance salesman who lived at 5033 North Pennsylvania Street, taught me something very important. He said that when things were really going well we should be sure to notice it. He was talking about simple occasions, not great victories: maybe drinking lemonade on a hot afternoon in the shade, or smelling the aroma of a nearby bakery, or fishing and not caring if we catch anything or not, or hearing somebody all alone playing a piano really well in the house next door. Uncle Alex urged me to say this out loud during such epiphanies: 'If this isn't nice, what is?'

And then "Roads Go Ever On" by J.R.R.Tolkien as the third, but that's too long to quote here.

The issues would come if she wanted to be married by a Catholic priest, because they have their own thing going on. Otherwise, getting someone to do the ceremony is the only thing you need; talk to other atheists to see what they've done, but there are a number of progressive churches out there that will be more than happy to help you.
