Er, right. Fixed that, thanks.

The reason that I don't post things as they're written is usually that I don't personally like reading stories that go "dead". You get three or four great chapters, and then it just comes to a complete halt for months or years while the author gets distracted by other things. And then as an author, if you post something obviously incomplete, you'll get people asking you when you're planning on picking that thing back up again.

I guess I would rather just post the whole thing in one go once it's done and get the feedback then. If I post things to get feedback, I would feel like I was crowdsourcing beta-reading, and I already have my wife for a beta-reader.
