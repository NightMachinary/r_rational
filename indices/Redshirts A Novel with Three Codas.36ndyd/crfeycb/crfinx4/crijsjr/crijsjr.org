Reminds me a bit of this short story by Cory Doctorow, "To Go Boldly" (found in /The New Space Opera 2/), where the "Enterprise" (with names changed for copyright reasons) runs into an alien ship that's super-tiny, and they all beam down to the nearby planet and get in a fight, only for the alien to be utterly shocked that the Federation has the technology to convert people into data and then reform into new bodies, but never think to just save the data patterns in case something happens- he's not actually physically present in the ship, just a program running on the computer (a copy of the original back home); after all, if he only has one instance and gets killed he's dead forever. What kind of idiots wouldn't make backups? Or even realize that they could make backups, instead of slinging around their only bodies in a metal can around the galaxy?
