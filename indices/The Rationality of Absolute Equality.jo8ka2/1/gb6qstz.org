Yikes, I would not want to live in this kind of society, and in no way do I see this a rational one.

A rational Actor and or Modus operandi is to persue one's objectives in the most efficient manner possible while adhering to a given set of internal rules.

The goal here appears to be an equal basis to start life from before striking out, by some technicalities this objective is being met with the proposed solution but the more efficient method would be to simply copy brain states / souls / AI patterns for a given specimen raised in this, horrid, manner. Using a master copy create as many of these, equal entities as are needed for the society.

This Society, would be bland tasteless, emotionless, stagnant entity. Diversity breeds strength, and Unity lets it endure.

True Equality enforced on every individual is a dystopia nightmare. For a society to flourish, Equality of opportunity should be available.
