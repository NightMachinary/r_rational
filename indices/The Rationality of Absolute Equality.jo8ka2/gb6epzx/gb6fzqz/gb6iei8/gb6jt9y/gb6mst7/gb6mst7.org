Who made the AI? Who made the laws? Laws are not perfect, and the fact that they are not perfectly enforced can often be a feature, not a bug.

For example, laws take time to change, and often aren't good. E.g. drugs; we want to discourage drug use and keep it from being accepted in public, but arresting every college student who has a smoke doesn't help society. A counterintuitive solution is to keep it illegal but not enforced strongly.

^I am not saying this is right or wrong, just want to put add more perspective on how a "god" AI can go wrong.
