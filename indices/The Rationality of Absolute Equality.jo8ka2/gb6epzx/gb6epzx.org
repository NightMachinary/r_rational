Nothing about this is rational. It is irrational to remove our genetic diversity. It is irrational to try to perpetuate the notion that everyone must contribute to society when we should push for things like Universal Basic Income. AGI controlling law enforcement? Likely going to require a lot of privacy violations, not to mention the security risks.

Your only half-reasonable proposals are equity in education and a deathless society, except of course, what do you even mean to balance age related inequality?
