You don't get genetic diversity back, you can't get genetic diversity if every member of your species is born a literal clone.

Because noone should have to work if they don't want it? If you don't want to work you get to live on the bare minimum of conforts, if you want more go get it.

If there's no data sharing there's no trust to be given to them. I mean, that's kindof why law enforcement is supposed to show evidence of crime, otherwise they could just punish whoever they wanted (even more)

Welp, that's just straight out impossible. If a person is alive for a longer time they have more connections and possibly more knowledge.

I stick to what I said, I'm afraid your ideas are just not rational, you are just trying to present your own version of a dream society, where you get all you want without compromising anything
