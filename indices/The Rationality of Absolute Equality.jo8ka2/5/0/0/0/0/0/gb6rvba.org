That doesn't necessarily imply a lot of genetic diversity. That just implies genetic diversity in the genes that involve appearance or ability.

For a couple examples of why genetic diversity is good: there is a genetic mutation which, if you inherit it from both parents, gives you sickle cell anemia. If you inherit it from only one parent, though, it gives you protection against malaria. The Gros Michel cultivar banana was bred to have no seeds and could only reproduce by cloning; it fell victim to Panama disease and had to be replaced by the Cavendish banana, which, also being a cloned cultivar, is in danger of being devastated by another strain of the same fungus.

If everything is based off of the same clone body, then we're eventually going to be hit with something that is exactly the worst thing against those clones. And then it will clear its way through the entire population, because, like the Gros Michel or the Cavendish, every clone is equally weak against it. On the other hand, if enough people are rendered different through genetic mutation and sexual reproduction, then there will probably be a few people with a minor bad traits, or a whole bunch of people with a neutral trait, who, like people with the sickle cell trait, will have protection against the threat, and that protection can then spread to the next generation.

The more genetic diversity you have, the more threats your population is equipped to face.
