How does a kid know what teacher will be right for them? Will they just be lucky they found the right one? they made the right choice? Did someone choose one for them? Unless its the same someone who chooses for everyone, and everyone is the same so the choice will always be the same that isn't true equality.

I think you will find there will never be "true equality" unless everyone is identical and lives identical lives.

As I mentioned in my main comment below, "true equality" isn't feasible or even desired (in fact, personally I think it is one of the most morally abhorrent things that you could fight for). You should look for a better goal. I personally like attempting to maximize "freedom" and "equal opportunity" together (the together part is important, because they are both mutually exclusive, increasing one necessitates decreasing the other by definition and human nature.) If you maximize equality you have to remove all choice and all differences between individuals. If you maximize freedom you get anarchy. The absolute of either one of those is catastrophe.
