This really sounds like a dystopia. Like, it's not even subtle.

Not being able to reproduce sexually? Many people believe there's a special bond between a parent and their biological child and wouldn't like not being able to experience that. Also, how does this remove nepotism? Unless you're having the kids raised by faceless robot entities -- I shouldn't have to explain why this is a terrible idea -- then /someone/ has to be raising them, and they might give their children unfair advantages.

No education is equal. Teachers are of varying level of skill and temperament, and some students will react better to different styles of teaching than others. If you have two students of equal intelligence, one a visual learner and one not, then the visual one will do better if the class has a teacher that likes teaching that way.

Constant surveillance by robotic entities? That's some 1984 shit.

As for 'equal contribution'... why? Literally, what's the point of this? Any of it? To say that a person should have to pay a price to feel comfortable in their own skin, to receive an education, to /be born/ is wrong and stupid at best, possibly outright offensive.

That's not even getting into the fact that you apparently have AI complex enough to be judge, jury, and executioner; why would anyone work, when machines could clearly do it much faster, easier, and better? At this point, just institute basic universal income -- if someone wants more than enough money to live comfortably, then they can get a job doing something not easily done by machines, like acting.

The reasoning behind this form of 'equality' -- speaking of, how on earth would it bring any sort of actual equality? -- also feels a lot like this society is trying to brainwash its citizens into feeling indebted to it so they won't dissent. "You owe us for making you. You owe us for giving you basic rights. You should be grateful. If you aren't, you're a bad person. You don't want to be a bad person, do you?"

Newsflash -- the earlier law about free education? It's not free if you have to pay for it.
