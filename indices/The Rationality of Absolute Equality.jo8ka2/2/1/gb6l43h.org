I grew up as friends with a pair of identical twins. They lived in the same home,studied in the same school, did the same things... yet, they had diametrically opposite personalities.

I can't explain why this happens... but, I think you would be surprised by how /unequal/ these vat-grown clones would be by the time of their graduation.
