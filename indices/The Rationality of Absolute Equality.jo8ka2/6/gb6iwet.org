Unlike the other commenter [[/u/JullianWyvern]], I think this is much closer to the eventual outcome of true equality than he thinks, but I would say that actually, *true equality is evil.*

I still think you aren't looking broadly enough though; the only way you can achieve "true equality" is by each person having *no* differences what-so-ever. e.g. you said that at age of maturity, they can "choose" what they want to do. Ok, so what if someone "chooses" something more profitable/fulfilling than another person? -> How did that person come to a different choice than the most optimum one? -> Their upbringing must have been different, hence inequality.

You cannot have anyone's life experience being ANY different than another person's for true equality. Choice does not exist in a truly equal society.

So IMO, true equality is completely unfeasible, and undesirable even in a post-scarcity civilization.

Since you mentioned them though, I wanted to comment on the two last points: First, Equity before the law; I agree this would be the only way to attempt to enforce "true equality", but I would also say that if actual true equality is achieved as mentioned above, there should be NO law. Anyone treated (let alone punished) differently than others is inequality.

If we look at it in a more realistic perspective: the problem with one entity having all the power is that if that entity somehow does the "wrong" thing, there is nothing that can be done. The only solution to this, is you have to have power be spread as much as possible. The issue with that is that as long as one entity with power wants more than their fair share (or just *perceives* another entity being unfair) you have conflict, and unfortunately you cannot solve this by centralizing power because of the above point.

I would also want to mention about the deathless society point; the old people don't need protecting. They would have the most power in a deathless society, think of an MMO, the weakest players are the new ones not old ones. If you are interested in equalizing this you would need to give the young something and take form the old. In our society that's Taxes and public education (plus parental obligation), and in a post-scarcity society I would actually solve this by countering your "equal contribution" point; Everyone should start (and be forced to keep) a minimum amount of "resources" which are enough for comfortable subsistence. The rest they can do whatever they want with.

I think what you are looking for is actually: how to achieve true "equal *opportunity*", and I think you will find it looks very similar to many developed countries in modern society with a few tweaks.
