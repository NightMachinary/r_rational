Under 'Equality of choice' you get your diversity back.

As for 'Equal contribution'... well, what is the origin of that universal basic income you propose? If it is generated by the other members of society, why should they give up the fruits of their labors to these unrelated young-adults?

About privacy, there can be restrictions on the AI to not share the data they have gathered. I believe the advantages outweigh the risks.

In the interests of 'absolute equality' I wish to avoid the formation of a gerontocracy where the elders, by dint of their greater age, gain undue authority.
