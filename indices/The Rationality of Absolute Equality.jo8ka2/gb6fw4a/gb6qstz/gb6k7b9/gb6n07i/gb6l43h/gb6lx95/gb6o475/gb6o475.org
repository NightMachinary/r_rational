Identical twins are fundamentally different from what you're implying. Twins in real life experience an incredible amount of stimuli. It is literally impossible for the stimuli to be the same. Most of the stimuli will be different, leading to different twins. The cause of difference between the clones in your ideal world need to come from somewhere, and if all the clones are the same at birth(which let me just say is an incredible loss of diversity, this would constrain them to specific modes of thinking and modes of life since a lot of personality traits and choices are completely set by genes and unchangeable in real life) then the only way they could be different is from a different education, which would invalidate the equal education initiative.
