My version of an equitable society would be UBI for everyone, law that is administered by an FAI(Friendly Artificial Intelligence) (probably in terms of utility), access to a universal curriculum that lays a foundation for individuals(which can be adapted to different learning styles), opportunities for pursuing dreams but which require extensive time commitment(if you want to travel to Mars, study for 20 years), an end to aging and all genetic and external defects and diseases, the choice to self-modify after 100 years and a certain quantity of specific experiences and the choice to reproduce after 100 years and a certain quantity of specific experiences. That's all I can think of for now.
