No, its not hard to explain. Subtle differences in upbringing, (e.g., lets say people are "designed" (as in their genes encourage them to) take one of two personalities: Extroverted or introverted. They are also designed to take the one which seems less common. (so in a pair of identical twins, if one becomes an extrovert, the other is likely to become an introvert) So now, whatever super subtle differences in their environment encourage one twin to choose their allegiance fist will become one, while the other will become the other.

Now, being an extrovert or introvert is VASTLY different, they have completely different *unequal* lives, by no choice of their own. How is this any different from genetic differences?
