Equal at birth doesn't work in general. If all humans were exactly identical, and especially if we had no genetic diversity, we would have no will to do anything. If I were born with no desires, no specific genetic traits then I would want for nothing, never make any choices because of an inability to make a choice, and pass the rest of my life without doing anything. If we /had/ specific drives, then all the clones would end up identical. Realistically, if they are all given the same education, and grew up with the same traits and drives, they would make the same choices, which technically fulfills equality of choice but makes it useless.

The problem with equality is that it boils down to people ending up the exact same. This is a classic equity vs. equality situation. We need equity, because the differences between people are important and a key part of humanity.
