For Practical Guide to Evil, I used to use Feedhuddler until it shut down, and now I use an IFTTT applet. Most stories (eg. all that use Wordpress) have an RSS feed, so that might be worth checking out.

(For me, Pocket makes particular sense because it can sync to an e-reader, but there are other ways to use it as well.)
