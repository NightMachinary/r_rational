I use [[https://www.inoreader.com/][Inoreader]] as an RSS aggregator. In general, if you want to be notified when one of several streams of content updates, RSS feeds are the most straightforward solution that isn't tied to a platform like Facebook/Twitter/whatever. They're emitted by Wordpress blogs, most webcomics, Reddit and even Youtube if you search a little (not Archive of our Own, unfortunately).

Honestly, I'd say any feed aggregator is as good as any other. Inoreader has a good UI, decent features in the free version, no major drawback and mostly does everything you'd expect it to do.
