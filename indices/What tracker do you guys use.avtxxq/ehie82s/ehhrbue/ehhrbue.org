I'm gonna be obvious here but: Most webnovel repositories have mail alert features.

For those stories that aren't published on a repo, there may be an RSS feed. If there's no feed, you may try asking for one.

Although to be honest I've long since decided to just /not/ follow webnovels that I can't manage in Calibre (through FanFicFare with mail alerts). There's just too many stories from too many sources and I have to filter them /somehow/ or I'll lose my mind. That means no blogs, no custom sites, no non-threadmarked forums posts.
