What.

No, please don't do that. Please don't just batch-scan all your stories. That's exactly the kind of thing that makes repos throttle their sites to mitigate bot-access abuse, and the exact reason FFF has such a huge timer between FF.net requests.

Please use mail alerts, and use FFF's "Get story URLs from email" feature. Your story updates will be WAY faster!

Sure there'll be some repos with no mail alert; for those you can create a "Manual update check" saved search on those publishers.

You can also create a custom column to evaluate (roughly) whether a chapter is late or not, based on publication date, last update date, and number of chapters. You can then only check those chapters that have a certain number of missed update cycles.

This custom column of mine tells me when an ongoing webfic has more than two missed update cycles, and how many missed days (just copy/paste the whole thing as a custom column template):

#+begin_example
  program:
  # Days since the last update
  days_since_last=days_between(today(), raw_field('#updated'));

  # The first chapter doesn't count in the average; nor do books with no chapters (since they generate a divide by zero error)
  chapters=cmp(field('#chapters'), 2, 1, subtract(field('#chapters'), 1), subtract(field('#chapters'), 1));

  # Days between chapters, in average.  If the average is less than one day, we up to one day.  This is so incomplete multi-chapters uploaded in one go don't get crazy values.
  pub_length=days_between(raw_field('#updated'), raw_field('pubdate'));
  avg=divide(cmp(pub_length, 0, 1, 1, pub_length), chapters);
  avg=cmp(avg, 1, 1, 1, avg);
  # Number of days an update should have come up, based on average
  days_delayed=subtract(days_since_last, avg);

  # Number of 'deadlines' missed.
  deadlines=divide(days_since_last, avg);

  # We only display a value for books with a Last Updated value. Among those, we dismiss completed books.
  # You'd think a date column with an undefined value would be considered empty by ifempty(), but nope.  It's a column with a 'None' value.
  contains( raw_field('#updated'), 'None', '',
      str_in_list(field('tags'), ",", "Completed", "",
          cmp( deadlines, 2,
          "", "", finish_formatting( deadlines, "0.0f", "x" , finish_formatting(days_delayed, "0.0f", " (", finish_formatting(avg, "0.0f", ", avg ", ")")))
          )
      )
  )
