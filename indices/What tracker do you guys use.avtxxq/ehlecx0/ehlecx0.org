​

you just have to find the rss link and copy+paste it into the site, and it lets you track which chapters you've read and collects links to chapters automatically.

​

for reddit threads, you can make a link by using the search bar, and once you've come up with a search that will give you the chapters and not too much else, you set it to sort by 'new' and then type ".rss" after the search (before the question mark) in the url, then copy & paste that whole link.

​

Wordpress sites often have a link somewhere on the page, but it's usually just [[https://www.example.com/feed.rss]]

​

archiveofourown doesn't have the feature available, as far as I can tell.
