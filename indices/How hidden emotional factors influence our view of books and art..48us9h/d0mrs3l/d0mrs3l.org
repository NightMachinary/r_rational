Interesting, but less profound or new than you might think. I'm sure context and ideas and narrative affect art. They're also not the only things that do so. As often happens in this kind of essay or video, the author overstates the case. I found myself skipping forward and listening to it in bits and pieces. Poor choice of soundtrack.
