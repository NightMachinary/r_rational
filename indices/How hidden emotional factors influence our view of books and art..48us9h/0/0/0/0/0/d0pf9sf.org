  The claim is that external factors influence our view, not that they determine our view. You seem to be arguing against the second claim.

well, from the video explained it I cannot be 100% sure this was the intention, but from the phrasing they used I got the impression they were suggesting its the framing which makes something "A masterpiece". It didn't suggest that there is no such thing as good or bad art based on the technique etc. but from the way it was said they either suggested a bunch of art currently considered to be really good to actually not be good, but just have the right story to elicit that feeling in enough people for them to consider it a masterpiece even though its not actually good. Or it suggest no art is -really- a masterpiece, and that what make something a masterpiece is the story of it.

about studies I don't actually have any studies to one direction or the other. but the point is neither does the author of the video. he just brought up those suggestions and was trying to show how the fit\explain a bunch of stuff. but that is not research. to research this would be to prove statistically that X number of pieces of art only became special after their sad story got publicity, or somesuch.
