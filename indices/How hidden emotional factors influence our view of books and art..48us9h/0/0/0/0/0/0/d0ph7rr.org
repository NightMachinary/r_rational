The video says specifically that the internal quality of the art itself is about half of what matters, while the external factors are the other half.

"No one has ever painted an artistic masterpiece, at least as we understand it" is similar to saying that no one has ever passed the 30-foot mark on the long jump without crossing the foul line.

Regarding studies, this actually relates to several studies that have been done that found this result, but didn't find the proper explanation. Here's one done at King's College in 1983 ([[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060914114727/http://www.psy.jhu.edu/%7Elapd/dl/coke2.pdf][http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060914114727/http://www.psy.jhu.edu/~lapd/dl/coke2.pdf]]), where they gave people the same drinks and changed the labels and letters of them, and it continually changed people's rating. They could not offer an actual explanation for it, mainly just reported the result. The idea here explains studies like this. But of course, in all social sciences, you can ALWAYS well-poison data. It's unfortunate, but we can still learn from doing it, and people have to look at and understand the actual idea to determine its validity.
