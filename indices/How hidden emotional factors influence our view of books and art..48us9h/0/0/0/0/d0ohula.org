The claim is that external factors /influence/ our view, not that they /determine/ our view. You seem to be arguing against the second claim.

Also, regarding that this isn't a new factor. I've always asked people, when proposing this, to please direct me to where this was previously studied or discussed. They've never shown me where. I've seen Apparatus Theory (which says that film influences our view of the real world, this is the opposite), and Structuralism (which relates art to other art by saying that common structures work well, not that external emotions play a major part). And some spotty mentions in a few papers on marketing research (which found the different ratings for the same product in different contexts but guessed wrong at the cause), and one mention that associated emotions play a part in people's rating of music that didn't go any further. And that's it.

So PLEASE, show me where this has been said so I can look into it. I've been trying to find out for a long time. So far, the only conclusion I've been able to draw was that people have a vague inkling of it that they don't quite understand, and it just SEEMS that it's been known or isn't new once this is clearly explained, purely BECAUSE it's clearly explained.
