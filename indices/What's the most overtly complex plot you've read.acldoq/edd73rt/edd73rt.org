If you want realistic population manipulation, look at propaganda in real life. It seems that the best way to go about manipulating lots of people is to bombard them with lots of little things, there's a lot of research into this if you want to look it up. Study things like Hitler's rise to power, it's probably the best case scenario for something like that happening IRL (he got pretty lucky).

Speaking of that time period, something that meets the criteria of (1) is military maneuvers. The whole thing is complicated and interdependent, but each part is fairly simple and if it fails the plans are left open enough that other parts can be changed. But at that point it starts to not seem like one plan, because it really isn't. What you're asking for isn't really an overcomplicated plot, it's breaking a problem into pieces and solving them; the realistic way to go about it.

I don't see how you can really hit (2), since success in working towards your goal in one way will probably change how you work towards it in other ways.

I'm not entirely sure I know what you're asking for. Do you want plans that seem complicated when you put the pieces together, but could still be pulled off? Because you could do that by looking at a historical event in hindsight, and ignoring how people were changing their plans as they go.
