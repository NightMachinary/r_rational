I think the main plot of /Fullmetal Alchemist/ (the manga and the /Brotherhood/ anime) could qualify. It's an extremely complex conspiracy carried out over centuries of history, but I'd consider it plausible compared to your average conspiracy theory as it has [[#s][spoilers]] at its core, and involves very few people in the know at each time. While not all aspects of how the story itself unfolds are believable [[#s][spoilers]] the conspiracy itself, in that world, I could see working.
