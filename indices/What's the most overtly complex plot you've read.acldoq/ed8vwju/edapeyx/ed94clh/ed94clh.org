I think /Fine Structure/ takes the top spot for me, followed by /Ra,/ both by Sam512. I'd explain why /Fine Structure/ in particular is so convoluted, but I'd have to understand the plot for that. There's a lot of interconnected plot lines, exotic high-energy combat, hyperdimensional shenanigans, world resets and such. It also has, as you put it, "population manipulation" going on so you might want to have a look.
