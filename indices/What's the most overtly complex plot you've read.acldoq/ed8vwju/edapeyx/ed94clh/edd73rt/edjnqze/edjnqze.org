The most complex plot I've come across is in /The Golden Age/ trilogy by John C Wright. After the story is up and running there are long stretches of plot twists or reversals of fortune almost once a page. I started reading /really carefully/ to check for plot holes, because the shear accomplishment of writing like this without plot holes was astonishing.
