It's difficult but possible. Look up the Xanatos Gambit on tvtropes. You set up events such that both the success and failure of a group benefit you.

Ex: Make robots that steal from museums, but they look like the protagonists. So if they succeed, you have a bunch of stolen goods, and leak the identity to the press. If they fail, you've just framed the protagonists with theft (remember to include self destructs).

Have later plots depend only on the protagonists being known thieves.
