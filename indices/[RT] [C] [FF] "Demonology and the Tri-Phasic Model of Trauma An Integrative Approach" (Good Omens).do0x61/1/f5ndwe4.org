That was really good! It definitely classified as “rational” in that the characters took a systematic approach to solving their problems. Worm fans that like Jessica Yamada's interlude will definitely like this story. It was sometimes repetitive in its introspectiveness, but I think that was an intentional choice of the author to communicate the slow progress that real therapy can require.
