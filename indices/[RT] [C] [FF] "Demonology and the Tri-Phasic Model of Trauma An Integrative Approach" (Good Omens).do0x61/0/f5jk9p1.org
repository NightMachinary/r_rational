The trauma being the bookshop fire? I don't often read fanfic, but this sounds like a great premise. Speaking as someone who's prone to catastrophic hypotheticals about my loved ones being dead in a ditch somewhere, the idea that that event would have a lasting effect resonates with me (it was actually the subject of the only fanfic I've written as an adult, although that was nowhere near as in-depth as this). I'm also excited to see a ratfic recommendation for something focused on emotional exploration rather than passionless munchkinry, because I am a big sap. So I'm sold. I'll edit this comment with thoughts on the piece once I've read enough to form an opinion on the execution.

*Edit:* I've read through most of it and can confirm it's very good. It's a thoughtful and detailed character analysis (about much more than just the bookshop fire), sincerely emotional without crossing the line into sappy, and the writing is surprisingly deft when it comes to subtext despite so much of the story being /about/ explicating the subtext in the original work. I also like that the character of the therapist is given as much attention and depth as the canon characters, rather than just acting as a framing device.

The "professional" thing didn't bother me; I think it works as a representation of the lens through which the therapist sees herself, judges herself, controls herself. It's also only one of several examples of (apparently) intentional repetition in the narration.

*Edit 2:* The ending is extremely fun.
