This has a lot of things missing from most rational fiction and I think everyone on this subreddit should read it. Normally writers gloss over what is explored in great depth and clarity here. These are complex, flawed people grappling with issues that cannot be summarized or be seperates from their analysis by their nature. A great deal of careful thought is put into it and it is imperfect because no things are perfect and one has to face problem of being unable to face a problem but still need to have it faced and where to move forwards from there.
