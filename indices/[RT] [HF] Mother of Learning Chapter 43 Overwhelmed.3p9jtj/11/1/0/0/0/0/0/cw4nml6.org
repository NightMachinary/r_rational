Again, nope. If I had magic powers - which I don't honest - this is an example of the trivial but info-leaking kind of activity I would avoid.

Winning a lottery? It happens to someone. Winning a lottery, and also predicting a large number of other events with no plausible mechanism? /Highly/ suspicious. Better to use it three times only:

1. Do something big, which would usually have very severe consequences. Eg optimise the outcome of pulling a Snowden for every country, at the same time. If still anomyous, continue with #2 and #3.
2. Find personal happiness, eg via the power of Love^{^{TM}}
3. Excessive money - eg via a lottery - to accomplish whatever goals remain.
