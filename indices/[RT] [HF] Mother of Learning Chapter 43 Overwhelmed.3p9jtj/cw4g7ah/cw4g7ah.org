Curious on why Zorian didn't try learning martial arts from his classmates. Even if the strength and dexterity from it doesn't carry over, he can still learn how to more efficiently move his body, like "All you need is Kill".

Also, it seems we're going to be in Cyoria for a while longer. Preferably until Zorian manages to get any/all useful info from his classmates/the treasury/research facility as well as figuring out the most optimal method of making friends with everyone.
