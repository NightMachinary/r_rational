  Zorian is more the type to sit safely in an aegis and slug spells or pull a gun and just shoot his opponent if he needs a non-magic option.

IMO, it's even one step further. If Zorian can beat someone without even being spotted, or /anywhere/ near the fight, then he'd be in his happy element.

Dominating an iron beak and having it do the dirty work for him is totally in his style.
