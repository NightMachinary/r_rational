My take on it is that Zorian is simply not going to be into martial arts...ever. It would take far too much time devoted to it to turn it into any kind of useful skill and it's not a game changer anyway. Seriously, what good are martial arts among high level mages? Ever see Quatach-Ichl or Kyron throw down with their fists? Plus most of his opponents are nonhuman and hence it's suicidal to get within range of them.

Zorian is more the type to sit safely in an aegis and slug spells or pull a gun and just shoot his opponent if he needs a non-magic option.
