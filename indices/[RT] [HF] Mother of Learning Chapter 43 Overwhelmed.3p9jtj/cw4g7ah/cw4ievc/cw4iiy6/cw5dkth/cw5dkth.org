Any mage worth their salt can weave homing functions into all but a few spells, totally making dodging a non-option. This is demonstrated just this chapter with Naim. Despite being into martial arts enough to be on a national level, it's practically useless against Zorian who's using nothing but magic missile and shield. Even the vampire who has superhuman physical abilities and a magic weapon gets owned by the squishy mages.
