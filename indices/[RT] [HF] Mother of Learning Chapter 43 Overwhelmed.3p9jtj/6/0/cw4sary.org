I think the facility is unrelated to the time loop. Time dilation is something that is difficult, but can be done, and has been referenced before. I think the time loop itself is something much more special, and I've been leaning towards the opinion that it's more likely to be related to Daimen's discovery in Koth.

  [You're very close,] the matriarch said. [They were indeed trying to cause as much damage to the city as possible, but it was to be much more than a simple distraction. Apparently, the date of the summer festival is very magically significant. It is the day of the year when the barriers between planes of existence are the weakest. In fact, the weakening starts exactly one month before the date, gradually reaching its peak on the day of the festival. And this year's summer festival is even more special than usual. I'm afraid that us aranea don't know much about astronomy, seeing as we live largely underground, but apparently this year's summer festival includes some kind of... 'planetary alignment'?]

Reasonable guess would be that the loop starts at the beginning of the alignment, ends at its peak. I'm curious about whether that means it starts 2:40am on the first day as well, if Zorian can somehow inject a "wake up" command in head for the very beginning. I think Kael was saying that's around when the Aranea die at the beginning of each loop.
