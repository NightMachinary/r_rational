Had to google it, turns out it was bludvein's questions to nobody103, and he posted [[http://www.jcafe24.net/index.php?topic=41682.msg943829#msg943829][both the questions and answers]] on jcafe's forum.

It's odd how often I see bludvein's posts on various sites, but that's mostly because he and I both follow The Games We Play, Mother of Learning, and Kumo desu ga, Nani ka. Edit: Oh, he posted on 17thshard too about Stormlight Archive. I should probably see what other series he follows if I need something to read.
