- According to the Filigree Sages, *shafts like these* were the 'secret' to the ease with which the aranea could penetrate even very deep layers on the dungeon without getting slaughtered in the process. While a *shaft like that* did allow for some of the horrid things from lower layers to reach you easier, they were very defensible and could always be collapsed on invaders if incursions got too frequent. In cases where *such shafts* didn't exist, aranea were liable to create them via application of stone shaping spells. --- Imho, the description gets kinda repetitive and could be changed slightly to amend against that.
