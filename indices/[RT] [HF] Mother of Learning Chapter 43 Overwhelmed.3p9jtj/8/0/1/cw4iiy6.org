For me, martial arts are less for attacking and more for defending. As seen in this chapter, the martial artist is able to dodge spells and be generally very agile/flexible. Zorian has low mana reserves, so being able to dodge and be quick on his feet would be a massive boon to his stealthy fighting style.
