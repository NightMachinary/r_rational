I'm sorry, it was the wrong sub. It should be [[/r/LightNovels]].

It was because the Chinese webnovel was flooding that sub and the mod got dissatisfied with it. He/she believe that [[/r/LightNovels]] should be mostly discussing about Japanese novels.

Sadly most of us got tired of the typical Japanese MC trope which generaly is meek and coward. So this Chinese MC trope is kind of a blessing for now.

Therefore they eventually gave us 1-2 week notice (I forgot) to make a new sub or join the sub that they have made (I don't remember). Almost everyone choose to move to a new sub to avoid that mod though.
