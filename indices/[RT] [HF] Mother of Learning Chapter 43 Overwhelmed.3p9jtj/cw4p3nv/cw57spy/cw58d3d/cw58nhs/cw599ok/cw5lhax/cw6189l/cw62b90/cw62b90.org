Well, that trope is not that uncommon in Japanese lightnovels either. Mahouka for example, where the main character is literally incapable of emotions. It's funny how so many power fantasies aimed at teenagers make the characters not care about anyone else, as if empathy is a weakness. I guess to an insecure teenager a character who doesn't care about how others view them feels empowering.
