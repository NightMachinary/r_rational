  Anyone want to throw out guesses on how much information those "memory stones" can hold? If if's significantly more than a notebook, then I think Zorian just got a stealth upgrade to his cross-timeline carry-over capabilities. Maybe even let Kael keep entire memories, at the absolute most optimistic.

If they are that effective, this could be 'mind bubbles in Time Braid' levels of 'can just bring people into my loops now'. If he can backup at least a month of memories in those, he can bring people's last iteration along with him into the loop.
