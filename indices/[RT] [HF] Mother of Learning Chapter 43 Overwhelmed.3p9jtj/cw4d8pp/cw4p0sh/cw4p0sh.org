I wouldn't mind him telling her.

And if he wanted to deflect, all he has to say is "I'll tell you, but after the festival."

Edit: It just occurred to me it would be a bad idea to tell her because she lacks mental protection and any information she has is likely to be skimmed by the rats. The only way he can safely tell her is by making her leave town until the end of the loop or telling her on the last night.

He probably could tell her about his empathy and lie, saying it lets him learn faster or copy skills.
