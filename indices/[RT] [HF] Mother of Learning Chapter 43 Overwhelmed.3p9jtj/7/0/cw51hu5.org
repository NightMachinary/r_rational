  Shouldn't he be afraid his soul would've been ripped out of his body and kept as some kind of trophy, or something?

From [[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/4/Mother-of-Learning][chapter 4]], the lich's first combat instinct seems to be the red disintegration ray. The lich only resorts to soul magic when Zach practically yells it at him.

So basically, the lich would generally just murder Zorian. Assuming he survived somehow, he would have plenty of time to activate his suicide failsafes. But even if that didn't work, as long as he managed to not say "My soul is in a time loop, lol" like Zach did, the lich would just kill him.

That is, unless Red Robe informed the lich about Zorian beforehand, in which case he would almost certainly not wait until the invasion itself to mutilate his soul out of the loop.
