Anyone want to throw out guesses on how much information those "memory stones" can hold? If if's significantly more than a notebook, then I think Zorian just got a stealth upgrade to his cross-timeline carry-over capabilities. Maybe even let Kael keep entire memories, at the absolute most optimistic.

Well, assuming those stones are something he can blueprint and reproduce, like his spell requires. And assuming the limiting factor in his brainspace isn't actually raw information rather than just mass. All right, maybe this /is/ bit too much of a speculation...

On another note, wow, he got killed so off-handedly by the lich. Shouldn't he be afraid his soul would've been ripped out of his body and kept as some kind of trophy, or something? Not that I would've seen that coming, since I thought Zorian wasn't having a noticeable effect on the invasion overall, but after the fact I feel like that's really something there should've been countermeasures for. Or at least some consideration whether Quatach-Ichl would bother.

Eh, but the drama ending was as neat a bombshell as I've ever seen.
