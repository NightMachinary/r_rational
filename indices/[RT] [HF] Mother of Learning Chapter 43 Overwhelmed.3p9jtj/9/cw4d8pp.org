It seems easy enough to deflect her. Make up some lie like "I have secret mind magic arts from the Aranea, which utilize a unique innate ability of mine which they share that allows me to instantly copy a number of skills from people and learn spells much faster."

He could plead the fifth and remain silent. Lots of options.
