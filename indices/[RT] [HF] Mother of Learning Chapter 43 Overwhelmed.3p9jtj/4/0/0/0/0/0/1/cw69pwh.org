Most of the one translated is about the path towards OPness. However not all are made equal.

I shall seal the heaven is an example of a great chinese webnovel. Unlike the rest of its peers, the MC wasn't shoved with luck like the IET novels (e.g. coiling dragon). Nor the MC slaugher its way like in Martial God Ashura (maybe? I didn't read it)

Or you can always find translated "proper" novels & some more webnovels in [[http://www.spcnet.tv/forums/forumdisplay.php/29-Wuxia-Translations][here]]. You can find the translation of Condor Heroes series which is very popular in East asia. So much so that it has its anime. I personally recommend A step into the past by Huang Yi. It is quite rational IMO.

In the end though, you do need to understand some chinese culture to able to understand some their novels. Rebirth/reincarnation is not a common sense in every culture.

I think the sheer size of Chinese population (overseas Chinese included) makes it not as important to promote their novels outside their own region.

That is unlike Korea which depend their economy with that culture push.
