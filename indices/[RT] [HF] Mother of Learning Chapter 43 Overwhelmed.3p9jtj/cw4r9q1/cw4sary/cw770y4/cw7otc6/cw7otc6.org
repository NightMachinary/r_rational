nobody103 already made a statement about the time dilation about a year ago.

#+begin_quote
  Yes. The logistics of time dilation are much more complex than people usually posit, though. I cringe every time someone write in a scene where a character spends a few months in their personal dimension (double cringe if they spend all those months alone; how are they not insane by the end?) like it's nothing. Later, when Zorian actually gains the capabilities to do that, I intend to explain why Zorian can't just casually abuse that idea.

It definitely exists down there, and Zorian will acquire access to either it or the necessary techniques, but it doesn't seem like he's going to be spending all time in such a place.
