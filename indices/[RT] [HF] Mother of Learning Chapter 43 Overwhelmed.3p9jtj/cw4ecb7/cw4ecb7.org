I love how Zorian starts out trying to be moderate. Only wants to make two friends to avoid drama, only wants to spend a bit of time on golems, only uses basic spells to avoid being overpowered... and he ends up with all the friends, him wanting to spend all day on golems, and still beating everyone else so bad Taiven started crying.

The accidental badass trope isn't used nearly enough.
