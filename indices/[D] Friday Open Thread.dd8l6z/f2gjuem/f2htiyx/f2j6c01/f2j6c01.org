  I think it depends on how you recall the memory, recalling the facts or details doesn't do much but putting yourself back in it does for me.

See that 'putting yourself back in' part I always thought was a figure of speech about imagining you're in that kind of situation again.

  When you think of a horribly embarrassing memory you don't get the sensation of it? I don't really feel the emotion that much, but I still feel the chest tightness of embarrassment.
#+end_quote

I kinda do. But it happens no matter whether I was embarrassed at the time, it feels like run of the mill second-hand embarrassment.

  Or can you think of a time you were justifiably angry? Does your heart rate not pick up a bit or you feel it pounding?
#+end_quote

No, can't really think of a time like that :P I don't really get angry.
