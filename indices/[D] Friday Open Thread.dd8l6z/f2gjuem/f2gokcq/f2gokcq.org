Yes, that is pretty standard fare of experience to me. It sounds like the article is describing something even more severe than what you have, where not only can she not recall any emotional experiences from the past but has difficulty imagining herself within a memory or daydream at all.

For me it's pretty effortless to reimagine being in some past situation again and running through what happened again, feeling an echo of the same emotions without any extra thought involved.
