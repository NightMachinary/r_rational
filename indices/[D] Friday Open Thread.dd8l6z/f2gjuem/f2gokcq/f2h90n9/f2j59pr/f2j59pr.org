  It's kind of weird to think that you wouldn't be able to remember what you were feeling at the time some experience happened, but you can remember the actual events. Can you remember what you did and why you did it?

Well, I generally think I remember less than other people, have noticed that long ago already. I can only remember what I did for specific events that seemed significant at the time (or shortly after), and so became part of a mental story. It's not particularly easier for me to remember what I did versus remembering something someone else did.

I can remember what I was feeling during an event if that was a really important part of the event, but again - that's the same as remembering something that happened to someone else, and knowing what they likely felt at the time.
