Yep. I can remember fairly well what I was like at various ages and how I felt at the time certain experiences happened. I would not describe it as "mental time travel" though. More like emotional state is just information that gets recalled along with the events and context. It's typically only significant if the event produced strong emotions, but then "experiences that evoked strong emotional responses" are what we remember most anyway. Or at least that's my impression from general knowledge - I've never really bothered to look into it, so I don't know what current research says.

It's kind of weird to think that you wouldn't be able to remember what you were feeling at the time some experience happened, but you can remember the actual events. Can you remember what you did and why you did it?
