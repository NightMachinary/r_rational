Yeah, this sounds way more real to me than what everyone else is saying. Welcome to the club! :P

Yeah, I also struggle with figuring out 'what I like' or 'what I want'. To some degree I've worked out skills to compensate for this lack of internal desire. I know for example that I like it - it feels good - when others are impressed with me in some way. But this doesn't really translate into a /desire/ to achieve that situation; it's more of another point in the plus side for doing something, if I predict it'll be impressive.
