My memories don't have any real sensory qualia to them, they're just knowledge of things that have happened. I remember facts about the events that happened in the past, and I remember facts about what I was thinking and feeling, my motivations, the context of the events happening, and what I suspected the people around me were thinking and feeling. The farther back I go in my memories, the less of this 'metadata' information I have, my memories from when I was a child are pretty much entirely just the physical events by themselves.

I have another internal experience question I've been meaning to ask people: what does it feel like to want something? Do desires and preferences have qualia? For me they don't feel like anything, and I've always had difficulty trying to parse my own preferences, so I'm curious if other people have the same internal experience as me.
