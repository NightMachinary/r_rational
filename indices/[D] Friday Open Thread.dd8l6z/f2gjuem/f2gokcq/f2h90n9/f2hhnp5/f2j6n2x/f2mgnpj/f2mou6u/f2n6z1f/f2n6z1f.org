Yeah, it was very strange and surprising to me as well. If I understand her right (which I easily could not be,) she can't really hold a vague and fuzzy image of a person, she needs to have a fully formed image, and since people and especially faces are so distinct, I think her brain can't just produce a new unique person on demand, so it has to settle for a cartoony stick figure.

I like your example of the red train. For me, I can imagine shapes and movement and spacial relations, but it's more like proprioception than like vision, more like feeling my hand being in a place and moving around than like watching an object move. There's no color, and shapes are only as complex as I bother making them. I could construct a whole model of a train with lots of detail, or a basic outline of a train, or just a cylinder. For a quick sentence like this I'd probably just make a point particle and label it 'train' and 'red'. The point particle would be moving along a pair of lines labeled 'track', maybe along an inclined plane l label 'mountain'. Then the point particle is relabeled 'toy train' and everything is shrunk to a smaller size. A object labeled 'hand' appears and picks up the train and is then extended into a basic body shape standing over a table shape.

Having written that, I think it's still actually more detail than I usually use when reading a sentence. To some degree I think spatially like that, but to some degree I just invoke the concepts by themselves. It's hard to even describe it more abstractly though, except as just like: red, train, movement forward, train tracks, mountain, smallness, hand, grabbing, person, table.
