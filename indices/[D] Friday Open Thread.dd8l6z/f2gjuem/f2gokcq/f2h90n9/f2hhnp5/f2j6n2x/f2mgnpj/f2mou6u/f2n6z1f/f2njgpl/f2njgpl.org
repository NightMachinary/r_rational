For me it's quite different, I can't think visually at all, unless I'm either very close to REM sleep or otherwise (very) strongly in a sort of "wandering" state of mind.

I'd say my main mode of thought is auditory, but that may not be exactly accurate. I'd say it's sort of a mix between auditory and "generic language processing".

For a long time I thought my thoughts were almost entirely auditory, but I noticed that I can think about things even without a coherent "inner voice", which is most noticeable when speed-reading, or skimming some text.

On another, slightly related note, I believe I have aphantasia. I cannot imagine anything visual vividly - unless I'm on the edge of REM sleep. I recently took a survey about aphantasia, where one of the questions was about the vividity of certain modes of thought - including visual, auditory, olfactory, and so on. I'd like to score how vivid some modes of thought are for me:

- auditory: I can recall somewhat complex audio sensation (simple melodies, simple percussion) with near-perfect clarity. I can /almost/ hear any audio I imagine, but real auditory sensation takes precedence unless I've tuned it out (fan noise, AC hum, radio static).
- spatial: Great vividity, great recall (but I never got the memory palace method to work). I can extremely vividly imagine a space, and I can easily mend it. If the space becomes too complex (e.g. trying to imagine a maze) I lose detail. This 'sense' is completely separate from all other senses, and is hard to explain. I imagine an entire space at once, OR I imagine a view (non-visual) from a traversal within that space.
- kinesthetic: Very mild vividity when awake. I can imagine the sensation of movement, but it's extremely dull compared to the real thing. When near REM sleep (or even in light sleep) imagining this is way more vivid. One of my methods of inducing a lucid dream is imagining something with strong kinesthetic sense, like laying on a beach, with the waves moving me (pulling me, pushing me, and rolling around me, with an occasional larger wave that spins me around), or being on a swing/hammock, or on a rollercoaster.
- olfactory: Absolutely nothing. I cannot imagine a smell in any meaningful way. I cannot recall smells at all, only the connections I made at the time of making the memory (e.g. I can recall that I felt a /sweet, flowery/ smell, but only if I've taken note at the time, and these are just arbitrary labels that describe smells that share some characteristics, I most likely couldn't distinguish smells from memory if they shared those characteristics). I can't imagine smells even in REM sleep.
- visual: Minimal vividity. When fully awake, it's hit or miss whether imagining anything visual works at all. If it does, it's likely just a simple shape, minimal color, if any. Recall is marginally easier. In REM sleep, however, I can imagine strong and vivid visual sensation, which seems moderately tied to spatial sensation.
- touch: No vividity for recall or imagined touch.
- pain: No vividity for recall or imagined pain of any form, except for rare occurences in REM dreams, where the pain is dull, mild, short-duration, and usually leads to instantly waking up.
- temperature: No vividity for recall or imagined sensation of temperature. The real sense overrides any possible attempt at this.
- faces: This is potentially a subset of visual, but I have zero face recall, if I try to imagine faces on the edge of REM sleep I get generic 'fuzzy' features, which look fine at first, but if I try to "concretize" any one of their features, I end up neck deep in the uncanny valley (which is weird to experience from within your own mind). I can only /learn/ faces by A LOT repeated exposure until I hardwire some neurons to recognize them. This is only a one-way recall. I could not draw ANY face, not even my own, or my parents' faces.
- Am I forgetting anything important?
