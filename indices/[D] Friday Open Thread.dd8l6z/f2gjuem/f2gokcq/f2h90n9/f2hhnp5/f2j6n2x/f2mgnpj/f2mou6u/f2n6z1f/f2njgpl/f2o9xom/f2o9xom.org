Oooh, love this idea.

auditory: Very vivid. I can hear something like a symphonic orchestra in my head, and if there's no distraction / am in the right mood identify position of individual instruments. (though, my memory is not good enough to confidently recall something like this from memory; it'd likely be made up)

spatial: Moderate. I can imagine / 'feel' distance and relative position of two objects on a plane (though scale is very abstract; i.e. something can be twice as far from X than some other thing, but not '10 meters away')

kinesthetic: Moderately strong. Things like 'this is what it feels like to move my hand' or 'this is what it feels like to ski' are identifiable and distinct, but not possibly confusable with actually doing it.

olfactory: Yep also nothing.

visual: Basically nonexistent. I can visualise basic geometric by constructing them with intersecting lines / planes.

touch: Reasonably vivid. I can recall and feel things like the feel of sea spray on my face while sailing, the feel of snow, the feeling of pressing a key on a mechanical versus rubber-dome keyboard, or fingernail striking a guitar string.

pain: Yeah recalled pain feels nothing like real pain to me. I also have fairly high pain tolerance naturally - whenever I see someone writhing under a massage I feel quite envious actually :P Those never really feel like much to me.

temperature: Weak. I can imagine being hot, warm, cold; seems there's a couple levels but no gradual scale.

faces: Am basically face blind :P
