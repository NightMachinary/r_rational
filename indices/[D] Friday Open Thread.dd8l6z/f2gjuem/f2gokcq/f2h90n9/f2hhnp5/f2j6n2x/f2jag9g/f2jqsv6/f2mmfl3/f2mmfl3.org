  Do you ever get engrossed in music?

Yes, but there is a strong visual component to it as well. I have scenes that play out for songs in my head. Some songs have multiple exclusive interpretations.

For a while I thought I was an auditory learner, but (in addition to that framing being mostly useless anyway) it just turns out that I visualize what people talk about and learn visually even if I'm only listening. To the extent that I learn faster if I don't wait for people to draw things: its faster for them to describe it and me to imagine it than for it to be drawn on a board, for example.

Still, the metaphor is helping me a bit. I'll +look+ pay attention for examples of non-visual thought in my life and try to imagine what it would be like if I did most of my processing that way.
