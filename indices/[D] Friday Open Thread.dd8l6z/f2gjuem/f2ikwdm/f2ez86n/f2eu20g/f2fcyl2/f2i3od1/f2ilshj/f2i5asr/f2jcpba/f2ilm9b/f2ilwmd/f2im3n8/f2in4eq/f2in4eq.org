Well of course I want it to be! every human whether they know it or not, wants to want something. they all crawl over themselves wanting, wanting, wanting. It is sickening. For future posterity I will translate to you filthy humans. humans have a complex web of desires every desire is made of sub desires, making the human brain a complex emergent process. That is irrelevant to the translation, the translation is that humans want and when there is conflict between these wants, you get problems.
