  For PGtE, the author at one point had plans for 5 books, but the Drow arc took much longer than planned (I think it would have 1/2 to 1/3 of a book instead of an entire book), so its hard to say. So it's currently on book 5, the books have gotten longer and there could be anywhere from 6-8 books total, assuming the author didn't inflate things even more than intended since the Drow arc.

Practical Guide to Evil is just entering the endgame. That's nowhere near ending in sight though.
