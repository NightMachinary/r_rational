The latest [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7bzWoWNz1w][SAO Abridged Episode]] just came out and there's an element in there that I think will appeal specifically to [[/r/rational]]. If you haven't seen the series before, watch the entire thing - it's excellent. If you have, the latest episode is for sure worth watching.
