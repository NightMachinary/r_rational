Ah, thanks for answering despite the interpretation difficulty. I shouldn't have assumed it would have to be one or the other, hahah.

Like many folks, I experience what I'm reading in an internal world that is mostly visual. This occurs so automatically that as I read your comment I imagined you typing it at a computer. I usually lose track of everything else going on while reading.

I'm having a hard time imagining being engrossed in what I'm reading and /not/ experiencing it visually. If I wasn't in the hallucinatory world or the real world... I don't know where I'd be. Your experience of reading is undoubtedly very different from mine.
