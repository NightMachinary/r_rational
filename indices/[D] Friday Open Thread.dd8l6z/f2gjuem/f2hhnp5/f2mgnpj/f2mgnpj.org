Neither for me as well. When I'm engrossed I don't see the page, and I'm not aware of the words as such, but it's not visual either. It's hard to describe because it's very abstract, I just experience it as an awareness of a series of events happening, and of the feelings of the protagonist. It's pretty much the same way I experience recalling a memory, as I responded to OP with, which has an interesting effect in that my memories of books are pretty much identical to my memories of my own life, and my own memories don't really feel more significant in any way.

I have a friend I like to talk to about this kind of thing because she's at the extreme end of being a visual thinker, to the point where her internal voice exclusively uses images instead of words. She has trouble reading stories unless there's a film adaptation or fanart of the characters she can look at first, because otherwise she'll just imagine the characters as stick figures when she reads, which isn't very enjoyable.
