Thanks for expanding my understanding of this.

That's very strange to me! I usually just 'pick' a way for someone to look and change it if it needs correcting. Sometimes the edges are fuzzy and undetermined until specifically stated or implied. My visualization changes with new information.

Here is an example. "The red train zipped around the track until he picked it up."

Adjectives come before nouns: reading that, I have an amorphous concept of red loaded before I know what to apply it to. The concept is like a red cloud, or red reflections on an object that I don't know what it is. When the word 'train' appears, it's like an image comes into focus.

In my visualization the train was traveling on a mountainside until the second half of the sentence, when it transformed into a model train and began traveling on a hobbyist's table. A person appeared: that person is a child with indeterminate hair and eye color, perhaps five years old but subject to change. He isn't well-defined but he might be based on my nephews.

There are very many different kinds of minds, it seems.
