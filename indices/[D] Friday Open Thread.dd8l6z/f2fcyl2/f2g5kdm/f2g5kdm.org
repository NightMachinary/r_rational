For PGtE, the author at one point had plans for 5 books, but the Drow arc took much longer than planned (I think it would have 1/2 to 1/3 of a book instead of an entire book), so its hard to say. So it's currently on book 5, the books have gotten longer and there could be anywhere from 6-8 books total, assuming the author didn't inflate things even more than intended since the Drow arc.
