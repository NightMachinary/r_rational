Yeah, I think the characters get reasonably more complex as they're explored. It's never going to be Dostoevski, but it's definitely good enough.

My only complaint with Cradle is that the last book's ending doesn't close enough threads. It's not really a cliffhanger but it feels like a middle act of a bigger book rather than a thing on its own. But you have a bunch of stuff to read until that becomes a problem :P
