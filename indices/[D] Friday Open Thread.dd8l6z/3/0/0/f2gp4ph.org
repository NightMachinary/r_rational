One thing I will say about the characters in pretty much all of Will Wight's books, is that they may not be deeply explored but they tend to be /very/ self-consistent. There's no backsliding in character development just to progress the plot, and characters almost never act out-of-character.

IMO the best example of this is Lindon's self-assertiveness. He starts out the series speaking in a super formal and submissive manner (largely because he's the weakest person around), but as he becomes more powerful and as people tell him to stop talking like that, he slowly drops it and becomes more assertive.

It even turns in to a joke in Underlord: people tell Lindon he's not allowed to go somewhere and he decides you know what? I'm a powerful Sacred Artist so I can do what I want. He barges in only to realize that they were telling him not to enter because Yerin was changing. It's funny, but still in character and even works as a bit of character growth.
