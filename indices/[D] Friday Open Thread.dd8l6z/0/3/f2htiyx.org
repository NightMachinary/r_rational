I think it depends on how you recall the memory, recalling the facts or details doesn't do much but putting yourself back in it does for me.

When you think of a horribly embarrassing memory you don't get the sensation of it? I don't really feel the emotion that much, but I still feel the chest tightness of embarrassment. Or can you think of a time you were justifiably angry? Does your heart rate not pick up a bit or you feel it pounding?
