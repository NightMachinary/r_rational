Oh that's very easy to interpret for me. Suppose someone you know went on a trip. You know they went on a trip but you personally don't have any memories of the trip.

Like, I know I went to my uni's graduation ceremony, who I went with, and where it was, but I literally have 0 recollection of what it was like.
