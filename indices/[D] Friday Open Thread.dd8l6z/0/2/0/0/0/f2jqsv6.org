Do you ever get engrossed in music? Close your eyes and just feel emotions without any particular visual or conscious aspect to them? It's something like that. In fiction I can identify or relate to characters and feel things as if what I'm reading was really happening to me or someone close to me, but there's no visual aspect to it.
