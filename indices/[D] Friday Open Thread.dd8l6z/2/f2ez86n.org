Does anyone have links to detailed anatomical diagrams of jumping spiders' faces, specifically regarding the articulation of the pedipalps?

This is for a Halloween costume of a spider head similar to [[https://biomorphosis.tumblr.com/post/95684854810/cant-dance-well-youre-not-getting-laid-a][the dancing peacock spider]]. Last year, I had a single point of articulation located beneath the eyes, where the top of the pedipalps were tied to the skull with strips of fabric. The pedipalps didn't move convincingly, and I'd like to do better this year, but that requires understanding the anatomy.
