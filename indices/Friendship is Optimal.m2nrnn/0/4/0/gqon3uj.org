It's more along the lines of the productive capability of doing stuff like immediately developing nanotech when our combined science and engineering doesn't have a mechanism for doing even simple versions of the stuff. The AI in Thousand Tales is plenty smart and does outthink humans all the time, but just because it has access to massive amounts of processing and the sum total of human knowledge does not let it immediately bypass a ton of R&D and lab-based prototyping and factory construction that must take place in the macro scale.
