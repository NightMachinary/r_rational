I don't have a link, no, but it was something to the point of how, if he'd written the same story, in Yudkowsky's version parts of the horror of the situation would be that all the "ponies" would still be aging and mortal, for no other reason than that CelestAI would be following the depiction of ponies as seen in the MLP show.

In Iceman's version, she seems to have enough leeway that she can at least make the ponies unaging and immortal.
