I'm not so sure. I estimate that when a young, attractive and charismatic person with good diction says something in a video, people are somewhat more likely to listen to them rather than a wall of text. And, more importantly, they are more likely to keep coming back for the next message.

If the goal is to spread rationality, every available resource should be used and pretty faces are undoubtedly a valuable one. Exploit biases to more effectively make people rational (and isn't that what this video is about in the end). How about it?
