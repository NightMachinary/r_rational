Yeah, but this subreddit isn't about exploiting people in this subreddit to learn or accept rationality. We're here to discuss works or rational and rationalist fiction, which this is not. I liked this video, but I am downvoting it because I don't think it belongs here.

It was interesting to watch, nonetheless. I'd have vastly preferred it in text form, because I read much more quickly than anyone talks, and it's easier to reread a section or implement other strategies than to do that with video. Whenever I'm trying to get educated on something, I hope there's text.
