Except that it's just a statement of fact. If you're going to denounce videos and articles which promote rationality then what is the point of trying to even promote rationality through other entertainment means like fiction? I'm not saying there needs to be a strict scripture oriented community and it's disingenuous to say as much about my comment. I'm just pointing out that you lack any real conviction to a ideology that you claim to support. What is the point of trying to argue freedom when that doesn't help the objective of the community? And, if there is no objective, why bother with promoting rationality?

Certainly there can be disagreements and counterarguments, but if freedom of the community to believe and do whatever comes before promoting rationality then what's the point of even building a community to promote rationality? It would be sparse with either lackadaisical objectives or no real objective to pursue.
