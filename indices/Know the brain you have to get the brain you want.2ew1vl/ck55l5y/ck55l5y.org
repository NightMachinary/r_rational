Jeez guys...the president of CFAR posts a youtube video and your comments are all about how whether or not her pretty face is going to bias everyone and whether or not that ethical? I mean, I get that physical appearances bias people, but that doesn't mean that we have to eliminate all traces of everyone's physicality.

I too, prefer text over video for information speed reasons, and agree that this material is a bit obvious to most of the readership here. Youtube does has an option to 1.5x or 2x the rate, really helps for informational videos in general.
