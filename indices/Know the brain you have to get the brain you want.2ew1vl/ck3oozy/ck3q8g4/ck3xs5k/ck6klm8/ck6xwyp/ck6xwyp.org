I'm not really sure what is there to explain. The meaning I wanted to convey is this: "an average person will be more likely to return and watch future videos starring someone one finds attractive rather than read text".

Since individual standards of attractiveness tend to overlap quite a bit within similar cultures, a strategy of using a conventionally attractive person to narrate entry-level videos about rationality is a sound one, in my opinion.

The secondary message is that I find Julia attractive. Since my preferences are pretty average as far as know, I think the reasoning above applies to videos with Julia.

That's it. I don't rightly know what was unclear in the original post. Illusion of transparency in action, I guess. Hopefully, I have conveyed the meaning properly this time.

Edit: I don't think there is any ambiguity in the term "attractive" itself. If you want me to elaborate what precisely I've found attractive, I can do that. Although, for some reason, I feel that describing in detail what qualities I find attractive in a concrete person on public forum is a faux pas. Communication is so damn complicated.
