I'm sorry, I did not communicate effectively. Let me make myself more clear: the video was an interesting watch, and I liked it. I do not denounce the video, or the video's author.

The two points I am trying to raise are this: I personally absorb text much better than video, and so I prefer articles to video. This isn't really relevant, but it was something I mentioned. More relevant is that this isn't an on-topic link for this subreddit. This subreddit is about rational and rationalist fiction, and from what I can tell, this video is not fictional.

I recommend posting it to [[/r/lesswrong][r/lesswrong]] or some other good rationality subreddit. This subreddit, despite being called [[/r/rational][r/rational]], is a reddit for the posting of rational and rationalist fiction . This is a reddit for fiction, not for other things. Check out the side bar to the right to learn more!

I was remiss to not guess that you might new here and were not aware of the purpose of this subreddit. I was out of line to assume that you were deliberately violating the subject of the subreddit, and I will be more accommodating to new posters going forward.
