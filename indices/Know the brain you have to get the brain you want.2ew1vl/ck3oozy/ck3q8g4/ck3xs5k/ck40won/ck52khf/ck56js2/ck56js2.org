I suspect, though I am not sure, that this is the wrong subreddit to try that sort of thing. Here, any blatant attempts to paint someone as an outsider or question their solidarity with the in-group will probably be noted for what it is. Questioning someone's commitment to the cause when they disagree with you might work elsewhere, though-- it's a powerful tool to have in your back pocket, if you're not afraid to exploit biases to bend people to your will.
