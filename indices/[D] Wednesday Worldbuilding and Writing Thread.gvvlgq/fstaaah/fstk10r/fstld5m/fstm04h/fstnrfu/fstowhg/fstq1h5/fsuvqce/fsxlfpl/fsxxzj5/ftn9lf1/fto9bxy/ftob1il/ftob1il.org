  psychologist uncovering the conspiracy
#+end_quote

I've been watching The Sopranos and I do like the idea of the psychologist getting in on it. I've got the wizard being the firefighter's roommate, but the psychologist would be a great bonus character. Now I wonder if we've got an existing OC I can template onto the psychologist or if we'll need a new OC.... Hm, I have a thought, though this OC is/was the wizard's love interest so... maybe not?

  Maybe the fire just happened to be where the protagonist was - walking her dog, or across the road from her favourite donut place, or similar. Coincidences like that are allowed at the start of a story, in order to get the plot moving.

Yeah, unfortunately I'm using another coincidence to get the story moving elsewhere (she and the vampire end up crossing paths a second time, and she sees more evidence that only seems suspicious if she's suspicious of vampires anyway).

  He was nowhere close to the building that caught fire! He doesn't have any evidence because he lives alone, but he really was, and he insists on it!
#+end_quote

I don't think the patsy being in on it or not really affects the protagonist's actions: unless she's an expert witness (and she'll be too young for that), she's not going to be in the courtroom.

I don't know if we've cracked it in a way that is logical. Probably the best way she can see something suspicious is by actually physically being in the fire trying to rescue the vampire who is dying (but, if this was a vampire hit, then.... the vampire would ensure the opposing vampire was put into pieces and burned first thing and then let the rest of the building burn to cover it).

Unless it was a dumb/young/inexperienced vampire... maybe that's the ticket. I wanted her to start out by hunting the biggest baddest vampire around, but maybe it's better to go for a young'un. Maybe a young vampire kills (e.g.) her maker, is dumb enough to leave the other vampire dangerously un-dead before she flees the fire ('non-paranoid vampires rarely live long'). The vampire victim is smart enough to have a house just around the corner from the fire department so Jack is on the scene very early in the fire and is in the basement/whatever to rescue the occupants. She sees vamp!vic burn to death in a way that is very unlike what she's seen before (the whole going to ash very quickly part), and is freaked out.

Her work thinks she's just got PTSD, the psychologist angle happens.

Now, the problem here is:

- How does Jack find the vampire culprit, but the police/etc don't?
- How could she find the vampire culprit, if the vampire legal system is going to strike ASAP?

That's not too bad: culprit is bad at murdering, so was on video camera. The picture can be published in the newspaper / online on a wanted poster.

But I think "seeing a vampire burn to death" uses up my one coincidence, right? So I can't have them run into each other "in the real world", and the vampire culprit in this situation wouldn't be moving freely because she'd be scared of a bigger, badder vampire finding and "arresting" her.

And the "vampire legal system" would have the culprit be killed almost immediately in retaliation, so that's bad. Only alternative would be the vampire realising she's about to be executed and turning herself into the police, but the corrupt police would probably deliver her back to the vampire legal system.

But the logical way for this to go would be that Jack sees vampire victim burn suspiciously, Jack finds vampire culprit, Jack kills vampire culprit (with a big dose of luck), and then the vampire powers that be are like "okay this lady knows about us and has killed one of us successfully, we need to off her", and the war begins. (Naturally, the oldest vampires won't be risking their life fighting a slayer when they can have their underlings do it for them).

So the big question becomes: how can Jack find the vampire culprit? And that is.... exactly the question I was asking to start with. I've just added extra steps /facepalm/

  It makes sense for the vampires, because having the judge in their side is worth a lot more than having a dozen people each willing to confess to anything
#+end_quote

A judge is great but I feel like an unfair judge wouldn't keep her job very long, or would at least get a reputation. There's appeal and whatnot, and if the judge is actually refusing good evidence, then that's going to be something lawyers can work with. Much easier to do framing more directly and possibly with co-operation
