Hmmm. Some alternative options:

- The psychologist is /really/ just a random person with no connection to the werewolf conspiracy. However, being close the the psychology industry, she is herself in a position to start /noticing/ the werewolf conspiracy once she starts looking. Which she only does at the instigation of the firefighter. (Not sure if your wizard character could be making a living as a psychologist). At regular intervals (say, between chapters or something) you could have a scene where the protagonist talks the matter over with the pychologist; at first, it looks like you're doing this so that the reader knows how the protagonist is thinking (which is also a part of it), but then later on the psychologist starts noticing signs of conspiracy in her /own/ industry and there's another part of the mystery revealed through that part...

- Maybe the fire just happened to be where the protagonist was - walking her dog, or across the road from her favourite donut place, or similar. Coincidences like that are allowed at the start of a story, in order to get the plot moving.

- Instead of having the scapegoat give out a rehearsed confession, it might be better to have the scapegoat react with shock. He was home all evening that night! He was nowhere /close/ to the building that caught fire! He doesn't have any /evidence/ because he lives alone, but he really was, and he insists on it!

...and then it turns out (eventually) that this guy really /is/ totally unrelated to the vampire conspiracy. He's just some poor schmuck who didn't have an alibi for that time period. The judge, however, /is/ a part of the conspiracy, so he really hammers this poor guy, refusing to admit any evidence that may exonerate him, and doing everything in his power to find the guy guilty (based, if anyone asks, on the clear video evidence; and maybe a "witness statement" from another conspiracy member who insists he saw the guy there).

It makes sense for the vampires, because having the judge in their side is worth a lot more than having a dozen people each willing to confess to anything; because the judge is (effectively) a reusable resource.
