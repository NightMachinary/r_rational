  Hm, I have a thought, though this OC is/was the wizard's love interest so... maybe not?
#+end_quote

There are a few ways to handle this. Either the roommate and the psychologist turn out to already be acquainted (the live in the same city, so why not?) or they meet at some point due to both being close to the firefighter and end up hitting it off really well.

It's even possible that the firefighter may be acquainted with the psychologist before going to her for treatment; that might help her to trust the psychologist. Or maybe she's not, and is /very/ surprised when it turns out that the two of them know each other.

  Yeah, unfortunately I'm using another coincidence to get the story moving elsewhere (she and the vampire end up crossing paths a second time, and she sees more evidence that only seems suspicious if she's suspicious of vampires anyway).
#+end_quote

Maybe you can eliminate the /second/ coincidence, then; the firefighter complains to her roommate that she'll "never figure this out", and the roommate offers to try out a spell to help her "discover the truth" behind the original incident (or something along those lines). And all that does is set up the second not-so-accidental accident.

  How does Jack find the vampire culprit, but the police/etc don't?
#+end_quote

Jack knows the real guy's face, the police are working off the doctored video. Also (as above), Jack may get a nudge to probability from her roommate.

#+begin_quote
  How could she find the vampire culprit, if the vampire legal system is going to strike ASAP?
#+end_quote

Again, there are options here. Option the first; the original incident /was/ the Vampire Legal System - that is, the victim had somehow crossed the line, and the person who killed him was a vampiric enforcer, and is therefore safe from the vampire law. The trouble with this option is that a vampiric enforcer should be experienced enough to not leave clues (and/or witnesses) behind.

Option the second; the inexperienced vampire is inexperienced enough that he doesn't think the vampire legal system have the faintest idea who did it. He's continuing to go out in the open because either he doesn't know about the vampire legal system, or he imagines that if he hides away then they /will/ know it's him, while if he goes about business as usual and pretends to be surprised then they'll never figure it out! (He's wrong, of course, but that gives him a motive for being out and about).

  And the "vampire legal system" would have the culprit be killed almost immediately in retaliation
#+end_quote

The thing is, for a centuries-old immortal, "almost immediately" could mean "a week later". Such a trivial, open-and-shut case probably wouldn't hold their interest for long - especially not if there's something more interesting that they're all paying attention to. Such as, say, a vampire wizard who may have generated a suitably vague prophecy that suggests there's a probability that there might be a Slayer in the area soon... and perhaps there's a debate for a few days over whether this vampire killed the other vampire or whether (as he claims) the Slayer has arrived a little earlier than expected. (Which also means that the Vampires are not terribly surprised when he becomes the Slayer's first real victim).

  A judge is great but I feel like an unfair judge wouldn't keep her job very long, or would at least get a reputation. There's appeal and whatnot, and if the judge is actually refusing good evidence, then that's going to be something lawyers can work with. Much easier to do framing more directly and possibly with co-operation
#+end_quote

Yeah; and in 99 cases out of a hundred this judge is /mostly/ fair. But when the Vampires want, then he gives the one side a decent amount of slack and absolutely doesn't give the other side any slack at all - and every time this happens, there's some seriously damning evidence against the accused (like the video in this case). Any attempt to appeal is going to have to run up against the fact that the video evidence /exists/.

He shouldn't have to ever refuse good evidence. That's too blatant. He simply casts aspersions on the good evidence, making it /look/ like bad evidence, and then rules very firmly in the direction pointed to by the fake evidence. (And it's not like he never questions the fake evidence; he rather carefully questions it in ways that he knows it can withstand)
