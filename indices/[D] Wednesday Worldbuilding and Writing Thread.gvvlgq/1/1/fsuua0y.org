Form and Grace are much better stats than strength and dex - form, for example, obviously also govern how attractive you look in a still photo, while Grace governs how effectively you can do a seductive slink/strut.

Extend this, split mental stats into Mind and Soul. Mind is thinking, memory, common sense.

Soul is inspiration, charisma, standing up for yourself and against evil, the favor of the gods (that is, luck) splitting out presence and luck by themselves is just too damn narrow.

Maybe have sub-stats, much in the way worth the candle does, so that the system does permit narrower focus, not that someone who gets to distribute their stats themselves, as opposed to the auto-allocate the masses of the world are stuck with. would ever be daft enough to actually use that part.
