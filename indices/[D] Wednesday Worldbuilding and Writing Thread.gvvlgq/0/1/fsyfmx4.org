1. I encourage you to consider meta tactics. If dieties gain power through worshop you would expect that dieties which religion had their followers breed more offspring and who converted other people to be more successful.I would expect that there exists a good chunk of dieties that is of fertility(both of people and of crops) and of war(to convert more people into followers) since such a diety simply would reinforce behaviour that made it stronger more efficiently than others. I'd also expect that there are dieties that somehow forms unbreakable vows of worship. I suggest that you look at memetics.I would also expect to see a trend towards fewer and fewer dieties and dieties are insentivized to take over each others followers.What stops the evil dieties from literally having breeding stations similarly to what slave owners had but now magically efficient and with the only way out of it being to believe sufficiently strongly?
2. They've experienced that dieties bargain in bad faith. They don't like the idea of superpowerful mindparasites. They think that dieties have bigger control over them/can track them if they actively worship.Can an individual make up a small diety for themselves?
3. How important is it for the diety that people think of it in the exact same way? If it doesn't care much for minor details you'd see memetic drift. Notably what happens if an arch bishop in some area decides that he wants a big diety to be in X way and thus start to preaching that the diety is that way?
4. I don't think that sects matter much tbh. State religions have so much more mojo than a sect.
