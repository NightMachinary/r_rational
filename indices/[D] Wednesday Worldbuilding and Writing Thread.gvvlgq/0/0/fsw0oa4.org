1. I would think that you would get messiah-type characters who have their own practices and beliefs which they align with a diety, without being deific themselves. Imagine a cult leader who needs to be wined and dined lest he switch his allegiance (this doesn't necessarily need to be cynical). Similarly, a sufficiently large and well-organized state could have enough power to put pressure on the gods, depending on how strong those gods are. A state religion might exist as a method of coercing or pleasing gods which the gods would in turn by obliged to support or make compromises with. Whether a state would attempt creation of a new god depends on how hard that is.
2. "Tangibly helpful" is kind of loaded. Deities, even 'good' ones, probably have different definitions of good, and you might disagree with how their 'good' operates, for example thinking that they are, as a whole, entirely too paternalistic, something that can't be solved by replacing them, e.g. "No one man should have all that power". Alternately, you might deeply care about the emergent structures of this setup and think that the structure itself is the cause of huge amounts of waste and/or evil.
3. Historically, a lot of religious conflict happened because of different views of the law and the social contract. I would imagine that it wouldn't change that much, if those differences persist. People legitimately believe in their religions, so gods being 'real' is kind of a non-issue except to the extent those gods actively interfere with warfare, which is kind of on the gods. Intrareligious conflicts would be a lot different though, because a god with two sects could pick a side, or fail to pick a side, or be attempting to hold a lot of different believers under a 'big tent' which would lead to conflicts in what certain positions put forward by the god actually meant. A god has the incentive to have as many followers from as many different places and ideologies as possible, but they also have incentive not to ever let those followers come to blows.
4. I'd think there would be many more state-sponsored religions, and religion-sponsored states, likely blending governmental and religious functions to a point that's only rarely seen on Earth. You might also see a collection of state-sponsored religions, since each presumably gives different benefits, and having only a single god on your side limits you to only a single tool in the toolkit. This depends a bit on the specific powers in play, what their roles are, and how godly power ends up scaling with the number of believers (i.e. whether there's a diminishing marginal utility of belief, or whether it compounds, or some other curve or equation to where the benefits are).
