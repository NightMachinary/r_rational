Sufficiently high negative Presence probably gives you a notice-me-not/SEP-field effect, where people just don't notice you and you fade into the background. At extreme levels you could become an antimeme.

As for negative luck, I think it could work for you if you had sufficiently high Form and/or Grace to survive the effects. Like, you end up having meteors falling at you, storms and lightning, just general chaos and mayhem. If you can survive that, the negative luck only hurts your enemies. So good for combat, but not so good for the rest of the time.
