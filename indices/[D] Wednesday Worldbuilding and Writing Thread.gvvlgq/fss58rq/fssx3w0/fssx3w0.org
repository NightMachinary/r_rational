Well... If high Presence makes you 'prettier' and makes people gradually align their actions and beliefs to your interests, then largely negative Presence would presumably give you an aura of 'ugliness', and the aligning of their actions and beliefs against your interests. Now, the first boon this has is shared with high Presence, and it's that it makes others' actions more predictable. Extremely low presence means that you can be relatively certain that the people and creatures around you are going to hate you, possibly even going against their own self-interests in order to make this work. An assassin, normally preoccupied with ending your life, may open up opportunities for escape or retribution due to an instinctual need to drag the death out and make you suffer. 'Ugliness', on the other hand, has value in that it deters people from looking to closely at you. People may be inclined to look away, instead of observing you for visible weakness. They may become nauseous just from looking at you. If people are inclined to see the worst in you, and your form feels horrific, then that's terrifically intimidating, and until you get to the point where people would commit suicide just to spite you, it may be useful for information gathering.

Once you get to the absolutely lowest of the low in Presence, you might find that people are acting almost like an AI. They may start to consider, logically, that because their future selves are likely to value self-preservation over making your life worse, that it is an imperative that they precommit to actions that make the only viable course of action destroying you. They cut ties and install dead-man's switches, learn mind alteration magic to use on themselves to make sure they maintain their hatred - and in this way, because the hatred is now cold instead of hot, your low presence has now become an aura of death in some ways, destroying the lives and psyches of those around you as they attempt to destroy you. Of course, this isn't pleasant for you, either, but a superior might have some use for such a specific variety of WMD. It is much more destructive for a nation to have its government suborned with these hate-agents than to simply wipe it out temporarily.

Luck, then, works similarly to presence, save that the agent you antagonise is the world instead of people. The world is going out of its way to make your life a misery, and frankly this is much harder to manipulate than people, since the world has an arbitrary amount of intellect to work with. If you bottomed out on luck, for example, you might spontaneously develop a painful infection that leaves you bedridden but alive and suffering, or even worse, and there's not much anyone can do about it (unless their good luck and desire to see you happy outweighs your bad luck and similar desire).
