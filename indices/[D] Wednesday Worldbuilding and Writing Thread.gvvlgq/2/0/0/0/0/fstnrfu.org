It's tricky, I'm trying to work out the logistics.

She's got a partner who is a wizard, so the original draft had them followed by a ghoul who they were able to defeat through a combo of having the literal high ground (they were on the top of a building) and the wizard realising for the first time that her powers actually work (she didn't think they were altogether real, it was more a "wiccan" thing for her, setting intentions etc).

They survived by not being worth the vampire's time, essentially, because they're not a threat.

But I never really liked how the masquerade was pierced by them. It involved her finding a suspicious series of murders with sightings of local vampires years and years apart.

When I was toying with the firefighter thing earlier, it made a lot more sense that she'd find a vampire house that burned down (probably an internal vampire conflict?) with no bodies (maybe she's in the house trying to save the occupant, and she sees the body explode into ash. the other firefighters are like "yeah, sometimes weird shit happens, or you see shit" but she is like "no there's more to it" - but why does she investigate more? Do firefighters also do post-fire investigations? Perhaps she could find something suspicious like, no food in the fridge or a "bdsm dungeon" that looks suspiciously real?).

I want her to ultimately have a target, but video surveillance with the (vampire) arson suspect visible plus coincidence/happenstance of the vampire showing up at the same club as the firefighter could work. It does make you wonder why a vampire would be so careless as to commit arson in view of cameras, but then again, the police force can now be corrupt (and maybe the head of the fire squad, if this vampire frequently kills rivals with arson), so the case can be dropped even though the guy investigating with the MC thought it was clearly arson.

Hmmm.... it's sort of coming together. The "gimme" becomes them running into each other In The World, which is not horribly inconvenient. EDIT: and the vampire being careless enough to be caught on camera.
