  And.... the way to handle it was to remember that the potential psychologist isn't the wizard's OTP, the wizard's OTP is someone else, so if I decide to go with this person as the psychologist then the wizard's OTP status is not important.

Okay, that's simple and straightforward.

  Other thought: perhaps the "vampire who burns down the vampire's house" is actually not a vampire.
#+end_quote

So you start out with a potential Slayer tracking down an /actual/ Slayer? Could very well work out nicely.

  Jack doesn't even need to see the real guy's face, the police don't need to work off the doctored video. If the noob!vampire is killing vampires, then why wouldn't the big!vampires use the corrupt!police to find them?
#+end_quote

Because the vampires already know who set off the fire (/they/ have the undoctored video) but they don't want to leave a chain of evidence leading back to anyone in the Vampire community?

No doubt they have their own people to do the tracing and the chasing down.

  I like this. I like the idea of it being a young vampire who didn't like all the rules her maker was putting on her and decided to kill her maker. She didn't even realise that there were other vampires in town.
#+end_quote

Yep, that seems to work out pretty well.

  Oh I hate the idea of making prophecies work in a rat context. But it does give you a lot to work with.
#+end_quote

Yeah, there are some serious issues with prophecies in general. You'd pretty much need to have them be states of probability rather than hard-and-fast predictions (e.g. "the chances of a Slayer appearing here are 60%", and then the vampires experiment a bit to see what actions seem to increase or decrease the probability - this prophecy will be particularly perverse, because the more they concentrate on the prophecy the less they'll concentrate on sorting out that junior vampire, and the higher the probability will go).

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, it really depends on how often they do that. A judge making a bad call even once a year might be too much, especially since appeals are a thing.
#+end_quote

Of course, it's worth bearing in mind here that even their bad calls are actually well-supported by (fake) evidence; probably even /more/ well-supported than their normal calls.

#+begin_quote
  I like the idea of the following steps: I think that's all fairly coherent?
#+end_quote

Yep. that seems pretty coherent.
