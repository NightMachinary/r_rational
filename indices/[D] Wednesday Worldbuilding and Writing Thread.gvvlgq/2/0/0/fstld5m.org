oh my god. AXES.

when she was a cop I had the crossbow be her arm of choice but.... AXES. She can throw them too.

And yes, firefighters are so universally loved.

I also figure she'll know how fires work (since that's part of firefighter training) and she'll know some basic first aid. The instigating incident for her becoming a Slayer is a car crash, which is something the fire department often goes to (as well as the police).

It's gonna be awesome. And she'll have a badass uniform.
