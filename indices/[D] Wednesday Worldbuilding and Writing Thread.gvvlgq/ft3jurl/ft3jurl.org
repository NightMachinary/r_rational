I'm working on the very bare-bones of a cyberpunk magical girl story where aliens are invading and the heroes who save the day get paid to do so via Twitch (or a fictional equivalent) donations they receive mid-battle and wear sponsor logos all across their armour/costumes to get a bit more revenue.

It's meant to be a rather bleak outlook on two already dark genres. Mostly I want to try something tonally different from what I've written before.

All that's to say, I'm having a bit of a hard time with my 'magic' system. It's only magic in the 'sufficiently advanced technology' sense, but I think the same storytelling rules apply.

My last story has a very consistent yet soft system in place, this time I'd like to do something that's sort of the opposite. Have a magic system that's hard in terms of limitations and rules, but inconsistent with its risk/rewards.

Basically, the people who are chosen to gain powers are given a device that allows them to pick how they want to change themselves based on their accomplishments. Think of it as a sort of achievement system-based skilltree.

Sneak past some enemies? You can now upgrade your costume to have silent shoes.

Kill an alien with a handgun? You unlock the handgun tech tree, allowing you to instantly transform that weapon into something a little better.

I suppose my problems are twofold:

/How can I prevent this from being too abusable?/

and, /How should this sort of system express itself?/

I like LitRPGs as much as the next guy, but I'd rather avoid levels and stats in this case. I don't mind having huds and a clear progression system though.
