I was thinking about the MLP world and I have an interesting headcanon: Celestia is only a few thousand years old and not infallible, the sun was managed by a group before that and one could speculate it was passed down from time immemorial, after all people do have a vested interest in keeping it going but that still seems a stretch. Beyond the sun just about every aspect of the world is actively managed; weather, wildlife and vegetation. Furthermore this does not seem isolated to Equestria, most groups seem to atleast have the ability to alter their environment in fundamental ways, even most species and races seem to be created with some degree of intent by previous. What if the sun is a relatively recent invention? What was life like before that? How have things changed over deep time? I mean a lot of these are pretty baseless assumptions but that's beside the point, I want a story to explore the idea of a world of rolling creation, one where the actions of it's inhabitants is the main driving force rather than the consequences of physical law. The closest two I can think of off the top of my head are Strata by Terry Pratchett but that's not really explored and revealed to not have actually happened, and Digger, again part of the setting but not really part of the story (It's a good story, I reccomend it)
