I started doing a mid-year NaNoWriMo on Thu, May 28th. One week later (including one day off), I just broke 20k words.

... I think I've been a bit pent up.

I started this writing project mainly to regain the habits of a decent writing process, so the first parts are probably clunkier than they should be; but I'm finally starting to feel properly warmed up, and am finally starting to get into the meat of what I was hoping to write about.

Might anyone be interested in a bit of beta-reading, to help point out how best to fix up that first section? (The tags [WIP], [HSF], and [TH] definitely apply, and hopefully it's at least generally in the direction of [RST] or [RT].)
