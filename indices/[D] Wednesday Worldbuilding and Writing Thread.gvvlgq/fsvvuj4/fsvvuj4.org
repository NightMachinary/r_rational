I've wanted to read a rational take on a world with deities that need faith to live and give out various supernatural powers (healing magic, superhuman strength, control over metals and so on.) Hence, I've started outlining a book with that as its premise. My central conflict will be between the fair deities who reward people sufficiently for praying to them, and the evil deities who punish nonbelievers and create followers through coercion. I only have a few vague ideas about it, but I want to hear this subs advice for how to use the premise in a clever way. I'd like to know:

1. What are some ingenious way of abusing/exploiting the need for belief in deities? (Deities can be made through sufficiently strong belief in enough people).
2. What would cause someone to be an anti-theist character in a setting where deities are tangibly helpful?
3. How would religious conflict and orthodoxy be different in a world where deities unambiguously exist?
4. What are the political implications of living in a world where religious sects are supernaturally empowered?

or any other interesting consequences of people trying to take the consequences of divinely-empowered D&D-style clerics and paladins seriously.
