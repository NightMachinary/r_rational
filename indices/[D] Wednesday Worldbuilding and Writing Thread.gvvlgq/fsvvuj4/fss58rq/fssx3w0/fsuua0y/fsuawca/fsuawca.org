Maybe really high levels of Wis gives you skill sharing/copying/teaching skills? I feel like it should be something meta.

Negative Presence could be “everyone hates you”, “everyone pities you”, or both. If someone could swap their Presence from positive to negative and back they could make a good Beserker/Barbarian impression.

Negative luck seems pretty self-explanatory to me.
