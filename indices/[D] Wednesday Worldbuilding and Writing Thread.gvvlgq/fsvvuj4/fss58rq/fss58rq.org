The story I'm currently writing uses ability scores. It doesn't get a lot of screen time, but it's similar to the system in The Gamer in that you start seeing bonuses outside of raw scaling as you raise your stats. The bonuses don't pop up all at once on round numbers, but they might for example start appearing in weakened form at 400 and then be fully developed around 500. For example, normal people gain and lose muscle mass as normal, but as your Strength increases you retain muscle better and better, and once you hit 100 or so you no longer lose muscle short of starvation. Then, between 1 and 500 you start getting the benefit of exercise without actually doing it, while also raising the ceiling you can hit if you do exercise. Then things get silly (As they should) and you go beyond human limits and petty thermodynamic concerns.

I'd love some input on what abilities the different stats could give as they start going beyond mere scaling. The actual stats in this story are:

- Form (Strength & endurance)

- Grace (Agility, aim, precision)

- Intelligence

- Wisdom

- Presence (Charisma, attractiveness, bullshit leadership aura)

- Luck

- Corruption (Putting points into this one lowers it, it increases when you come into contact with /eeevil/.)

Form and Grace are fairly straight forward. They just dial up parameters that real people have, even if they do end up dialing them up beyond natural limits. I also figure Grace at high enough levels might allow you to change your perception of time, speed up thought and reaction time, etc, while Form will eventually allow for Wolverine levels of regeneration.

Intelligence and Wisdom are split a bit arbitrarily, but I figured making them one stat was too much. We do want to make room for intelligent fools, as well. So really high Int will give you things like a photographic memory, the ability to sense physical and magical elements, eventually let you delve into Alchemy, etc. High Wisdom meanwhile allows you to sense 'life energy' and souls, and as the stat goes up you can sense them over greater distances and in more detail, eventually letting you sense personality traits and such. Different magic systems use either Int or Wis. Basically DnD style.

Presence is an interesting one. Other than the making you 'prettier' part, it's basically just subtly mind controlling those around you, growing less subtle the more you raise it. However, it doesn't fuel magic of any kind, so going all in on it makes you less of a glass canon and more just glass.

Luck... Well, it's useful, but the rich and powerful have spent a lot of money developing ways of neutralizing it, because otherwise it breaks everything a little too much. So it helps against nature, but not in high level combat or at up scale gambling dens.

And finally, Corruption. Although 'discouraged' by the churches, having a high Corruption gives you secret insight into terrible, Lovecraftian truths and all that (Sanity is a resource to be spent, after all), but the flipside is it really does also damage your mind, so it's not for everyone and you might want to consider putting a few points in it now and then to keep the score down.

There are also a million hidden stats that you can't normally touch, but spend a year at the North Pole meditating on the nature of Cold and you might 'discover' the ability to put points into Cold affinity. Live in the woods training animals and you might find a new stat representing your spiritual connection to nature. Things like that. These are mostly so I can throw in NPCs with unfair powers.

Partly writing this to help organize my thoughts on a story I'm currently writing, but also if you have any interesting ideas on non-obvious bonuses that could come with high stats, I'd love to hear them. I'm also planning on having the main character discover a way to trade stat points around, and since in this system the stats don't bottom out at zero, I'd especially love ideas on what 'abilities' might develop out of sufficiently negative Luck and Presence.
