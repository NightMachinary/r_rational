  What are some cool consequences of a vampire-slaying-urban-fantasy-protagonist being a firefighter that I might not have considered? What are some opportunities? What are some drawbacks?

One good thing would be that your protagonist has a /fantastic/ reason to keep in excellent shape and build muscle. Heck, have your protagonist sign up for "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter%27s_Combat_Challenge][Firefighter combat]]" and she'll have an even better reason.

A drawback is that firefighters are pretty much always on call. You're going to run into some Spider-Man-style shenanigans where your protagonist is going to have trouble explaining why she can't show up to a fire on time, due to vampire-slaying duties.

Another problem might depend on what's left after a vampire dies: if they turn to dust, that's one thing, but what if a skeleton is left behind? If someone comes across a body (possibly deformed; I don't know how different your vampires are) in a supposedly abandoned, burned down building, that becomes a whole different kind of investigation than a simple insurance claim.
