  One good thing would be that your protagonist has a fantastic reason to keep in excellent shape and build muscle.

Yep! I was reading an article about firefighters in my city and the exercises they have to do are absolutely redonkulous.

  A drawback is that firefighters are pretty much always on call.

Is this true? I had more an understanding that they did 3 days on / 4 days off where they sleep at the fire house, but that's based on American stuff I've heard and my story's not set in America, and googling about Australian firefighters is all about last summer's record breaking bushfires when I really want the sort of general "day in the life" general interest piece.

I mean, that said, if she has to sleep at the fire house and can't go vampire hunting with her BFF then that's kind of interesting plot stuff. I think, realistically, she's ultimately going to have to quit her job to stop the Supernatural Scourge (like the Animorphs eventually stopped going to school) so I'm not /too/ concerned about that stuff.

  Another problem might depend on what's left after a vampire dies: if they turn to dust, that's one thing, but what if a skeleton is left behind?

Yeah, this is something I struggle with. Based on how My Vampires work, I think the only way to kill them is to burn them (otherwise you're left with severed arms/legs that can ultimately grow a new vampire, starfish style). I think it would probably also turn the bones to ash, too. Which is very convenient for hiding bodies.

EDIT:

I managed to find an article that covers how shifts work for firefighters in one part of Australia and here it is:

#+begin_quote
  Mr Jullienne --- or Jules, as he's known --- works two days on, two nights on, then four days off, like every other fireman.

  “Any normal day shift is ten hours long, staring at 8am. When you arrive you've got a bit of time to freshen up and have a bit of breakfast in the mess room. Usually what we do first though is check over our equipment, check over the pumps if we're down to drive, clean the station, do some station maintenance. Then it depends on what you're rostered on to do --- fire education talks in schools or nursing homes, building inspections, site plans for emergency situations, training exercises and drills. Then obviously there's a very high chance we'll get called out as well, so we fit everything around that.

  “Night shifts you have a little more down time. We still do our checks and training, but not so much community education. That shift goes from 6pm-8am, so it's 14 hours, a little longer than the day shift.”
