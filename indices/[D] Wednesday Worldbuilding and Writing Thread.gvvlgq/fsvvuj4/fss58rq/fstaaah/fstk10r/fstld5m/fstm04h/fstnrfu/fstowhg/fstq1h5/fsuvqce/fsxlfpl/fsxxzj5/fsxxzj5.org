  The only thing is - would the fire department review the camera footage?
#+end_quote

Perhaps her departmental chief is a chronic delegator. He hate getting up off his chair and doing stuff himself, so he delegates /everything/ to one-or-other of his underlings. And, as it so happens, he delegates the task of collecting camera footage to her.

Of course she looks at it, sees the transformation, and report it to him. He doesn't believe her - people don't just /turn into/ bats - but he tries to be gentle, calm, supportive and get her into a session with a good psychologist, because /clearly/ the strain has been too much for her and she's snapped. (Her protestations that she really did see it and she's /not crazy/ don't exactly reassure him). Eventually, he agree to go to the car wash and see the evidence himself, all the while trying to suggest that perhaps she was mistaken and there's really /nothing wrong/ with having a discussion with a psychologist...

And then when the two of them get to the car wash, the footage is different. She /can't/ avoid her discussion with the psychologist now (and the fire chief, out of respect for her, tells no-one about what he considers the 'bat delusion').

Perhaps the psychologist turns out to be an ally. Or at least a neutral person who acts as a sounding board - someone she can at least talk about her discoveries re the conspiracy with (even if said neutral person doesn't believe a word of it, but at least maintains a noncommital facade), incidentally allowing you to tell the reader what the Protagonist is thinking without having to show her thoughts directly.
