  Of course, if you really want to give your protagonist a Big Hint, have the camera catch the vampire turning to/from a bat. [and then all the evidence is "mysteriously" destroyed]

Oh, that's a good idea. That's a massive hint, believable, and immediately points to a large conspiracy so that she will be spooked from reporting this.

The only thing is - would the fire department review the camera footage? Maybe her cop DNA manifests as her being more inclined to do her own investigation. The main arson guy knows that This Fire is not one for her to investigate. But she knocks on the doors of the car wash across the road and they do have footage which they send to her personal email. She looks at it, sees the damning stuff, and then... is probably already suspicious enough not to mention it?

Then a few weeks later, the boss says, "oh, we managed to get footage from the car wash across the road, we found the woman who set the fire" and the MC is shocked because it was clearly a man and all of a sudden she wants to get to the bottom of this.

Then she runs into the vampire a few weeks later at a nightclub, observes him doing vampirey things, and the conspiracy is unwound in her brain.
