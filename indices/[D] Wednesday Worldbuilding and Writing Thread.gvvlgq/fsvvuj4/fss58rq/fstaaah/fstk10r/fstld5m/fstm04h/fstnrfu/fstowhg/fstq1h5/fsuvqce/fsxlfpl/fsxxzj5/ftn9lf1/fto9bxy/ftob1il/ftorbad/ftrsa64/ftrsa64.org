  There are a few ways to handle this [love interest problem]
#+end_quote

And.... the way to handle it was to remember that the potential psychologist isn't the wizard's OTP, the wizard's OTP is someone else, so if I decide to go with this person as the psychologist then the wizard's OTP status is not important.

  Maybe you can eliminate the second coincidence, then; the firefighter complains to her roommate that she'll "never figure this out", and the roommate offers to try out a spell to help her "discover the truth" behind the original incident (or something along those lines)
#+end_quote

Other thought: perhaps the "vampire who burns down the vampire's house" is actually not a vampire. Perhaps it's a human whose family has been fucked up by vampires somehow, and the Slayer finds this human, the human confides in her, and is promptly killed by the vampires (whoops), giving Slayer both inside scoop and a healthy respect for the power of the vampires?

  Jack knows the real guy's face, the police are working off the doctored video. Also (as above), Jack may get a nudge to probability from her roommate.
#+end_quote

Jack doesn't even need to see the real guy's face, the police don't need to work off the doctored video. If the noob!vampire is killing vampires, then why wouldn't the big!vampires use the corrupt!police to find them? So the wanted poster would be real.

  the inexperienced vampire is inexperienced enough that he doesn't think the vampire legal system have the faintest idea who did it.
#+end_quote

I like this. I like the idea of it being a young vampire who didn't like all the rules her maker was putting on her and decided to kill her maker. She didn't even realise that there were other vampires in town.

  The thing is, for a centuries-old immortal, "almost immediately" could mean "a week later"
#+end_quote

Duh, thank you!

  Such as, say, a vampire wizard who may have generated a suitably vague prophecy that suggests there's a probability that there might be a Slayer in the area soon...
#+end_quote

Oh I hate the idea of making prophecies work in a rat context. But it does give you a lot to work with.

  Corrupt judge
#+end_quote

Yeah, it really depends on how often they do that. A judge making a bad call even once a year might be too much, especially since appeals are a thing.

....

I like the idea of the following steps:

- Slayer sees Vic!vampire die before her eyes

- Gets therapy for "PTSD"

- Whines to Wizard that she's "not crazy" and she knows that something must be going on. Shows her the "wanted" poster and says this person probably knew something was not right about the vampire somehow

- Wizard quietly thinks that Slayer is stressed, and casts a spell that she words vaguely enough that it means both "help Slayer recover from her mental break" and "help Slayer find the vampire that started the fire" are reasonable interpretations

- Wizard immediately feels the urge to go to a club, and invites Slayer along. (Wizard probably has strong urges a lot after casting spells, and they almost always work out)

- Slayer and Wizard see Vampire and here we have options:

  - a) Vampire is doing something suspicious (e.g. eating a human in an alley) and they [attack and get lucky]/[follow her home and see her (get hit by the Powers That Be)/(meet with the powers that be)/(hand a fellow vampire a human snack)]
  - b) Vampire is not doing anything suspicious and they approach her, asking what was with that whole fire thing. She [is extremely evasive]/[pretends to be a vampire hunter to get out of the situation] and they [follow her home and (see a)]/[get lured into a trap by her and luck out and kill her]

I think that's all fairly coherent?
