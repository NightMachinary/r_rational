Hmm. I like the psychologist angle, especially because a lot of psychologists have ins with the werewolves who are keeping their masquerade very, very tight and would be on the lookout for people like Jack to refer to "specialists"(really: werewolves).

I think the bat may be a bit much, especially because if the rumour gets out the vampire may come find her to silence her. But if the footage is just doctored to change the person's head, that would serve much the same purpose.

We don't even need the footage: she can be on the scene putting out the fire, spot a man leaving (...actually, why would the vampire stay long enough to be seen? well, if we have the mage cast a spell to help the firefighter "find her purpose" or some bull you get there, otherwise the fact he can tamper with the video means that being seen is no problem), and then the video footage they get shows someone obviously different at the same place and time (different hair colour / clothing / etc). They are then arrested, managing to get a relatively short sentence on a plea bargain with a confession that sounds oddly rehearsed and doesn't quite match the scene (damnit my werewolf lawyer would be great here, but she does immigration stuff mostly so I doubt it would make sense for her to be here unless you use the trope of All Lawyers Can Lawyer Anything).
