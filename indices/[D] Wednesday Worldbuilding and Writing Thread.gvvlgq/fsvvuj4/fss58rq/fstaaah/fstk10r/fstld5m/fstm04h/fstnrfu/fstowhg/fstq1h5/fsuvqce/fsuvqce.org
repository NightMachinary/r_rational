According to the mythology, I'm pretty sure that it's the same as the reason why they don't show up in mirrors/photographs; old mirrors are backed with silver to make them reflective, and silver tends to work against classical vampires. Also, I understand that old camera film used silver in some way.

This implies, of course, that even classical vampires may remain /perfectly visible/ on modern digital cameras, because they no longer use film.

Of course, if you really want to give your protagonist a Big Hint, have the camera catch the vampire turning to/from a bat. And /then/ have the camera taken by the police before she can copy the recording, and the official police recordings shortly afterwards 'mysteriously' do not have that bit (instead, they have a visibly /different/ person setting up the arson; that guy is promptly arrested for the crime, with everyone ignoring his protestations that he wasn't anywhere close to that building at the time).
