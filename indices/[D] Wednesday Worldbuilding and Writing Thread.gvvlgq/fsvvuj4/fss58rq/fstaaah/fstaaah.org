So, I assume nobody remembers the post I made a month ago and have been procrastinating replying to some really nice comments about?

In it I was saying I was considering making my urban fantasy protagonist not a cop anymore because it made the "don't go to authorities" thing too unrealistic, since she is the authorities.

Now for some reason "police as the good guys" seems like it requires more suspension of disbelief than "vampires as sexy love interests".

So I'm going to make her a firefighter, because 1984 tells us that firefighters set fires (which can be used to kill vampires - she's a vampire slayer).

So, my actual question:

--------------

*/What are some cool consequences of a vampire-slaying-urban-fantasy-protagonist being a firefighter that I might not have considered? What are some opportunities? What are some drawbacks?/*
