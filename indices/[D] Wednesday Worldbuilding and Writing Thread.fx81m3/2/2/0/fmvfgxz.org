My takeaway from all three suggestions is 1. Either give the lord a clear reason for bringing his entire force either give him an decisive advantage, make him a risk taker, or a clear disadvantage that he couldn't afford to leave many troops behind. 2. My tiny force of 100 could overcome a stronger force with clever tactics such Zhuge Liang's Empty Fort Strategy. 3. That my story shouldn't be about achieving victory but a delaying tactic to til the bulk of the forces return.
