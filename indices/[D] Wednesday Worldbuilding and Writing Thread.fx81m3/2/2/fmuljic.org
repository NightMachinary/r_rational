In addition to Norseman's suggestions, rather than facing overwhelming odds the ruler could believe they are the one with an overwhelming advantage. If you think it very unlikely that anyone could sneak around your army or attack from some other direction, and you expect a quick, clean victory against whomever you are attacking, then it makes sense. Why leave 10% of your army behind if you are facing a seemingly easy battle and bigger advantage = statistically smaller losses? Generally speaking, if you bring 1000 men to attack 500, you will lose fewer soldiers than if you brought only 900.

That said, the ruler would probably be a bit arrogant if they did this, or at least a gambler. You never know when the enemy has an ace up their sleeve or someone else decides to backstab you.
