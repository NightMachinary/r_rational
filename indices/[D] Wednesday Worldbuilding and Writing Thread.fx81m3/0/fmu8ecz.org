I've been trying to write this fight scene, but I've gotten kind of stuck, and I think it's due to my lack of knowledge about how fighting actually works. Maybe somebody here will have advice.

== Short question ==

If you have an injured leg, and your opponent has an injured leg, how does that impact your tactics? This in the context of unarmed, hand-to-hand combat.

More meta, does anybody know a good resource for these sorts of questions?

== Long question ==

Okay, so what I'm trying to write is the following: my MC and her friend both have an injured leg. They are both skilled combatants who enjoy testing themselves against each other (with the friend being more skilled) and they decide to test their skills against each other in their injured states. This is meant to accomplish:

- Demonstrate how my MC thinks about the efficiency of her movement when she can't walk on one leg
- Illustrate how both characters have little regard for their own safety, recklessly jumping into a fight when they ought to be letting their legs heal
- Illustrate how both characters have little regard for the others' safety, ruthlessly trying to win, capitalizing on the other's injury even if it would risk hurting them, even though it's just a practice match.
- Show that my MC really just wants to just beaten up because she's a masochist.

Anyway, I think I can do most of that headspace stuff. What I /can't/ do is write 2 sentences about how the circumstances affect my characters' tactics in the match. Really, I'd be pretty happy with 2 non-sucky sentences on this. I could write,

#+begin_quote
  I shifted my stance to account for my bad leg
#+end_quote

but that's vague and says basically nothing. I presume that I could write something along the lines of,

#+begin_quote
  His right leg was broken, so it would beneficial to approach from the right/left, and he knew that and would be defending against it [mind games ensue]
#+end_quote

But which is it, right or left? Or neither, and the considerations are actually just much deeper than anything I, an inexperienced person, could conceive of while sitting on my couch? (Probably that last one.)

I've tried googling around various issues, but I've gotten absolutely nothing, probably because sensible people don't actually fight with injured legs. I know this sort of question isn't the usual for this thread, but does anybody have any advice, either on this specific question, or general comments about writing a scene of this nature?
