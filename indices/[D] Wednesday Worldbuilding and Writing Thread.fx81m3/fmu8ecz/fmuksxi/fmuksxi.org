  If you have an injured leg, and your opponent has an injured leg, how does that impact your tactics? This in the context of unarmed, hand-to-hand combat.

  More meta, does anybody know a good resource for these sorts of questions?

MMA is a good place to go for this sort of thing. Generally speaking, hand-to-hand fights end up on the ground and then the person who is the best at fighting on the ground will win, and it's usually not close once it gets to the ground assuming one person has skill/experience on the ground and the other doesn't.

Assuming two unskilled people, I'd see one getting on top of the other and beating the shit out of their head.

  They are both skilled combatants

What are they skilled in? Is it the same discipline or different? This will inform it. I'd recommend watching clips from UFC 1, 2, 3, 4 and you can see a karate guy fighting a sumo wrestler, etc, to see how different disciplines might match up IRL.

How ethical are they? Head butts are very effective in combat but very likely to injure your opponent permanently, so they're illegal in MMA. Ditto eye poking, sticking fingers in mouths, hitting the kidneys, dropping people on their head, etc.

You're saying broken legs. That's.... hideously reckless. Like, almost unrealistically so. There's a scene in one of the Jurassic Park novels where Malcolm says that a black belt in karate can kill someone with his bare hands but the karate training gives you the experience / knowledge / empathy / etc to not to want to kill someone with your bare hands. Obviously this isn't actually true but it is in a purely illustrative sense: high level fighting training gives you an appreciation of how fragile the body is and how long injuries take to heal and how debilitating they can be. If it's possible for the injury to not literally be a broken leg, that'd be a good idea.

If you want two sentences, here's my attempt at writing it. If they're both Present Day people who are learning to fight in mainstream gyms, MMA is a very popular "discipline" to learn, so you can probably work with this.

I'm not an expert and I hate writing fighting too so this is a writing exercise for me as much as anything else

My right leg was killing me: I couldn't believe I'd done this again, let myself be so stubborn and reckless as to do something like this. And the worst thing was, she was as stubborn as me, and even more skilled. I watched her front leg: I knew she'd be aiming to strike my weak leg, just as I was fixing to strike hers. But I had a plan: she was the more skilled at stand-up, but she didn't know I'd been seeing a new coach for my ground game. I thought I might have a chance. I attempted a few leg kicks, one of them striking her swollen red thigh. Her face contorted into a satisfying wince. I feinted a few more kicks, and, when she was too focused on me pushing my advantage on her injured leg - and when she'd given me another two big shots in my own leg and a punch that was dangerously close to my liver - I shot in for the takedown. My time on the high school wrestling team paid off: I had her legs, pulled myself onto her, and was in half guard before she knew what had happened. I laughed, a combination of relief and bloodlust as I started punching her face in furious volleys. She grabbed one of my hands, trying to redirect my might, before pulling me close so I couldn't get enough space to land a big punch. Her face was bleeding, and I kept going. If we had a ref, they would have stopped us by now: but we didn't, and she lay there, not reacting as I kept punching.

Finally, I realised what I was doing: stupid pride. I sat there on top of her, trying to catch my breath. She looked up at me, her nose crooked in the nest of her bloodied face. I gave her a smile. She smiled back, as we both knew how insane this whole thing was. I helped her sit up, and she blew her nose. As bloodied mucus flew out of her, her eye swelled shut.

We started laughing again: we both knew that the last thing you did was blow your nose if you had the slightest suspicion it was broken.

We were idiots, through and through.
