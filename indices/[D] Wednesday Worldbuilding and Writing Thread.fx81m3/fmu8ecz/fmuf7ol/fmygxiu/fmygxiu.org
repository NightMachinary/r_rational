So the biggest issue I see with this is that under known physics, an FTL machine is necessarily a time machine as well. You could play with that, or just handwave it away, "our previous models of physics were wrong."

The two technologies that you mentioned seem very well suited to facilitating space travel. I could see a good story focusing on expansion into space, especially with an eye toward acquiring the classified material that enables anti-gravity (which I would make strangelets, 'cause those are neat).

Other generic sci-fi technologies which could be worth exploring include power generation (I would personally use zero-point energy rather than fusion), and force fields as you mentioned, as well as a teleporter.
