A few possibilities come to mind:

- The ruler is expecting a battle against overwhelming odds, and lots of siege weaponry, so the castle would be a deathtrap for anyone who stays in it rather than helpful. The ruler abandons the castle to fall back and regroup with more allied forces.

- The ruler has very limited forces and is embarking on a mission to attack (or defend against an attack) on a crucially important person, place, or resource, and cannot spare even a token defense force to hold the castle (or the objective is of so much greater importance that the castle is negligible in comparison).

- The castle has been left as a deathtrap for the enemy. The water and/or food reserves have been poisoned, maybe intentionally as a baited trap. Or perhaps there is a secret entrance that the ruler will use to access the castle at night and butcher any enemy forces who try to occupy it.
