This happened regularly in the crusades. Lords would take their men and go to the middle east, leaving their castle with their wives and a handful of guards.

There's also the "Empty Fort Strategy" [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_Fort_Strategy]] where you try to fake out your opponent.

A related ruse would be to tell the castle garrison to make it look like there are a ton of guards still in the castle. Maybe they run around maintaining a bunch of distinct fires, so that the enemy sees the smoke of 20 cooking fires and assumes there are 100+ men inside the castle walls. Or the inside guards could get clever with their patrols to make it look like there are a lot of people.

This would make the enemy deploy their forces so they're able to respond to an big attack coming from inside the castle. Meanwhile, the actual army is somewhere else
