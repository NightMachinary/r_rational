A lot of this, assuming skilled combatants will come down to style. Legs are a driving force for kinetic strikes be they with the hands or the feet (look at a few basic instructions in boxing or karate style punches if this isn't intuitive). In "soft" throw/grapple options legs are needed for maintining center of gravity (throws), or obtaining/maintaining purchase on the scrum of the ground.

To write this well you probably need to pick a final move used and move backwards to the injury that was overcome, make sure you understand both the physics of what was pulled off and why it /hurt/ (and potentially what long term injury was invited), so much to pull it off. From there you can back off to what the antagonist pulled off and what your MC did.

I don't hate to tell you to look at a Gray's anatomy and a few instructional videos on how to hit and where to hit and why, because the old adage write what you know. It sounds like you have a MC and foil who are skilled at mayhem, and no offence, you don't seem to be; the reasources I'd look at (in addition too the various suggestion for watching experts work) is the simple concepts so you can get a feel for why.

On a more visceral level getting your leg knee or ankle SNAFU in a fight, speaking as a tall wiry type who wants to capitalize on those items with the more robust sort, in sporting rules is game, they won, in the scrum it's take them to ground and fight dirty time, before you'd have a chance to screw up the other person's leg. If you can't stand on it: you aren't kicking with it or the other leg; throwing them is generally asking to fail a throw and be at a disadvantage when they grapple; and punching without footwork, just from core and arms, eh it's not good but maybe you have a bigger biceps/calves ratio.

TLDR: I'd suggest discarding the double leg injury, no is really going to go for a leg when down one against someone, (being down a leg isn't being down a rook or bishop, it's being down a queen knight/bishop and rook on a side) it's a call for calling the match as a concession or immediate escalation to impolite/debilitating/fatal dissassembly techniques

Disclaimer:I'm a enthusiastic amateur in the field of unarmed combat; my school required 3 classes I took the forth; I only know enough to keep out of or get out of trouble. Hand to hand is an odd duck when training people, reflexes happen a lot more than escalated purportional violence when in the ring, so the little trading I've given trends towards killing as the objective.
