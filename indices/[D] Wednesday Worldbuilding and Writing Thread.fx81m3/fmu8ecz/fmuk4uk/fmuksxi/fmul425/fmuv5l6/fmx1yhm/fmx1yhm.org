Answering this from personal and witnessed experience.

During stand-up fights, pretty much all power starts at the legs. If you can't plant your legs, your punches (especially female punches) aren't going to have any weight behind them.

With one good leg, you can plant it and throw a hard cross or hook, but your weight is going to end up on your bad leg so you better connect. Depending on the severity of the injury that could mean a slower recovery leaving room for a counterattack, or falling over altogether.

If your MC is markedly larger than her opponent or way better at grappling she'd probably want to lunge off her good foot and then tackle her opponent to the ground where she can leverage her size and the injured leg means less (not nothing, but less).

Forget about kicking, unless your MC is big into jumping kicks (a la karate kid) because you are either using the bad leg to kick or to plant and both are important. I had a match years ago where I broke my toe early on, which isn't even that crippling of an injury, and it basically ruined my kicks. Something more serious would've made a /meaningfully strong/ kick inpossible.

As a final aside, people can take more punishment than you'd expect and keep fighting. I watched a guy I knew break his collar bone in a wrestling match and continue for 5 long minutes, and that wasn't even life or death. That's one of the more painful bone breaks, too.
