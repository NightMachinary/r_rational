One answer is that they could kick at each other's injured legs. But attacking an injury like that seems sort of dickish; I'm screwing up my opponent's recovery and not practicing anything that will be super effective against a normal opponent.

Instead, I'd have them circle each other, and play with distance.

Consider an exchange that's as trivial as: I step diagonally towards you, putting me outside of your guard. I kick at your side with my injured leg. You block, step back (bringing us back to starting distance) and then do the same to me.

There's a sense in which this is a no-op; neither of us is gaining or losing ground.

But, underneath that, we're trading pain. I step (ouch!) and kick (ouch!). And then rather than try to catch my leg or close, you're showing me that you can endure an exactly equal amount of pain.

Anything other than mirroring me would be merciful since, regardless of who wins the spar, a tap means that we can both stop walking around on injured legs.
