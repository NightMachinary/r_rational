Here are my notes on your comment. I'm including them so that you can correct me where I've misunderstood you.

#+begin_quote
  Fight scene.

  2 combatants (POV and PART (for partner)), each with an injured leg.

  Each is maximizing for the best outcome in this fight.

  Unarmed combat.

  Constraints:

  1.) How does POV respond to injured leg in internal monolog?

  2.) How do combatants act when they aren't concerned with long term consequences of leg injury, but are both optimizing for winning the fight?

  3.) How do combatants act when they aren't concerned with long term consequences of the other's injury, but are instead optimizing for winning this fight?

  4.) How does POV act when they are a 'masochist.'

  [[/u/tjhance][u/tjhance]] is confident in 'headspace stuff,' but isn't confident in how that headspace stuff will affect the behaviors of the combatants.

  It seems to be that the main issue is in 'simulating' what an experienced fighter would do under the circumstances.

  Q: How to best write an engaging fight scene under the listed circumstances.

Shit, yeah. That's tough, lol. It's a theme in HPMOR that playwrights must in a sense encompass their characters, such that you will be able to predict what they will do in any situation. So, it seems that you're asking the right questions, which is a great start.

It seems to me that in order to how a character would respond in Situation X, one must know how a character would respond in any given situation, which I think that we can break down into two separate parts.

1.) How would an experienced hand-to-hand combatant react in any given situation?

2.) How would a masochist react in any given situation?

For 1.) My best guess is to start studying a couple of MMA fights. * If you can internalize a few general principles of the field, then you've won. If you know, for instance (I'm not trained in MMA so this is only a hypothetical), that all fighters seek to drain their opponents stamina faster than their own, then you already have the 'win condition' for both your combatants. From the generalized 'win condition,' simplify that into the steps that each combatant would take while getting there. Once you're able to imagine what you would need to do to win a fight, you then add the fact that both you and an opponent have an injured leg. Remember, you're still trying to reach that win-condition. How must you change your approach with this new complication?

To generalize, the goal here is to take one big problem (how to simulate what a trained unarmed combatant would do in Situation X) and break it down into a series of slightly smaller problems (how to simulate what a trained fighter thinks will win any given match). Keep simplifying the problem over and over, and when you can isolate the core algorithm that the fighters use to make decisions, you've won.

For 2.) Second verse same as the first. What does a masochist do in any given situation? For this question, I would probably brush up on the evolutionary psychology of masochism (which I have n. Remember, the goal is to find that root algorithm. If you know the why behind why a masochist behaves; if you know the core goal in their behavior, then you'll know how to write your story such that a masochist must act in a particular way in order to satisfy their values.

Your question was super interesting and detailed, and so I couldn't help but interrupt my day in order to externalize these ideas. I hope that you're able to get something out of this, lol.

*[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FYgoHwzTIA]], is a video I found. I haven't watched it, but I imagine it might be a good conceptual starting point on research.

* Also, Miyamoto Musashi's The Book of Five Rings seems to be a popular (if somewhat esoteric) primer on how the field of swordplay can be translated to find a winning strategy on every field. It may or may not be helpful.
