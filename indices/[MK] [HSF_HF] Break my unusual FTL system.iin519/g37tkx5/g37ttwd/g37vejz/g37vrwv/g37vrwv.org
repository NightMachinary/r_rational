Basically Sol, the system that's the furthest in the past of the entire network, is the one whose government is in control of the entire network and all the access codes required to open a connection to let things through. Since they're the furthest in the past, they can send relativistic ships to any point in their future light cone and enforce what they want. If someone sends a wormhole somewhere that Sol doesn't approve of, they can intercept the relativistic ship with a solid tungsten rod impacting at 99.9999%c. Other systems cannot do that because they're further in the future, so their light cones can't reach present-Sol, only future-Sol which is obviously more technologically advanced, so Sol has a spacetime-geopolitical advantage and remains in control.

Obviously once someone gains access to something they're not supposed to have, that's when things go off the rails and worldbuilding turns into storytelling.
