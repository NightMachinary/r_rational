This video is a twenty year time lapse of stars orbiting the black hole at the centre of the galaxy: [[https://youtu.be/TF8THY5spmo]]

It takes just five years, from our perspective, for one of those stars to traverse billions of kilometres around a half-loop of the black hole. If that were true, though, the forces involved would rip the stars apart.

There are three factors affecting the divergence of frame of reference: distance, relative velocity, and the presence of a big mass like the black hole. (In relativity, the latter two are the same thing, and are implied by the first).

You cannot force Sol and some distant star to share a frame of reference for more than a split second. Having two wormholes far apart, and expecting them to share the same frame of reference, is violating causality.
