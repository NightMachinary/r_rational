Out of curiosity, is there anything preventing a wormhole endpoint through a wormhole? I would have thought that the very first thing that would have been sent through a long-distance wormhole, once it was established, would be a couple dozen more endpoints which replicate the just-established tunnel, so that if something happened to the original there would be plenty of backups.

Admittedly, this wouldn't really break anything except the potential to have "O noes we are stranded" plots. And even then, you could technically have them if the first set of endpoints at a location were ALL destroyed or otherwise rendered unable to be used.

Another question - you're talking about endpoints which, when in operation, might go between stars, planets, planet-to-moon, and so forth, as well as between local systems and interstellar spaceships in flight. Presumably, this means that endpoints do not have to remain fixed in space (if that's even possible given the way spacetime can warp) with respect to each other. What happens when you have two connected endpoints on two ships of equal mass which are traveling away from each other at 0.5c, and you start passing mass from one ship to the other through the hole? What do observers on each ship see? What do external observers see?
