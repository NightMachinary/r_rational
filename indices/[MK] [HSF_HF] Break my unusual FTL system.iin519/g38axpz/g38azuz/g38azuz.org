Whether you can send a wormhole through a wormhole? I have no idea if that'd be feasible according to GR, but I'll allow it for the sake of easier logistics. And when you look through a wormhole, you see what's on the other side as if they were standing still relative to you, you don't notice any time dilation or length contraction (even though they still occur, which makes time offset wormholes possible in the first place).
