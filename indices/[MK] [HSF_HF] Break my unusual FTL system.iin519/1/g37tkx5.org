The problem you face is that any method of FTL physical travel is synonymous with time travel. Moreover, it's hard to see how the reference frames would actually even be mathematically consistent for your proposed wormhole delivering courier that only takes a few years from earth reference. It certainly seems that it privileges the earth reference frame, but there's no clear physical reason that should be the case, unless that's just somehow part of the 'magic'? It does not seem to follow from a simple application of reaction-less inertia. Depending how this actually works, time travel might be the least of your problems.

I would suggest that your worm hole view of the courier should probably show a time dilated perspective. I suspect anything else would not offer consistent reference frames under Lorentz transforms.
