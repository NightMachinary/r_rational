From earth observing the spacecraft directly, it indeed takes a long time. From earth looking through the wormhole it only takes a few years. The idea is that both ends of a wormhole experience time at the same rate when looking through it, so when one end experiences time dilation the ends aren't connecting the same points in time any more.

And yes this results in time travel, people having the possibility to end up millions of years in the future, and things from the far future potentially making it back, which is why all wormholes with high time offset are very strictly regulated. The actual wormholes are actually tiny (nanometer size, only photos fit through) but space warping expands them large enough for ships to go through, but only when active so without both sides consenting and activating the expansion the connection is closed to anything large. Obviously nobody lets anything from the far future travel back without a lot of checks, can't be too careful.
