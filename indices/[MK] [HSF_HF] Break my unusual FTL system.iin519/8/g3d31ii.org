A private black hole factory would be relatively easy to set up once you have a few wormholes to work with. Find an unclaimed gravity well, set the wormholes in alignment with it, add a bunch of turbines in between and funnel some water through the wormhole.

Once you've got the first black hole, create a time travel hole to collect energy for the second, precommit to sending enough matter-energy back that you will definitely have a black hole no matter what, and you've got a self sustaining loop. Or a bunch of cosmic debt, but since you're creating black holes for fun and profit it shouldn't take too long to get ROI and get some robots to do the harvesting.

Btw, SoI doesn't sound like a government, they sound like a monopoly. Basically the same thing except a monopoly doesn't have to follow anyone's rules besides their own.

Edit: By the way, I'm wondering if a few second time loop could be used to reverse entropy. It seems like there should be a way but I don't have the math handy.
