The time travel aspect is kinda what politically keeps Sol in power. You can't send a wormhole connection backwards in time, only forwards and let someone come back through. This means that if a connection was built from A to B, B is further in the future than A and cannot construct a connection back to present-A, only far future-A which would cause all kinds of chaos. Since the original network was built from Sol and the other systems are scattered around the edge of Sol's light cone, other systems cannot make networks that connect all present day systems because they're outside their light cones. If for example someone in Andromeda tried to make their own network, the vast majority of their connections would end up at other systems millions of years in the future compared to the connections from Sol.
