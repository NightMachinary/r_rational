True, the days offset range is probably the one with the most immediate gain. Access would probably be tightly controlled, and give a major advantage to those who run the system (and those who can get access that they shouldn't have). Not unlike HPMoR's time turners, except without the arbitrary 6 hour limit and a lot less portable. They'd probably have to limit the amount of information going back, since they can't change anything that they already know will happen unless they lie to their own past selves afterwards, which would completely invalidate the point. There might also be activists demanding further reduction in causality-breaking, free-will-limiting information, their success depending on how strongly democratic values are adhered to. I'm still in the process of working out how exactly the geopolitics (or spacetimepolitics?) would look like.
