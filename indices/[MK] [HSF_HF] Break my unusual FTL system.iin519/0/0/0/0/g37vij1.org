True. Although there's certainly a risk to letting someone return from the far future, they could be bringing back something dangerous self-replicating such as a supervirus or a copy of am artificial superintelligence, thus causing it to exist in the first place. That's why I imagined all connections to the far future to be used extremely cautiously, largely limiting the things that can be done.

Time travel wormholes with just a few minutes offset would be pretty widely used though, mostly to solve complicated computational problems. Computers don't get scared when the message they get from their future self is "don't mess with time".
