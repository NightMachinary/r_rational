My point is that basically working time travel is a win condition pretty much no matter what your goals are. Consider having a thousand ideas that might work but will each take decades to accomplish your goals. Start trying the first one, and send an observer to the future to report back whether it worked. If so, great. If not, switch to strategy 2 and repeat.
