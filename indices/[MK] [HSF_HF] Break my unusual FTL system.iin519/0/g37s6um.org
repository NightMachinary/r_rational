So you can open a wormhole and send a cruiser to Andromeda, and the cruiser will arrive 2 million years later. People from earth can travel through this wormhole, arriving 2 million light years away and 2 million years in the future, and then back, arriving in the place and time they departed from.

So what you do is when you arrive in Andromeda in 2 million years, you open up a second wormhole near the exit of the first, with the other end in a cruiser bound for the Milky Way. When that cruiser arrives back at Earth, it's now t+4M years. You send someone through the Earth->Andromeda+2MY, then through the Andromeda->Earth+4MY wormhole, and have them collect data from the future then return back to present day Earth.

Congratulations, you're writing a time travel story.

Edit: which on rereading I see you're aware of. Still, there are lots of time travel shenanigans you could pull here. Which ones will work depends on the exact time travel model you're using.
