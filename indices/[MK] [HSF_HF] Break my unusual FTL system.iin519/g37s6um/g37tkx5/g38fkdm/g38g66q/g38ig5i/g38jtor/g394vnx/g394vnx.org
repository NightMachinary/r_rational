Right, sorry, forgot to refresh the page.

After thinking it through, I think that wormholes might be stable if they have a positive or a negative, and maybe /exactly/ zero time differential, but things break at the limits. Just like how you can have a particle travel /only/ slower than light, or /only/ faster than light (as far as relativistic kinetic energy goes, at least), or /only/ at the speed of light.

Consider another scenario: You have two wormholes 1 light minute apart, with a positive time differential of 1 second. So if you stand between them and fire straight at the far/IN end, the laser comes from the close/OUT end behind you and hits you in the back after one second. The wormholes were made a fairly long time ago.

Lets also say you have a carefully engineered laser gun which is perfectly transparent and accurate, and you're actually sitting off to the side so the laser has nothing to hit. The laser fires a arbitrarily short pulse such that you don't have to worry about the length of the beam at all.

Finally, you're in something sort of like a cloud chamber, where each laser pulse causes secondary emission of light so you can see it as it travels, but the beam is never diminished. Also, your eyes are really good and you can think quickly enough to track these as they move.

Scenario 1: Space-time distance of +1 second

T=0, you squeeze the trigger, and watch as the pulse flies off into the distance towards the far/OUT hole. You turn on the safety and step away from the laser; it won't fire again.

T=0.999, you can see the beam about half of a light second away. It's 'actually' .999 light-seconds away, but the light emitted from that point will take about a second more to come back. The light from the half-way point is visible /now/, though.

T=1, another beam emerges from the close/OUT hole a bit behind you. At this moment exactly, it's passed through the laser and looks exactly the same as a fired beam. Mostly. You didn't see it come from the hole until it reached you and the laser, because the visible indicator from the cloud chamber travels just as fast as the beam. So you don't so much see the beam travel, as just a instant-quick glimpse of a trail of light leading back through the close/OUT hole, all the way back to the gun, where you can see yourself holding the trigger of the laser as you were a second ago.

T=2, the 'first' beam, that you've been tracking, now appears to be 1 light-second away. The 'second' is apparently half a light second away. A 'third' emerges from the hole, trail and all.

T=30, you've seen thirty beams flash by, and there are 31 visible in flight. The foremost beam still only appears to be 15 light-seconds out, only a quarter of the way to the far hole. The closest has just passed through the transparent laser gun.

T=60, you can see 61 beams. Yes, 61 somehow. You were only expecting 60 at most, but the front beam is only half way to the far/IN end and you can clearly count another 60, including the one that just passed you.

T=120, the front beam has finally reached the far/IN hole. You watch, and while a flash does pass you, you suspect it isn't the same beam. You can see yourself through the far/IN hole, and you're still holding the laser's trigger, with a beam visibly emerging from the muzzle.

T=121, another beam passes you, and through the far/IN hole you can see yourself standing away from the laser, reacting to the first beam. If you really squint, you can see through the /next/ far/IN hole where you're drinking a cup of coffee before you began. Somehow, you suspect that this line of beams is going to appear to go on forever.

T=122, just before the next flash of a line comes you stick your hand in front of the transparent laser and stop the beam as it passes through. You half-expect another beam to hit you after a second, but it seems like it stopped at just that one pulse.

T=240+, you've waited and watched. All of the rest of the beams have gone through the far/IN hole one by one, up until the very last one, where you see yourself stick your hand out to stop it. And then the rest of the beams go on, though the next far/IN hole visible though the first, where you see this repeat, so on and so forth until you can't see clearly anymore.
