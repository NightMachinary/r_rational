Imagine the world has only two dimensions. X is "time", but not how you normally think of it, and Y is "space" but not how you normally think of it.

If the slope of your line is 0 you are stationary

If the slope of your line is 1 you are moving at the speed of light.

Imagine the line being striped in the graph to show the difference between your reference frame time and x-time.

Another way to picture it is that your reference frame "velocity" through "spacetime" is constant, and the faster you move through the "space" dimension the slower you move through the "time" dimension.

A third way to think about it is: from the perspective of the photon, time is not passing for us, only for it. There is only "forward" and "back" and it is all happening in a single moment, we are all still. But from the perspective of us the photon is moving.

(This is all sort of bullshit and none of this will work if you tery to measure the entire system with a single clock.)
