I know this in theory but don't understand intuitively. Could you expand? Let's say we have means to jump instantly between Earth and Mars. We are on Earth at the point in time E(0), we can observe Mars as it was at M(-3m). We jump to Mars and arrive at M(0), observing Earth at E(-3m). If we instantly jump back, we arrive at E(0), if we fly back at the speed of light, we arrive at E(+3m). I don't see how can we travel in time using this setup. What am I missing here?
