Do we know this? Is there a single, fixed timeline?

Of course, people who compose extremely careful questions to their future selves (or to future information-brokers) could still get use out of it. For example, not asking "do the activists get mysteriously murdered and when?", but things like "is there ever a time when a majority of the most vocal activists are together in the same room?" Effectively, asking about opportunities rather than conclusions.
