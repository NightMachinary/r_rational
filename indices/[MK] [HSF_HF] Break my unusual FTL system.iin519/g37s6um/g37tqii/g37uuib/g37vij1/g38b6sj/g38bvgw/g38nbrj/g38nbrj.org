Why would they limit information? Future knowledge doesn't cast a binding spell upon you once you hear it (...unless is /does/ because your world has magic). The binding was already there, because physics is deterministic.

As you have HPMOR time travel, given that they are communicating information, nothing that happens will prevent that communication. This means that either the person talking can't stop the circumstances that led to them talking, or they don't want to.

This isn't "serious advantage" territory. This is P=NP=1. The organization with time travel does one of two things:

1. Explodes immediately. This should be unlikely, because whatever gets sent back has to be something that causes you to want to send the exact same thing back even knowing it explodes you.
2. Has perfect days for the rest of forever. They never so much as stub a toe, not even to stumble over pirate treasure, because they would just tell their past selves "hey, there is pirate treasure here, watch your feet". These people aren't powerful, they are Contessa without blind spots.

   1. This organization could technically be beaten by altering their goals. At 8:00 AM Jan 1st they hear from Jan 2nd, "Go to the abandoned warehouse at noon for excellent cake!" Instead, they are mind-controlled, and 8:00 AM on Jan 2nd they tell Jan 1st to go the warehouse.

Basically, the way to ensure this stays in serious advantage territory and not godhood territory, Just invent a physics or magic reason why every A-B B-A pair explodes if more than a certain number of bits are sent backwards. I'm thinking something like 32 bits a day, allowing for tension heightening but still cryptic messages like "HELP" to be sent back.

Sharply limited data and sharply limited time allows for interesting things. For one, information from further ahead can come back by simply ferrying it backwards, one day at a time. And could be subverted along the chain.
