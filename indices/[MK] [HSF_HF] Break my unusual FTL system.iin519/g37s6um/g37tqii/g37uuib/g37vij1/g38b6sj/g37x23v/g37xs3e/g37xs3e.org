They'd have to get their hands on a wormhole. Not exactly an easy process to create one.

And they'd have to deliver it to a point in the future of reachable spacetime, which means that if Sol finds out they have more than enough time to send an interceptor to shoot it down. Remember that Sol is at the bottom of the cone-shaped spacetime map of the network, they can reach any point they want with a relativistic ship.

Then they'd have to prevent the future civilization that they want to observe from destroying the spy.

Finally they'd have to figure out how to make sure that the information they get is trustworthy. Any information from 100 years in the future is risky, especially when it's terabytes of data, because those could turn out to be the source code to the superintelligent AI that runs the future and sent itself back to create itself.

My idea was a society which has time travel to and from the far future, but treats it extremely cautiously and if anyone created an unlicensed wormhole that might allow someone from the future to invade and Sol finds out, half their nuclear arsenal would arrive within the same hour.
