A-B/B-A time-travel wormholes with a few days' offset would be /incalculably/ valuable from a political, military, and economic standpoint. Would a government which controlled access to the technology - or the individual politicians in power - be able to resist the siren song of knowing exactly how any decision they made would pan out, and thus being able to choose the option that works out the best for them?

Would there even be able to be lotteries, gambling, or anything resembling a stock market any more, if information from minutes or days ahead was available? Would billionaires and megacompanies who could wangle access to future information (by means fair or foul) always outperform and outmaneuver their less successful rivals? Would there effectively be a new level of have-and-have-not in society, with people who had future foreknowledge establishing themselves firmly and permanently on top?
