To the best of my (not exhaustive) knowledge about relativity and wormholes, you're mostly right about how they behave at relativistic speeds. They basically 'link' reference frames, so if you accelerate one end to high fractional c and look through the other, it will appear to be travelling faster than light. That 2 million lightyear trip could take a subjective 2 years, 10 minutes, or 2 seconds as seen by Earth if you have enough acceleration.

But the catching point is the time travel. If you take that wormhole that is 2 million years + 2 seconds in the 'future' and slowly move it 3 light-seconds back towards Earth, you get time travel; grab a lasergun on Earth and fire a shot towards the Andromeda end and you'll see the (rather dim) flash through the wormhole a second before you fire.

Or you /would/, if the wormhole didn't violently explode the very instant it moved more than 2 light-seconds backwards. You see, if you /did/ give it a negative time differential and fire a (impossibly accurate) laser through, aiming to loop, the laser would make the journey in negative time, reaching it's origin before it fired. And then there's two lasers instantly. And then four. And then eight. And so on.

Thankfully, the universe does not get a wave of infinite mass-energy expanding at the speed of light. Rather, the wormhole just collapses. But it collapses /instantly/ as soon as this becomes possible; virtual particles are a omnipresent bitch, and will instantly do this as soon as there is /any/ space-time path with negative length, regardless of how many wormholes are involved or how complex the path is. You don't get a endless source of energy that is stable so long as you avoid a infinitely looping path.

I'm not sure if stable time loops are a option, though. You have authorial fiat of course, so do as you will, just keep in mind that non-looping time travel is a bad thing; the most charitable interpretation is infinite free energy and replication, the least is a light-speed wave of universen't.
