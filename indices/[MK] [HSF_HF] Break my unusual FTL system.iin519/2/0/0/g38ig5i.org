Possibly; in practice it would be difficult to do this with a laser gun, though you could maybe get something similar with a transparent lasing medium with no casing? Not sure.

A better example might be: imagine that, as you're moving the wormhole, there just happens to be a single photon travelling to Andromeda that will thread the needle and loop infinitely. The loop is infinite, so that single photon tries to become a wave of "oh no" and the wormhole breaks instead of the universe.

A simpler arrangement might be to imagine 2 wormholes with a teeny negative time differental, 5 feet apart. Much easier to arrange a inconvenient photon than aiming a laser perfectly over lightyears.

And virtual particles are sort of everywhere at /some/ level of probability (sorta, i'm not as good with QM), so that inconvenient photon is always there all the time. Because the process multiplies to infinity, even the tiniest amplitude of that happening will still result in infinite energy.
