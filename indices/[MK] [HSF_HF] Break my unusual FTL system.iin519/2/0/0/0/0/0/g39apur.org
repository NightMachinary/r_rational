Scenario 2: Reducing space-time distance

T=-, you repeat the experiment and let the beams travel until they've visibly reached the far/IN hole.

T=0, you press a button, and you start moving forward. The platform that everything is mounted on, including the close/OUT hole, is very slowly moving forward.

T=N, the space-time distance is now 0.5 seconds. You've watched as the beams have increased in frequency, and now they flash by every half-second and only appear to be a quarter light-second apart as they travel. You can see 240 of them total, not counting the one you see just passing through the far/IN hole. Speaking of, what you see in the distance towards the far/IN hole seems to be ever so slightly fast-forward. This isn't really noticeable with the beams, but you can see yourself through the far/IN hole and you're tapping your foot ever so slightly faster, and now you're half a second out of sync. Same the other way; looking through the close/OUT hole, you see whatever you were doing half a second ago.

T=1.999N, things are starting to get concerning. The flashes are coming by almost constantly, and the series of beams in the distance looks rather more like a continuous line. Looking through the close/OUT hole, there is barely any delay between your actions and the you that you see in the distance.

T=2.001N, you aren't quite sure what happened. Well, that's not quite true. Something exploded, that's pretty clear. Otherwise though, it's a bit of a blur. The way you've been thinking about it, a beam 'leaving' the barrel of the gun (ignoring that it's just passing through, not being fired) is the 'trigger' for a flash and a beam after a delay; one second at first, coming down to almost nothing. Of course, it's really the same beam, you saw that in the first experiment, it just arrives after a small delay despite the fact that you can see it flying into the distance. Repeatedly, for that matter.

So what you /think/ happened is... well you aren't quite sure what happened at T=2N. But after that, a pulse was 'triggered' a teensy bit of time in the past; almost no time at all, really. And then, because it was in the past, it would be in /front/ of the last beam, so that beam... immediately? Already had? It passed, and 'triggered' another another beam, slightly in the past, just a bit in front of it, 'pushing' the stack back. If it just stopped there, and you flung your hand out to catch the beams, you'd be hit by /three/ of them. There was 'actually' more than one beam now, or at least more than one beam you could interact with.

But it didn't 'stop' there, it wouldn't. Why would it, this whole thing technically occurred in /negative/ time, however that works. So there was another beam behind that, and another behind that, and another behind that... all spaced by the space-time distance. How small was that negative distance, how close to zero? Was it really infinite, or was it just equal to the planck time?

Either way, you suddenly had a rather worrying amount of energy. If you had been at, say, -1 second space-time distance, it wouldn't have been so bad. If you think about it, looking through the close/OUT hole is sort of like looking into the past. And the pulses literally would have propagated along that line, all the way back to whenever these holes were installed, years or light-years in the past. And with a entire meter between them, that would be fine, but mere planck lengths apart...

Maybe it's a good thing that the holes exploded. You don't want to find out what happens when more mass-energy than exists in the entire universe suddenly appears in one spot.
