There's /too/ much stuff, is the thing. Farshtey felt like the type of writer to connect a lot of stuff together with causal connectors just for rule of cool. "The work of the matoran keeps mata nui's body going!" What? How? Did we ever see /how/ the matoran's work keeps the Mata Nui robot going, like, how do their industries tie into Mata Nui? If Metru Nui is supposed to be in the head- as the brain, or at least close to the brain- where's the /processing/? How does Mata Nui's 'soul' move from a gigantic fucking robot's substrate to the Ignika? HOW DO LIGHT MATORAN TRANSFORM INTO BOHROK? /Why/ did the writer decide to make matoran transform into bohrok?

Like- it really felt like Farshtey started pulling bullshit out of his ass, as time went on. I'm not sure there's anything worth making sense out of, as much as I loved bionicle when I was young.
