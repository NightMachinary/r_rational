Thanks for the comments!

The table of contents was an oversight, and has been fixed. With only nine chapters so far, the RSS feed link at the right of the screen displays all chapters. Despite that caveat, it was an oversight that I hadn't updated the table of contents yet. Thank you.

What are you using to get updates? There is an RSS feed link on the right sidebar, and if you follow, you can get email updates. If there's something else you use, please let me know and I'll work to figure out how to make it happen.

The homepage does start at the most recent chapter. This is a deliberate choice, because I, personally, do not like wandering around a story homepage when there's been an update. This won't be changing unless I get a lot of feedback otherwise. However, it would not be hard for me to add a link at the top of each page, indicating "The Story Starts HERE" Do you think that would be acceptable to see every chapter? That's a genuine question. I'm of two minds on the matter.
