Thanks for helping me improve the site! If you don't mind looking at it now, the table of contents should be updated.

I included RSS on the right sidebar at the request of readers, I don't personally use it. This means that I cannot offer a solid RSS suggestion, but perhaps some other people here might have a few elegant RSS/reader applications which might be of use?

[poke] This is where the rest of you who actually have smartphones and use RSS make suggestions (/grin/) [/poke]
