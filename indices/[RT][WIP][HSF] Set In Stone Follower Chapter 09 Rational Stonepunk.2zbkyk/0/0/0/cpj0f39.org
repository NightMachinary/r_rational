The relevant app I use is an app called FictionPress Reader, which looks a bit like [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader][Fanfiction Reader,]] but no longer seems to be on the Play Store.

I tried messing around with a RSS reader a while ago, but I don't remember much of it. I /think/ I might've stopped because it was unintuitive and a pain in the ass(I think it was shortly after Wildbow released Pact, and navigation between chapters on it was a bitch?). I could probably chalk that up to an inexpertly-made app, though.

Looking at Worm, I just realized that the homepage starting at the most recent chapter probably doesn't matter if there's a working Table of Contents: in fact, I /had/ tried the Table of Contents first, and I don't think I would've mentioned the Homepage or been as vocal if it had been working properly at the time.
