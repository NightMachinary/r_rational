  The exact wording is: "Water placed within it becomes holy water" so, no, it doesn't have to touch the chalice. Interesting point, and one that I will definitely try to (ab)use if I can think of a way.

The solution is to turn the chalice into a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle][Klein bottle]]. You can move from the "inside" to the "outside" without crossing an edge, so it's inside /is/ its outside. All you really need is a way to alter the chalice and that fiddly bit where you technically cross into the fourth dimension, but after that you're good to go! (I suppose technically it could be argued that a Klein bottle has no inside or outside at all, in which case the artifact would be kaput, but it really depends on how those words are interpreted.)
