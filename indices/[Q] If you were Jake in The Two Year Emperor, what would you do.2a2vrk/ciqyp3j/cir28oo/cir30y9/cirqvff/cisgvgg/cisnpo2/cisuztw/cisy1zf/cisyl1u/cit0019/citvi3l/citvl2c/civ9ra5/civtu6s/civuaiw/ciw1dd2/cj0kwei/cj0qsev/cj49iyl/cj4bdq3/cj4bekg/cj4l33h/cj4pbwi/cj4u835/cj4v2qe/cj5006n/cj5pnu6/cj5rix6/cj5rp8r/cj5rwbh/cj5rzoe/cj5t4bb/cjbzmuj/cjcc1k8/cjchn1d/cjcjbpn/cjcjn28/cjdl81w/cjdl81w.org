Okay so, let's see if we can design a less /offensively anticlimactic/ version of this. (For my money, anticlimax is /proper/ munchkinry against overpowered foes; you save the flash and boom for when you're having fun with threats you could hypothetically handle by standard means.)

When a lich's body is destroyed, its soul returns to the phylactery, right? And by that I mean, the soul is physically inhabiting the phylactery, it's actually /there/.

Well... Doesn't that technically mean that /Afi/ is right there on his phylactery? We can't target the Phylactery with wishes, but we /can/ target Afi.

So let's try this:

First, design a sentient magical item. It's lawful neutral and named Boomer. It takes the form of a hard-leather steel-toed boot.

Boomer's one and only ability is that, on command, it will cast PAO on its steel toe, turning it into a couple grams of antimatter.

You have a caster ready an action: Upon (and therefore /exactly/ before) Boomer completing its PAO, they will Wish/Miracle Boomer onto Afi's head. Since Boomer will complete its action /on the same round,/ Afi has absolutely no chance of teleporting it away.

You have now killed Afi via [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFldBVWFgWo][Boot-To-The-Head.]]

Then you just wish up /another/ Boomer, and /do the same thing./ Goes straight to Afi again... and since Afi's in his phylactery....

(or if you only want to use two wishes; find a way to kill Afi's body by more standard means, then use Boomer. But phylacteries don't really have a Head to Boot.)

And maybe the gods could step in right after and put a ban on making sentient artifacts that only exist as curse bombers or... something. They're gods, there's gotta be /something/ about this that offends them arbitrarily.
