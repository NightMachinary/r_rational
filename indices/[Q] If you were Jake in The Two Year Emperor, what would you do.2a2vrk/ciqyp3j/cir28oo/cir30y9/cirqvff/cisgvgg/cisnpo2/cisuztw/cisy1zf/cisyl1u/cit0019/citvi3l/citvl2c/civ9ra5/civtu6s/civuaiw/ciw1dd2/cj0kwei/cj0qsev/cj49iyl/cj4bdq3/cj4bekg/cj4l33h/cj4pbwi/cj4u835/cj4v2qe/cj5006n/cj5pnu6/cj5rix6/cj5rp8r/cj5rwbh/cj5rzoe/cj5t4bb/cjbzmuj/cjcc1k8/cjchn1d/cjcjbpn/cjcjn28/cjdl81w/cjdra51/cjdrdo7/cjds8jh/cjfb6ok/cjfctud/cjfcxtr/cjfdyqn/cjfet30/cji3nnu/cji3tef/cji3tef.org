Aww, thanks! I guess against a foe like Afi, you -need- munchkinry like this. Awesome foes get awesome solutions, and all that.

I think I'm just about fresh out of ideas. I hope I've been able to seed some ideas in your head that can give you your own awesome ending :)

Also, you can't plane shift, because /the portable hole is dimension locked./ Like I said, I think this is proof against anything but a god. No idea how to do godproofing.
