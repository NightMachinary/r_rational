Yep, I know about the density issue. I was thinking about the evaporation problem when I said that 10^{19} wouldn't be enough.

Apparently I'm wrong, though! If it's only 12270K then yes, it WOULD last long enough. And I like your trick with the "specified density" sphere. Not sure it's physically practical, since neutronium is as dense as it gets and you're asking for something way way denser. Then again, screw physics! This is magic!

I like the way you think. :)
