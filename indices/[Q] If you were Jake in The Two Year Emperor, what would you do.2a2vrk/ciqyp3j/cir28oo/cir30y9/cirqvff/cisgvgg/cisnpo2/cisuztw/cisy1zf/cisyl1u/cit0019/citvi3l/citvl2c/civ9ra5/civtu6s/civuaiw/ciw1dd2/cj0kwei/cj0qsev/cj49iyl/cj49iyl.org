Okay, I've tried to get myself off the PAO-er-pack of ideas, and get to non-phylactery anti-lich strategies. Preferably ones that could be done from a distance, since Afi could probably ask reality itself to turn against someone and /succeed/, with his diplomancy.

The only idea I've had so far is this:

A lich cannot (as far as I know from RAW) choose to abandon a body and return to the phylactery by any means except suicide. If you can trap their body in a strong anti-magic trap, and keep them suitably restrained, you can keep them as sealed evil in a can.

Extension of that idea: If you somehow get a lich's body to near the event horizon of a black hole, or somehow find a way to launch them to trans-relativistic velocities, then it may be tens of thousands to millions of years before they return, even though for them it's only a couple of seconds to cast greater teleport.
