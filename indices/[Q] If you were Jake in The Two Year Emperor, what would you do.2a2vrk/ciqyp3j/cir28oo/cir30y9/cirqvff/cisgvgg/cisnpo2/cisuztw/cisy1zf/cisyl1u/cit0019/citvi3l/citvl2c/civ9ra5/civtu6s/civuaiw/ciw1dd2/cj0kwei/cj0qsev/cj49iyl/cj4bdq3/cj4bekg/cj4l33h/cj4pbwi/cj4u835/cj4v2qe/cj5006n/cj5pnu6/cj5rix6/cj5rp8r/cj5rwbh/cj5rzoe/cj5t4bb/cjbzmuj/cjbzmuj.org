If Jake ever gets his grubby mitts on another wish or miracle, would any of these work?

- Wish to have all the liches' phylacteries.

- Wish for an even mix of 1 gram of matter and 1 gram of antimatter to appear on top of all the liches' phylacteries.

- Wish for Afi to become lawful good.

- Wish for Afi to become friendly.

- Wish for the other liches to turn on Afi.

- Design a magical item that teleports the person who posesses it into a random part of space and then casts imprisonment as a (ridiculously high number) level spell on them. Every round, so the imprisonments stack up. Wish for Afi to own this item.

- Design a helm of opposite alignment with a much, much, /much/ higher save. Wish for Afi to be wearing it.

- Design a Weirdstone that, rather than blocking teleportation, invisibly redirects it into a custom demiplane that looks exactly like the area it protects, surrounded on all sides by portals back to the appropriate parts of the material plane. Hunker down and hide for two years.

- Design an invisible (even to true-sight) portable hole, as a further addition to the super-weirdstone.
