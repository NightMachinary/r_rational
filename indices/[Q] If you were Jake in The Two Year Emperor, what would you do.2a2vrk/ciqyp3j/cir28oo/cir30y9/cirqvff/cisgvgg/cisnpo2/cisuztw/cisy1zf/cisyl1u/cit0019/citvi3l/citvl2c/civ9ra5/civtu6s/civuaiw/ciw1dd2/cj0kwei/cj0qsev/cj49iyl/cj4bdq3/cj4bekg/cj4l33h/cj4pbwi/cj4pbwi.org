Aww, he lost the scry trick as part of the package? I was hoping that he'd just never think of blowing up the planet as a valid strategy, but could keep all the pieces short of that. Darn sacrificial goddess-resurrection rituals and their high demands...

I guess if he had breathing room, he could try and figure out where the center of the galaxy is through good old astronomy, since there's pretty much guaranteed to be a supermassive black hole there? But that'd take at least til the end of his two-year tenure, to set up magitec telescopes and wait for parallax alignments and stuff. Any sort of scrying tricks to try and figure it out quicker?

You could always find some safely-distant part of space and /make/ a black hole. PAO up sufficient qualities of neutronium or something, so it collapses into a hole that will be stable for a few millenia?

I also take it that [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/imprisonment.htm][Imprisonment]] wouldn't work since it's also a will save, /and/ a touch attack, /and/ undead are probably immune to it for some reason or another.
