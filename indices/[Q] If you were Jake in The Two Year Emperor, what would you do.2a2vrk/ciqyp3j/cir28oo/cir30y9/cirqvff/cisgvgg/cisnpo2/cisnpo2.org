Hm.

I'd be inclined to say that when you PAO something, you have changed its fundamental nature, and thus it is no longer holy water anymore. This "change of fundamental nature" is why, when you PAO into a dragon, you get all of the dragon's special abilities.

Also, note that if you polymorph water ice into dry ice, you actually have permanent duration -- every single one of the modifiers applies, giving you a duration factor of +13.

You couldn't PAO it into blood, but you could definitely have the infants drink it, or inject it into them. That would work.

The WoF armatures...that's just sick and wrong. I love it. Thanks.
