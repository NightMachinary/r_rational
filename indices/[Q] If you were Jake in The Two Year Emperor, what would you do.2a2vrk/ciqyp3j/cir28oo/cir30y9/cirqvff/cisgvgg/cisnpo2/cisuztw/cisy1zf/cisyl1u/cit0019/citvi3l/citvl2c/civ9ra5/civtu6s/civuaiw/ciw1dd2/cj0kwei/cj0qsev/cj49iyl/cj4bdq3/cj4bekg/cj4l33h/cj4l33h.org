Huh, this could actually have worked if Jake hadn't sacrificed the "find imagined things using art + Scry Location trick. Wish I'd thought of it.

As to the fussy details: the Teleport Trap spell doesn't have the range, unfortunately. (And, due to range and planar rules, you can't use the (Planar) Ring Gates to extend it.). Still, you could use the Baleful Teleport spell to make it work. You'd need to use a lot of them simultaneously; the spell has a Will save, so Afi would probably need to roll a 1.

Nice thinking. Please keep trying -- I'm actually fuzzy on how they can kill Afi at the moment.
