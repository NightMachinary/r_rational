It's a pity that Jake can't just say "Polymorph Any Object: Sheet of paper to Sheet of paper with the perfect plan to defeat Afi written on it."

That'd be a hilariously anticlimactic way to end things.

Well okay, you'd have to word it differently, else it'd pull the trick of having "The Perfect Plan To Defeat Afi" written on it. You might even just have to PAO up a person with knowledge of how to defeat Afi, to get around that kinda literalism.

/ooooooo!/

What if Jake starts poly-learning things into himself! "Polymorph any object: Jake to Jake with Albrecht's skill for strategy" "Jake to Jake with Thomas' willpower and bravery" "Jake to Jake with intensive training in the art of kung-fu"

/That/ would probably get the gods to yell at him. Not to mention bring on personality shifts and stuff. But could be worth it.
