  I think that it would tear his body apart instantly though, and then his soul would go back to the phylactery.

You said that a soul being resurrected was kinda like a Gate spell, right? Presumably a soul ascending to the afterlife is the same thing. So a lich returning to the phylactery would prolly just use the same mechanism...

/Can/ a soul escape a demiplane entirely sealed by dimension lock?
