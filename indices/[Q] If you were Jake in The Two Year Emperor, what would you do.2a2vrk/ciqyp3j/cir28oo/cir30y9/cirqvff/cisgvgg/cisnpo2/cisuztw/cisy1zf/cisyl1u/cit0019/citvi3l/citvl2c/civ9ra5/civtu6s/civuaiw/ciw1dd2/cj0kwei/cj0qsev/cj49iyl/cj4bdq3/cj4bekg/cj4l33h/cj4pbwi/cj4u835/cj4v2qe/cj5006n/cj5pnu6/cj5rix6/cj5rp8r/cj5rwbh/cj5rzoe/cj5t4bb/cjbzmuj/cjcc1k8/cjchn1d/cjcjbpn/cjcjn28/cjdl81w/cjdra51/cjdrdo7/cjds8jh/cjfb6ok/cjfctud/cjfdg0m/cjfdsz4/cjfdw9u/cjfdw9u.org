Ready an action to close the hole upon gravitational forces of the collapsing neutronium applying to the space beyond its entrance? You're dealing with weird initiative-time here, beating gravity (which moves merely at the speed of light) to the punch is pretty easy :P

What about casting [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dimensionalAnchor.htm][Dimensional Anchor]] on his soul? That's a ray attack, so it has range. Well, it's a ranged touch attack, but I /think/ those work on ghosts, so should work on souls? And you might trap his soul in a demiplane like that even /if/ it can escape the other DimLock /and/ the body is destroyed truly instantly. Since then you'd be specifically preventing his soul itself from changing planes.
