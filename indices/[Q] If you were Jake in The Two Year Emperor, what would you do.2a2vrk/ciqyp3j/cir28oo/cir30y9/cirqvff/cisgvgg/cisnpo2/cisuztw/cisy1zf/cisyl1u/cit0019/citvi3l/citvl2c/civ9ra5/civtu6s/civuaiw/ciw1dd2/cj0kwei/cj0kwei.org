In case you aren't already using it, I found an online listing of [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm][Wondrous Items]]

Of particular interest seems to be the [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#manualofBodilyHealth][Manual]] and [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#tomeofClearThought][Tome]] series of items. They're a set of 6 magical items, 1 for each of the base stats, which permanently endow an "Intrinsic Bonus" of up to +5 for that stat.

Permanent. And intrinsic. Meaning it's pretty much just added to your ability score. Fundamental change of nature, like PAO. You can get more skill points from int and everything.

+That makes me think that unlike other bonuses, it can be stacked.+

+That seems like prime getting-yelled-at-by-gods territory to me, but /oh/ Jake will be able to make himself so much better before he gets there. And he could probably use some Wis to round out his Int, anyway.+

Disregard that, intrinsic bonuses can only go up to [[http://dnd.steinhour.net/General_DnD/3E_Charts_and_Tables/3E_Magic_Item_Notes.html][+5 for each stat.]] But still, even if it isn't uberstackable, that's +5 to each stat that Jake can give to an entire /army./ Plus another substantial boost he can give to himself, since he /could/ probably do with some Wisdom (he probably has the max +5 int from wishes)

It's a slower stat-gain regimen than wishes, since each tome takes 48 hours over at least 6 days to read, and probably something like a month to make. But if ever Jake gets some breathing room, he can just set tens of thousands of mages working in parallel on a massive set.... (I'd say go to the astral plane to farm them out, but didn't you say something about not wanting time dilation effects for planar travel, since that's too easily breakable?)

Also potentially good:

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#helmofBrilliance][Helm of Brilliance]] : Lets you cast a number of useful undead-killing spells, and until you use all of them, emits undead-harmful blue light dealing 1d6 for 30 feet in all directions. If the damage-per-round stacks, would be wonderful to equip entire squads with it and let them destroy undead just by /standing close together./

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#dustofDryness][Dust of Dryness]]: Stores up to 100 gallons of water in a marble-sized pellet, all of which can be released at once when thrown. Holy water bombs? Holy water bombs.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#instantFortress][Instant Fortress]]: Instantly creates a massive adamantine tower. Deals 10d10 damage to things caught up in its growth. So many applications, from custom-shaping the battlefield, to simply using them as a farmable source of adamantine for other projects. Presuming you can't just buy adamantine golem parts on the market, anyway.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#lyreofBuilding][Lyre of Building]]: Magically reinforces buildings once per day for 30 minutes, potential for hiding the town in an indestructible box if you build 48 of them, maybe. But more interestingly lets a skilled player effectively become a superpowerful earth mover. If they can ace performance DC18, then there's no reason they ever have to stop playing the damn thing. Depending on how multiple lyres' powers overlap, may allow a bardic symphony to play an entire battlefield into one massive constantly-firing trap. Or to make /giant music-powered stone golems the size of a mountain./ Even if that wouldn't work, has tons of potential for moving the town.

I'll start trying to think of anti-lich tactics that one can enact without finding the phylactery.
