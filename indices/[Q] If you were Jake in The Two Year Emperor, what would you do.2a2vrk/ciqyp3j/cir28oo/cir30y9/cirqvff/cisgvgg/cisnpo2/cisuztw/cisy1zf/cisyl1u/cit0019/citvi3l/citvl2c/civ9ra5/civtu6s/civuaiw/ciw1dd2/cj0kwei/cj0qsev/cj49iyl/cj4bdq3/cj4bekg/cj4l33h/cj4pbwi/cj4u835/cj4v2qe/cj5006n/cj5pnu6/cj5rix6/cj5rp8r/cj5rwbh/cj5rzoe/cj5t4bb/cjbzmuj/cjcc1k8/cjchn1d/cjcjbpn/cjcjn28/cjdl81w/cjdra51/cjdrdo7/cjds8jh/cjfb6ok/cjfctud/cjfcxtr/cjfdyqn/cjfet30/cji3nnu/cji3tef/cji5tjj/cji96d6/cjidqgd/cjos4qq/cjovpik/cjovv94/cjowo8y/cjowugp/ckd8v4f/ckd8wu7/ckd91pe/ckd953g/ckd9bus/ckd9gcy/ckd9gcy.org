Actually, speaking of alter self... [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/polymorphAnyObject.htm][PAO]] says it more or less mimics Polymorph, and [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/polymorph.htm][Polymorph]] says it imitates Alter Self....

And [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/alterSelf.htm][/Alter Self/]] says this:

#+begin_quote
  You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.
#+end_quote

So.... All you have to do is realize that a few extra folds and connections in the brain is a relatively /minor/ physical quality, no?

Also, PAO says:

#+begin_quote
  Unlike polymorph, polymorph any object does grant the creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If the original form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those scores as appropriate for the new form.
#+end_quote

Which implies it really /does/ mess with your head on more than just a 'command' level. It grants you the intelligence and other properties of the form you take. So maybe you can specify just /what/ that intelligence implies.
