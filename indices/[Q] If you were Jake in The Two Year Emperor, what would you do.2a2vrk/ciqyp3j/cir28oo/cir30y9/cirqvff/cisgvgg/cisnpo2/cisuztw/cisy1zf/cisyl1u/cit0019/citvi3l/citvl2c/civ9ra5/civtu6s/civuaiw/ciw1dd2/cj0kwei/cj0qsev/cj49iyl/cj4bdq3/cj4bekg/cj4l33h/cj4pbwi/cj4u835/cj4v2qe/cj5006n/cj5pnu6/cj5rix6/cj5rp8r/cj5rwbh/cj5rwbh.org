Huh. I think you would, actually. At least, by a VERY technical reading of RAW. PAO changes the true nature of something, so this thing is no longer a lich, so it can do the lich ceremony. But it still has a phylactery, and when it's killed it reverts to being a lich, which means its phylactery still applies. Wow. That's throughly evil, in all senses.

Crap. Afi was tough enough before, now I have to figure out how to handle him when he has multiple phylacteries too?! Damnit!
