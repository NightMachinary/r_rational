That is hilarious. And kinda epic. I'm a bit tempted, but one issue: phylacteries are going to be protected with Mind Blank(*), which even Wish can't get through.

Although...Discern Location can see through Mind Blank. Hmm. I'll think on it.

(*) Actually, the cat that the phylactery is tied to will be protected by Mind Blank, but same thing. MB only protects critters, not things.
