I know it's kinda a silly and basic thing to ask, but the Deorsi make regular use of [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Hide_from_undead][Hide from Undead]], I take it? Might be a good flobovian gift if they don't have that spell.

Hell, in general, get a Deorsi spell list and compare/contrast the Flobovian one. Might be some low-hanging fruit when it comes to new defenses.
