Do two people with the same initiative act in the same 'slice' of time?

The big problem with PAO'ing antimatter right now is that it necessitates sacrificing a high level mage. But what if you sent in /two/ magi with the same initiative? The one who goes first PAOs the antimatter, and the second casts word of recall, to get them both the hell out of dodge before it explodes, presumably one initiative tick later.

Or can you cast spells through a ring gate without sticking your head through? You'd probably have to stick your arms through, but arms can be regenerated. And since the gates only transmit one way, you'd be safe.

Not exactly permanently helpful against liches, but antimatter bombing would probably be useful nonetheless.
