If that is so, then it's only valid for the first Boot To The Head, since Afi would prolly have mindblank on his body. You can still get around it if you find a way to assassinate Afi's body through other means, or if you can find someone standing /near/ Afi to Boot.

The double tap, though... you're not targeting the phylactery. You're targeting Afi's very-much-unprotected soul, which is just /residing/ in/on/around the phylactery. Unless mindblank survives the process of his soul violently leaving his body. That may or may not interact with the mindblank in a way that nulls it out.
