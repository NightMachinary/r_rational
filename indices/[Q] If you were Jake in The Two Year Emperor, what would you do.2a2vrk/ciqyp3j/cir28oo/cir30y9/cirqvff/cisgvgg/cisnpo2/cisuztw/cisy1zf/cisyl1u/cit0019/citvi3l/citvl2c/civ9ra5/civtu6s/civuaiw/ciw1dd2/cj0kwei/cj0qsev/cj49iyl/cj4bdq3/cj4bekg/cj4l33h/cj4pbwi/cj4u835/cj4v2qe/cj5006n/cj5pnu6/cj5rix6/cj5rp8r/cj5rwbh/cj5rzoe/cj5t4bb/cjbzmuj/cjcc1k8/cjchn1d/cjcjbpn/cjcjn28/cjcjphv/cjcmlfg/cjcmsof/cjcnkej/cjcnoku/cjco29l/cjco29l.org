The helm itself is pretty cheap, only 4k. The intelligent item part only adds the cost of what you roll on the tables.

Even with the most expensive rolls that only adds +145k to the price since you can choose not to swap a greater power for a special purpose.

149k base price->5960xp. Cheap enough, so the issue is crafting time. With wish we can skip that by paying 16920xp. The restoration trick gets us that easily even if no one has that much banked.
