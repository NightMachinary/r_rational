PAO is weird because its magic. You couldnt actually PAO into a one-legged troll or a purple-haired woman for instance, neither would fall into the the norm for their race. It doesnt even always give you the ability to /fully/ use all the limbs of your new form actually, just check out alter self and attacking with multiple limbs. Its not a finely controlled atomic restructuring machine; its a magic spell in a poorly defined, badly written rules system.

Think of it more like a command for the universe's command prompt, not a logically consistent phenomena. You can pass it certain variables and it will run with it. If you try to pass it invalid or uncalled for variables it will, at best, ignore them if not error out entirely. PAO allows X, Y, and any value of Z; it wont take A, B, or C.
