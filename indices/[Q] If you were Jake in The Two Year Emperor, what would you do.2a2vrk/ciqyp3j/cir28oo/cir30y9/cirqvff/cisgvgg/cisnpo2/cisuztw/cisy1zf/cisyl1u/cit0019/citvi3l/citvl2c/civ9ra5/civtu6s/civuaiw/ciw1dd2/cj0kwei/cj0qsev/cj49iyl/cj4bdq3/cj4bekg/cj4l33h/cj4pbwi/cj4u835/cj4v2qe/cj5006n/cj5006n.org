Black hole: hm, good point. And you couldn't double-PAO the object, because there would be too much neutronium -- a 20th level mage can only affect ~56 cubic meters of mass, which is on the order of 10^{19} kg, which is nowhere near enough for a stable black hole.

Although...hm. With enough caster-level boosts -- and I mean REALLY enough -- it might be practical.

You're right about readied actions and yes, 'I teleport when the antimatter explodes' would work in my interpretation.

In point of fact, destroying someone permanently is a really hard thing to do -- even if you wipe out their soul, a god or enough Wishes could Ship of Theseus the person back into existence -- create an exact copy of their body and a mind with all the same memories and skills.

The only way that anyone came up with to wipe someone out permanently is the Ritual of Crucimigration. It's a ritual that you use to become an undead; it's quite unpleasant. You have to petition for it, then lose a level, then pay 1000 XP. "if the level loss and the 1,000 XP cost drains a creature to 0 XP or less, it is destroyed, turned to dust, and can never he raised or revived again using any means." *any* means -- that includes divine intervention. So:

- Dominate Person to make them petition
- Make them play patty cake with a vampire and then fail all their saving throws so the level loss becomes permanent and they are level 2.
- They lose a level (putting them at level 1) and can't pay the 1000 XP.
- Boom! They are permadead.
