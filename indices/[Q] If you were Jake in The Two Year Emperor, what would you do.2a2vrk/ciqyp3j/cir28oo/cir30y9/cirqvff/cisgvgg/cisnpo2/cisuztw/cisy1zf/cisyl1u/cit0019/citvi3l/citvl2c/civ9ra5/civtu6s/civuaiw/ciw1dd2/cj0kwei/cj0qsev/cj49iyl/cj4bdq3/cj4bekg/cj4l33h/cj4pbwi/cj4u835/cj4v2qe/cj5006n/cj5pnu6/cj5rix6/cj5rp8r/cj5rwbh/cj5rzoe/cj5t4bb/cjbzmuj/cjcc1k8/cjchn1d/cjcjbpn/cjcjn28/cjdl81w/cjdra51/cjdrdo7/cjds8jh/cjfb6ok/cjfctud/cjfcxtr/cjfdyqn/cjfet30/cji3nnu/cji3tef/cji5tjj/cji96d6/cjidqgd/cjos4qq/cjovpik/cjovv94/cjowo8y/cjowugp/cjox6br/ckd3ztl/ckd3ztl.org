I just had a completely silly thought.

We already know that readied actions activate faster than light (they ALWAYS fire before the trigger, even if you're waiting for a laser dot to appear on a piece of paper) and therefore you don't need to /see/ the trigger to activate the readied action, right?

Well, if you don't need to /see/ the trigger, then you shouldn't have to rely on any sort of range. After all, you could ready a counterspell against a mage 100 feet away, no? What's to say you couldn't ready one against a mage 100 kilometers away? You aren't seeing them complete their action either way, and yet the readied action still fires.

Therefore, say you introduce two commoners to each other. You then hire them both on, so that they spend all day readying an action every turn: They will repeat anything the other commoner is about to say.

You've now got yourself an infinite range, faster-than-light radio with infinite uses per day, and no silly word limits like Sending. Just tell one commoner to repeat what you say to them, and have someone listening on the other end!

Or you could cart around a commoner and use them as an omni-radar! Have them ready an action every turn that they'll point in the direction of Afi's base if they get within 10 quadrillion feet of it, or something. They'll be like a compass directly pointing you to Afi's base, so long as it's on the same plane/planet.

Or an early warning system! Have them ready an action to raise the alarm whenever a group of enemies starts to head for grofhamr with intent to harm!
