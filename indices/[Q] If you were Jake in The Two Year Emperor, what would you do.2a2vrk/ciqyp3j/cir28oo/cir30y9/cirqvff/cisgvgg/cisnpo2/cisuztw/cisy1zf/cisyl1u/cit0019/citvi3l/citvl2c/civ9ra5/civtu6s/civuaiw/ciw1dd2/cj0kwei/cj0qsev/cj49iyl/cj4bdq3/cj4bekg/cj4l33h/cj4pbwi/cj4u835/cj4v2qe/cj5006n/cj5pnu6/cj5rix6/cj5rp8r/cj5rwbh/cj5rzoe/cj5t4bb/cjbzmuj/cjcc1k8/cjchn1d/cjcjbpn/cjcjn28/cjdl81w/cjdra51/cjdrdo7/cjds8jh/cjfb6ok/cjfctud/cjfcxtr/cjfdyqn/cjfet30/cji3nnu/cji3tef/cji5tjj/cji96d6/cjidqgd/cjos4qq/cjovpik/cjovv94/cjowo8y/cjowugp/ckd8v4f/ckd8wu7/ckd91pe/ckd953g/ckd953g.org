The thing is that PAO /already/ does a lot of messing with your head. If you use it to turn into a troll, it has to rewire your entire brain to fit the new body. It has to give you the troll's automated systems that keep its heart beating, it has to modify you to fit how the troll's senses work.

And more than that, if you turn into a quadruped, you can probably bet that you'll know how to walk in your new body, despite being bipedal all your life.

So I don't see why you can't just ask it /directly/ to put knowledge in a head, by specifying knowledge as part of the conditions.

It's just like you could ask to PAO a one-legged troll, or a purple-haired woman. You're telling the spell specifics, and it fills in all the /unspecified/ stuff with that 'average member of the species' stuff.
