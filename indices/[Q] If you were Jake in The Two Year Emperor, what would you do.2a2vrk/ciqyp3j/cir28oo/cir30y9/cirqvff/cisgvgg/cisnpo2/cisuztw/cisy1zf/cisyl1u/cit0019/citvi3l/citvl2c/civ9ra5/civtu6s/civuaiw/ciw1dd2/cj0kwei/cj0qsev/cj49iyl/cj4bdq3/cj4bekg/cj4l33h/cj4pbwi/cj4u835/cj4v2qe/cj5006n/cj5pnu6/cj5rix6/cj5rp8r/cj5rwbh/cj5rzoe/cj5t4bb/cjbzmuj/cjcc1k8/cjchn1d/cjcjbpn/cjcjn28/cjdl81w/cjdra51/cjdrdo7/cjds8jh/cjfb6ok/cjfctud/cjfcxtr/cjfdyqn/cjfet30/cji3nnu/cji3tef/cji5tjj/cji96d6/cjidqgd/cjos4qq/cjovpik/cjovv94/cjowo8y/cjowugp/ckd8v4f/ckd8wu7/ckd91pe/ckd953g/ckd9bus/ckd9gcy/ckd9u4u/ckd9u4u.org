Those specific folds and connections would still not fall into the normal ranges for that creatures kind. As for int bonus, what it implies to me is that it physically changes your brain, not that it imparts any knowledge you specifc. The rules say you get a new int score, it doesnt say you get a whole bunch of knowledge along with it nor does it say you can specify anything about what that int score means.

But if we allow this, we could just as easily argue that being a Nth level wizard is just a matter of knowledge and thus PAO gives us infinite levels of wizard. Or that since any ability can be expressed in a minor physical quality, we can have any ability we want through shapechange as long as we make it (ex) or (su).

This is going down the rabbit hole that leads to arguing about what you can and cant do while dead. Ultimately 3.5 is not a ridgid, properly definined, consistent system. You have to use common sense at some point to fill in the gaps. You can rip apart literally anything if you are willing to ignore common sense enough. If we do not accept that the rules tell us what we can do rather than what we cant do, then the entire system instantly snaps in half.
