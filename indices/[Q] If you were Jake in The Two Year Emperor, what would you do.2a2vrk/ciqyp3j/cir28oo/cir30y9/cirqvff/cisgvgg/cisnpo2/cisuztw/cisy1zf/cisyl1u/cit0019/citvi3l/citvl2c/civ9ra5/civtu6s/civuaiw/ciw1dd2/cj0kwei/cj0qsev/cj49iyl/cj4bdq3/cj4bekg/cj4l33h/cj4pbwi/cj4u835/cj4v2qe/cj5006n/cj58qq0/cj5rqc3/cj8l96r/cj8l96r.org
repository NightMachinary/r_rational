It's a good thing I came up with that PAO-with-specified-density thing. I just checked, and the schwartzchild radius of 10^{19} kg is [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=schwartzchild+radius+of+10%5E19+kg&lk=4&num=1][absolutely tiny]]. I don't think you'd compress the neutronium sphere sufficiently even with shaped antimatter charges.
