WAIDAMINUTE!

I just [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/mindBlank.htm][looked it up]]

Mind Blank only prevents wishes that gather information/scry, or effect the mind /via the wish/.

Teleporting a person/sentient object might not count as that! Even if you teleported a person with a readied Sending there, you'd not be getting information /through the wish./ You'd be getting it through the person's eyes and ears, relayed through another means.

Likewise, the only way they're gonna find out where Afi is through this spell, is if they can see the boom. Which they probably will, this being antimatter :P

Oh! And mind blank's prolly your reason for why the Helm of Making You The Goddam Opposite Alignment, And You'll Like It Mister, Or I'll Call Your Mom +5000, wouldn't work. Forced alignment shifts probably get filed under the domain of mind-effecting magics.

Good thing we have good ol' Boom for the Boom God to substitute :)
