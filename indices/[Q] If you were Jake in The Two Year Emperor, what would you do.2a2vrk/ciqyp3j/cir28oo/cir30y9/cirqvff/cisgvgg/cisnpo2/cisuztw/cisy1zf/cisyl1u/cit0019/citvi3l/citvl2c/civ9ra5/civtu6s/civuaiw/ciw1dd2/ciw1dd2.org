That would be a great Sniper Rifle to have. :) I think they're going to need something like it.

As to the XP exploit...Hm.

You can definitely keep XP that you gain while in another form, even a PAO'd form. I don't think you get XP in a non-sentient, non-animate form such as a boulder but, yes, you would get XP as a zombie.

I don't think I buy the part about being turned into a proto-magic item, fed XP, and then turned back. XP for crafting isn't the same as XP earned for level advancement.

That said, the idea of a super-high level Duncan is kinda amusing. :)
