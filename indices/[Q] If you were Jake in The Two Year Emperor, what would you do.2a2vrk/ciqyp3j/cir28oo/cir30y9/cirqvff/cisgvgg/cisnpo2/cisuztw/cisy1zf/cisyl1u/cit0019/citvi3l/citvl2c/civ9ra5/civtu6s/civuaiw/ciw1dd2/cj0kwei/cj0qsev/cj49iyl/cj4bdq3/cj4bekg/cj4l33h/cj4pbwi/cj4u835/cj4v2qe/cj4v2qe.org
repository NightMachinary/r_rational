There is one potential problem with PAO'ing your black hole though: you're obviously not gonna get a permanent duration first cast. Probably only gonna get a 20 minute duration. And /whose 20 minutes do you get?/

If it's 20 minutes by the reference frame of the caster, then there's no problem, just cast PAO neutronium->neutronium. Or maybe PAO singularity->singularity (technically the source object would be infinitely small now :P)

But if it's 20 minutes in the reference frame of the object, then you're gonna have it instantly disappear. Only potential way to make it work is to do tricks with initiative, double-PAO'ing the neutronium before it collapses.

And that imprisonment trick is /eeevilll./ Major props to the person who came up with that.

Re: Initiative-slipping an antimatter blast:

I thought of readied actions too, but I think the exact wording in RAW is that a readied action happens just /before/ the trigger, interrupting it. So even with a condition 'when Al finishes the spell,' the actual occurrence would happen just before he finishes. Which could be problematic if Al passes the check to finish casting anyway.

You /might/ be able to do readied actions with the condition 'antimatter detonation' though. That might get you to interrupt the antimatter while it exists, but before it kills you.
