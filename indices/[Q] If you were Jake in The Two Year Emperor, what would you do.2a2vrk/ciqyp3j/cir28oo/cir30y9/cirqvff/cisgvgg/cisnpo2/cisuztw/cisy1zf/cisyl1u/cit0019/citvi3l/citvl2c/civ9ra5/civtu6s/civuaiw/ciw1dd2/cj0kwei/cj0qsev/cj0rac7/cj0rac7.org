Heh yeah, I guess I was just looking for low-hanging fruit, since XP is essentially free and with enough time Jake could train up tens of thousands of high level mages. But he doesn't really have time at this point. He probably barely has time to set up one or two armatures and maybe start getting a trickle of apprentices to archmagi, or get the XP costs down to start constructing some artifacts that might be finished a long time from now. Real pity about the astral plane not being workable, that'd be my go-to as a munchkin otherwise.

Too much strategic and not enough tactical thinking, I guess :P

For dust of dryness, I guess it would depend on whether the water it releases is the same type of water as it absorbed; It can absorb salt or alkaline water. If that caused it to release salt or alkaline water when thrown, then I could argue that soaking up holy water should cause it to release holy water, even if it's not the 'same' holy water per se.

The Lyre... Yeah, I have no idea. It's been forever since I DM'd and I've never run artifact-heavy campaigns that would have something like that anyway. But it seems exploitable as all hell. The reinforcement even resists Knock, and that building capability is just tasty, especially if it stacks.
