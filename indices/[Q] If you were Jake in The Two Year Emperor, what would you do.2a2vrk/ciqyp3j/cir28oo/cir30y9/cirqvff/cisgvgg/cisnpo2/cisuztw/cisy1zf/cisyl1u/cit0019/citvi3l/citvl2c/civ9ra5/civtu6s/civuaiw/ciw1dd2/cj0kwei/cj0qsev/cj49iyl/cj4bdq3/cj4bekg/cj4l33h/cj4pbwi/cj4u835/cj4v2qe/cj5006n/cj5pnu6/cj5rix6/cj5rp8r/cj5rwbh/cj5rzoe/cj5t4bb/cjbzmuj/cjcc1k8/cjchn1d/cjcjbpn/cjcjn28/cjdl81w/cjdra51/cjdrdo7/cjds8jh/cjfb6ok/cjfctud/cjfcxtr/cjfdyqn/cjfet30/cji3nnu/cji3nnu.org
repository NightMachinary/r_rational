Yeah, I think you're right that it's an environmental hazard. The way I would play those is that they hit you when you first encounter them, and again on each of your initiatives, before you can act. (Even with a readied action.)

True, closing the gate would solve the problem, and a readied action would happen before gravity reached you. You can't teleport across planar boundaries so you couldn't teleport out. You could Plane Shift. I guess you could even just have the Big Strong Fighter pull you out.

That is HIGHLY Munchkiny. So much that even I look askance at it. It's also utterly epic.

Of course, now if I use it I have to admit that I didn't come up with the ending to my own story. Damnit. :/

Still, it's seriously epic. Talk about a Crowning Moment of Awesome.
