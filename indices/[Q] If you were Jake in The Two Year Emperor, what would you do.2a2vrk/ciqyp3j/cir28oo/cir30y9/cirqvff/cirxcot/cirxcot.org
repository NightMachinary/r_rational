Hrm, if it effects your decision, then according to [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Intelligent_Items#Intelligent_Items][the wiki]], intelligent items should be treated as the sentient construct race. So if constructs are vulnerable to scrying, one could argue that intelligent items are as well. But ultimately yeah, that'd probably be DM's call. And it's less useful of a tactic if you have Scry Location anyway. Could be useful as a means of tracking a mind-blanked mark you tricked into picking up the ring, maybe? Mind-blank says that scrying targeted at the blanked person fails, but says nothing about the sentient ring in their backpack (Air Bud rules lawyering FTW :P)

I honestly thought that moving the town underground was what you were going for, what with showing us just how far /one/ mage could dig into a mountain, and then showing us you have tens of thousands of them.
