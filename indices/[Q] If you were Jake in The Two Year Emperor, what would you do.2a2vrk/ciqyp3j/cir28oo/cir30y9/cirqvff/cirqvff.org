Let's see...

Water cannon: could work, but would a lot of fiddling. Probably not the most efficient tactic, although it makes a nice surprise.

Scrying: there is a Scry Location spell that will locate places instead of people. Unlike other Scrying, it will even reach other planes!

Int 0 as animal: I would have to check, but I believe if any of your abilities to to 0 you are either incapacitated or dead. Regardless, I would still treat them as people, not animals.

Sentient artifacts: that's...an interesting idea. I think I would rule that they are things, not people, but I would need to think on it.

The underground trick is brilliant.
