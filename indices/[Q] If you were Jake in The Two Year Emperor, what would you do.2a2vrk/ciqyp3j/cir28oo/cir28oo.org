Hm. AFAIK, Rules As Written (RAW) are silent on how you de-sanctify holy water, so it's up to DM (or, in this case, me) decision. I have a question in over at the GitP forums to see if anyone knows of a RAW answer.

I like the steam cannon idea. I was trying to do something similar a while ago: put so much water in a Portable Hole that it would fuse and turn into a 1-shot plasma cannon. Sadly, you can't get it dense enough in a useful period of time without using demiplane tricks that I've already outlawed.

The Deorsi chalice is a 'Sacred Vessel', from page 37 of the Book of Exalted Deeds. The exact wording is: "Water placed within it becomes holy water" so, no, it doesn't have to touch the chalice. Interesting point, and one that I will definitely try to (ab)use if I can think of a way.

The water has to be /in/ the chalice, not just touching water that is in the chalice, so blessing the whole ocean would require pushing every drop of water through something the size of a punch bowl. Theoretically possible but not practical. (Although I /really/ like the idea of holy rain, and have actually been working on an idea that is somewhat similar.)

The Deorsi portals are Ring Gates. Sadly, they only have a 100 mile range, they don't have an offswitch, and they DO have a mass limit: they can only pass 100 pounds of stuff per day. This removes most of the abuses that you can do with them. But! There's a loophole: if something doesn't go all the way through, it doesn't count towards the mass limit. e.g., if you reach your arm through and then pull your arm back, it doesn't count against the mass limit. So, here's what you do: take an iron bar, put it partway through. Move the rings until the ends of the bar touch. Weld the ends together. You now have a no-ended iron bar. Drop it, and it will fall forever, generating effectively infinite kinetic energy (it's possible, although difficult, to remove the air from around it). The problem is that you can't move the darn thing once you start it (because if the bar touches the edges of the rings it will break them), and you can't get it out of the rings.

The interesting thing about that is that (per my ruling), the two rings are /mathematically the same point/. So, if ring A is parallel to the ground and ring B is perpendicular to the ground...what happens to the bar?

As an aside, there are 'Planar Ring Gates' too. Same thing, except they are 10' wide, have a mass limit of 10,000 pounds / day, and only function when the two rings are on different planes.

As regards damaging the Sacred Vessel, there is a 6th level arcane spell called Hardening. It permanently increases the hardness of an object, and the effects stack. You can make the Vessel as touch as you like. (Which they've done; that's why it can manage having 10 Decanters of Endless Water pointed at it without breaking.)

Spell engines with summoning: yes, you can. Interestingly, however, you get no experience for summoned creatures, because the ability to summon them is factored into the summoner's XP value. (The way it's normally expressed is 'you don't get extra XP if the caster throws a Fireball at you, so why would you get extra XP if he throws a Summon Monster at you'.) Personally, I think this rules is a complete crock, but it is the rules.

There's an out though: a monster created by Polymorph is /not/ summoned. So, set up a spell engine that polymorphs houseflies into, say, a wolf. The trainees beat the crap out of the wolf and gain XP.
