So, not sure I understand what you're saying, but what little I get reminds me of something that puzzled me about Stargate as well: If your portal lets through gravity, shouldn't Earth (or whatever planet you're on) be thrown out of its orbit the moment you turn the device on? In the case of the Ring Gates the planet's own gravity should do the same.

Speaking of Ring Gates: If you make the iron bar a permanent magnet instead, would you get an infinitely powerful generator? Though, to be honest, I seem to be incapable of imagining what the field lines of a straight but somehow no-ended magnet would look like...
