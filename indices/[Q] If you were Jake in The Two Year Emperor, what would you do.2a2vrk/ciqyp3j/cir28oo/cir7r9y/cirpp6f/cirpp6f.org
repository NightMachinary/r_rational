Consider us being in the elemental plane of air, nothing but air around anywhere. Insert an infinite wall of soundproof material, dividing space into two. Punch a portal-sized hole in the wall. Place a strong loudspeaker a few kilometers from the portal, and yourself a kilometer from the portal on the other side. The sound that reaches you will be much weaker than if you were two kilometers away from the loudspeaker on its other side, and for the same reason gravitational pull towards a portal to a large mass will be as strong as usual from directly in front of the portal, and about quadratically with distance diminish as you back away from it.

It would work much like a spaceship with air inside a space without having a hole punched into its wall.
