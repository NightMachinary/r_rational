Goodberry requires that the berries be freshly picked; not something that scales well with a spell engine.

I love the Major Creation options. You'd want to MC the photons already collimated, in phase, and moving in the same direction, though.

Magic traps are one version of what I've been calling 'spell engines'. There's also spell turrets spell clocks. I just use 'engines' to lump them all together.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicMouth.htm][Magic Mouth]] says "The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects," so it actually can't activate another Mouth. Also, it's a one-shot; once it's discharged, it's gone. Other spells CAN (e.g. Programmed Image) say command words, though.

Infinite planes: true. Unfortunately, Jake sacrificed the knowledge of the "infinite planes == whatever you want."
