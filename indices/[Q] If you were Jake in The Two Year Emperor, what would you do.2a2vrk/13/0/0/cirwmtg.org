Then that's my Jake's first line of enquiry. /What am I?/ He can be hit, therefore has an AC. He can hit things, therefore has a BAB. He can be affected by magic therefore has saves. He can benefit from stat-boosting items therefore has stats. He can operate magic items, although he apparently has no UMD skill; he can /know things/, although he apparently has no Knowledge skill. Does he have an alignment, ie do items that interact with Good or Evil interact with him?

I'd work on my own character sheet, in the course of magically improving and equipping myself to raise whatever can be raised as high as it will go. I want AC and saves in the +30s. I want stats in the 30s.

I want to figure out /why/ I cannot accumulate XP - am I missing a necessary organ? Can I /wish/ that into place, without limiting myself? Can I then abuse the system to acquire character classes? It seems the world doesn't operate with the Epic Handbook (unless I'm misremembering), so I will multi-class to 20 in every base class and 10 in every prestige class that I can qualify for.

Then as Supreme Being of this damnfool world, with my three-digit bonuses and hit points in the tens of thousands, I will unmake all the bits of it that annoy me, which is highly likely to include the undead horde.

(Oh crap. I think I've figured out a plausible origin for Stupid-world; perhaps some previous planar intruder did exactly that?)
