Eventually the speed of the object falling an an air filled space will set the air on fire, then turn it to plasma, then begin to FUSE the plasma. You really need that vaccuum.

And there is no real method to extract energy from it once it gets that fast without splosions.

Also, as an object approaches relativistic speeds, its mass increases to infinity. Not sure how that would jive with a weight limit, but it could have a serious gravatic effect on the surrounding everything.

I'm assuming Jake's current idea involves a little teleport circle-star lifting or equivalent. That or black hole connections. Either is about as dangerous as it can get there, but if the liches are anything smart, the phylacteries are not anywhere near where they are. Likely not even on the same plane. They basically need Herrun to find them with any degree of success.

Hmm. There might be a way to abuse instananeous (FTL) teleporting to get information from the future...

I'll have to think on that.
