You might still be able to use the ring gates for an oceanic water cannon. You can chain together gate pairs to get around range restrictions. With careful enough positioning of tiny buried gates, I'm sure you could make a surprising amount of the entire world be within '100 miles' of everything else :P. After that, you just need a Hardened gate cover with a quick-release valve or something. Then you could instantly summon 100 pounds of (potentally holy, if the Sacred Vessel is involved) water through a tiny corridor once per day. Not /as/ effective, but still pretty damn powerful, and you could equip squads with them over time.

If you have an infinitely falling no-ended bar, could you teleport it out with [[http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Teleport_Object][teleport object]] or something? That might be a way of getting it out of the rings without touching them, for use in orbital/relativistic strikes.

That polymorph thing sounds brilliant. That also makes me wonder something, though. Divination rules are that you can only track people, not places or things, right?

What qualifies as 'people'?

Like, if you used inteligence-damping equipment and spells on a person enough to drive them to 0 intelligence or below, would they start counting as an animal instead? Would that make them invisible to scrying, and controllable by druids? You could potentially put some sort of druidic post-hypnotic command or geas or something on them, for them to do a bunch of stuff and then shuck the anti-brain gear. That way, you could move people about on the surface without risk of being spotted.

Attacking the problem from the other direction, what if you make a sentient artifact? Does /that/ count as a person? Can you use it as a scry-spy? You could make a grid of buried gold sentient rings over the area you want to watch.

Also, I had a thought about the current brute-force anti-teleport locating weakness thing: What if you move the town /deep enough underground/ that it doesn't effect the surface?
