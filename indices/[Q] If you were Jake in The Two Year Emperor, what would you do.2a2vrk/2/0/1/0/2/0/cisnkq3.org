Air does weigh something, but I'm inclined to treat it as massless for purposes of the ring gates. For one thing, it's a pain to calculate how much air is moving through them under current conditions. For another, it makes them substantially less useful and requires a lot of annoying bookkeeping or, as I like to call it, 'anti-fun'.

Of course, it does open them up to yet more abuses, as you point out. But personally, I find abuses == fun -- that's why I'm writing 2YE in the first place.
