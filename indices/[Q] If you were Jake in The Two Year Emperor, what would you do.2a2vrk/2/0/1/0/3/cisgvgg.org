Idea!

Okay so, those wall-of-force armatures Jake used to mass-manufacture cannons from iron blocks...

Let's say you had one of those that was set up to kill a monster coming out of a polymorph engine. Like, if the exit of the engine was laced with wall of force razor wire, and there was a springboard trap on the floor of the engine set to a trigger held by the trainee, which splatted the polymorphed monster into it.

People get XP by indirectly killing things all the time in TYE. The landguards just got a ton of levels via cannon bombardment. So I think there's a strong case for the WoF armatures being a valid way to factory-farm XP.

You might be able to have some lucky trainee killing one monster per /round/ for however long it takes to no longer get EXP from it. And they'd be able to kill stuff /way/ above their pay grade, since the only consideration is that you don't want to polymorph up something that can survive the death trap.

Second idea:

Freeze holy water (presuming freezing it doesn't desanctify it.) Since it's now a sold object, you can cast Polymorph Any Object on it. (PAO doesn't specifically /say/ the object has to be solid, but best be safe. Besides, it'll give you a duration bonus.)

Polymorph it into dry ice, or nitrogen ice, or some other solid that sublimates into a gas fairly quickly. Then you can fire the ice blocks out of a cannon, and let them dot the field. Or pump an undead stronghold full of the mist from the evaporating ice, or fill portable holes up with the ice to make mobile smoke emitters, or something.

The field will quickly be full of (seemingly inoccuous, to the undead) mist. But as soon as the polymorph wears off, they'll be /covered/ in holy water. The ones with open wounds will have the stuff /inside/ of them. Since you're converting a cold solid to a cold solid, you'd have a duration factor of +5, so you'd have 12 hours to bomb as many undead clusters as possible before the polymorph wears off and they (painfully) realize what you're doing.

Oo, or even better! Even if the thing being polymorphed has to be a solid single object, does the polymorph /result/ have to be solid? If not, you could polymorph holy ice into carbon monoxide, or some other colorless odorless gas. Have a stealth team sneak ring gates or portable holes or something full of the stuff in, and you can secretly 'poison' high-value targets.

Alternately: polymorphing holy water into blood and transfusing it into the feeding stock of babies may be a valid vampire assassination technique. That one has some potential stealth re-applications, too. The vampires have to eat, and so long as you have alignment-switched vampires as sleeper agents, they'll have a hard time predicting who is poisoning their supplies. Very good demoralizer, classic guerilla tactic without the usual fallout of poisoning a well.
