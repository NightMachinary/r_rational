Thats kinda the dirty little secret of RAW though, there is no such thing. RAW in the strictest term does not actually make a workable system; its self-contradictory and lacks definition. As in, it fails at even the simplest levels, way way below what we have been talking about. If it was a program it would fail to compile rather than just have bugs when run. You have to have some level or RAI or you hang on undefined terms before you even get to the rules.

All my arguments about what PAO cant do are on the very RAW side of the continuum. Same as I would argue that a lv1 commoner cant cast wish at will just because the rules do not spell out he cant. By RAW: "rules say what we can do, not what we cant" is the foundation I am going off of here.

If I wanted to argue it enough, I can point out thought bottle lets you store both xp and thoughts (suggesting xp is purely mental), xp is literally experience which is synonymous with memories (again implying it is purely mental), and mental and physical capabilities fall under a species normal ranges by your definition (which covers what class levels do), thus alter self gives you xp. And hey, there is no minimum int needed to be an archmage either, just a minimum if you actually want to cast certain spell levels. Playing word games ends in a trainwreck.

I just cant agree that specific knowledge falls within the normal range for minor physical characteristics of a species, normal range has an actual meaning. Specific knowledge is not in the normal range, its at a range so extreme that its highly likely to be unique if not nonexistant. That is going beyond even the whackiest raw scenarios and into purposefully abusing semantics to allow something that is clearly not allowed.
