Sadly that doesnt actually work. Nothing in PAO, polymorph, or alter self (from which PAO inherits its abilities) gives any ability to change into anything but an average-ish member of a species, much less the ability to get certain thoughts/memories with the polymorph. If Jake had some kind of spell that allowed specific and open ended polymorphing with regards to the assumed form then that could work.

Now PAO a rock into a map showing Afi's location is totally legal because only PAO mentions objects and it doesnt say jack about restrictions, just that you can.
