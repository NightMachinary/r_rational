Well, at this point Jake's probably gonna have to sneak back to flobovia and get some of this done, so he can craft a Sniper Rifle of Extreme Accuracy And Power Such that it Kills A Lich's Phylactery Through The Link To Its Body + 6. Can't believe you gave /Afi/ the diplomancer, this is gonna be /awesomely/ daunting.

On that note, I actually had an even /more/ munchkinly variation pop into my head. I don't think it has a /high/ probability of working, but it's such a wonderfully evil thought that I just had to share it.

The main limitation of the WoF armature training is that eventually the monsters get just too darn strong, and they can /survive/ complete dismemberment. I imagine there are some pretty dern high challenge ratings to be found there, but it's still a hard limit to how high a level you can reach. Not exactly getting-yelled-at-by-gods territory.

But consider this:

Exp you get while polymorphed into another form, even via PAO, is still experience you keep when you morph back, right? You might earn more or less exp for a kill than your baseline form, depending on how the transformation effects your ECL, but still.

And that includes non-sentient forms. If you PAO yourself into a zombie and the zombie kills a bunch of stuff, you keep that xp. Or if you PAO into a boulder that rolls down a hill and kills a bunch of monsters.

So what if... You PAO yourself into an iron ring, and you have your mage friend try and craft you into a magic item?

They don't /complete/ the crafting, that'd just make you revert the changes as if you were damaged or something. Instead, they hook you up to the WoF xp machine, and they let it pump you full of tens of thousands of xp.

They're just... putting it all into an item. An item that happens to be you.

And I don't see any rules forbidding /multiple people/ feeding xp to the same magic item. Hell, the rulebook even explicitely mentions an idea of an evil sorcerer chaining multiple people to his armor of evil evilness. So you could have banks of /hundreds/ of level 1 peons feeding you.

Jake can't use that on any of his troops, of course. Even if it worked, it'd /immediately/ make the gods break out the wide-angle destruction beam. But mein gott, can you /imagine/ a level 100+ Duncan?
