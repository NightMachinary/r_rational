Correction: I said that the dark gods use a resurrection to reverse-gate /something else/ along with the resurrectee. The soul itself isn't Gating anywhere.

[[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dimensionalLock.htm][Dimensional Lock]] blocking transmigration of souls: hm. That's tricky. I think the answer is yes, souls can escape a DL. I'm basing that on this line: "Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell." That implies that things CAN get out of a DL; souls are about the slipperiest things around, so I would say they can escape.
