Unfortunately, Diplomancy and backup phylacteries aren't the only trick in Afi's book. I has horrified when I realized that there was one thing that he would absolutely have done that would make him nearly unkillable. At this point I honestly have no idea how the heroes can realistically win.

Well, I have two ideas, but one of them would be almost literally unbelievable -- the sort of thing that would make readers say "wow, THAT was convenient!" The other is something of a narrative cheat.

So, please -- more anti-lich ideas!
