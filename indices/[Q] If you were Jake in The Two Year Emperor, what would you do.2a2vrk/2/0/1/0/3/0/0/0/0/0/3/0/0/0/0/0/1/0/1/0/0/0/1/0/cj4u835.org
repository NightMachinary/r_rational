Scry trick: yep, all gone. The cost of trying to resurrect a divine being killed aeons ago. :)

Make a black hole: Heh, that would actually work. As I remarked in story, there's a limit on the size of the source object but not on the size of the output object. There's no reason you couldn't say "PAO: grain of sand to enough neutronium to form a singularity".

As far as I know, undead are not immune to Imprisonment, although the touch attack and Will save part are troubling. (Although, if you know the target's name and facts about its life then it gets a -4 on the save.)

A while ago I started a thread over on the Giant In The Playground forums asking [[http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?306515-How-to-kill-someone-permanently]["How do you kill someone permanently in 3.5?"]] There were a lot of suggestions...really a lot. Most of them were outside the ruleset that I'm using and some I just didn't agree would work, but there were several that would. One that I found especially interesting was: Take your victim into a Portable Hole. Cast Imprisonment on him. Get out of the Portable Hole and throw a Bag of Holding into it in order to destroy the Hole. You can only be released from Imprisonment if "a freedom spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place" -- and that location no longer exists.
