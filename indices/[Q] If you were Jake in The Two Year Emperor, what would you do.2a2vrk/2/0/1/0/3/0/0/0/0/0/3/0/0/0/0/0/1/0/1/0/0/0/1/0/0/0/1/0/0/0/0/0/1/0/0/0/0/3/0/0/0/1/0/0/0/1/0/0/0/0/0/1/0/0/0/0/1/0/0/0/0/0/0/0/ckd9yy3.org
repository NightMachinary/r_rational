Indeed, but part of the fun of Two Year Emperor is that it really /does/ run on Rules As Written, /not/ Rules As Intended. So if the rules even allow you a tiny chance, you can go /right on ahead/ and snap the whole system over your knee. Until the gods intervene, anyway (or unless it would break the story. Which Eaglejarl decided this would. But I'm bored as all hell, can't start on the next episode of Let's Read Boatmurdered yet, and this argument is fun.)

And sure those folds and connections are within normal ranges! Someone of your species can and probably does /hold/ that knowledge, after all. So it's within parameters. Now, if you wanted to impart something like a total knowledge of universal whatnot that only a god could comprehend, /then/ you'd have a problem.

Levels and skills though.... I'm not sure those /do/ count. They don't seem to act like standard garden-variety knowledge. You can be as brilliant as any archmage in terms of raw intelligence, but you won't be able to comprehend a ninth-level spell until you actually have the raw XP for it. Likewise, no matter how much you may /know/ about blacksmithing, you can't make a sword unless you have points in crafting for it.

I'd say that levels and skills are more like 'blocks' in your head. You might know all that stuff already, but you can't /use/ it until you appease The Dark Gods of Level Grinding.
