I don't suppose that jibe about the effected object being infinitely small held any water?

Technically speaking, 10^{19} is more than enough for a black hole. In fact, two protons are enough, if you smash them together energetically enough. Gravitational singularities are a function of /density,/ not just sheer mass. Mass just makes it easier, since you have gravity working with you to squeeze it all down, and the Schwarzschild radius becomes bigger. Maybe if you had the neutronium sphere surrounded by antimatter explosives (my, isn't that a fun sentence <3), it'd be enough to squeeze it down?

The only problem with low-mass black holes is that they're short lived. The lower a black hole's mass, the more hawking radiation it gives off, and so the faster it will dissolve. A 2-proton black hole would exist for such a short amount of time that it barely counted as existing at all. That's the real reason the large hadron collider was never a danger; if it /did/ somehow make a tiny black hole, the hole would just instantly dissolve.

The Chandrasekhar Limit is a limit on how massive a non-rotating white dwarf star can be before there's no stable possible configuration and it /always/ collapses into either a black hole, or a neutron star, depending on conditions. You could consider it a minimum mass for natural black holes (though I imagine the pressure of stars going supernova means there's a few natural ones out there under the limit). It clocks in at 1.4 stellar masses: 2.765*10^{30} kg

Thankfully, wolfram alpha [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=hawking+radiation&a=*FS-_**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.T-.*BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M--&f2=2.765*10%5E30&f=BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M_2.765*10%5E30&a=*FVarOpt.1-_**-.***BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.Q--.**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.J---.*--][has a function for this]]. It says that a black hole with a mass of the chandrasekhar limit would have a temperature of 4.4*10^{-5} millikelvin. Pretty dern close to absolute zero. So the hole would only lose mass very slowly, and would last for billions of years.

A black hole with mass 10^{19} [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=hawking+radiation&a=*FS-_**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.T-.*BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M--&f2=10%5E19+kg&f=BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.M_10%5E19+kg&a=*FVarOpt.1-_**-.***BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.Q--.**BlackHoleTemperatureFormula.J---.*--][has a temperature of 12270 kelvin]]. That's a high temperature, and it would only get hotter as it loses mass. But it's releasing that mass as pure energy here, and since E=mc^{2,} we can reach pretty good temperatures before we lose significant amounts of mass per second. Thing would probably be stable for at least a few thousand years.

Set it up, and throw in a few dozen more neutronium spheres, and you got yourself +a stew+ a black hole that should last a good couple hundred million years at least.

Of course, if you could phrase the request like "Sphere of neutronium with volume 56 cubic meters of suchandsuch density" then you could make arbitrary amounts of mass and still be able to double-pao it before it collapses. That'd get around the problem neatly enough.
