Can undead be petrified?

+It's a fortitude save to resist all the petrifying attacks I can find, and undead seem to be immune to most things that require fort saves. But petrifying seems to be more magical and esoteric, rather than the usual poisonous or painful things that the undead seem to be /meant/ to have immunity for.+

nevermind, undead are [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#undeadType][explicitely]] immune to /anything/ that requires a fort save, propriety be damned. Unless the effect also works on objects.... Which I don't think any of the petrification effects do.

Actually, the wording on [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/gorgon.htm][the Gorgon's breath attack]] is kinda vague enough. Maybe it turns everything caught in the cone into stone, and so would count?

Regardless, if you can catch Afi PAO'd in a non-undead form, or if you can find a petrfication technique that's a will or reflex save...

You aren't /dead/ if you're petrified, just unconscious. So a lich's soul wouldn't retreat back to the phylactery. Could be a way to trap a lich?
