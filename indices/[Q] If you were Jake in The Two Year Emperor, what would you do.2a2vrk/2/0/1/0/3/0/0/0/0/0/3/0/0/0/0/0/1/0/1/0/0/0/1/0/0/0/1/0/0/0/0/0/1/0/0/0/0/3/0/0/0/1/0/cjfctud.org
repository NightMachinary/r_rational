Hm. The RAW on TtS is "picks up or accepts the object". 'Accepts' implies a conscious choice, so wishaporting it into his hand doesn't count. 'Picks up' does not require the same degree of conscious choice, but it does require that he take a move action to put his hand on it and lift it. Again, no go for teleporting it into his hand.

Maybe you could trick one of his minions into giving it to him...or make a piece of paper be the trigger object, wishaport it near him, with a Magic Mouth to say "We surrender! Here's the terms!" Maybe. You would think a lich who's lived for thousands of years would be a little more paranoid than to pick up random objects that just came out of nowhere.

Maybe you could wishaport into his lab, and enchant one of his pens as the trigger object?

Wish 'mimics' a spell, meaning that it's exactly the same. Same range.

The PH / singularity could work. I think that it would tear his body apart instantly though, and then his soul would go back to the phylactery.
