The ring gates would work and, as I understand the RAW, you don't have to stick your hands through. The actual text says "you can cast a spell through it" [quoted from memory]; it doesn't say that you have to reach through to do it.

The initiative trick was the first way that I thought of to make AM work safely; Al has a readied action with the condition "when Bob finishes casting his spell, I will teleport us away". Bob casts the PAO:antimatter. Al's action triggers and basically preempts everything else in the universe so that his action can happen. You would need to use a ring of teleport or something like that, since casting a spell would still take 6 seconds.

Alternatively, Bob could just have a Contingency spell on himself that says "when I finish casting PAO:antimatter, this Teleport spell will get me out of there."

Alternatively, Bob could PAO or Shapechange himself into a ghost or other incorporeal form before casting the PAO:antimatter. Incorporeals are immune to all non-magical damage, including AM blasts.

I can think of other methods too, but these seem like the most reliable.
