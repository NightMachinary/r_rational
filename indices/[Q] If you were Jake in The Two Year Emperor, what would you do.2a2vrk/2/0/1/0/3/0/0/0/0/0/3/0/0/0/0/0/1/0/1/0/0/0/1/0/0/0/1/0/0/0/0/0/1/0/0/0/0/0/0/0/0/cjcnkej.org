Thinking on it, the increased save dc bit is unecessary so extra xp is not actually needed. Just have 1000 wizards ready an action to wish the helm onto Afi's head and back and go down the line. 500 chances pretty much gurantees he would fail at some point. Since it would all take place during one round and Afi would be flat footed that really restricts Afi's possible counters as well.
