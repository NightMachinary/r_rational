Okay, I'm not sure if this is from a nonstandard source book or homebrew or what, but I can only find this spell description on one wiki:

[[http://therafimrpg.wikidot.com/glass-strike][Glass strike]] is like flesh-to-stone, but glass. Except it can be cast to /explicitly/ target objects. Undead are subject to fortitude saves that effect objects. And since that's a really rare occurrence, I imagine Afi's neglected his fortitude compared to his other saves. A glass statue of Afi can be PAO'd as easily as a stone statue, no?

Also, from the Book of Exalted Deeds, [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/sanctify-the-wicked--93/][Sanctify the Wicked]] is a spell that /directly targets the soul./ It tears the target's soul out and imprisons it in a gem, where it's turned good over the course of a year. Tearing a lich's soul from its body and imprisoning it sounds like the sort of thing that'd keep it from returning to the phylactery. But the spell requires a rare class, and it's 9'th level, /and/ it requires expensive spell components, /and/ it's a will save.

Also from the BoED, [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/last-judgment--90/][Last Judgement]] kills the target, but immediately sends it to the lower plane to be punished for all eternity. Might also prevent phylactery resurrection. Would only be a delaying action, since he can be resurrected, but still. Sadly it's also a will save, but at least it can be cast by classes I know you have on hand.
