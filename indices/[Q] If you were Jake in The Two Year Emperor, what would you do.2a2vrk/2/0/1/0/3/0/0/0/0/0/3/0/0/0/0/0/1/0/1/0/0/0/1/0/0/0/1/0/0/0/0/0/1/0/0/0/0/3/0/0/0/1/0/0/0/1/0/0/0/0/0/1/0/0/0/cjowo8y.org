My contention would be that the spell can't pull information purely out of nowhere. The antimatter PAO works because Jake knew a lot about it and told Isaac to create it which implicitly generated enough information to "reify the mystic construct" </Isaac> Asking for something that no one in universe knows at all is beyond the spells abilities.
