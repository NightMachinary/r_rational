We've already discussed at least one strategy for quickly farming ridiculous levels of Xp, including xp for item creation. Maybe you could channel the xp into a scroll of wish or ring of 3 wishes...

Of course, the method we discussed would take at least a day or two to set up, and probably 2 weeks to a month to complete properly and get scaled up to the kinda production levels needed.
