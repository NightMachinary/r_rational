Killing chamber is a second spell engine of prestidigitation (cleaning)?

Or if you're using the monster body for something, have the spell engine set to only polymorph every few rounds instead of every round, and have a commoner team cart the corpse out. Very carefully mark out where the WoF wire is.

Of course, if the trap is energetic enough, then chunks of the monster should be launched well clear of the spell engine anyway. It's not like you need to carefully preserve every last scrap of the infinite series of monsters.
