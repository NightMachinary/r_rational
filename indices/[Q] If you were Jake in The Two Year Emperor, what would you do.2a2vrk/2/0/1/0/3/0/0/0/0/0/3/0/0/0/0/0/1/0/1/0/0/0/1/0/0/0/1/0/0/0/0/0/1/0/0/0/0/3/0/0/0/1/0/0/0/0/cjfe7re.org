Souls would be [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#incorporealSubtype][Incorporeal]] right?

RaW says that they're immune to nonmagical attacks. /Not/ that they can't be /hit/ by them. You can 'hit' them, you just pass through unless you're wielding a magic weapon or have ghost touch.

So you may be able to /make/ a melee touch attack. You pass through, but you still 'touch' them, and the spell hits (if it passes the 50% chance rate, for damaging spells. But we aren't trying to damage, are we?)

.... I wonder if that would qualify as /punching something in the soul/
