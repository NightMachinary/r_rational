I thought on it a little more:

Damage from gravity is probably a type of [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/environment.htm][environmental hazard]]. Damage from those is determined by the round. I'm not sure if that means each character rolls for damage on their round, or if the environment itself has a 0 initiative roll for everybody at the start of each round.

Either way, /Afi will survive at least until his round comes./ Unless he has the exact same initiative as the people who cast the PAOs and closed the hole, then he will survive for at least a fraction of a second, and possibly as long as 4.999(repeating) seconds, before he even has a chance of taking damage. If he's beyond the event horizon, where time dilation approaches infinity relative to outside the horizon, then a fraction of a second is /well/ over enough :)

For avoiding this process destroying the world:

Once the portable hole is closed, it's sealed off. You don't have to worry about the singularity devouring the world unless someone opens the portable hole again.

So long as you close the portable hole /before the effects of the collapsing neutronium reach the entrance of the portable hole,/ you're fine. You can do that easily via a readied action. Like I said, gravity propagates /merely/ at the speed of light. It's got nothing on readied actions, which /always/ pre-empt the event, /no matter what./
