Huh. That would totally work, as far as I can tell. Wish for "an intelligent, lawful good Helm of Opposite Alignment named Bob with a save DC of 10,000." Then Wish "for Bob to be transported onto Afi's head." Intelligent items are explicitly stated to be creatures, constructs, and NPCs, so Wish can definitely transport them.

Bleh. That would work, but it would also suck as a narrative device. Now I have to figure out why neither side can actually do it.
