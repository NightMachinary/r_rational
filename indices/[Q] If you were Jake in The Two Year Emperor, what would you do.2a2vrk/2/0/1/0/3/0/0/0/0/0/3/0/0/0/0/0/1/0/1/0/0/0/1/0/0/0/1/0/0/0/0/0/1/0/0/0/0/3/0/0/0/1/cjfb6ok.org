Idea:

If Wishaporting an item to someone works through mind blank by -any- of the means I've tried to justify (or if you can just locate Afi through a Loki question sufficiently enough to target him, or something....)

What if you Wishaport a [[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm][Trap The Soul]] spelltrigger token into Afi's hand. Does that count as tricking him into picking it up? 'Cause that shit don't have a save, and it /sucks the soul right out./

--------------

Secondary idea:

Wish can be used to mimic just about any spell. But does it stick to the range restrictions of those spells? Like say if my friend Bob on the other continent casts Sending to me saying "Omg soooo many dire wereleprechauns, buffz plz," can I Wish to cast Grease on Bob's clothing so he can get to properly wrestling them?

If Wish can cast spells at great range, then do all the /other/ usual range-y things of Wish apply? For example, can Wish cast across planes, or to targets that are usually impossible?

If so, it may be possible to directly target Afi's soul /while it's still schlepping around in his body./ Potential there, if you can find a way to /destroy his soul directly/ through some spell or another.

--------------

Tertiary idea:

Get Afi into a portable hole by some means or another. Dimension Lock the portable hole once he's in (or before if you aren't using some manner of teleport trap.) Double-PAO into the hole, turning a mote of dust or oxygen atom or something into a hyperdense neutronium sphere that will collapse into a black hole, and close the portable hole as a readied action against the sphere collapsing into a singularity.

Afi's now trapped in a dimension-locked demiplane with an extreme gravity well making time there run superslow thanks to relativistic effects. If mind blank /does/ beat all manner of wishaport, then he's gonna be trapped there until he realizes that and takes his own mind blank off. Even if that just takes one round (his time) he's gonna be in there for tens of thousands of years (our time), at /least./

I /think/ that should make Afi unreachable to anything but a really determined god. So long as you can keep tabs on that closed hole, or find a way to dissolve it without destroying the demiplane. (Put it in a box tied to a mind-blanked temporal stasis'd cat, and thow the cat into /another/ DimLocked black hole, but just in space instead of in a portable hole this time?)

Any ideas on adding godproofing?
