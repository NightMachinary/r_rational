How specific can PAO be about putting knowledge into peoples' heads?

Like, if you PAO'd a dust mote into a human, could you make them Lawful/chaotic/good/evil? Could you dictate that they're a worshipper of any one god?

What about allegiances? Could you say "Polymorph Any Object: Dust mote to Lawful Neutral Human who zealously worships Herun and is loyal to Grofhamr" ?

What about languages? Could you tack on a list of languages that the polymorphed human speaks?

What if you polymorph up a person who knows a bunch of languages, and who is loyal to the town and to the goddess of secrets, and then you /ask them to sacrifice the knowledge of all the languages they speak to the goddess/?

That'd make the goddess of secrets stronger, /and/ get her a whole horde of worshippers who can /only talk to/through her/. Automatic vow of silence, should be pretty good worshippers. And I imagine that sacrificing something as big as /all the words you know/ would be a pretty good sized secret to feed her. Could be that you don't even need to polymorph that many of them to tip the scales back to your side.

Hell what if you PAO up a person with all of wikipedia in their head, and they sacrifice /that/?
