Y'know, Jake could have someone PAO /him/ into, say, Jake With a Tarrasque's Regenerative Capabilities. Or go with smarter again.

That'd probably be a fast track into getting yelled at by another deity though, wouldn't it.

Still, there must be /some/ non-forbidden PAO self-improvements....

Non-magical improvement things, maybe? PAO up some extremely powerful Nootropics, or a nanomedicine suite that gives you technology-based regenerative powers, or something?
