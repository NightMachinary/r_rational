I had a thought: Why does the XP all have to go to /people/?

We've got an infinite pool of xp now, and it looks like magic items aren't something you can just buy on the marketplace in TYE (is there a name for this world?), even with infinite gold. Why not use some of it to farm out magic items en mass?

It's quite possible for a person other than the item crafter to [[https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060526a][transfer XP to a magic item.]] The only solid restrictions I can see are that it has to be a willing transfer, and it has to be to an item that the transfer-er is proficient in. And you need a cheapo magic item that just about any caster can make in a day.

So while you can't use a commoner for this, you could just use a trainee fighter for weapons/armor, a trainee wizard for scrolls and wands, a trainee bard for Vuvuzelas of Supreme Annoyance +20, etc.

And I do mean trainee. The lower the level, the more bonus exp they get for killing stuff above their challenge-rating with the WoF armature. If you have a level 1 peon slaying a dragon per round and putting all of it into items (keeping them at level 1) then you should be able to build up /absurd/ amounts of exp right quickly. Make some truly expensive stuff, outfit everyone in your army with +5 swords, whatever.
