Yeah, it's kinda a dodgy thing that would probably depend on the DM's interpretation. And any decent DM would shoot it down as obvious munchkinry. Which it is :P

I think you can -kinda- exploit PAO for more exp a little even without it; if you use it to artificially lower your ECL, you can get a higher exp bonus. But that's kinda just chicken scratch. I think I'm finally getting low on ideas for exploiting the WoF armatures.
