Yeah, sorry for the necro. Was responding to your latest comments and saw this.

Chemical stuff PAO can do in the process of assuming a creatures form, but it has no ability to do specifics beyond that. Unless the spell says that the assumed form could have preprogrammed knowledge, you cant do it. Its inclusive, not exclusive since it specifically lists what you can do.

It doesnt make a whole lot of logical sense if you think of PAO on an atomic level, but its magic in a world with stupid raw rules.
