Idea: If you had a sacred vessel on the field, you could load it up with dust of dryness pellets and have some sort of mechanism to burst them. At the moment of being burst, all the water from the pellets will be 'inside' the vessel, and so will be blessed. Instant holy lake!

... Though it might be supercompressed into holy plasma.

Let's math!

You said the sacred vessel was 'the size of a punchbowl' right? I'd guess that at around 3 gallons' volume, fair?

According to woflram alpha, [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number+of+marbles+fit+in+3+gallons][you can fit about 6400 marbles into 3 gallons]]. Might vary a bit depending on the shape of the chalice, size of the pellets, etc.

Let's first imagine that the water escapes somehow without being significantly heated/compressed. So it all stays water. We'll even assume that it just floods out instead of being largely aerosolized.

if the water has to be 1 foot deep to be dangerous to undead, then it'd be dangerous until it spread out into boxes of 5*5*1, which each take up about [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5*5*1+foot+box+volume+in+gallons][187 gallons]]. 640000/187 is about 3422 squares. [[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=radius+of+circle+with+area+3422][Giving us a radius of about 33 squares]] .

Okay, so not so much instant holy lake. Instant holy decorative pond?

Good thing that's probably not what would happen.

640,000 gallons of water. In a 3 gallon container, however briefly.

/yikes/

I have /no idea/ how to do the math for trying to compress that much water into that little amount of space. I do know that it takes an /obscene/ amount of pressure to force water into any greater density. Like, the entire weight of the ocean is enough to /barely/ make the water at the bottom /slightly/ denser than the water at the top from pressure alone.

My gut tells me that the pressure wave of all that water expanding at once is probably gonna be much more dangerous than the fine misting of holy water. Probably more economical to use a non-sacred (and bigger! Muahaha!) vessel, save the risk of destroying your Sacred one.

I think I like this idea /much/ more than the old '100 gallon holy water bomb' idea!

Of course, 6400 dusts of dryness would cost 5,440,000 gold. So even if Jake could buy it on the market, he'd probably have to get the commoners mass-exploiting the ladder trick to make that much in a reasonable time period.

But it's still fun to imagine making a nuke out of /water/.

*More realistically usable:* It wouldn't be a nuke, but you might be able to make decent /grenades/ out of a single pellet. Wrap it in a thick steel/iron/whatever casing. 100 gallons of water in a 1/10'th-inch sphere should be pretty catastrophic levels of pressure, all released at once when thrown.
