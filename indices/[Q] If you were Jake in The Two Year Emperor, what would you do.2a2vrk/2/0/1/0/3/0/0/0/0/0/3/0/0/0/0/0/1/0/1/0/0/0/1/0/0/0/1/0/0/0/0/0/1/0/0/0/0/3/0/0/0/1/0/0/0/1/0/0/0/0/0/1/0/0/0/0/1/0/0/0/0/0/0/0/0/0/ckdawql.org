Eh, you're right. It's not necessary to polymorph knowledge since we have mindscrape, anyway. Pity the gods turned that one down.

Although I /do/ wonder if you could theoretically import knowledge so common that more than 50% of the species knows it. That'd be the literal definition of 'average member of the species' after all :P. Like, could you polymorph into a dragon to learn draconic? Food for thought, that.
