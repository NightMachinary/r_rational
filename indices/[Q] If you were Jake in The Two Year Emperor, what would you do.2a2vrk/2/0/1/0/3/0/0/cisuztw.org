Fundamental change of nature, ehhh?

/eeevil grin/

Can something that's been PAO'd be PAO'd again?

'Cause then you could PAO a drop of pond scum into an ape (lasts only a few minutes since very dissimilar) And then PAO the /ape/ into a human being (Very similar, should be permanent.)

The PAO scum->ape wears off, but you don't /have/ an ape for it to wear off on. So... Which spell takes precedence?

Or y'know, some other chain of polymorph to get whatever thing you want an infinite supply of that you can't get at the marketplace.

And yeah, that (usually temporary) fundamental change of nature is kinda why I thought you could use it for holy water surprise attacks. The trick would be seeing if the water regains its beatitude when it unmorphs. So you'd have to avoid dry ice, obviously, but maybe nitrogen ice or some other volatile would work.

Morph it into smoke bombs, maybe?
