It could be a fun part of Afi's backstory. Maybe that's how he became head lich, figuring out that trick and making his enemies waste their resources pursuing /backup/ phylacteries.

I think we're making progress on anti-lich strategies that don't depend on phylacteries though, so all hope isn't quite lost yet!
