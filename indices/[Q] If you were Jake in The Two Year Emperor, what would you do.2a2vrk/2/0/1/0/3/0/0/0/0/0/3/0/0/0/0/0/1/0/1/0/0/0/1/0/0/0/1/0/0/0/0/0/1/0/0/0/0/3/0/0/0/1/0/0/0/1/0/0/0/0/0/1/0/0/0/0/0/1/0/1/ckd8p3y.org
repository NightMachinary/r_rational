There is nothing in raw forbidding it because nothing in raw is allowing it. If you ready an action to move but your character is immobilized the action would just fail. Nor could you ready an action to cast wish as a fighter, neither is a legal action for the character to take. Readied action gives you no special ability to do things you cannot normally do.

Same thing here, if you cannot make a spot/listen check you cant relay a message, if you dont have the knowledge you cant point to afi's location.

What is abusable, however, are trigger conditions. By RAW and a broad definition of condition, I could argue that Afi being in /this/ map grid is the condition to trigger my action to point at a specific map grid. Pointing at a predesignated spot doesnt require anything special-the trigger is doing all the work here. If the DM allows that trigger, thats legal (if stupid).

This gets dangerously close into the old "it doesnt say I /cant/ cast spells while dead" area though if you allow such a definition. Sadly not even the rules compendium really goes into the definition of valid conditions so it is ultimately up to you.
