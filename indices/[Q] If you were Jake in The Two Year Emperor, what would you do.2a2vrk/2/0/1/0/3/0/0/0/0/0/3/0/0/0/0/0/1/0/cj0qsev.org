Unfortunately, Wishes are also inherent bonuses, so Jake is maxed out and can't get any benefit to his Int from a Tome.

As to WIS and CHA bonuses -- yep, it would be helpful to him to have them. Nope, he's not going to get them. Jake's two big problems are (1) social challenges and (2) making mistakes. Boosts to CHA and WIS (respectively) would solve these issues mechanically, making the story boring. They would also represent a major change in the character; I'm not sure I even /could/ write that character without it seeming like a Mary Sue. Boosts to INT are nice because they make things more INTeresting (ha) but they don't raise the power level; they just let you make bigger mistakes faster.

Jake could give these boosts to an army, but each Manual / Tome only works once, so you'd need to make one per person. You can't use spell engines to create magic items, so you'd need to dedicate a 17th level wizard (need Wish memorized) or cleric (for Miracle) to take 25 days to make each one. The Deorsi only have about 5000 people of that level left so they can't go completely nuts.

Daern's Instant Fortress (to give it its proper name from before all copyright-restricted material was purged from the SRD): great item. Brings back memories. :) Expensive item so can't really be mass produced but yes, it would definitely be interesting to see.

Dust of Dryness -- when I read this carefully, I don't think it's the same water that comes back. It says that "a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed to nothingness[....] If this pellet is hurled down, it breaks and releases the same volume of water." I think it's not the same water, which means the positive energy in the holy water is lost.

Lyre of Building -- it's not exactly clear to me what that 'reinforce buildings' ability does. It might mean "you play this thing and the affected building is completely un-harmable for the next 30 minutes", or it might mean "the building heals every round for 30 minutes". In any case, the building ability is shiny and I can totally think of uses for it. Thanks for the suggestion.
