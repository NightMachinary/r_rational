Hrrrrrmmmmmmm.... Temporal Stasis...... Tricckkkyyyyyy...

Well, if you can get an antimatter bomb /to/ it, then the blast will pretty well reveal its location, and completely disable all its defenses. All you need is to look for the cat in the center of the crater. You have 1d4 days to get through the army of undead and cast Freedom on it. Tricky but not impossible, potentially worth a go even if we can't find a way around it.

But let's try and find a way around it anyway :)

Okay so.... What if we studded Boomer with outwardly facing Beholder eyes? (The sending mage casts Wish from beyond 150 feet. So long as they have gear to enhance their eyesight like you used to detonate those explosive runes on the super-bouncy-balls-of-righteous-undead-slaying, should work fine.) Or we give Boomer the ability to emit antimagic that doesn't effect itself, same difference really. Would their antimagic emissions disable the stasis while it's within the field?

Back to getting around the Mind Blank...

Wishaport doesn't seem to work like any other sort of teleportation. It has /no/ chance of failing, It does /not/ rely on 'familiarity' in any way, and it has no sort of range or plane restrictions. I'd say that there's a good chance Wishaport is a special ability of Wish itself, rather than wish mimicking/combining spells.

You're reshaping reality itself so that someone is 'there, and not here.' You might not need to be able to find your target to do that. Wish just puts it there /anyway./

After all, Wish can't /tell/ you where Afi is, but that doesn't mean that Wish doesn't /know/ where he is.

Finally, the text of Wish says that it can put things down in an area 'regardless of local conditions.' So maybe one of the 'conditions' it can get around is lack of information about the target.
