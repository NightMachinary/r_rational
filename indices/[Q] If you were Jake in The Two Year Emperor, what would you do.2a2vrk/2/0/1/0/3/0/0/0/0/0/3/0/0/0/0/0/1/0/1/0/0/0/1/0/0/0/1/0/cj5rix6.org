Yep, that would work. You wouldn't need PAO either -- wait until you catch them using Shapechange, for example.

Also, when you have them petrified, you can do better than just keeping them sitting around as a statute:

- PAO (get them to non-undead form)
- Flesh to Stone
- Soften Earth and Stone (turn them into clay)
- Add a lot of water so they become mud
- Purify Water so they become just pure water
- Pour the water into a river

Petrified is not dead, so they don't respawn from their phylactery. But they no longer have a defined location from which they can be turned back. Wish does not contain a clause that would fix this situation, although the catchall "you can try for stronger effects but it might be dangerous" would let you do it at GM's discretion. Miracle (aka "the strictly better version of Wish") probably could recover them, especially if you paid the 5000 XP for a major request.

Other than those two options, I don't think mortal magic can bring them back.
