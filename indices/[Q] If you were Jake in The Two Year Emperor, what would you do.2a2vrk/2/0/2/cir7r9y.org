So I happen to be a mathematical physicist semi-specializing in GR. I've never rigorously looked at a space with portals like this in it before (but after this discussion I probably will try), but my intuition suggests you're going to run into more problems than you realize.

As far as you've described, the portal openings consist of a pair of (probably) ellipses with conjugate points on the part of the planes defined by the ellipses interior to the ellipses mathematically identified. The problem with doing things that way is twofold. First, these portals have no "backs," meaning if something going in the "front" of portal A comes out the "front" of portal B, then anything going in the "back" of portal A comes out the "back" of portal B. Requiring portals be "anchored" on flat surfaces doesn't fully solve that problem due to the next problem.

Since these are /mathematically/ identified points, then anything physical can travel through the portals. Including forces. Including gravity. As a toy example, consider two point masses with appreciable mass, each very near the portal surface compared to the size of the portal. At that distance, the relative locations of the portals don't matter; they can be lightyears apart and the masses exert a pull on each other like they are right next to each other.

Now rotate one of the portals around one of the point masses. Wherever the portal opening faces, that is where the force of attraction is.

What does this mean in the context of people using portals? Say you have a portal in front of you (normal vector perpendicular to the ground's normal vector) with output above you facing down toward you (normal vector anti-parallel to ground's normal vector). Looking through the portal you see the Earth "in front" of you, which means you feel its gravity in front of you, too, /in addition to the normal gravity below you/. So the mere presence of portals near massive bodies changes the force of gravity *appreciable distances away from either of the portals*. In theory, with the proper locations and orientations, you can severely screw with gravity across the entire planet with two portals on the same continent.

To go with the RAW while keeping physics as realistic as possible, you either have to drop mathematical identification or GR.
