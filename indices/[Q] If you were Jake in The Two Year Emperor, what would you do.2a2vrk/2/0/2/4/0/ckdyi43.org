I haven't yet; thanks for reminding me! I finish teaching this week, though, so I'll have a chance this weekend to sit down with the space.

One note, I've never worked with GR in spaces with identified subregions (from the physics side they're not physically meaningful, and from the math side the special case of GR is so complicated no one in the math community does anything with it unless they absolutely have to), so I may not get actual results for some time. Keep poking me and I'll keep you updated.
