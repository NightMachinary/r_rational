RAW seems to imply Aristotlean physics, not Newtonian, let alone Einsteinian. Gravity is locally generated and doesn't necessarily propagate.

That said, there is considerable value in Doing Physics Experiments, in order to /work out/ what actually happens in a RAW world. A lot of it will be DM's call, and the DM is /not necessarily/ required to be consistent; it's already been established in-story that the DM's tolerance only goes so far, and the same may apply to physics.

Remember that this is a creationist world with a fairly capricious Physics God.
