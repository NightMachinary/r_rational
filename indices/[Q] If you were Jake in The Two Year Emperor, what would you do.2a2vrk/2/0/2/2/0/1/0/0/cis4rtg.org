Hm. Good point. Yes, you can. The canonical examples from the item description are:

"A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate."

Ok, so the input / output thing is not absolutely pure -- the input side can emit things that started on the output side, so long as they are boostrapped in by something that went only partially through the ring. Still, the general point stands -- air, light, gravity, nothing comes through in the "wrong" direction except through this one loophole.
