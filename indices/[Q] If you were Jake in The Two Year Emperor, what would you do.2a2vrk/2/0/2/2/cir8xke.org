I'm going to need to read this a few more times to make sure I understand it, and I'd like to do that in the morning when I'm fully awake, so I'll leave the bulk of this for later.

One point: the Ring Gates actually do have an "input" and an "output". Nothing goes in the output side or out the input side. I'm not sure if / how this interacts with your post. To be clear: if something goes in the "input" side of ring A, it comes out the "output" side of ring B and vice versa. Through suitable use of Sovereign Glue (a magically cannot-be-broken bonding agent) it is possible to make a one way valve like this -- just glue the input side of B to a magically unbreakable wall.

EDIT: Ok, I finaly had the chance to sit down and read this. I think what you're saying is that, in the situation you describe, the planet's gravity is simultaneously pulling in two separate directions. There's only one "point mass" (the planet) in this example, which is why I was confused -- you mentioned two in your original statement.

You are (of course) right, that's how it would work under physics. I think, however, that this is a case where RAW trumps physics -- the item description makes no mention of effects on gravity, therefore there aren't any. Of course, the flip side of this is that it wouldn't transmit /light/ either -- the descriptions says that you can "stick your head through" to look around, it doesn't say that you can just look through the portal. That's a pity, since I was planning to turn (a pair of ring gates) + (a bunch of Celestial Brilliance stones back home) into a giant anti-undead laser cannon, and now it looks like I can't. Feh.
