hooray, I thought of something shiny <3 Thank you for that compliment.

Here's something else I thought of:

What are the conditions for de-sanctifying holy water? Obviously if you drink holy water, you don't have holy pee. But it can sit on the shelf indefinitely without losing its beatitude, right? And presumably putting things like flavorings in it wouldn't have any effect (so long as the flavorings weren't cursed or antithetic to the deity blessing the water, I guess.)

If you evaporate holy water, does it lose its beatitude? Steam is still the /exact same water,/ just moved around. It's not turned into something else like when you drink the water. Hell, if the water is blessed by a deity with a fire/heat affinity, it should probably rightly make the water /stronger./

Boiling holy water sounds like a helluva anti-undead weapon to me; it'd fill the air with holy steam and take out any of the fliers. Or you could pressurize holy steam and fill up a portable hole with it; slap it onto a board or something and you have a 1-shot steam cannon that should blast away most undead.

But that's all tactical thinking. Thinking more strategically... How does that holy water maker that the Deorsi have work? Does it bless whatever water it touches, or does it have some sort of HW/volume limit?

If you dropped it in the ocean, could you theoretically bless the whole damn thing, if you left it in long enough? If you lowered it on an anchor into a major tidal cycle, you could probably bless most of the water in the ocean. Not only would it kill any undead walking along the ocean floor, but it'd also mean that all the rain in the world is now /holy rain./ Which would probably put a damper (heh) on the undead nations.

Edit: I~DE~AAA!

The Deorsi portal things that link two places together can be turned on and off with a command word or something, right?

Make yourself a classical infinite-fall tunnel with two of them, with a third (deactivated) portal-half between them. You can then drop things into the tunnel (via brief activation of the Input/Output portal) and then just let the object fall forever, picking up velocity and damage. You can then have an instant surprise orbital strike wherever you can get the I/O portal half. Turn it on, thing goes flying straight to the ground, boom. If you found a way to suck the air out of the falling tunnel, there'd be no terminal velocity and you could even accelerate things to /trans-relativistic/ speeds! Relativistic Kill Vehicle Portal Strike.

Or you could sink one portal half to the bottom of the ocean. Then whenever you activate the other half, you'd have a million-PSI water cannon that could pulverize steel.

OOO! Does the holy water chalice have to /touch/ water to bless it, or does it just have to be 'within the cup'? Depending on how it works, you could make it a part of a portal chain to the ocean (very carefully sized and positioned portals to prevent damage to the artifact, of course.) Then you'd have a /Holy Firehose of Utmost Annihilation./

Further idea: Can Deorsi spell engines be keyed to a summoning spell? If you had a magic tunnel that spat out a monster on demand, you'd be able to make much more scalable training arenas than Jake's current design.
