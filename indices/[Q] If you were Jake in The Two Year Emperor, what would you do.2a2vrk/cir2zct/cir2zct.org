Step 1) Move everyone inside of a demiplane (This is mostly already done)

Step 2) Get a critical amount of casters who can cast Locate City

Step 3) Cast Locate City with explosive spell tacked on

Step 4) Everything not in the demiplane takes 1000000d6 damage

Step 5) ???

Step 6) Profit!

EDIT: Or failing that, since I just remembered explosive spell is metamagic, Dust of choking/sneezing has no save. It doesn't matter how high of a caster level you are, if it hits you, you're as good as dead. Wishing for an easily abusable magic item would do it too. Hell, it might be best just to detonate the planet with antimatter and move everybody to somewhere else.
