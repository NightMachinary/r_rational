You're right that a permanent SoD will kill unlimited enemies, but it turns off for 10 mins between each blast, so it will be of limited use in a combat situation. Still, a wall of them would do a great job of wiping out the first few ranks.

As to Find the Path... I've pretty much been pretending it doesn't exist. It destroys too much tension; anything you need, you can use this to get it. Although...hm. That actually gives me some interesting ideas. Thank you! This is going to solve a major plot issue that I had looming on the horizon.
