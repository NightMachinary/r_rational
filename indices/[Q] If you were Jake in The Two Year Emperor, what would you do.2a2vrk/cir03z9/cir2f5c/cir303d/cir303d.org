Orcus stands, and grasps his great claymore from the weapon stand beside his throne. He descends slowly from the raised dais his throne rests upon, taking each step slowly and carefully, exuding malice.

On the third step down his ankle catches on a length of adamantine razor wire, neatly severing one of his feet. He falls over forward, hitting yet more razor wire. He arrives at the base of the dais in imperfectly quartered chunks.

The thief and wizard share a massive XP dump. (Thief runs regular razor wire, wizard casts Transmute Object: Adamantine on the wire)

...

Well, not really, but it'd be funny to behold.
