Nope, there absolutely still is innocent life and beautiful things. That's what Jake was talking about in today's chapter. Looked at from a utilitarian viewpoint, the question is murky:

- The undead will almost certainly kill and/or convert all life on the planet; does this mean that the lives that exist now can be looked at as unsavable and therefore not a factor in decision making?
- Exactly how many lives would be taken by blowing up the planet? How do you tell?
- If doing this is the only way to be sure that the undead don't follow and kill off the millions of people that you are transporting, how does that affect the calculation?
- Will the undead stay confined to this world, or will they spread to others before the gods finally decide to cut them back? If they do spread, how many billions of lives will they end?
