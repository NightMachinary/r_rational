Is this /entire world/ nothing but a hellscape, exclusively controlled by the undead? All the natural beauty gone, all the plants and animals corrupted or dead, no other civilizations hanging on, deep in jungles or under the ground or under the sea? No innocent life /anywhere/?

Destroying an entire world, the cradle of life, the beautiful creation of the gods - this seems to me to be an evil act on a cosmic scale.
