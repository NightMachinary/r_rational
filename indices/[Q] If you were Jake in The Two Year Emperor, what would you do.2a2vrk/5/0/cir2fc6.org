The Eternal Hourglass seems like it should be utterly broken, but sadly it's not. It doesn't 'make a spell permanent', it casts Permanency. Permanency has a specific set of spells that it can effect, and most of the really interesting ones aren't on it. If I had written it the other way it would be /so/ abusable. I kinda regret that I didn't, but I think it might be a complete story-breaker.

There's no way to modify the set of cards in a DoMT, so you can't fill it with Balance (which would be cool). You can, however, just repeatedly shove a Helm of Opposite Alignment on the person until it works. HoOA is a one shot, though -- after it affects someone, it becomes non-magical.
