Permanency Tongues on everyone to allow all to understand everyone. Do magic items only have to be made, or can they be bought for I know of two ways to reduce the need for food water and sleep. Ion Stones, which can also stop the need for breathing too, and Rings of Sustenance. Also Feather Token, Trees would be great ways to have self defence options as well as offence for physical persons. With the permanency hourglass things like the huts and rope tricks can be made into lasting areas. Permanently cooling the water as well or keeping areas clean forever with prestidigitation and the Hourglass too. Can you make someone else draw from a Deck of Many things willed with only the The Card "Balance," to instantly turn without save the alignment of the Vampires and if you can manage it any of the Lich(Liches?)

Philosopher's Stone mixed with cure potions to easily cast true resurrection if you can make them/buy them.

Immovable Rods would be very helpful, as would Lordly Might would help for when you enter a Maze when tracking down the phylacteries. If you can create a powered up Rod of negation like you did for the Hourglass and Rule(Caster level 100, heh) it would also be a boon to use against the phylacteries.

That is all I can think up off the top of my head and by no means ideas that would be allowed by any way other than RAW, which is the whole reason for the story in the first place.
