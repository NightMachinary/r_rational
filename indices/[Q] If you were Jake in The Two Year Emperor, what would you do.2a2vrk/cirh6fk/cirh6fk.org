Leave.

I would leave.

Get everyone out and go somewhere else. This world is fucked and [[#s][bad things are happening.]] Go to another place, another world. Another plane, if you have to.

Did I miss a reason this isn't possible?

Look, I know the Planar Handbook wasn't in the resources list, but other planes clearly exist. They're in the Prime Material now. And it is apparently ruled by idiot gods with some serious issues.

So, leave. Jake's kidnappers wouldn't be happy unless they took everyone from their kingdom, but we've seen that /logistically/ it is possible to do. They could likely be talked into saving the people and not the literal land in this instance, especially after seeing the results of [[#s][other advanced people.]] Or figure out how to bottle entire cities, if that helps.

Point is, despite all their /wonderful/ speed-chess plans to fight back, there is still no known way to defend any country anymore. Easy attacks abound, ones their foes are clearly able to enact right now. There is also proof many, many others have failed in the same situation before. [[#s][Even worse stuff.]]

So leave, and find a better place to live, with [[#s][nicer stuff.]] Even if there isn't time to make such travel work, someone had to have done some world or plane hopping before. Find their stuff, unearth it, and play Stargate SG:1 until you find a gate that goes somewhere nice. Or at least [[#s][redacted.]] You don't even need your Omaga plan follow up. And we all knew what that was the moment he thought it up.

I would be in favor of this plan both as the person of Jake and as a member of a D&D adventuring party stuck in this situation.

*Woah!* Wait, stop the presses. I just read in another response that there are Planer Ring Gates. So...other methods have to exist. This is sounding better and better.

Either that, or run a quick ascension gambit so you can actually stand a chance of fighting back.

No, not on yourself -- you likely don't have the soul that would become godly in the first place. No, bootstrap /your executive assistant/. You know, someone with a good mind who's humble, moral, and actually seems to like you and wants to help. Forget [[#s][current plans.]]

If reality hands you lemons, make a goddess of lemonade.

Just do it fast enough. We know [[#s][they]] can't react faster than Jake can do stupid things, and at least then you'll have a new goddess to support you.

*tl;dr get the hell out of Dodge, or get into the god business as an early investor; or both.*
