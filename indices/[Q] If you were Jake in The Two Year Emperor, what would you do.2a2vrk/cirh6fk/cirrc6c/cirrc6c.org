"You don't even need your Omaga plan follow up. And we all knew what that was the moment he thought it up."

You, sir, are smarter than the average bear. I've already had several people ask what that plan was.

I really like the idea of ascending Suze, I just don't know how you would do it. Pun-Pun takes too long -- the gods would see as soon as you started the loop and show up to smack you. Conceivably the Omnifiscer, but I think that trick is bogus and I wouldn't allow it. Any thoughts?
