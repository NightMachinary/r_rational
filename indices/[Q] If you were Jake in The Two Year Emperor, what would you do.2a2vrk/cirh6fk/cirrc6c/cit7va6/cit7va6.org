Maybe I just read too much doomsday sci-fi. Didn't think Jake assumed planer travel was possible at the time, though. The idea I initially had was a suicide switch, some sort of “fuck the world” option. Means seemed obvious when I read that part, which to me is just good storytelling.

--------------

*edit some numbers wrong, doesn't matter had dragon

As for becoming a god, how that happens always depends on the story. I'm just going to go ahead and post the ideas I've got so far, as this is taking forever to work out in detail. This is really long.

There are some basics. You've gotta become at least a quasi-god or hero deity -- Divine Rank: zero. This is what people like Hercules, Perseus, or Theseus have. They are just /better/ than normal people and have some sort of divine nature, like a godly parent -- though that isn't listed as a requirement. The closest to a firm listed descriptor is that they /usually/ have at least one higher than mortal stat. Someone acquiring this basic divine nature is the only rules path I know of that doesn't involve direct and high-level godly intervention. And that seems...unlikely at this point. Wishing someone into hero deity status should be a last option, as that seems equally unsafe.

From reading the “rules”, such as they are, being /like/ a god in some way appears to be one firm part of being considered one. My take is, if you have stats that are literally godly, and you also do godly things, it should just slot into place if there is room “up above”, so to speak. That which is like a very minor goddess and does a very minor goddess' work, /is/ a very minor goddess, in other words. Worst case, you end up with a hero or champion who has literally inhuman stats.

Well, worse-worst case is, existing gods erase you from existence. But that shouldn't stop you at this point. There are already hints that ascension is very possible and the gods watch out for common world-breaking exploits to it, but this path isn't exactly cheating. Wishes might still help, though I wouldn't go there unless you're very, /very/ sure there are no better options.

--------------

There are two ways to go that I see. Max her level and look for divine boosters, or think outside the box.

First option, get Suze a class level, then powerlevel her. She has high INT (perfect memory?), so a wizard --and we can powerlevel those easy now. Done.

Finding something to light that spark of the divine is hard, but seems possible. Depends on DM approval, though there are several spots where the plot might imply ways to do this. Might be one of Secret's terrible secrets, even.

--------------

Or you decide to jump out of the box and start swinging around wildly. Then it is time to explore something that's been kind of thin on the ground: dragons. We've got a creepy mathful topographical dungeon now, but still no dragons. We need some, so might as well make our own.

Now, dragons have interesting stats. Physical are absurd, but this isn't a problem that can be solved by crushing with large size combat rules. No, I'm interested in their high mental stats, higher than any normal human. One might even say, on the way to godly.

Problem is, you don't get mental stats of something you ploy'd into. But if Suze can really become a dragon, even just a /little/, then she's got some chances to bootstrap into godhood. The best shot seems to be just to get her to be a /hatchling/ dragon, somehow, then artificially age her a *lot*. Dragons gain stats with age, not with class levels, and that includes much, much better mental scores. I'm not sure a poly'd dragon would count, but maybe it would in a strict reading of the rules (or lack of them). Otherwise, you could do something like wish to take the form of a hatchling dragon with your original mind in it's body, running and expanding along with it's brain. Or find or make magic item to do one of those strategies. It shouldn't be impossible to do.

It is important to mention again that the point of the aging is to use the dragon's natural mental progression to improve your own stats. For that to happen, you need to be a dragon to the extent that you improve like they do. That also means you need a way to age a dragon that makes it actually mature. By strict rules, this isn't training or “growing up” somehow. You hit the age, the dragon gets the stats. We'll take advantage of that.

--------------

I see two options for aging. If you can get a room with compressed time magic on it, maybe using some custom plane antics, and have dragon-Suze spend 1,200 years of relative time in it, great. Make sure she brings a book to read. If not, I think it is time to talk something like [[http://dndtools.eu/spells/complete-divine--56/bestow-curse-greater--729/][Greater Curse]].

This specific spell allows for custom curses that are no more powerful than those given as examples. Any sane DM wouldn't allow negative spells to have strictly positive effects. So clearly, it would be possible here, as we're only using the rules as written. Personally, I'd figure out a way to bake it into a magic item that ages people who activate it. Here's how I'd justify that working to my DM:

One of the set effects for Greater Curse is “one ability score is reduced to 1.” Permanently.

Now, “venerable” age gives a character +-3 (point reduction, not penalty) to the three physical stats and +1 to the three mental ones. That's a total of -6 points of stat changes. The curse effect is therefore twice as bad as the sum effect being applied to a single standard adventure's average stat (13).+ *edit wrong in a couple of ways, whatever. It is actually even more years with this methodology and the right numbers. Adulthood to venerable is 55 human years, so I'd round conservatively, and thematically, and say an equal Greater Curse effect is making a total of 100 years of human aging happen per cast to the target of the spell.

To get Suze to 1,200 years old (greater wyrm) would require only 12 casts. Very doable for an item, still doable otherwise. Do note that it is touch only, and would still have to be available in someone's spell collection. Seems like something /someone/ should know, even if your infodump didn't contain it.

But on the /other/ hand, if you can get some kind of Chamber of Maximum Learning going, all the better. Age her to 1,200 or so as quickly as possible in a compressed time field while she studies. I do not have rules for this, but it should be possible. No rules in core D&D for going mad from lonesomeness or isolation, so that isn't a worry. But really, give the woman some books. Lots of books.

Suze needs her own infodump, if at all possible. This would be a good time for that. Focus on stuffing that genius brain with secret knowledge from the looted temple, any spells and engineering secrets your new “friends” might have squirreled away, everything and anything. She'll have plenty of time to sort through it.

Then find even more magical ways to get more knowledge into her. Try jamming mass-scryed knowledge in there too; total information awareness seems godly. Get all possible divination and knowledge magic running full-time, pour it into her brain. Maybe instead of a revived goddess of Secrets, you can get a dragon goddess of Knowledge out of it. That hits the right checkboxes on the “rule of cool” list.

--------------

Through whatever methods, assume by this time that you've got something like Suze the “all naturally grown” gold great wyrm, with at least 30s for mental stats (more, if you let her advance from her human stats).

Now kill her.

Okay, maybe that was a little overly dramatic. You'd need to bring her back, obviously. I haven't worked out the best way to do this, but you need to get dragon-brained Suze into a real human body again. And I think a trip through the afterlife with increased intelligence on death might help thematically firm that up, so loss of natural intelligence doesn't occur.

Remember, the point is that having a dragon with dragon stats isn't special. Having a human with the same mental age-growth curve of a max age dragon is very, very special. One might even say, quasi-godly. The end goal is a 30s mental stats Suze as a human again, all ready to do epic things in the world to to support their claim to divinity. Then you can start to power level her with class levels, if you haven't already.

Getting “natural,” permanent ability scores that should normally be impossible for a mortal human (int, wis, and cha, in this case) is a good start, but you should also do a crazy hard task: like learning all the spells from two civilizations, diving into the secrets of a dead god, experimenting with how to make the best coffee in the multiverse (/It is by the coffee of Suze that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion./), something along those lines. If you set up a compressed time chamber, that'll push her in that direction already. If not, it might be time to get /really/ creative.

I know this all looks unlikely, but it is also thematically appropriate and could be done without drawing divine attention with any one act. Like wishing to be a dragon god. Well, maybe the time stuff, hard to call. We haven't heard of any dragon gods yet I think, so the position might be open, easing the way a bit.

Hell, I'm half convinced just from writing this that she's a moderately old gold dragon in disguise /right now/. Wouldn't /that/ be convenient for this plan.

--------------

Even if my ideas have huge, commonly dismissed holes in them, hopefully it'll help get the juices flowing. Looking forward to more chapters. Keep up the good writing.

*tl;dr dress for the god you want to be -- so become an ancient dragon, then turn back into a human and complete some heroic actions; time chambers to train under 10000x Earth's time are a good idea; Suze is totally a dragon already, isn't she?*
