Hmm. Thank you. Nothing too embarrassing, I hope. :)

Another question occurs to me: /players/. Jake's assumptions for this world are based on it being a RAW D&D 3.5 game world. Where do /players/ fit into this? Is he being played, by which I mean, his decisions made by an entity at a higher existential/dimensional level? Is anyone else? (Bonus points for addressing the mind-as-signal/brain-as-receiver model.)

This question may require high-strength psychedelics to explore, in character or out of character. ;)
