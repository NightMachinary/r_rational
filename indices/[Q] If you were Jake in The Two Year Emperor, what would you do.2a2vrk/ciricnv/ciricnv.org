I read the first ~30 chapters some time back. I haven't looked at the entire thing recently, so apologies if this duplicates stuff that's already happened.

I would personally go for an Ice Assassin Army.

[[https://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fw/20030124a][Ice Assassin]] (also in Frostburn) or Simulacrum Clone Armies. Anyone who can cast Ice Assassin (Wiz 9 spell) can make an evil clone of a target /under their complete control/. If the evil clone happens to be a clone of themselves, the high level caster who just cast ice assassin, well, the clone can cast the spells you can... including, say, /Ice Assassin/. Your army of one can expand indefinitely more-or-less. Simulacrum is similar but requires a higher level target because of the percentage stuff. For fueling the caster cost requirements, consider planeshift or balor mining.

Combat tactics: use mooks/summons carrying Dust of Sneezing and Choking (stuns for 5d4 rounds in an area, /no save/) backed up by infinite wizard armies. Start your attack by having some fraction of your wizard armies on another plane cast the spell /gate/ to summon in all of the leadership and high-level characters of the opposing army that you know of and force them to hand-roll tacquitos while you kill them, before your assault begins.
