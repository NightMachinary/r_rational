Should be awesome.

I remember reading about some historical thing. Some army had an excellent ways of beating their enemies. They'd invite all their enemy leaders to a peace conference, capture them or slaughter them, ransom them for wealth, buy a larger army. Rinse, repeat.

People with a silver tongue have done crazy things in our history. With dnd magic on your side? Well, your enemy is going to have to very quickly learn how to fail their listen checks.
