Big Booms:

1. Rods from God via linked linked gates in space. Lots and lots of of Rods from God.

1. Look at the /Teleport/ and /Gate/ spells for ways to relocate significant pieces of the sun into hostile territory (but do the math first) you want toasted hostile countries, not the earth analog turning into mercury or slipping into the elemental plane of fire.
