One thing no-one in this thread has suggested yet: Templates, the use and abuse of.

We've already covered a lot of the polymorph abuse, but I think that this is a big enough thing to bring up again.

There's no RAW restriction against polymorphing into a (deep breath) Half Celestial, Half Gold Dragon, Half Silver Dragon, Half Copper Dragon, Half Bronze Dragon, Half Amethyst Dragon, Half White Dragon, Half Black Dragon, Half Red Dragon, Half Blue Dragon, Half Black Dragon, Half Green Dragon, Half-Giant, Half-Troll, Half-Illithid, Ti-Khana, Chimeric, Tauric, Voidmind, Titanic, House Cat.

Sure, it doesn't have to be that absurd, but I think the idea of stacking all the half-dragon templates would be a great way to invite Tiamat and Bahamut to the party for a bit part. I have a hilarious mental image of Tiamat trying to facepalm but not having enough hands.
