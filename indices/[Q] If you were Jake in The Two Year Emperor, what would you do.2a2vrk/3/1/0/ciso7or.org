It would make a lot of sense to trick Jake out with some WIS and CHA boosts. I've deliberately not been doing it because it would make the story boring. Jake has two powers: "outside view of the RAW allows exploits" and "everyone must obey me because I'm the ruler and I'll have the Landguard kick your ass if you don't." His problems are: social and making mistakes (or succeeding but causing issues in the process).

INT boosts allow you to make bigger mistakes faster, and insult people more easily. WIS boosts make you make fewer mistakes, and CHA boosts let you manage social situations more smoothly. Boosting either WIS or CHA would (a) substantially change his character and (b) eliminate most of the problems he's facing.

As to why he's not doing it and no one is suggesting it...um...look! Shiny object!
