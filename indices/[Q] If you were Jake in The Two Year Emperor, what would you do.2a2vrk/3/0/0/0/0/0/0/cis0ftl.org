That's what multiplying up by 100 Symbols is for. The spell doesn't prescribe, so far as I can tell, a minimum surface area for the /Symbol/, merely that they are legible at 60ft, so you should be able to inscribe enough onto the surface of a single shield, which you then reveal at an appropriate time.

The idea behind using multiple of them, of course, is that natural 1s happen to everyone, if you give them enough chances.
