The /Symbol of Death/ slays unlimited amounts when subjected to a Permanency spell. A day's castings of level 8 spells is a small investment for making your base immune to creatures with less than 150 HP.

The note on Find the Path is true; that's why I paired it with Discern Location. However, on reading that spell's description I realised that you have to have touched the object so that's probably a no-go. You can, however, still choose targets like "the room where Afi keeps his phylactery" as valid choices for Find the Path, and then just throw out a Mage's Disjunction.

RE: Ioun Stones: I thought they were an item bonus. Never mind.
