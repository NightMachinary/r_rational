  Using Animate Object ... on the armour
#+end_quote

This creates a medium-sized Animated Object, which has just 31 HP. Making it out of adamantine gives it a hardness of 20, which acts as an impressive amount of damage reduction, but that's all it really has going for it. It can probably kill wights indefinitely though.

There's actually a much more powerful use of animated objects, which is seriously broken within actual game terms, but not within Two Year Emperor terms - the druid spell Awaken (only 5th level, to Animate Object's 6th) can turn trees into permanent Animated Objects with no size restriction. Any particularly large full-grown tree is colossal (the trees that come out of a feather token are just barely too small, and still gargantuan), which yields 256 HP and hardness 5 permanently for less investment.
