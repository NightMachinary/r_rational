- You can use the Hourglass to make permanent /Symbol of Death/ set to affect only undead creatures. (Attune them to Colborn so he doesn't get splatted.) Put the symbols on shields and have them activate on sight. If you have, say, 100 shields lining the entrance hall to Grofhamr, then even an undead that passes their save on everything except a natural 1 will be destroyed 95% of the time.
- They have access via merchants to infinite amounts of adamantine armour. Using /Animate Object/ and the Hourglass, then stacking /Hardening/ on the armour, create practically-indestructible shock troops. For bonus points, fill the armour with Celestial Brilliance Bouncy Balls of Doom. Or fill the armour with papers of /Explosive Runes/, and order it to get close to high-value targets and then break a necklace of fireballs/other item that will set off the /Explosive Runes/.
- Also cast Hardening and Animate Object on the Landguard's armour, with orders to get them out of combat once they're unconscious. This should hopefully preserve enough of their body that only a Raise Dead is needed rather than a full True Resurrection.
- Again with abusing the Hourglass ( :D ) you could give everyone in Grofhamr both /Invisibility/ and /See Invisible/ permanently, which seems like an advantage.
- Dust of Dryness as a bomb containing 100 gallons of holy water.
- An Ioun Stone of +Int seems useful. Maybe some +Wis items would also be good so that he has the insight to spot flaws in plans. A pale green Ioun Stone grants +1 on all ability checks, which includes Knowledge (Tactics).
- 48 /lyres of building/ make any fortification impenetrable.
- Combine /Discern Location/ and /Find the Path/ to get a route to Afi's phylactery that bypasses all of his traps.
