How about finding a way to experimentally determine if someone is a PC or an NPC? I know that Diplomacy doesn't work on PCs in RAW, but I'm not well versed enough in the RAW to find a more reliable way to find them from an in-universe perspective.

Once you have a confirmed PC, you've got another counter to Diplomancy cheese, and the chance of actually having a communication line to the outside.

I've got this wierd vision of some bard being a PC, and using Pinkie Pie-esque references to give coded messages which slip past the OOC filter.
