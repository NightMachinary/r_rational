Unfortunately it still doesn't solve the fact that any Ice Assassin more than a mile from you starts bending all of its (equal to your own!) intelligence to ways to achieve its original (you)'s death.

EDIT: On rereading the spell it's a bit ambiguous as to whether or not it continues following your orders once it's out of range.
