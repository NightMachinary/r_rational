It says that "you have no direct control over it." That seems to imply that you do have INdirect control -- that it continues to follow orders. If your first order to it is "always obey my commands, serve me loyally, and, if you're not clear on what my command means or what action to take, do whatever is in my best interest"...well, you're in pretty good shape. (And yes, this is TOTALLY abusing the rules.)
