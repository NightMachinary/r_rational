Possibly the most broken magic item in the entire game is the Thought Bottle. The TB lets you pay 500 XP for save point on your XP; when you use the save point your current XP is set to N, where N is the number of XP you had after paying for the save point. (So, you're at 3000, you pay for a save point, you can now restore to 2500 whenever you like.) I believe a given save point only works once.

So, let's say you are 7000 XP above your level requirement. Get yourself, say, 3 TBs (A, B, and C) and do the following:

A: save (can now restore to 6500 XP) B: save (can now restore to 6000 XP) C: save (can now restore to 5500 XP)

You now have 5500 XP to play with. Cast Ice Assassin (IA). Reset bottle C, take a new save point. Cast IA. Reset bottle B. Etc

You can end up casting a truly ridiculous number of these things for a grand total of 500 XP. And don't forget that each IA is a duplicate of you, including your experience total. Give them each some thought bottles and let them go crazy as well.
