The Diplomancer build relies on feats, which I'm mostly not using. I realize this is a pretty major section of the rules to leave out, but it prevents a lot of abuses and/or gamebreakers like this one. Also, feats upset my 2nd-edition-trained brain.

More generally, though: the Diplomancer, Pun-Pun, and the Omnificer all share the same problem -- they are relatively easy to pull off, and then the story is over. The Omnificer I handle by saying "I don't agree that it works" (which is true). Pun-Pun I handle by saying "running the loops takes quite a few rounds; the gods would show up and smack you before you got too far out of control."

The Diplomancer definitely works, and it can be built up to slowly enough that the gods probably wouldn't notice until you were already doing it. Arguably, if they used their divine power to observe you doing your jump, they would be affected even if they weren't there. So, yes, it's an entirely doable worldbreaker. And that's part of why I don't use feats.
