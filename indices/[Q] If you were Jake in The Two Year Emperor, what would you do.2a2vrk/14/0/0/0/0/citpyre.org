I reread the diplomacy skill description.

"Bluff, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), or Sense Motive"

There's actually three skills that you can put points in to get a cross skill bonus, so you can get 2 extra points. That means that with this no feat build you can upon rolling a natural 1 convert any group in one full round action to be friendly (chatting and offering advice) to you, and on a 1, burning your special power, convert them to be helpful (fighting by your side).

You can also drop one level because of that if you want, making the super diplomacer a bit faster to build.
