The heavier abuse ones rely on feats, but you can get reasonably powerful effects even without them.

For example, you can create a magical item with a 30+ skill bonus for just around 90k gold. Takes 90 days. 100*skillbonus^{2} A 5+ bonus takes 2.5 days. I'd probably get a number of magical craftspeople to make a variety of those for the near future, with different bonuses. You may well be able to acquire a cloak of diplomacy or such of 5+.

So, level 10 half elf cleric. No feats. 16 charisma, 5+ from wishes, 2 from level ups, 5+ from a magical item of charisma, total 28 bonus 14+. 13 skill points spent on diplomacy, 4+ from synergies, one 5+ item. 22 skills, total bonus 36. They cast visage of the deity, giving themselves a 4+ bonus to charisma. Cast divine insight on self, 15+ bonus to one skill check. Have some cast greater heroism on you, giving you a 4+ skill bonus. You now have a skill of 42, or 57 in a pinch. On a 3 you can convert any group in one full round action to be friendly to you, with visage of the deity you can with a 3 convert any enemy to be helpful to you in a standard edit full action. This power would get far worse as you got stronger diplomacy items. If our emperor had a 30+ item and a 5+ charisma bonus then he could convert any hostile enemy, including a god, to be friendly to him with no roll needed.

Is it abusive? Not much more than antimatter, I'd argue. It's a way of instant killing a group of people with less range and lower requirements. It could help a lot in mass conversions. And it's really not that hard, even without feats, to get a decent bonus.
