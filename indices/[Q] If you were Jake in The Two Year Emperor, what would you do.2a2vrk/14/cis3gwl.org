I'd use diplomacy bombs. If you get the skill up reasonably high (which shouldn't be too hard with monster training arenas) you can relatively quickly do mass conversions of the liches. To convert an enemy who is hostile to you and trying to kill you to a friendly person who will fight on your behalf requires a roll of 60. To convert them to fanatical requires a roll of 160.

In the long run I'd be trying to make some sort of build like this, where when the person jumps anyone who observes them instantly becomes a fanatical follower. This works just as well on gods, incidentally. If they observe me they are then fanatical followers because my unit's jump was so awesome.

Still, even without that extreme measure, diplomacy wins the game. Mass mind control of any sentient being. You could take measures to limit it's effectiveness, like blocking your hearing, but generally diplomacy is very effective.

A potion of glibness is pretty good too, since it lets a character with good bluff rewrite reality.
