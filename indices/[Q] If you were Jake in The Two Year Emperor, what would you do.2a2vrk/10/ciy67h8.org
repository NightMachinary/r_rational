/Blasphemy///Holy Word///Word of Chaos///Dictum/ instagib everything around you that's 10 or more hit dice behind your caster level. No save. Caster levels are hilariously easy to increase: Orange Ioun Stones give an untyped bonus to caster level. Stack up Orange Ioun Stones until your caster level is in the low hundreds, then walk up to $target and cast an appropriate /Word/. Boom. Even works on Undead!

--------------

Craft Contingent Spell lets you set any spell you know to be cast on a near-arbitrary trigger. For example, you can trigger a /Celerity/ for whenever combat starts, ensuring you never lose initiative ever again. Or you can trigger an /Atonement/ whenever you have to use /Blasphemy/ while you're Good, so that you can use your /Word/s without having to worry about your alignment. Or, for that matter, you could just set a /Word/ to go off whenever a high-level undead is within the AoE. Cast /Heal/s whenever you're at low health. Cast /Delay Death/ whenever you're about to die.

--------------

/Magic Mouth/ can trigger off arbitrarily complex audible signals. It can produce audible signals. /Magic Mouths/ can trigger each other. Build a computer.

--------------

Things which have had /Temporal Stasis/ cast on them are completely invulnerable modulo /Dispel Magic/. Use /Animate Object/ to animate a giant folded-up tarp, have the animated tarp origami itself into a castle, /Temporal Stasis/ your new castle. Or door. Or helmet. Whatever.

Quintessence is similarly fun.

--------------

If you want mechanical energy, /Heat Metal/ when cast underwater instantly boils all of the water nearby. An acre or two of chicken wire could easily power a gigawatt-range reactor. If you don't want to go through the trouble of electrical generation, just use a ring gate to connect your fuck-off-huge steam turbine to your load through a /Temporal Stasis/'d shaft. Side note: when you're doing stuff like this, it's much easier to build open-cycle systems using Decanters on the input side and /Dispel Water/ or Spheres of Annihilation on the output side.

--------------

.../Goodberry/. How the hell did everybody forget /Goodberry/. A single command-word item of it, at maximum throughput, can permanently feed 10k people. And berries are way more tasty and logistically convenient than protein sludge.

--------------

/Major Creation/ can make just about anything you want. Including "rare metals" and other odd stuff. It's temporary - one round per level - but it significantly lowers the level requirement for antimatter bombing runs. Other fun things to create: Hydrazine (fuck you, Tsiolkovsky), enriched uranium (what happens to fission and activation products when the original uranium goes away?), 10 cubic feet of photons (IMMA CHARGIN MAH LAZOR).

--------------

You can make any spell into a trap. Traps can be reusable, auto-resetting, and - most importantly - auto-/casting/. Give them super-low search, avoid, disarm DCs and so on, and your magic items now cost a thousandth as much XP. And take a thousandth the time to craft. And don't require people to stand there and set them off. Even better, if you've built yourself a /Magic Mouth/ computer, you can use traps for physical I/O.

--------------

If there are /any/ infinite planes /anywhere/ in the multiverse, you can use /Planar Binding/ to summon /whatever you want/. Because no matter how small the measure of your target being is, if it's nonzero (and, in DND terms, "nonzero measure" means "you can build it as a character, the build is the story") there's a concrete instance out there somewhere for you to summon. Have fun!
