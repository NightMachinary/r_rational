Sepulchral was identified in Chapter 7 as the former High Lady Mirembe. Cat at least thinks it's possible that she's being backed/used by the Black Knight in his campaign against Malicia, since he hasn't made much else in the way of overt attacks.

I think the time skip was three months, which was enough time for the fallout of the diplomatic conference at the end of the last book to settle in and shake things up a little.
