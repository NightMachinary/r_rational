On a different note than the other comments you've received, I'm actually liking this a lot. I'm only a handful of chapters in, but I like stories with this level of research behind them, with a competent MC.

The lack of conflict actually makes it unique in tone and it can be perceived as dryness, but I actually find that it leaves time for more interesting developments.

Thanks for the suggestion!
