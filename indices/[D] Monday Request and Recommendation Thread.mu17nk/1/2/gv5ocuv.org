Only Villains Do That was an interesting read. Let me be clear---I agree with everything you said and unreservedly recommend it. I enjoyed The Gods Are Bastards, and expect to have a good time following Webb's new work. The plot is more original than you might expect---it's not the first time someone has done a villain/morally ambiguous isekai or a secondary isekai, but not only does Webb spin it their own way, the other novel elements they peppers into the setting and the plot add up to create an incredibly refreshing experience in a somewhat oversaturated genre.

However, I can't help but think it feels a lot like Webb is writing for their audience this time around. There are some patterns in the work come across as distinctly Royal-Roadlike, which isn't a bad thing, and doesn't necessarily detract from the quality or my enjoyment of the work.

One of the most glaring ones to me is the use of physical and sexual violence against women as a recurring plot device. One of the first things the protagonist does is become offended when he sees a group of bandits keeping a woman prisoner, defeat said bandits, hand the woman a weapon and allow her to enact vigilante justice upon her would-be rapists. Later on, he bribes a Watch captain to prevent some women from being raped in jail. There's an almost explicit implication that the protagonist perceives harm done to women as being more morally consequential than harm done to men. The first unambiguously bad action the protagonist does involves lighting a woman on fire.

The recent Worth the Candle batch is very relevant here, I think, and perhaps what drove me to notice this:

  “Raven is wondering why it's always women, which Juniper feels defensive about, and would deflect on, which would risk escalation of conflict. In fact, Juniper knows why it's always women, which is that he personally finds it more shocking and horrible when bad things happen to women, especially if there's some element of sexuality involved. He recognizes this as being inherently unfair to both women and men, but his efforts to reframe his view of the world have so far failed, and in his opinion, so long as his actions don't reflect that bias too badly, he's not going to worry about it. There's some unresolved guilt there though.”

So much of the story revolves around harm being done to women, harm being prevented against women, and aid being offered to women. It's gratuitous, and comes across as Webb feeding an audience that eats up stuff like this. Righteous indignation at threats of rape. Hero fantasies of saving waifus from terrible fates. I'm sure there are people more versed in the discourse that can explain this better than me.

And yet they manage to keep it all tasteful. Nothing is played out in graphic detail solely for the shock value. No women falling over themselves to praise the main character for his magnanimity or fighting over his affections. The woman he rescued at the start of the story pivots into becoming a useful party member rather than a generic love interest tease. The hardships described are realistic, and the characters in the story respond to them in realistic ways. Everyone in the story comes across as a rational actor. There are no waifus or harems, only tight plot, excellent characters and creative worldbuilding.

Basically, Only Villains Do That feels designed to appeal to the Royal Road audience by smelling like wish fulfillment and weird pseudo-misogyny, yet at the same time work with the sensibilities of the more traditional web serial audience (Worm, PGtE, Wandering Inn, TGaB, etc.) by /not actually being a weird pseudo-misogynistic hero fantasy/, just vaguely pushing the same buttons while being a perfectly rational and respectful story.

It mostly sticks out because it's a departure from The Gods are Bastards, which I've seen being criticized for coming across too strong with its feminist elements and being SJW soapbox. A criticism I disagree with, by the way, because usually they're talking about Trissiny at the start of TGaB, and that's just part of her character. But it drives home the juxtaposition of what reading The Gods are Bastards felt like and what reading Only Villains Do That feels like.

Once again, I really do like OVDT. Great story, great author. This isn't really a criticism, only a weird observation. I don't know if Webb is intentionally writing for an audience, or if it's just how it came out when he sat down and wrote a portal fantasy to a borderline grimdark world with all the harsh realities that entails, as opposed to a fantasy Western setting with a militant feminist cult as one of the dominant world religions.

I would talk about the arguable queerbaiting when Seiji in a fit of desperation tries to cast a spell on another man that makes the caster appear irresistibly sexy to the target until they fuck, but Webb gets a pass on that one because it's actually hilarious.
