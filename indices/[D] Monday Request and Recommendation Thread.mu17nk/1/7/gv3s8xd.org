W.r.t. "A Practical Guide to Sorcery" I guess one problem is that it has a "Gender Bender" tag which can be an indication for a bad fic (it's pretty hard to do the topic justice and often can be just left out). I wouldn't categorize a "Song of the Lioness" setup as a Gender Bender either.

And w.r.t. underrated. The litrpg "Gods of Blood and Bone" and sequels ([[https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Azalea-Ellis-ebook/dp/B012CLCCAK][amazon]]) by the same author is pretty good. It has YA elements, but it's better than other YA books. Idk why it isn't more successful.
