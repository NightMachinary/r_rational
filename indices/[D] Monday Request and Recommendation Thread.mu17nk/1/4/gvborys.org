I de-rec /Only Villains Do That/.

As [[/u/jiffyjuff]] mentioned, "So much of the story revolves around harm being done to women, harm being prevented against women, and aid being offered to women." However, I disagree that the author manages to keep things tasteful by omitting exact details. It's a recurring plot device that reeks of masculine white knighthood, robbing female characters of agency.

The female bodyguard? Saved from rape and empowered solely by MC's whims.

The women in the opposing adventuring party? Saved from rape solely by MC's whims.

And don't forget the helpless prostitutes in the red light district who are the only mass recipients of MC's freely spammable, ultra-powerful heal, or the goblin women who (ineffectively, because MC is too good for that) use sex appeal as their primary bargaining chip.

The author/MC seems to view sexual harm and rape as completely different from physical harm, which makes the whole toxic masculinity thing worse in my eyes. Repeatedly burning people until they're on the brink of death and then healing them so you can do it again? MC thinks that's acceptable to accomplish his purposes. Rape with minimal physical harm? Noooo, women are delicate flowers and must be put on a pedestal where they will not be deflowered.

Additionally the main character is an irrational Marty Stu that doesn't try to make the most of his abilities, doesn't stay true to his characterization as a selfish prick, and doesn't rationally pursue his supposedly primary goal of getting revenge on the Evil Goddess that forced him to become the dark lord (like, maybe by teaming up with the Hero, who seems to think that MC is a pretty swell guy). You want to get revenge against the Evil Goddess? How about joining the Hero, or becoming a Healer, or spamming Heal+Slime to create a tidal wave of healing slimes to help the world, or visiting any of the dungeons to get more magic and make an actual difference?
