From what I remember of Savage Divinity, it's technically well-written and has a bit of rational bent. However, it's also a harem story, and has a lot of the negative traits emblematic of the genre. I don't remember enough to point out specific points, but I remember feeling squicked out and eventually dropping the story. Blue Core didn't annoy me as much as Savage Divinity, and it's literally about a sex dungeon. (I eventually dropped that to, but because I lost interest, not because of the harem.)
