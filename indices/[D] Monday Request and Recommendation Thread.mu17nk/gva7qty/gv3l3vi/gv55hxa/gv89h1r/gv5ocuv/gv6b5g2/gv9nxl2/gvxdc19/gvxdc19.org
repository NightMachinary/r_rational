  It mostly sticks out because it's a departure from The Gods are Bastards, which I've seen being criticized for coming across too strong with its feminist elements and being SJW soapbox. A criticism I disagree with, by the way, because usually they're talking about Trissiny at the start of TGaB, and that's just part of her character.

You know, I never really got a SJW soapbox feeling from early Trissiny. I got more of a soapbox feeling from later portrayals of the Thieves Guild. It felt like they got more and more suish. Whether "all systems are corrupt" is SJW or not... I don't have strong feelings either way.
