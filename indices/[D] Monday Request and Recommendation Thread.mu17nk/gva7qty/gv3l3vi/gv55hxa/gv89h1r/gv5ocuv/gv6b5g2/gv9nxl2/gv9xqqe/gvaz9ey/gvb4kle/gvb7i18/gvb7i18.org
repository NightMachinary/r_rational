Huh. I didn't find the harem aspects of Savage Divinity particularly problematic. As far as I can tell, the MC treats his wives well and they are more than pointless eye candy for filling the harem.

What annoys me is the glacially slow pacing and pointless introspection. Most chapters spend at least half of their word count in the mind of the viewpoint character showing how they react or consider different characters and situations. And even then a lot of the thoughts are repeated thoughts that the character often has, such as how fluffy and cute a pet is.

I'm just venting about Savage Divinity now because I've had these greviances for a while now.

I read Blue Core as well, and I've also mostly lost interest at this point. I binged up through 200+ chapters but can't find the motivation to check for updates more than once a month. Too much time spent describing Sim City gameplay and not enough on the interesting characters in the world.
