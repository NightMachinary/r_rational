Ah, I forgot about the boob armour thing.

Yes, a lot of things can be ascribed to the setting and goddess interference. But that's just the brilliance of it---it's all plausibly deniable. It's like a superposition of two stories, one that's slightly-better-than-standard isekai trash with creative worldbuilding but questionable overtones, and another story that's an interesting metanarrative/deconstruction about a sensible protagonist reacting to an isekai trash world with isekai trash plot contrivances. The protagonist occupies an ill-defined character space that allows both white knight harem fantasy fans and rational/rational-adjacent fiction fans to project their values onto him.

In fact, even within the rational genre, the protagonist manages to simultaneously come across as "hypercompetent uplift SI that's smarter than everyone but the world contrives to oppose him and cast him as evil because they don't understand his sheer brilliance", and "person with flaws just doing his best and making difficult decisions, sometimes making mistakes".

I'm not mad, just impressed. And slightly weirded out.

But I trust Webb---TGaB is one of the most explicitly socially progressive web fiction works I've read, with excellent queer and female representation in characters with real agency, traits and compelling stories. While I'm not going to expect Only Villains Do That to have any gay kissing (except of the lesbian variety, because MLM is ew and WLW is hot) because RoyalRoad readers are allergic to that kind of thing, I trust the story not to go full Savage Divinity on us. If we get a neat arc about isekai tropes being enforced by narrative contrivance, all the better. Regardless, I'll keep reading.
