Hm, perhaps I might have judged it a bit too harshly? I don't know. It's not that much about what actually happens, but rather the male-gaziness of the whole thing. I don't think I can be trusted to give an objective opinion, because anything I say is going to be skewed by the fact that it's a harem story. I'm not going to say that harems are intrinsically problematic, but in practice they tend to be, and they tend to appeal to fantasies fundamentally rooted in sexist thought and objectification even if the author manages to not be sexist or objectify their female characters. More relevantly, harems certainly make /me/ personally feel uncomfortable. So I'm not the person to ask about SD.
