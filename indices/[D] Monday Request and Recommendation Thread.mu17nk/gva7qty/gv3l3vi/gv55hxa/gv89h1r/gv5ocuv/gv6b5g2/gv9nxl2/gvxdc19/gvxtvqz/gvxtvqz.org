If I didn't make it clear, I /don't/ think any parts of TGaB is soapboxy. The Thieves Guild I think isn't really something that can be criticized because it's just what the Thieves' Guild is characterized as. Their philosophies get free reign because the only people in on their doctrine is people who are in the Guild, and people in the Thieves Guild are going to be proponents of their own doctrine, especially when it's something as nebulous and unfalsifiable as "all systems are corrupt". I never got the feeling that Eserion was meant to be "best cult", and in fact we get plenty of examples of the Guild failing to live up to its own hype, mostly by basically becoming a system itself.

It's somewhat comparable to real-life communism, which can be talked up academically, but tends to fall short in implementation, or anarchism, or objectivism---the platonic concept of Eserite doctrine is unchallenged because it's impossible to implement on a large scale in reality, and any time the Guild tries to do anything and fails they say it's just because the Boss wasn't good enough at being Eserite, because a /real/ Eserite wouldn't try to do anything organized and meaningful. We just sit around and react to people we think are getting uppity! It's the ultimate feel-good philosophy, because you get to act self-righteous about tearing down the people on top, but when you get questioned about what exactly the point of all of this is, what positive change you're ultimately trying to effect in the world, and what those people are doing over there, hey stop that, you just shrug and say, "I dunno, that sounds like a system, and you know what they say about systems?"

(Note that I don't remember much from TGaB proper, because Trissiny's Guild arc was a while ago, as was the last TGaB update :( so correct me if I'm misrepresenting the Guild here.)
