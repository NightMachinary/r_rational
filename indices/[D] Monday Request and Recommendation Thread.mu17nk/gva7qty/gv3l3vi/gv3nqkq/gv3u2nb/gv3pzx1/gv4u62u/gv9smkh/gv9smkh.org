I remember enjoying [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12606073/1/Service-with-a-Smile][Service With a Smile]], a literal coffee shop AU of RWBY where Jaune, instead of getting into huntsman school, opens a coffee shop, and slowly the other main characters start appearing. It's quite long though, and not exactly deep literature (or Rational), but Coeur Al'Aran is a fairly decent writer.
