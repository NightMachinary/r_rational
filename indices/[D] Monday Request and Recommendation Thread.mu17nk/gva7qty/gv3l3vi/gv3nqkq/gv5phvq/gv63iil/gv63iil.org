I linked that in a previous thread, so it might have been that, but it's also totally possible you got it from somewhere else. Outside of that one, there's not a ton of good CG Fanfic, but I'll offer what I can.

There's a lot of popcorny Peggy Sues that are my guilty pleasures. I don't know of any I would consider really /good/, per se, but if you want content and have a decent tolerance for them I can link them.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/semper-ad-meliora-code-geass-britannian-royalty-quest.55535/][Semper Ad Meliora]] Somewhat indulgent, but the writing quality really is excellent and that makes up for a lot. Very ambitious AU setting but makes it work.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/code-geass-the-shattered-mosaic.55873/][The Shattered Mosaic]] What-if AU from near the end of Season 1. Irregular updates but it's still active (it's updated recently, just not on a set schedule) with interesting premise, solid writing, and isn't a rehash of canon or other fanfics.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/one-and-only-son-code-geass-gundam-00.807280/][One and Only Son]] Crossover with Gundam; I'm not familiar with Gundam, so I can't give as much context here as I'd like, but I am a fan of the author's other CG work.

There's also this one DxD crossover on QQ, which is like the SaM but more so in terms of setting indulgence but like SaM it makes up for a good bit of that by being well written. SFW thus far despite being on QQ, but I don't know of any other site it can be read on so :shrug:.
