I would like to recommend [[https://storiesonline.net/s/63138:104648/magestic-part-1][Magestic]]. It's pretty under-read and definitely underrated.

The protagonist meets a man sent back in time to prevent a world-ending disaster who has been sending letters to world leaders to forewarn them of smaller incident to build his credibility. Starts off with him trading the stock market but it snowballs fairly quickly.

It ticks a lot of boxes for me --- I really like the civilisation-building genre and the author has clearly done his research and gets it all mostly right about the military and disaster relief. He goes into a lot of detail about Africa too, which I really enjoy. His views on China and Russia are a bit too charitable, but it was written about 10 years ago. But still, I really recommend checking it out.
