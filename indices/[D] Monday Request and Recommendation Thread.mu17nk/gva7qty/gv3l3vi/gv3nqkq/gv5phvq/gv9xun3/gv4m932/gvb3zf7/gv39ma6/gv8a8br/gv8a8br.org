Have you ever hate-read a web serial?

Abyssal Road Trip is really, really badly written. (Almost) everything about the technical execution of the writing is bad. The list of things wrong with it is longer than I have patience to enumerate.

And yet I read it anyway, because ... I don't even know why! I wanted to see where the story goes? I like some of the characters? I wanted characters I don't like to get their comeuppance? Fuck, I don't know. I hate myself for reading it, I hate it for making me read it, THANKS I HATE IT.

I'd vaguely consider it rational fiction; the characters use their abilities in interesting and creative ways, characters all have their own motivations that aren't necessarily revolving around the MC, the character is or at least grows to be introspective/meta-cognitive to some extent.

Ugh. I'm so mad that this story is so badly written.

(For context I think it's worse-written than Azarinth Healer but not as bad as Magical Smithing.)
