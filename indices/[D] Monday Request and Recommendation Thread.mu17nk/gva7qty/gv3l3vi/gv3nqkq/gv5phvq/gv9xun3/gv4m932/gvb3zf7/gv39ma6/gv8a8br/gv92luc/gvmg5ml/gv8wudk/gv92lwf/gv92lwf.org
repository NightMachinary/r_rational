I keep starting other things, and then I finish them, and then I go read the backlog of Abyssal Road Trip because apparently I hate myself and I hate the universe.

In all seriousness, I like the story that is almost entirely buried by the flaws in the writing enough to keep reading it. Besides, I read just about anything. I even still read Delve! /rimshot/
