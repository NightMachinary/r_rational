It looks like a symptom of too much free time imho.

​

Entertainment at the end of the day is a tool, if at any point it starts taking control of you or being detrimental it probably needs to be looked at and fixed.

​

I understand it though, addiction is hard to deal with, if what you suffer from is at that point already I'm sorry for you and wish you good luck.
