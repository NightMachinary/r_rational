Today, I read the fourth book in Becky Chambers's Wayfarers series, "The Galaxy and the Ground Within".

I adore this series. I am a complete sucker for hard/hard-ish SF soft-utopias with all of their "yes this is still a problem"s and their "but through collective action and thinking very hard about what the right solution is we can probably solve it". I love that she doesn't pull the punches with the kinds of problems that kind of society is bad at dealing with, and I love that she doesn't fail to highlight all of the ways that kind of society would be wonderful.

I want to hug all of the people in this story and then make them cake. Very carefully, because they're none of them humans and all have conflicting dietary needs, obviously.
