Fringe is pretty good, though the first few seasons are a bit too episodic/monster of the week by contemporary standards. Like X Files, basically. John Noble is a highlight, magnificent actor.

Raised by Wolves isn't really alternate dimensions(at least not yet), but it feels like it. Years ago I joked with a friend that "everything is either a penis metaphor or a motherhood metaphor" with Ridley Scott's movies, and then this show came out and proved me absolutely right, hahah. I still recommend it though.
