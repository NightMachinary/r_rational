/Youjo Senki/, a LN/manga where a 21st century Japanese businessman gets transported to an alternate world that is loosely based off of early 20th century Earth, and reincarnated into the body of a young girl at the outset of the Great War.

/A Young Girl's Political Record/ is a fanfic/sequel of Youjo Senki. I really enjoyed it and its alt-history. I did find the ending a bit rushed, and the promised epilogue has yet to be written (though half of the last chapter kinda fits that), but overall it was a fun read. I've seen some complaints that it whitewashes Germany/nazis, but I didn't really get that impression, since the MC isn't Hitler and has no interest in being a successful version of him.
