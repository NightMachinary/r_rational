I used to love cradle, but now I mostly hate read it.\\
tl;dr: no time for conversations or characterization, only exposition and banter while fighting/resting from fighting/preparing for fighting.

Same with Savage Divinity, I hate read it for a while until it got too much for me.\\
tl;dr: pet harem

Delve, definitely. Together with Savage Divinity it's one of the few stories where my hatred for it bled over into dislike for the author.\\
tl;dr: have you ever wished for magic powers and an eidetic memory so you could regurgitate pop culture references at a captive audience?

I don't hate He Who Fights With Monsters, but I don't really like it either. I dislike-skim it occasionally if I have nothing better to do.\\
tl;dr: Dunning--Kruger + chuunibyou + auras

Magic Smithing - The fact that the MC is a guy from our world that gets transmigrated into a girl's body in another world, but neither is going to ever factor into the plot, not even in the MC's inner monologue or minor actions... why? Why even include it if it's just a non-factor that he used to be a guy from a modern era?!\\
tl;dr: /tears hair/
