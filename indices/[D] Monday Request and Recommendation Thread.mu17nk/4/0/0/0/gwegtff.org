I guess I assumed the show is a product of human imagination and the decision to end the girl's story in the first season and make the series an an anthology was a considered choice, and thus malleable.

Do you have a reason to believe the show is instead somehow contractually committed to a faithful retelling of the real life events that happened in a train-shaped purgatory?
