There's a season or two of /Marvel's Agents of Shield/ where they infiltrate an alternate reality where Hydra won WWII and the cast has to deal with their Nazi-doubles. Not super rational, but an underrated show in my opinion.

Similarly, although I've only watched bits and pieces, the recent Star Trek show, /Discovery/, also has characters interacting with alternate universe versions of themselves (who are also evil human-supremacists). iirc, the most recent season plays mostly in the evil-alternate reality.
