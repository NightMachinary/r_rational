I enjoyed the TV series Counterpart, about a Cold War between two nearly identical alternate universes.

Does anyone have recommendations for other science fiction or fantasy with alternate dimension travel? Some other examples are Charles Stross' Merchant Princes/ Dark State Series, Terry Pratchett's Long Earth Series, etc..
