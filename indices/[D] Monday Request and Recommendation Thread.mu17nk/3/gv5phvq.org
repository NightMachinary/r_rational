Any good Code Geass fanfictions? I've recently been reading a lot of it, because the world is pretty interesting, and I enjoy the characters.\\
The original anime wasn't really rational, though it was more than most. It feels like an interesting world to do some form of rational main-character in.\\
The only Code Geass fanfiction I'd rec out of what I've read so far [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870721/1/Kallen-Stadtfeld-Countess-of-Britannia][Kallen Stadtfeld, Countess of Britannia]] (was this linked in a previous thread? I forget where I found it..), but I wouldn't really consider it rational, just higher quality.
