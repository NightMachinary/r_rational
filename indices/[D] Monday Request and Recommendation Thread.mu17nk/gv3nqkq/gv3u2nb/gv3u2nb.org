I've decided a Blindsight college AU would involve the human cast as professors trying to grade some essays written by a student that almost seem to make sense and discuss advanced concepts, but have weird consistency errors. They email the student about it and get replies that have the same odd mistakes. One of the professors accuses them of being a Chinese room added to the course as a prank by other professors, and fails them for his course, but then later finds out that the student really exists! Eventually the professors discover the student is a genius at writing deep learning algorithms but so lazy that they never put any conscious thought into the coursework and generated all their responses using an improved version of GPT-3. Meanwhile, the student perceives any attempt to make them think critically or be conscious during class time as an attack, and the student protects himself by submitting terrible reviews about each of the professors at the end of the course. “The professor is insane and deliberately confuses the students talking about nonsense. Terrible class and a waste of time!”
