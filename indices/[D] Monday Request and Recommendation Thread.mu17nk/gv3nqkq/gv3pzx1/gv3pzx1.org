Let me introduce you to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13796073/chapters/31715919][Life Bends Down]], a Worm no-powers college AU featuring the Cauldron cast. It's not representative of the genre, because it's more of a well-meaning satire of the College AU, deriving humor from the juxtaposition of placing some of Worm's most morally questionable characters into a "light-hearted" setting. Extremely verbose, introspective and technical, which is half of the irony.

I've read quite a few coffee shop fics, but usually they're AUs that happen to be staged in a coffee shop rather than a story who's premise is "coffee shop". One more common example is using it for secret identity gimmicks, where the core humor is the clueless coffee shop worker (or service worker in general) interacting with someone with a Secretâ„¢. Unfortunately, I can't remember any off the top of my head.

I have only read one or two college AUs, and they're the same thing. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2447843][Hemingway Can Suck It]] is a good one, though strictly one might classify it as an /academia/ AU.

(You probably already know, but you should be aware that such AUs are mostly about shipping, and, at least for AO3, mostly gay pairings.)
