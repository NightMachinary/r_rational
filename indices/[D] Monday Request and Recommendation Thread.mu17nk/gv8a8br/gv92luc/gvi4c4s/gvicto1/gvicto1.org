In the last book there were like 10+ PoV characters in a 90k word book. To the point where the much anticipated reunion of Lindon with his family was them exchanging like 30 words of superficial dialogue with each with each other. Same for the comeuppance with his clan, another 30 words of dialogue.

Speaking of which! A proper writer would have actually up set up the betrayal by reminding us of these characters that were first introduced 9 books ago. /Anything at all/ to make it resonate emotionally! Instead it falls absolutely flat because these are all just cardboard cutouts instead of characters, with feelings and motivations that are completely opaque to the reader. Blergh.
