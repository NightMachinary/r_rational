  To his credit, the author tried to do a mini arc with each of those subplots.

Honestly, it didn't even seem like he tried to that, to me. It seemed like he /set that up/, and then never bothered to go back to it. I was honesty kind of confused when the kaiju showed up and not one of these threads had been picked up again. It felt like the book was rushed, for no particular reason.
