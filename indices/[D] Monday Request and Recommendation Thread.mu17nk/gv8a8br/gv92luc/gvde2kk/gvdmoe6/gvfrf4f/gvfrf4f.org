Many early access chapters are where the money is. Magic Smithing is written well enough that people read up to the current chapter and then see that they /could/ read another whopping 25 chapters for just a couple bucks.

This changes the transaction from "I want to support the author" to "I want to pay money so I can read more" which is more profitable/attracts more patrons
