There's such a thing in fanfiction as Coffee Shop and College AUs. They're supposedly fairly popular, yet I have never actually read any of them, +except Arc 18 of /Twig/+. I'm curious. Any good examples?

I don't care what fandom it belongs to, whether it be /Love Live/ or /Blindsight/ or the Bible. (Well, no, obviously a /Blindsight/ Coffee Shop AU would be the most fucking hilarious of them conceptually, but I don't expect I'll be able to be this picky.)
