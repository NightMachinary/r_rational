Two slightly odd recommendations this week:

First, a series of interconnected stories first published on [[/r/nosleep]] called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/][How to Survive Camping]]. It's a series of horror stories narrated by a very blas√© campground manager. The main character is very practical in dealing with absurd supernatural things and over course of the first book it built to a surprisingly satisfying arc. It's detailed and lush descriptions of the creatures out of folklore are very well done. I'd say it's a little like Welcome to Night Vale or American Gods at times.

Second, an animated series on HBOMax (or the high seas...) called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Train][Infinity Train]]. The premise is that people facing turmoil in their lives end up on a infinite train where each car is a different environment and learn about themselves. Each season follows a different person's character arc. It does a very good job of creating a surreal and unsettling vibe. The main character for the first season is a young girl who wanted to go to a coding camp. While not explicitly rational, I think many of the people here might see their younger selves in her. She does a decent job of trying to explore a fundamentally irrational place using rationality. Overall, it's one of those kid shows that is unsettling enough you end up wondering exactly who it's aimed at. (e.g. one of the main characters straight up murders someone). There are well done themes of identity and reality, and the show eventually gets into the mechanics of the train to a satisfying degree.
