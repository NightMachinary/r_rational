Ah, I just checked again. Up untill a day or two ago the story stopped at chapter 27. Whoops!

Nevertheless, I stand by the opinion that it has serious pacing issues. To me it feels like the mind-control stuff is the main plot and it's what drew me in, but after 100k words there's only been the beginnings of what I'd describe as main plot. More specifically, I read the synopsis, got certain expectations, and then read hours of the protagonist growing up. This wasn't badly written or anything, just superfluous.

Also, yes it's a sequel, but the protagonist is not the same afaik.
