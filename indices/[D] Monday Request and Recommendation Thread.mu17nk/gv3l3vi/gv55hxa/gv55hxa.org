I have to de-rec /your review/ of An Unbound Soul (not the story itself, which I /do/ recommend).

1. On hiatus? The last update was less than a /day/ ago! And the previous ones less than a week!
2. You complain about the summary... yet somehow manage to miss the fact that the story is a sequel to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon][A Lonely Dungeon]]. As in the /second/ story in a series. Which is /linked in said summary/. What, next you will complain that the second book of Harry Potter mentions Hogwarts by name in its summary?!
3. The plot /is/ going places. Your complaint about it being too slow comes the closest to being an actual valid point, but only by the loosest definition. In the sense that it is a matter of taste. Objectively the story has a steady pace; there is relatively little /combat/ action and lots of world building. Considering that the story is as of today just shy of *60*k words long, when comparing with other progression fantasy works, I would honestly call the pace of the story outright /fast/.
4. While numbers /do/ go up, to claim that it is the sole point of this story is disingenuous at best, if not outright deceitful.

Can't say anything about the other reviews, as I haven't read the stories. Any second opinions?
