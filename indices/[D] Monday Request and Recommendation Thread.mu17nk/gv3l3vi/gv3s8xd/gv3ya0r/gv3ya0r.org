Yeah. If I were the author I wouldn't have included it because typically the tag indicates stories where questions concerning sexuality or identity are critical to the narrative.

In this story, they aren't, and the male secret identity is basically just a very fancy costume (so far). Unless the author has future plot plans concerning this point, I'd advise them to get rid of the tag.
