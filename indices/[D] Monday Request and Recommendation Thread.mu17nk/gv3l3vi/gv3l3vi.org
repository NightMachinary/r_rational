Last week I read and heartily recommend:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that][*Only Villains do That*]]. It's fantastic. First of all, the author is a pro and has already written and uploaded /millions/ of words of their other story, /The Gods are Bastards/. This means the technical quality of the writing reaches levels rarely seen in webfiction and gives me faith that the author won't abandon the story. As for the story, it's pretty fresh. It takes a bog-standard isekai template but does exciting things to it in many new ways and the characters are fun to read. I'm interested in seeing where this story goes, and this is one of the ones where I read every chapter as it's released.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery][*A Practical Guide to Sorcery*]]. I periodically do searches on RR for some of the more obscure tags (in this case gender-bender) to find diamonds-in-the-rough and I found this, which is massively under-read (It's something of a mystery to me how some stories languish so low in the rankings despite having good reviews and content on RR). It's rather good, and follows the protagonist as she lives a double life as a criminal and a magic-school student in a male disguise. The worldbuilding is also rather unique so far, and the more mature magical-school approach with a helping of political intrigue is fun to read about (also, the cover art is great).

I also read:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41521/a-budding-scientist-in-a-fantasy-world][A Budding Scientist in a Fantasy World]] and it's okay. Nothing too special, but a decent enough popcorn read if you're hankering for some portal fantasy. I'd wait though, as with only 60k words, the plot doesn't really go anywhere yet.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38292/an-unbound-soul][An Unbound Soul]] and it's also okay. More portal-fantasy (what can I say, the genre just does it for me for some reason) but it looks like it's on hiatus. Really, I'd probably rate this higher if the main plot (the fact that the whole world is a mind-control dystopia/utopia) actually went somewhere instead of just going nowhere. Right now, it's all about a toddler grinding levels and skills which is really boring (I find litrpg meh in general) and the synopsis is badly written, because it reveals the big twist (mind-control) which only gets revealed in-story after ~80k words. In general, in reincarnation-stories, I much prefer it when the younger years of the protagonist are covered with speed or have some sort of meaning instead of just being a litrpg vehicle for "numbers go up".
