[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that][Only Villains Do That]] is well-written technically up to 1.8 where I'm currently reading, and the premise feels oddly obvious to me - like I'd figured out the Obvious Thing To Do With Isekai and then played /that/ completely straight. (Vide the Demon Lord and Hero dichotomy in "[[https://www.glowfic.com/posts/3866][team tyler's van]]" (by me, writing as "Iarwain")... which I'm sure isn't original per se, but is an example of what I mean by "doing the obvious thing" with isekai tropes.) It doesn't suffer for that, and I'm definitely still reading.

EDIT 1: Really liking the alienness of the world's biology, too.

EDIT 2: Definite "Warrior's Apprentice" vibes here and that's a good thing.
