The issue is he at least has to pretend to make an attempt at being evil, or be annihilated by the goddesses. I'm pretty sure if he just decides to turn to the light side, neither goddess is going to stand for that, rules be damned. The premise is built to not allow him to optimize his approach. Honestly, I was skeptical of how he even plans to get back at the goddesses, since they're literal deities. Now it's clear that it's likely going to involve messing with the source code of reality, since his special ability gives him a foothold to hack into the system, but before he knew that, it was kind of a hopeless idea. I imagine a less suicidal and more realistically minded person would settle for building an industrialized authoritarian state, leaning on the evil /aesthetic/ and abstract concept of tyranny to win "evil overlord points" without actually doing anything that morally questionable.

But yes, I agree on the treatment of women thing. If it were an unknown writer, I would probably agree that it smells like bad writing. However, as I mentioned, the author has done very good work before, so I'm inclined to give them the benefit of he doubt.
