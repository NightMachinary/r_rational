I take your point, but most of my suggestions could plausibly be argued as part of the evil master plan. E.g. subverting the hero, taking over a country by using healing as a carrot, fielding unstoppable armies of soldiers paired with healing slimes.

Unfortunately I haven't read TGaB so I can't speak to that but your strong vote of confidence is reassuring.
