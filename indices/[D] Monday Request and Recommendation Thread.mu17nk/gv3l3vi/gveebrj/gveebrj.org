I enjoyed Only Villains Do That. So far the character hasn't been significantly evil, and him not being evil by nature (just a dick) is nice. (Ex: compare to Overlord where the main character doesn't seem to care about people) Though, he is undoubtedly going to have to do far worse than what he has done so far.\\
Relatively mild spoilers:\\
The opening chapters he's more unreasonably a dick, but later on he grows to be less of one. Though, I do think the latest chapters have had him grow /too/ kindly, making him your normal competent protagonist. Though the acknowledgement about where he's weak (military history, etc) does help avoid that somewhat.\\
I feel like the story is somewhat grabbing Isekai tropes and trying to subvert them. He's the villain rather than the hero. He doesn't actually /want/ to go around becoming a dark lord, he just dislikes people. He does the usual save person getting attacked and then rather than having them be the usual 'but you are a dark lord!' person who gets converted, Aster handles it far more competently while not being evil herself. The background characters, the bandits are interesting in of themselves.\\
I do agree with others that a surprising amount of the violence in it is of the sort of MC protecting women from getting sexually assaulted. I'm not against them including it, but when the majority of the negative things about this society are this it feels overdone. It would be more interesting seeing the wide array of how fucked up the society is. I think some of this annoyance is how much it comes up in the character's thoughts towards the latest chapters. It didn't harm the story overall too much, and at least the character is trying to do something more notable than just stopping attacks that come to his attention, which does fit with the whole societal change aspect that the story is trying to do.
