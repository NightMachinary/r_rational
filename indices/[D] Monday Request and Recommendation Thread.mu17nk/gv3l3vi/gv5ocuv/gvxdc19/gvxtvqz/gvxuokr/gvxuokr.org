  If I didn't make it clear, I don't think any parts of TGaB is soapboxy.

Don't worry you made it clear, we simply disagree on the portrayal of the Thieves' Guild.

  (Note that I don't remember much from TGaB proper, because Trissiny's Guild arc was a while ago, as was the last TGaB update :( so correct me if I'm misrepresenting the Guild here.)

I felt that as time went on the Guild became more of an authors pet. In earlier chapters their PoV bishop was explaining to the elves he's training how there's always a bigger fish so you need to be careful not to get noticed by it. Later on that same bishop broke into the house of the empire's spymaster to threaten him.

In early chapters the Aveiests were criticising the Thives Guild's style of vigilante justice as not being justice at all. In later chapters when Trissany joins the guild on a temporary basis she has no objection using their methods when the Aveiests can't touch one of their own bishops for some reason.

Sorry for being vague, but it's been a long time since I read it.
