Interesting analysis, and I generally agree.

I think you're on the mark with a more "writing for the audience" approach in OVDT. I mean, TGAB was/is clearly Webb's passion project--you don't write that much if you don't like it--but it hasn't really managed to get very wide readership like webfictions of similar monolithic scale often do. It feels like OVDT is an attempt to use these lessons learned, and write something more popular/widely read (but still excellent obviously), for example:

- Posting on RR gives readers faster than hosting it on your own wordpress
- An easy to understand and familiar premise draws in readers (isekai)
- Small character cast and clear plot makes it easier for a webfiction audience to follow (my main TGAB criticism)
