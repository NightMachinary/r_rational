(I haven't read TGaB so I can't speak to that. I tried briefly once but it didn't click, easily could've been a persoanl timing issue though so I might try again eventually)

I'm not going to count out the in-universe misogyny and plot points as not being an intentional decision by in-story goddesses pulling Some More Bullshit, the Hero got his full "totally not a harem" party thing started, the stuff happening to the main character could be more of the same. The "magic armour on feminine bodies morphs to being revealing and salacious when equipped" thing mentioned in passing kind of supports that take.

I don't mean to give it all a possible pass by saying that, but I guess as writing its at least a little better than standard isekai trash author line of "its my character's deep and personal choice to wear a chainmail bikini as a personal commitment and reminder to become more open and trusting" or other such bullshit. I'm also not discounting an eventual conversation with one of the goddesses taking the "this world is reflecting on your desires, don't you think that's fucked up?" (maybe to the Hero more than the mc) not so discretely pointed at the readers in a similar vein to the game Spec Ops: The Line has as its ending.
