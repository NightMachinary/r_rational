Yes, £1200/mo is reasonable. I live in London and I spend a little less than £1000 per month.

Edit: Be warned that rent is the main factor. I share a flat, and my share of the rent is £650/mo. Depending on where in London you live, though, you could burn through your entire budget and then some on a one-room studio.
