8% of your company is a LOT. YC is the premiere incubator in the USA; they give ~$20k for three months, they take 7%, they give legal support and business mentorship from major names, and at the end of the three months they put you in a room with all the major angels and VCs.

If all that EF is doing is paying you a very minimal stipend and giving you some office space, they are not worth it.
