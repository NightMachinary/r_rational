So I recently made it into the "final selection round" of [[http://www.joinef.com/][entrepreneurs first]].

They contacted me, had me do a short programming test, that was intentionally designed so that most people couldn't complete /any/ of the tasks in it in the allotted timeframe. I managed to complete one of the 3, but it was pretty close.

The whole thing is pretty weird. They contacted me out of the blue, and a few days later I'm in their "final selection round".

I suspect it might be because a lot of my linkdin contacts are impressive. A lot of CFAR graduates and others in the rationality community. They mentioned they found me through linkdin, but I pay /very/ little attention to it.

This definitely seems a lot easier then I'd expect, which makes me a bit nervous.
