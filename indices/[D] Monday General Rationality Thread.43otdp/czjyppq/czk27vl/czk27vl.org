These sorts of things bug me too (why does the resistance in Star Wars VII, an organization spanning star systems, have about 30 fighters to its name?) but I don't think that irrational worldbuilding is the same thing as poor writing. Wall-E isn't poorly written - it's a masterpiece of visual story telling. It's just willing to sacrifice the scientific or logical details of its world for the sake of its desired plot, characterizations, and themes.

We're here on [[/r/rational]] because we're not nearly so willing to make the same trades, but rationality isn't the be all end all of writing.
