It's room for speculation and extrapolation, which makes watching media more fun and exercises your creativity! Especially if it turns out there's an actually logical reason that just wasn't explicitly stated.

  Why do the robots make trash towers?

It's the logical way to arrange cuboids of trash so they take up less space. Perhaps there were originally other robots that carried the towers away.

  What happened to the humans not rich enough to leave - I find it hard to believe they just died out (it's not like it was a nuclear apocalypse).

Starvation? No plants anywhere means no food.

  Why, after 700 years of harsh weather, were things like paint still on buildings? Why didn't all the metal rust? And on the spaceship, why did they have alarms ringing outside the ship?

I'm stumped on these ones.

  Why does Wall-E have emotions? Is that a change, or were all of the robots originally given the capacity?
#+end_quote

It's a change.

One of the major themes of Wall-E is that new experiences and challenges are what make us human. Throughout the film, the robots that display the most personality are either those who have to deal with the outside world (Wall-E, Eve, Auto, Mop) or those who've been damaged and learned to cope with it. The humans live in a tightly controlled environment and have basically no initiative or personality at the start of the film. Wall-E and Eve re-introduce the unexpected into the Axiom. The Captain is kicked out of his routine and ultimately defies Auto and his superiors, and it's all sparked off by Eve's plant and a few specks of dirt. Wall-E accidentally switches off a woman's computer and makes her look around herself for the first time. As long as the humans aren't challenged or stimulated at all they're content to be more passive than any robot, but when they need to re-colonise the Earth they pull off a roaring success. I think this is the film's main thesis. In the end, it's an optimistic one.

In my opinion, your enjoyment of rational fiction has equipped you to ask these questions. Which is good! Now you can learn to answer them as well.

p.s. This works because Wall-E is an excellently-written film and the world doesn't just stop making sense the moment you scratch at it a little. Poor worldbuilding won't hold up to this kind of scrutiny, but it can still be fun to try.
