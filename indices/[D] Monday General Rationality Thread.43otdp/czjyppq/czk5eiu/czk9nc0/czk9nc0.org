On the paint thing, it could be that there were robots designed to repaint the cities every once in a while, and that they have simply shut down as well, with Wall-E being the last survivor. If all of the paintbots died in the last 25 years or so, the paint would be faded, but not gone. Especially if the trash towers provided an insulating effect from harsh weather and wind.
