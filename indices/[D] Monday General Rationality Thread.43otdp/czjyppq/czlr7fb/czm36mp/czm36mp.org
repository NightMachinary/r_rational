If you're talking about Wall-E, the ship has artificial gravity and a hyperdrive because those are staples of space opera, and their absence would draw more attention than their presence (for most audiences).

No FTL and no artificial gravity are usually signposts of hard sci-fi, which Wall-E is not. They wouldn't fit.
