While there are plenty of works where the irrationality is just bad writing, for a lot of works it can simply not be the point of the story. In my opinion the question you need to ask yourself is not "Are the things happening on screen rational?", but instead "Can I imagine rational alternatives to the irrational issues in this story, and have its main point persist?". if the answer to the second question is "yes" then probably the irrationality is not really a big issue. Yes I do believe a better writer could probably make it both rational, interesting and keep the point(even if the alternatives i can imagine are not all of the above), but does it -really- matter if the main point that the writer tried to make would still stand the rationality test?
