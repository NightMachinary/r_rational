  read a bunch of philosophy stuff, and then (frighteningly) find out if you've changed your Views on Things afterwards. If this sounds scary, not to worry: you're a lot better at not changing your mind than you think you are ;-)!
#+end_quote

To clarify: I'm not worried about changing my views. I'm worried that my views will change and I won't know /in what way/ they've changed.

Do you know of any good ways to write down your self, before and after beginning such an endeavour?
