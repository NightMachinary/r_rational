I'm at a strange impasse. Here's a list of things I want to do, in the order that I think they need to be done (and why)

1. Revise my Senior Thesis (a defense of Catholicism to The Protestants), annotating why I wrote it (for the grade), why I disagreed with it then and why I then thought it was bad (jumping from "It is necessary that a First Mover exist" to "Jesus is His Son") and why I think it is bad now.
2. Write down my current set of opinions on Things. (Does anyone have a good self-interview framework for this?)
3. Reread HPMOR and rewatch TTGL, taking notes on themes, characters, and plot elements ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3c7w5y/youve_watched_gurren_lagann_and_read_hpmor_what/][Here's why]])
4. Read the Sequences and associated works
5. Figure out how my mind has changed since Point 2.
6. Write the fic that I've been planning to write.

I have a whole bunch of uncertainties about this process that are hard to articulate. I'm kind of scared how my mind might change, and I'm kind of scared about writing my thoughts about my lapsing. I'm uncertain why.

Does anyone have any advice or techniques for comparing brain states and beliefs? I want to know how reading the Sequences will change my mind on things.

And, of course, does anyone have any advice on writing crossover fanfic?
