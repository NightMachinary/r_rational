*How big is Earth's past light-cone?*

Designing a story, I want to know how confident a character should be about something. To know this, I need to know two numbers: How much space-time hyper-volume exists in his past light-cone (ie, the cubic volume multiplied by the time), and how large his past-light-cone will be at various points in the future (eg, 100 years, 10,000 years, 1,000,000 years, etc).

Does anyone here have a good idea on how to approach the math?
