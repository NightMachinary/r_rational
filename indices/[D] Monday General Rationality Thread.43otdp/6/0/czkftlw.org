The hypervolume of a 4-cone is the 3-volume of the base, multiplied by the height, divided by 4.

Ignoring the expansion of the universe, the hypercone is 14 billion years long and its base is a sphere of radius 14 billion lightyears.

I get about 4*10^{40} light^{3}years^{4}, but somebody should probably check that for me.

It'll be a little bigger once you add the expansion of space into the mix, but I think it'll probably still be around 10^{41} light^{3}years^{4}.
