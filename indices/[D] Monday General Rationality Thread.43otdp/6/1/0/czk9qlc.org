The question is the Fermi paradox, so I want to choose the start date of the beginning of the universe - which runs into a few issues with universal expansion. :)

An alternate approach, which seems more complicated to me but may not me, would be to replace the count of parsec-years (or light-year years) with, say, galaxy-years, or star-years. But this is for generating a simplified initial estimate, so light-year-years could be good enough.
