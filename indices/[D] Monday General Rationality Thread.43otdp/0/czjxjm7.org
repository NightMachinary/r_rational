I feel inspired by Xvim's shaping exercises (from Mother of Learning), and I am interested in real-life application of his methodology. The essence could be maybe phrased like this: *take a small, concrete ability, and repeat it ad nauseam, until you master it. Only then continue with next step*.

Lukeprog from LW wrote about his experience with something [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/58m/build_small_skills_in_the_right_order/][very similar]] (TW: scientology, LW), and it also reminds me of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen][Kaizen]] and of the math course on [[https://www.khanacademy.org/][Khan's Academy]].

I don't think this is especially unusual idea, but for some reason I feel very motivated by Xvim and by MoL main character. Do you have any experience with this method of self-improvement?
