  Also, has your senior thesis already been submitted?
#+end_quote

Almost six years ago. It was something like 50% of my grade for the Evangelical Studies class and 50% of my English grade in senior year of high school. (School was non-denom Protestant with Baptist teachers and conservative Anglican backing. My family were token Catholics.)

I'm pretty formally a Lapsed Catholic, gone full agnostic, but I want to document the reasons I have for why I made that transition.

  It seems like you have two actual tasks in mind: 1. Write an HPMoR-TTGL crossover fanfic. 2. Clarify your Views on Things, read a bunch of philosophy stuff, and then (frighteningly) find out if you've changed your Views on Things afterwards. If this sounds scary, not to worry: you're a lot better at not changing your mind than you think you are ;-)!

The problem here, I think, is that 2 blocks 1, because of the research that I'm going to need to do for 1 being "read a bunch of philosophy stuff".

  ... they're not /sufficiently/ good introductions to Bayesian statistics, causal inference, meta-philosophical naturalism, machine learning, cognitive science, etc.
#+end_quote

Eek. I definitely do not have formal training in any of that, except maybe naturalism. (Plant biology, microbiology, some computer science, various communications and marketing techniques, and so on I do have training in.) I'm guessing there isn't a recommended reading guide to the sequences?

Are there schools of rationalist thought that are web-accessible and friendly that aren't the Less Wrong Sequences? Or are there other places that would be a good place to get started in Less Wrong? I've heard things about "EA"?

  The upside of all that condescension towards religion is that it's rarely mentioned at all.
#+end_quote

That's pleasant to hear. New-Atheism-style religion-bashing is definitely not my style.
