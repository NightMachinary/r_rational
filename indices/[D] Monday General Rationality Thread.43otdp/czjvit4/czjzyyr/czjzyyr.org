  Write down my current set of opinions on Things.
#+end_quote

Which Things, and why write down your opinions? Ah, for point (5). Also, has your senior thesis already been submitted?

It seems like you have two actual tasks in mind:

1) Write an HPMoR-TTGL crossover fanfic.

2) Clarify your Views on Things, read a bunch of philosophy stuff, and then (frighteningly) find out if you've changed your Views on Things afterwards. If this sounds scary, not to worry: you're a lot better at /not/ changing your mind than you think you are ;-)!

You should schedule them.

  I'm kind of scared how my mind might change, and I'm kind of scared about writing my thoughts about my lapsing. I'm uncertain why.
#+end_quote

Because different frameworks and theories for Thinking About Life are difficult to express in each-other's terms, so it ends up seeming as if you're a different person on one side or the other?

Well, you're not a different person.

Also, am I correct to guess that by "lapsing", you mean ceasing to believe in your former religion? The actual thing about the Sequences is that they take nonreligiosity for granted as a trivial consequence of having even a little scientific education, let alone "Rationality".

The upside of all that condescension towards religion is that it's rarely mentioned at all.

The downside of the Sequences in general is that you'll get vastly more out of them if you come at them with preexisting knowledge of the formal scientific and philosophical topics they actually cover: they're not /sufficiently good/ introductions to Bayesian statistics, causal inference, meta-philosophical naturalism, machine learning, cognitive science, etc. to replace actually learning those subjects. They weren't intended to be that. But it does mean that what you get out of them is partly what you bring to them, and if you come to them /lacking/ in background, you might leave thinking some things that their author and the general community did not intend you to think.
