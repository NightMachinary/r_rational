Here are the issues that stuck out to me when I watched it: Why the hyperdrive? It's not like humans actually go anywhere, so it's just a frivolous detail that makes the rest of the story harder to believe. Why no orbital space colonies? They obviously have the technology for it, even if they for some reason don't choose to spin them for gravity. How did the humans re-adapt to one-gee after spending their entire lives in zero-gee, when this results in deterioration of the load-bearing bones?
