This movie is more of a hard sci-fi parody than genre space opera. No aliens, everyone is in microgravity for most of the movie, and the main villain is overconsumption. It misunderstands these things in comic ways. Microgravity is misunderstood as small amounts of artificial gravity. Assuming that was an intentional joke, I get it. Same goes for the world literally filling up with garbage.

So it shouldn't have had FTL, or should have made some kind of narratively useful joke about it.
