    [[/u/alexanderwales]] wrote the defining piece about how I approach any DC universe work, and now I can't approach it at all.

    In the new trailer, it seems Batman clearly articulates Wales's Lex Luthor's primary concern: Superman is an existential threat to humanity, and must be destroyed. This motivating factor is explicitly stated in the newest movie trailer, and is explicitly stated in Metropolitan Man.

    Yet, it is obvious that is where the two diverge. While Lex daftly maneuvers around the Kryptonian in the fan fiction, it is obvious that Lex Zuckerberg and Batman only know how to use force. They will not find out Superman's weaknesses by probing at the edge of his powers. They will attempt to destroy him by (1) building a better batsuit and when that fails (2) making an even more powerful existential threat. Batman will switch to Superman's side to defeat this Big Bad along with the help of Wonder Woman.

    That is, the power balance will be changed and the side that can punch harder will win.

    God. It could be a good movie, too. It could have a good script and good action and not be as dark-and-edgy as its going for... but Metropolitan Man will always be in the back of my mind saying "this is dumb. hey. this is dumb."
