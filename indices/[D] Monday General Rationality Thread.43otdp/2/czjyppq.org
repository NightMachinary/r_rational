I've come up with a funny problem recently.

I've been reading a lot of rational fiction recently. It's not the only thing I read, but it's been most of it for the past few months. And when I turn back to "traditional" fiction, I find myself criticizing incongruities and poorly planned characters. Mostly in TV shows and movies.

For example, I watched Wall-E for the first time over the weekend (yes, I know, shame on me for waiting so long). I liked it; it was cute and sappy. I could even get behind the pro-environmentalism motive.

But I kept criticizing the illogical parts of it. Why do the robots make trash towers? Why does Wall-E have emotions? Is that a change, or were all of the robots originally given the capacity? What happened to the humans not rich enough to leave - I find it hard to believe they just died out (it's not like it was a nuclear apocalypse). Why, after 700 years of harsh weather, were things like paint still on buildings? Why didn't all the metal rust? And on the spaceship, why did they have alarms ringing outside the ship? No one in a space suit would hear them.

I mean, it's a kid's movie, but I just kept overthinking everything and it sorta took away from the experience. I've been just as bad when playing /Fallout 4/. Worse, probably.

I felt something similar when watching Agents of SHIELD. The characters' motivations jump so freaking often and seem so short-sighted and illogical. Again, I realize - cable TV show that relies on drama and creates it to keep viewers invested. But it was really frustrating.

TL;DR: Rational fiction has ruined poorly written mainstream media for me!
