One thing I've come to appreciate the difficulty of: prioritizing what to do and then actually doing it. I used to cycle a lot thinking about what to do, because any potential train of thought about what to do today/this week ended up leading to several hard-to-answer questions about future goals/objectives. And then, I'd get distracted about how certain choices now might affect me/others 3 months down the line.

But one generally useful technique I'm now using is to just be okay doing a shitty first draft during the prioritizing phase, then revising and iterating once maybe, and then calling it 'good enough' after a max amount of time and just moving on to doing the highest priority thing. Many of the smaller decisions that come up after you're decided the main priorities don't even matter either way... often, the cost of switching back if you made a wrong decision is very very low, so why even bother wasting attention on minor, cheap-to-change decisions? I'd rather worry about prioritizing the right things every week and then reflect on how that worked out at the end of the week.

Anyway, nothing earth shattering, but I now usually ask: "what would it cost to undo this if I had to?"
