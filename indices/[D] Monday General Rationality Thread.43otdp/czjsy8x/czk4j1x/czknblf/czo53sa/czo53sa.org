Certainly that's part of it, being woken up during a dream makes it easier to remember the last few seconds. But I think the dreams themselves are different too.

Nightmares make me wake up in a cold sweat; if I had one but forgot about it until waking, I'd still notice the sweaty patch on my bed. (Sorry if that's gross.)
