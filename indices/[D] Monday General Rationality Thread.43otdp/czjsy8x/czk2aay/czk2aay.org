Uh, yeah, if you manage to fall asleep while on a caffeine buzz, you'll remember more of your dreams, and the buzz also draws time out a bit. As a result you also get the illusion of having dreamed for a very long time.

...Of course that's if you can fall asleep at all, and it's probably not healthy. But I've gotten some enjoyable experiences out of it, so I think it's worth trying occasionally.

Edit: Back in highschool I had a tendency to stay up late then take a powernap after my morning coffee. That's where I recall most of my successful sessions.
