  People know they aren't what-we-call-dreaming when they're what-we-call-awake.

But ... most people clearly don't, or they would notice the difference when they /are/ dreaming. If people /actually noticed/ the differences between waking and sleeping, they'd be lucid dreamers.

That's what lucid dreaming /is/, checking if you're awake or not and discovering you're ... not.

Most people can tell if their /memories/ are from a dream or not, which is a completely different thing. Anyone who's confident they're not in a dream but regularly mistakes dreams for reality is suffering from hindsight bias.
