  I'm perpetually mystified when people say "we could be dreaming right now, how would we tell?" I know, and it's knowledge that translates directly into superpowers.

When they say that, they're saying they don't know that what-we-call-reality isn't a higher-level dream, not that they don't know that they aren't what-we-call-dreaming. People know they aren't what-we-call-dreaming when they're what-we-call-awake.
