I've often caused myself to have some fairly distressing nightmares, by doing something pretty simple. It's not guaranteed, obviously, but I find that, if I go to bed and fully wake up, say, an hour before I need to, and then go back to sleep, that 45 minutes to an hour of extra sleep I get will often set off a nightmare. And a fairly long one at that. I've had nightmares with multiple scene transitions in that space of time, and when I wake up, it would feel like hours have passed, even though they really haven't.

Not sure why this happens, but it's happened to me enough to notice the trend.
