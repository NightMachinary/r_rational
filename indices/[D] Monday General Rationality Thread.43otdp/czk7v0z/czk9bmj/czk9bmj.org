You have to choose a start date, which can be fairly arbitrary. 2.8ish BYA for formation of earth, 900ish MYA for multicellular life, 600KYAish for modern humans, 19xx for birth of protagonist... (nb - check those numbers before use)

Then take the volume of a sphere with radius (elapsed time * c) and integrate over the length of time you've selected.
