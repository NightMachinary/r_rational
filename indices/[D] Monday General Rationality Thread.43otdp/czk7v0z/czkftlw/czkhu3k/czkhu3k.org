Let's see... using the figure of 13.82 billion years from [[https://www.google.ca/search?q=age+of+the+universe]] , the past light-cone of Earth, in light-years^{3-years,} circa 2100 AD, can be given by (4/3 * pi * (13.82e9)^{3)} * (13.82e9) /4 , which Google gives as [[https://www.google.ca/search?q=(4%2F3+*+pi+*+(13.82e9)^3)+*+(13.82e9)+%2F4]] = 3.8199774e+40 . Twiddling with Laplace's rule of succession, then roughly, we can be 99% confident that we will continue to see no evidence of extraterrestrial life until that figure is about 1% higher, ie 3.858e+40, which happens when the 13.82 billion year figure increases to roughly 13.854 billion years, 34 million years from now. That's... a much stronger statement about the Fermi paradox than I was expecting.
