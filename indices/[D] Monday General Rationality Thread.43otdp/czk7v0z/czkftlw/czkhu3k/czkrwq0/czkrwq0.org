Well, we don't know for sure that there are no aliens anywhere in that volume. If they're not drastically re-engineering stars by the million, we're quite unlikely to detect them outside our own galaxy.

Aliens with the same tech level as us would have difficulty detecting us from more than a few light-years away. We can barely detect Earth-sized planets at all, never mind determining if they have life.
