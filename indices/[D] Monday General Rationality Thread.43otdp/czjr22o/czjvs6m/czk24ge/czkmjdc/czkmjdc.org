At this point, just shy of half the superdelegates have already publicly committed to Clinton, as opposed to just over 1 percent of them committed to Sanders. While they can still change their minds, Sanders is basically operating with a 360 delegate handicap, which is unlikely to change baring several landslide victories in early-middle primaries. It isn't impossible to overcome, but at this point in time Clinton still looks like a near shoe-in for the Democratic nomination, regardless of primary results.
