My experience with multiplayer has mostly been Quake 3 (and Legions: Overdrive/Fallen Empire: Legions). Super fun, but not a lot of coordination. I think team leaderboards might not help, as it acts as a way of pitting teammates against each other for better K/D ratios.

A large part of my latent, impossible, and undesirable desire to join the military is to act as one part of a large machine. That also comes out in an unrealized desire for coordinating multiplayer. I'm not very fond of the individualistic multiplayer that's so common in most FPSes; I want to see a multiplayer game that is fundamentally collectivist, with explicit emphasis on coordination, specialized roles, and dependence on strategic intelligence and communication.

I've heard of a few things that might fit. Space Station 13 is very much this, but not combat-oriented, and I fear that it will suck time out of my life like a sponge because I'm so attracted to this concept. Planetside 2 isn't something I know much about, but it appears as though its various levels are all parts of the same battlefront, to the point that it looks like a strategy game on the high-level. That is incredibly attractive. I want that multiple level of detail; where 'officers' as a role decide on strategies and goals and assign missions and direct troops. A literal virtual war, no deaths needed.

To a lesser extent, the idea of clans in a lot of FPSes is also appealing, where voice communication is enabled and people actually treat games as something to be won together. I've never been able to play games with a mic, though, and I've never gotten good enough at any game to ever think I was up for joining a clan.

I remember another story involving a game with impoverished communication. This was a game specifically designed so people had to help others, and you had to be helped to progress. It was a (computer) mouse maze game, with moving walls and buttons, and often several buttons had to be pushed at once in order to let people through. It was amazing. While I'm sure there were defectors, people queued up. A mouse entered the stage, made their way to a button, helped the next person through, and after all the mice that had been there before left their buttons and made their way to the exit, entering mice replaced them, and they could move forward themselves. There were also times when people would get trapped together (I was often trapped). You could draw on the walls, so we drew little messages back and forth. One guy and I stayed together for a little while, and when we ended up parting we drew each other little hearts. So cute. :)

The key to coordination with impoverished communication is establishing Schelling points. 'W to beat green' is a minimal amount of information, communicated in the only info-dense medium the game has, names, but it reminds people that they can donate their power, and designates you as a natural recipient.

Mutual cooperation is a Schelling point. So is mutual defection, but if the game isn't zero-sum why the fuck would you do something like that? We're in it together.

(In cases where one side defecting and one side cooperating results in a greater total gain than mutual defection /or/ cooperation, and the gains are transferable, then alternating defection, or one-sided defection plus sharing, can be another optimal collective strategy. I'm not sure what this type of game is called.)
