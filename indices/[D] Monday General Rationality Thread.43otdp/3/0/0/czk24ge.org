It will be interesting to see. Hillary had the super delegates in 2008 as well (Though by a smaller margin), but when the popular vote swung in favour of Obama they followed after. If Sanders somehow wins the popular vote but Hillary wins on super delegates, my American friends (All two of them) will be so extremely disappointed. And me too.
