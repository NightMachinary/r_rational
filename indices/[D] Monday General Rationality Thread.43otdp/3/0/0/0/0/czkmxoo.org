She's definitely most likely to win. But I think, or perhaps mostly hope, that the superdeligates will not ignore the prospect of the public outcry that would come if they override the primary. Which would, after all, make a lot of voters extremely unhappy with them not very long before a general election.

That said, Hillary has a clear lead nationally in the primary, so the point may be moot.
