I tend to get much more vivid dreams when I'm not sleeping properly. Sleeping at high altitude, missing a dose of medication, having a fever, all induce particularly vivid dreams. I think this is related to [[/u/gabbalis]]' experiences with caffeine in the sister comment.

It's not always pleasant - I wake up still feeling tired, and it sometimes causes nightmares.
