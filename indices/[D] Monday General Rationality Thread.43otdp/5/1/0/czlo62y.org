Curiously, my experience is the opposite (not accounting for the possibility of forgotten dreams, anyway).

Usually when I sleep poorly, with similar causes as those you listed, I have no sense of having dreamt at all, and at most have only a vague sense of having been dreaming, without any recollection for content. Meanwhile, when I sleep well, especially when I have the opportunity to bed especially early or sleep-in especially late, I have much more vivid memories, and often find myself so intellectually engrossed with them that I will consciously choose to back to sleep, not because I am still tired, but because I am interested in continuing the dream (which, surprisingly enough, do usually continue more or less linearly from where they ended).
