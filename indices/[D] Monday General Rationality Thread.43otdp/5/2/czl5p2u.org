Lucid dreaming is pretty fun.

You just make a habit of checking for the various signs you're in a dream. (I usually pinch myself, although that might get annoying for some people.)

I'm perpetually mystified when people say "we could be dreaming right now, how would we tell?" I /know/, and it's knowledge that translates directly into superpowers.
