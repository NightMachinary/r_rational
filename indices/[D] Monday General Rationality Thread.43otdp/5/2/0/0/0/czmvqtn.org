  But ... most people clearly don't, or they would notice the difference when they are dreaming.

No. I said they can tell /when they're awake./ When you haven't trained yourself (or naturally deviate from the norm, whatever) to test reality for dream-ness, you very rarely consider dreams in the context of dreams vs. reality. The 'critical process' in your brain that would otherwise notice that reality has gone /fucking bananacakes/ is functionally nonexistent. The point of making those habits in order to induce a lucid state is because you would otherwise not even question it.

...I actually had a dream last night that seemed to create memories that were perceptually farther back in my past than what I had experienced in the dream. Instead of the dream acting as an interruption to my life, it acted as an interleaving. It was very weird, and I hardly remember what it was about.

Even though this comment was about a factual error, [[/u/ZeroNihilist]] addressed the bigger conceptual error in a clearer fashion. They're positing that reality is a different sort of dream with unknown rules. It's just another version of the anthropic simulation argument as per Meta Mega Crossover.
