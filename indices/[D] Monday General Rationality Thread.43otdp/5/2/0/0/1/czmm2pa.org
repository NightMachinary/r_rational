I think the point is that without the understanding of how a higher level of reality might differ from the one you're in, you can't actually realise you're in a dream.

So because you know, having been awake, what being awake is like, you can determine when you are not awake. If what you thought was wakefulness was in fact just another, more coherent layer of dreaming with different rules, how would you ever know?
