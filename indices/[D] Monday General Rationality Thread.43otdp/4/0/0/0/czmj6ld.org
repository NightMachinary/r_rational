Regarding games to be won together: I have greatly enjoyed the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, a collectivist game where one person plays a bomb defuser and can see the screen which has a bomb to be defused, and the other players are all playing bomb defusal experts who can see a (long, opaque, confusing) manual that tells how to defuse the bomb. The game in essence is trying to replicate the bomb defusal scene from movies where people are shouting about what wires to cut or what-have-you while a timer ticks down. The defuser relays information to the experts about what they see, while the experts relay instructions based on that advice. It's a great party game and can be played with microphones online or in person. It's good for playing with IRL friends casually, as it needs low equipment (only 1 computer / 1 manual, can have additional copies of manual).
