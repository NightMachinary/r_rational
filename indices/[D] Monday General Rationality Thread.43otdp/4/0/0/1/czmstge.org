Having played Planetside 2 in the past, and subsequently burnt myself out on it several hundred hours in, it did have that level of strategy. I'm not sure about now, as the introduction of the lattice system killed some of the strategic options while creating much more contentious fights. Whether this was good or bad was the subject of a lot of debate. I may write more on this when I get to a real keyboard, if you're interested.
