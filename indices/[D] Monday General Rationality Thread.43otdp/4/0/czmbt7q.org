Interesting story. Thank you for sharing!

  But what I learned from agar.io was the power of social cooperation, and to an extent, tribal bonds and manipulative leadership, in the face of a complacent but large opponent.

I actually play team games a lot, especially Dota 2, which is a 5v5 game with fixed sides from the start of the game. I actually played a game recently where another player by charisma, willpower, and manipulative leadership caused our team to come back from a large deficit and win the game, in spite of lesser individual skill from basically all of our players on an individual level.

Getting people to cooperate in Dota 2 is partially analogous to what you describe from Agar.io - I only played Agar.io for about a half hour once, but there are some striking similarities - teams where some players would sacrifice their own strength to add to the strength of others, outperforming more naive teams where it's every man for themselves.
