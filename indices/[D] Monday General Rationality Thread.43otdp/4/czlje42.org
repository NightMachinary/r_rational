So, I just remembered a lesson about social dynamics I learned from agar.io back when it became a thing. (I've been thinking about/researching game design and how you can use games to teach things/communicate, though the things taught aren't necessarily useful)

The free-for-all games were fun, but I eventually became more interested in team games. At first I played like an individual, but with the added benefit of there being a few monoliths that I could commensalize, in the sense that I used them to ward off my predators while not particularly giving anything in return.

So, that was interesting for a while as well. What changed my normal parasite behavior was interesting. In one game, our team was losing, consistently. There were three teams and we were less than a sixth of the pie, struggling to make headway. There were two different things I tried in order to fix this, which I suppose could be considered experiments.

The first was selfish. I named myself 'W to beat green'. Green was in the lead by far, and the W key was what allowed you to eject bits of your mass out in order to get smaller. At least, that was what I thought. I had noticed people donating mass to others, but I hadn't really paid attention, playing mostly egocentrically. Now, however, I realized that mass could be traded/invested, and that was what I used. The strange thing was, my name actually worked. A bunch of people on my team committed themselves to collecting mass from the autotrophs and our opponents, and donated it to me. Often it was a few individuals who attached themselves to me, forming a kind of silent camaraderie. I quickly became very very big. I don't remember who won in the end (it never actually ends), but I believe we did manage to topple Green from their lead.

The second was the opposite. That run had interested me, so I decided to play the role of the smaller symbiote. I committed myself to giving mass to others, specifically, single targets, who I followed and fed regularly. They became the monoliths, and sheltered me from larger enemies. Instead of a commensal relationship, I became a productive mutualist.

I'm not sure if I'm inventing one or the other of these memories, or if both really did happen, or if I'm mixing up the order. But what I learned from agar.io was the power of social cooperation, and to an extent, tribal bonds and manipulative leadership, in the face of a complacent but large opponent.
