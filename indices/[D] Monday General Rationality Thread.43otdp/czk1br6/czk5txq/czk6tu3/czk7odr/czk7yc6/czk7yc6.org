  London can be an expensive city, but the living stipend we provide is enough to cover all your basic costs.

I presume they have a system in place. I don't imagine it will be comfortable, but for three months I can deal.

I'll definitely look into what happens after those three months, but I suspect that has to do with them changing programs times and not updating it everywhere. I've seen other places where it references the program being 3 months.

Right now I'm living in a 4 bedroom townhouse. It costs about ~500cad a month. Getting out of that will be tricky.

I'm unemployed, but very employable. I'm definitely going to need to take on some more work leading up to this.
