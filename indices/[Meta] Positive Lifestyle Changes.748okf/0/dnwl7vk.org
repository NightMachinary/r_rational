There are two approaches I'd take to alleviate depression. The first is some basic stuff that has to do with our physiology. That stuff sounds trite and uninteresting but it's critical to dealing with depression. The second is a note about your lived environment and life purpose.

To hack your physiology and mood back to a more normal state, do these things. Don't try to do them, don't do them slightly more. Just do them all.

- Sleep. Aim for 8 hours or slightly more a night. If you're sleeping more, you may be using that as an avoidance tactic. If you're sleeping less, that can cause ongoing cognitive disturbances. Six hours is not enough, there's good science on this.
- Eat fruits and vegetables. You may think this is sounding like an after-school special, but the studies on this indicate some really mind-boggling differences. Not "statistically significant" differences, more like "cumulative 10% improvements in mood per serving" differences. Insert pun about low-hanging fruit here.
- Cardio exercise. If you can somehow do this in a natural setting, you're getting a twofer, since natural settings have been shown to elevate mood. But cardio exercise is a ridiculous mood elevator. There's a reason "runner's high" is a term of art.
- Human interaction. This is a kicker. If you go some days without talking to anyone meaningfully, that's cognitively very dangerous. Lonely people have biomarkers similar to people under incredible stress and mortality and negative life outcomes dramatically increases with loneliness. The increase in mortality with loneliness is actually similar to the risk increase with smoking.
- Sunlight. Lack of exposure to sunlight can directly cause, not just contribute to, depression (seasonal affective disorder).

Working on one area can have effects in the others. More sleep and better eating can make it easier to exercise, etc. On the other hand, improving in these areas can often mean confronting addictions--media addiction, for example.

There's another avenue of attack that I recommend as well, and that's evaluating your lived environment and purpose or direction in life. Your environment means your work and the people around you. If you feel disconnected from your environment--well, that's practically the definition of depression. This is also related to what you see as your purpose in life, a mission to accomplish or a community or organization you can advance the goals of. Even if you get your day-to-day mood in order, you may need to track down one of these to really get over depression. You may also need to radically change your life situation/milieu, which may require a physical relocation, starting/quitting school, or starting/quitting a job.

I'll also just say that you can't think your way out of depression. You need to make behavioral changes and change your life circumstances. We have a modern belief that "positive thinking" or other cognitive states change outcomes and perception. I think it's more generally true that different environments and different behaviors produce different cognitive states, so work on doing things differently, not thinking things differently.
