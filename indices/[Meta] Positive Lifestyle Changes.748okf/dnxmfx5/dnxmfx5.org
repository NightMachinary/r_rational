Someone recommended nootropics a month back

I feel much much better with rhodiola rosea [[https://www.amazon.com/NOW-Rhodiola-Rosea-500mg-Capsules/dp/B001GAOHHA/]]

I'm getting headaches and its messing with my sleep, but its downright trivial. I havn't cried myself to sleep with intrusive thoughts in a month.
