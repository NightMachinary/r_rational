Okay, first of all, this is my experience with depression so yours could vary greatly. The thing that helped me the most was Stoicism, which is a following the teaching of Seneca, Marcus Aurelius and a couple of modern authors about how you face and live your life, based on what you control and virtue. I highly recommend you to take a look at [[/r/stoicism]] to check that out. Another thing that helped a lot was tulpamancy, the concept that you can create another sentient mind inside your own brain. It's much like Hufflepuff/Ravenclaw/etc. inside HPMOR Harry's mind, but on another level of thinking and reacting. The good folks at [[/r/tulpas]] can explain it better than I ever could. It helped me immensely by not feeling obliged to have the same degree of social interaction with others, and allowed me to be a better person altogether among other stuff.

On another note, I think understanding your depression helps just as much. I can't search for the source right now, but I read a recent study that considered depression not to be a disease/problem, but more like a defence mechanism for the brain. In situations where the brain isn't getting new knowledge/ being on the same routine every day, the brain goes into a 'depressed state' so it won't spend as much energy keeping your memories of the same stuff over and over. The same happens when you are constantly sad, the brain goes into a state so it won't keep those memories of being sad. The conclusion for that article was that better than getting exercise or eating/sleeping well, a good course of action would be to force yourself to experience new things regularly; going to that new coffee shop in town, watching a orchestra, going to the beach, anyway, whatever suits your fancy.

Hope I could help, my best wishes that you can pull through it :)
