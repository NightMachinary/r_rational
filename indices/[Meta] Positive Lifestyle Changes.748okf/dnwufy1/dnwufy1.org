An added thing is how much its important to "not do it alone", it being both life and also some of the specific things you do to alleviate the depression. If you feel like you need to exercise more, do it in a group; you are letting your life goals wither, get a group of like minded people to work on them together, etc.

Depression has a temptation to make you push off socializing until you are 'ready' or 'feeling better', which isnt always false but is often a trap.
