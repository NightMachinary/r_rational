  During the summer I only work out twice a week but play ultimate, rock climb, and mountain bike.

Writer is coming, and dropping those sports could be a bummer. I know it's not the same, but maybe join an indoor climbing gym/club or do some other outdoor winter sports?

Also, if you're used to being outside in summer, watch out for Seasonal Affective Disorder. The days are already getting shorter, make sure you have enough vitamins in your diet and maybe try a sun lamp.
