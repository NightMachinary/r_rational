I was going through a severe depression because I was going through some bad life stuff. What cured me instantly (within one month, stopped taking it after that with no withdrawl) was NSI-189 however this is experimental.

Since then I've discovered safer stuff but haven't had any real major depressions (one reason might be that I take CBD pretty regularly). You could try CBD oil and the Wim Hof breathing technique (youtube has a lot of videos on it, should feel effects instantly and see if it clicks with you)

Never had a therapist or any real friends who can listen and I've gone through some pretty depressing shit. Introspection + learning a ton about human behaviour / psychology will help you figure out the real causes of your depression, then take some stuff like CBD, maybe try smoking weed to get out of your funk so you can fix the real problems. For general life advice I find Jordan Peterson videos to be of immense value.

Also getting angry helps me when I'm feeling down, one of the ways I get angry is piracetam and aggresive music like hip hop / rock. I feel anger is much easier to reach for than calmness / happiness while depressed. But you need to be careful to get angry at the right things, like your old self for doing stupid shit that got you to where you are instead of getting angry at the world / people that caused you pain. I find accepting responsability for every shitty thing that happens to me and then using anger to make sure I never do the stupid shit again helps aswell.
