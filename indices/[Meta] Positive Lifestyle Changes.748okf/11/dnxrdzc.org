I highly recommend Prof.Jordan Peterson, he works as a clinical psychologist and he has helped me personally and many of my friends. [[[https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos]]]

Start either from his Personality lectures that he teaches in university: [([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&list=PL22J3VaeABQApSdW8X71Ihe34eKN6XhCi)]]]

Or a channel that collects short clips of him: [([[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9QgwWCNEhDxL1gH-jxa8Q/videos)]]]
