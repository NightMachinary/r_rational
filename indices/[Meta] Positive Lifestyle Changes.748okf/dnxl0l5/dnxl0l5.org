First - What time zone are you in? (I'm PST) I'll tots pop on calls with you (I'll PM my number?). I'm not a shrink or anything, but I go through phases of really needing meaningful human contact, too. And people generally think I say helpful things.

Second - AFAIK, there's a distinct difference between "depression" and "feeling bad". Depression, AFAIK, is a low-energy state; you don't have the oomph to do anything. Feeling bad (like after a break up, or while pining) is a different thing. Which are you experiencing?

I typed up a bunch of crap, but that'd be me telling far more than listening.

Which part of the world are you in?

I read some of your other comments. You're highly physically active. How's your social anxiety / comfort in new situations?

I would definitely look at acroyoga and contact improv; acroyoga is rather more widespread.

Edit: OH ALSO, "Altered Carbon" has some good advice from the character: Get to the next screen.
