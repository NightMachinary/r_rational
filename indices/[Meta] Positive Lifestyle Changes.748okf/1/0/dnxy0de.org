Another way to manage it is to deliberately schedule in Things and Stuff until your days' schedules are noticeably distinct.

Sample of my current week:

- Tuesday: lift weights, run, get some groceries, cook dinner
- Wednesday: go biking, work on essay, bake with groceries from yesterday, leave work Slack open late because of coworkers being in Release Panic Mode
- Tonight: work on essay, meet with person downtown, probably do some studying
- Tomorrow night: probably try to work in a date night with the wife, possibly run

Weekend plans:

- Gym and run
- Probably board-games night with some friends
- Absolutely need to study for stuff, a lot
- Need to start signing up for more meetup groups and attending, due to all my current friends being geographically scattered and having weird schedules
- Bother the other friend whose girlfriend just got out of the hospital with appendicitis. See if I can grab him during his Wed-Thu weekend to do academia stuff

Other than work, gym, and running, things /need/ to be kept varied in order to maintain the density of complex experiences in mundane life.
