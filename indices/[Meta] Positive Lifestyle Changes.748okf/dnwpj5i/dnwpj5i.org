I make it a rule to accept social invitations unless I have a conflict.

On any given night, I feel tired and like I'd rather stay in and read.

The problem is that nights in tend to blur together. The week feels like time flashed by without me doing anything. This really kills my every.

Defaulting to 'yes' breaks that pattern.

A nice side effect is that a reputation for saying yes means thay you'll get invited to more things.
