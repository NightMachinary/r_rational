  I recoginse the signs of some unreliable narration and Naruto's >(Kurama-induced?) rage leading him to take actions he then recognises as wrong but I think you could make it slightly more overt/obvious because I kept second-guessing it.

An interesting thought! But I don't need to make my hidden sekkret plot points obvious, because all of my readers are geniuses who will pick up on them anyway. :)

Well, I mean, I sure hope so. Otherwise there is the risk of me ending this story with all of my readers going "wait what just happened" while one or two people go "well that was straightforward".

  As a specific point about Naruto's perspective: just before his fight with Gaara, was the bug-infusion scene supposed to indicate that it was changing how he thought and making him more aggressive?

Nope. Naruto was going "say what's in this drink" to excuse the fact that the show of friendship from all of his former rivals was making him super emotional.
