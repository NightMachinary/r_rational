*A/N:* That's it for now! I've reached the end of my pre-written material, and although I have planned out the rest of the story long in advance I now need to spend some time to write up the next act. Well, technically we reached the end of act 3 a while ago - probably when Naruto was being trained by Jiraiya - so maybe this is act 3b? I dunno, the act structure has gotten a little wonky.

The point is, there won't be any chapters for a while. In the meantime, please check out Scar's Samsara if you haven't already: It's a finished rational story set in the Lion King universe which features magical kung-fu animals, so it's basically the same as Naruto. :p I have the sequel to this story just about finished, and I'm planning to start posting that while I write up the next act so you guys have something to read while you wait. Needless to say it's incredibly hard to write two stories at the same time, but hopefully I can juggle it and it won't cause any further delays.

I hope to see you guys again soon!
