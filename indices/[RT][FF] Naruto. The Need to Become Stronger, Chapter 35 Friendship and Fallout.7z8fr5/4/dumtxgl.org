Damn it Sophronius! My juvenile mind needs a happy ending to feel truly satisfied. Still a great read though, even when it does paint a bleak picture.

I recoginse the signs of some unreliable narration and Naruto's (Kurama-induced?) rage leading him to take actions he then recognises as wrong but I think you could make it slightly more overt/obvious because I kept second-guessing it. Maybe thats just me prjecting and hes acting like a normal adolescent would.

As a specific point about Naruto's perspective: just before his fight with Gaara, was the bug-infusion scene supposed to indicate that it was changing how he thought and making him more aggressive? Or just a clarity of mind/purpose thing?
