That is why I argued that the Kazekage was pursuing a win-win strategy where the survival of Gaara would still provide him with some benefits even though his death at the hands of another competitor would be preferable.

I would also argue that the idea of a Leaf Genin managing to kill Gaara is not totally unexpected as the current generation is comprised of clan heirs. The idea that one of them would possess enough skill or acquire a sufficiently powerful technique from a family member does not seem that unlikely.

The probability of Gaara dying at the hands of Leaf Genin would only seem to increase as the Chuunin Exams progressed and the full capabilities of Naruto and Sasuke were revealed.
