I am not going to restate my argument on the nature of the Kazekage's plot so I would recommend that you re-read my earlier posts but here are two key points that you may have missed.

1) As part of the general setting rewrite the idea that the Kazekage had been trying and failing to kill his son via the direct attack of elite ninja has been removed. The opposite of the case appears to be present as Gaara explained that he was highly valued by his father even to the point where a boy was killed for spitting on him.

2) Gaara and all the inhabitants of the world are mortal. Any ninja can be killed by a sufficiently skilled foe. All it would take for Gaara to be killed is for a foe with a means of breaching his sand armor to strike a single direct blow. This is a capability that an informed outside observer like the Kazekage could perceive to be conceivably within the reach of the Leaf Genin competing in the exam. (EX: Chidori, Rasengan)
