I see it as the reverse...

If anyone is capable of stopping him and getting away with it, it's Naruto.

Consider... Gaara is the son of the Kage of his village, and is the bearer of a Tailed Beast. Most normal people he can kill and get away with it, like most nobles could with commoners throughout history. Anything else might provoke a war, and what feudal ruler is going to go to war over the life of a peasant?

So what if there was another way, a way to get rid of him while making it 'reasonable', by pitting him against someone of equivalent standing?

Because Naruto is *also* the son of a Kage (mind you, the Fourth is dead, but still). He *too* is the bearer of a Tailed Beast. The fact that they both went into the fight willingly and Gaara escalated it to where he threatened to kill Naruto and his friends means the responsibility of Gaara's death /is on Gaara himself/. The Sand can't argue that the Leaf is crazy for wanting to defend some random person, because they are literally standing up for their equivalent of Gaara.
