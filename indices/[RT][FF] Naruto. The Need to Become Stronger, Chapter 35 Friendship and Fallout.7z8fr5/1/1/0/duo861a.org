This theory is somewhat hampered by the fact that neither the Sand or the Leaf is willing to reveal who their jinchuriki are. Even though the Hokage at least totally knows this already about Gaara. Because ninjas have a pathological need for secrecy, that's why.

Mind you, you /are/ right that Naruto is one of the only people who could walk out of that room with the Hokage after killing Gaara without any consequences (so far), but that's only a benefit from Naruto's perspective.
