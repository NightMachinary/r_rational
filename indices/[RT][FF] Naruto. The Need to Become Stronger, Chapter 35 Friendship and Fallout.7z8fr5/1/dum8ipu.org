Fantastic update as usual.

After reading this a theory that came to mind is the possibility that the death of Gaara is something that was intended by the Kazekage. My thinking is that Gaara had become a significant liability as his violently unstable nature and willingness to disobey orders had overcome the benefits of his power. The Kazekage needed to get rid of him but doing so presented a problem as killing his son would significantly damage his reputation and further alienate him from his heirs. The solution to this problem was to place Gaara in the Chuunin exams and simply let the enemies that Gaara makes among the Leef Genin dispose of him.

The advantage of this plan is that either way the Kazekage stands to benefit. If Gaara manages to survive than he will have undoubtedly have killed enough Leaf Genin and openly violated enough rules to provide the Kazekage with the perfect justification for having him killed. If Gaara is killed than he now can avoid any harm to his reputation and gain profit in the form of restitution from a Konoha that wants to prevent the rash actions of a single Genin from igniting a war.

Anyone have a response to this Theory? I really like the idea that while Naruto perceives his actions as an epic struggle against a force of evil and a rejection of the realpolitik that feeds of the blood of children he is simply acting as a pawn in a political strategy.
