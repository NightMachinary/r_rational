I need more rational Naruto in my life. Ideally, I'd like a complete rational Naruto fic- Lighting Up the Dark was good but I think it's dead. So please don't give up or go dark for too long! Your story is wonderful. As others said, I like how Naruto isn't a bastion of reason come to civilize the savages, and I'm pretty sure that at least one someone is playing him.
