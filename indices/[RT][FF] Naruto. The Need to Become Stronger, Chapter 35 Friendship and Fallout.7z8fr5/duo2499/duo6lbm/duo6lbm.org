Thanks very much for all the praise! It seems a lot of people are starting to like this fic more and more, which is a good sign as my writing should be getting better.

  By the way, did he Sharingan-brainwash Neji in the darkness?
#+end_quote

Hm, an interesting theory. Certainly not one anyone else has brought up so far. :)

  I never totally bought into Naruto's argument that it was his responsibility to deal with Gaara -- it seemed much more like Gaara was an outlet for his frustration and need for agency.
#+end_quote

That's a perceptive point! You're right, Gaara is much more of a 'force of nature' than Haku. Haku represented the rationalist's frustration of having to fight an intelligent, reasonable person who nonetheless insists on being your enemy. Gaara represents more the sheer impossibility of trying to reach out to someone who is not interested in being reasonable at all. If that had not been the case, Naruto would not have needed to kill him. He was the death of Naruto's naive belief that reason is always the answer, basically.

Itachi, of course, is supposed to be genuinely unnerving by virtue of the contrast between how he talks and acts.

  It's actually interesting that Naruto (along with Sasuke and Sakura) is much less reflective than many of the other characters
#+end_quote

Eh, it's not so much that he is unreflective, as that he is a very emotional person who tends to get caught up in the moment. He doesn't always think before he acts, but in between the action he certainly does take the time to wonder about what he is doing why. And it is precisely because he has such a good understanding of his own thoughts that he finds himself despairing at his inability to change the way he acts.

Also, I wouldn't give Shikamaru too much credit: Sure, he's much more intellectual than Naruto, but there'll be a scene from Shikamaru's perspective later where he discovers exactly how crippling his own weaknesses are...

  On that note, do you have a rough estimate of how long this fic will be?
#+end_quote

About 1000 pages in total, probably. 5 acts, so right now we'd be... at 2/rds? Half? These things always tend to grow and grow until they reach George R. R. Martin levels, though...

  P.S. Finally read (and quite enjoyed) Scar's Samsara. Thanks for the reminder!
#+end_quote

Great to hear! I recently reread it as well, and I'm still really proud about the mood I managed to set. At least, I think I did a good job there.
