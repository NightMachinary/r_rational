Alright, your Sasuke has finally won me over. By the way, did he Sharingan-brainwash Neji in the darkness? Kind of suspicious that Neji found common ground with Sasuke after their fight and that he seemed to be more friendly towards Hinata. Maybe this was supposed to be obvious since his eyes were no longer covered when the match ended?

Anyway, on re-reading the Gaara fight I no longer had much of a problem with it. I do think that the Gaara/Naruto dynamic could have been stronger or better motivated, but I'm not really sure what the problem was. I never totally bought into Naruto's argument that it was his responsibility to deal with Gaara -- it seemed much more like Gaara was an outlet for his frustration and need for agency. Maybe Gaara's philosophy could have been more symbolic of the general cruelty of the exam... but I guess you did gesture at that. Much more might have been annoying.

I recently reread the Waves Arc, and noticed that while other characters may not be as clever as Naruto, they have very good introspection and are prodigies at amateur philosophy. They notice the patterns they are acting out and the forces that determine their actions, and so the conflicts feel more meaningful because the antagonists occupy stable philosophical attractors that won't readily converge with Naruto, but aren't obviously dumb. We got a lot of this with Haku and Itachi, and some from Gaara although this was hampered by his instability.

It's actually interesting that Naruto (along with Sasuke and Sakura) is much less reflective than many of the other characters (eg Shikamaru or even Shino, in addition to those I mentioned above). I'm hoping we'll see Team 7 grow in thoughtfulness, and eventually surpass the others by breaking out of their frame / their roles / the Nash equilibria they are in. In any event, the depth to the world and the rest of the cast really makes this story stand out among rational fic. I'm looking forward to your return!

On that note, do you have a rough estimate of how long this fic will be?

P.S. Finally read (and quite enjoyed) Scar's Samsara. Thanks for the reminder!
