Afaik Gaara is a battle-hardened ninja who has fought anbu-level people before. His village wanted him dead and tried to assassinate him multiple times. They then decided they'd just use him as weapon instead. I can't buy this theory. Gaara can't even understand getting wounded and he can do the tailed beast transformation safely if all else fails and no clan kid should be able to beat that.

I can understand ino-shika-cho, but do every clan time their kids to the same year? :s
