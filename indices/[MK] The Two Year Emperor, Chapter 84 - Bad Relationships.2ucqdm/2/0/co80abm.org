I had a feeling this was the case. The earlier discussion on how gods actually have less free will then mortals, and on how they are shaped by their worshipers suggested it.

It's an issue. It can be solved, but it's an issue that by itself serves to counter any attempts to solve it. Her current position means she /needs/ that worship, and having to switch over to others could be difficult.

The best possible choice would probably have been to go to Jake first, and have a suggestion that those who go through the FLEA spend at least a small amount of time worshiping Suze in some kind of benevolent Death aspect. With 60 levels and the need to get at least a 19 Int to cast the spells required, most people would understand the concept of rational self interest enough that having a Goddess personally interested in the survival of her worshipers (which are now as a group and individually the most powerful non-divine beings alive) is in their best interest.

Plus they are all good, so they would have an interest in shifting a traditionally Evil God to Good through worship.

On top of that, I'm surprised that Herrun hasn't tried a bit harder to explain what is going on to Suze, and more thoroughly describe how divinity works. It seems like leaving her to flounder can have some serious negative effects.
