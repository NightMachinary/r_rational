  This question is vaguely offensive, not because you're saying that *you believed the story was bad*, but because you are implying that everyone must have the exact same tastes as you, so that everyone must know exactly *how bad you felt the story was* (without you explaining why *you felt it to be bad*) and so they can respond whether it improved according to your tastes, which you haven't actually explained. Perhaps you should indicate what parts of Twig you like, and which *parts you don't*, so that people can give a better response whether you're likely to consider it improved according to our understanding of your tastes.

  I abbandoned it cause real life kept me away from reading.
