  Does the story gets better from 9 to 14?

This question is vaguely offensive, not because you're saying that you believed the story was bad, but because you are implying that everyone must have the exact same tastes as you, so that everyone must know exactly how bad you felt the story was (without you explaining why you felt it to be bad) and so they can respond whether it improved according to /your/ tastes, which you haven't actually explained.

Perhaps you should indicate what parts of Twig you like, and which parts you don't, so that people can give a better response whether you're likely to consider it improved according to our understanding of your tastes.

EDIT: That having been said, I loved arc 13 the most out of the whole Twig, and probably better than any arc in Worm too.
