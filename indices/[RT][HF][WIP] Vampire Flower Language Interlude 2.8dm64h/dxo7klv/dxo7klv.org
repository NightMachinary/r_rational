Another interlude, giving a quick glimpse into human-vampire relationships and explicitly spelling out the reason for the novel's title in case people didn't already know that the Victorian era had a fad of talking in codes with flowers. From a Watsonian perspective, a human probably found a young vampire's notes and the meme spread; from a Doylist perspective, it must have served as inspiration for the vampire society on some level.

Chapter 3 is titled Jonquil and will drop on the 5th of May, very excited to share it!
