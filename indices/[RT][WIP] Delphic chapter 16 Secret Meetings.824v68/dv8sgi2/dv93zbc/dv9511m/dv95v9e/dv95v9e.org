There are nukes now in the Delpic-verse. There were not nukes yet in the 1940s. The WMD used to end war in the Pacific was the upsilon beam, and it wasn't nearly as awe-inspiring.

To answer one question from last week and pointedly ignore your other musings here: the lukewarm end to the European theater combined with the drawn-out, bloody victory in the Pacific theater was why Truman did not have the support to beat Dewey in '48.

I really, really want to say more... but I think I should save it for the story.
