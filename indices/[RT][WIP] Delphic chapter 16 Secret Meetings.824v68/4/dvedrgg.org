Criticism is very good! I'm appreciating the honest feedback I've seen on this thread.

It also looks like the thread has received a couple of downvotes. I presume that reflects a couple of people who were unhappy with the story (or just the chapter). If they have not already, I would love to get feedback from them as well. I consider myself a very inexperienced writer and am looking for as much constructive criticism as I can get.
