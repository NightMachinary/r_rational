Wait, wait, wait. Do nukes exist in the Delphic-verse? A site-based Google search turns up no mention of nukes or nuclear power at all.

Are /supers/ the apocalyptic power everyone's afraid to let loose that's deterred great-power war if there aren't any nukes? The supers we've seen so far are relatively innocuous - not enough to deter a Third Reich that controlled everything from Brittany to Crimea. Supers capable of doing that would make Superman look tame - something like Scion and the Endbringers from Worm. Moreover they would have likely had to demonstrate their power at least once, and each nation claiming to have a deterrent super would have to publicly make such a demonstration.

It also means the balance of power is far more tenuous than in the real world. Supers can be killed, die naturally with time, and new ones can emerge. Which means any great power with deterrent capable supers might at any point come to believe it has the capability to gain a decisive advantage over its opponents.

And if /Germany/ is the counter-weight to American power, and a German-aligned super-villain team recently assassinated a healing super - that might just be the opening gambit in a bid to cripple American super-deterrence by first destroying their ability to heal any damage done in the next round.

Hah - this just went from bank robbers playing mercenary for an evil corporation to the opening act of WW3.
