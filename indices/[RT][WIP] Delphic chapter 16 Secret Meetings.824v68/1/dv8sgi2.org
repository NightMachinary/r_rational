Echo the other comment about Hector's response to Polarity confirming that she's here for him and just waiting for the takedown order. I'm confused as to what crimes the CIA thinks Delphic has been committing. Maybe just association with the Doc, maybe they're just feeding Polarity a justification she would accept, maybe something else.

As for the extra bits of alt-history that were dropped, /goddamn/ is that a bigger fork from our time line than I was expecting. I guess I was too optimistic thinking it was Korea that turned against the Allies and not WW2 itself. Definitely makes me think more of the theory that America's relative standing in the world is diminished, and with the USSR having apparently collapsed before or near the end d of WW2, there would have been no Cold War at all to make Americans fiercely loyal to the idealized vision of liberal democracy that would stave off dynastic power. If I'm reading it right, Germany de facto won WW2, annexed northern France and most of Eastern Europe, and then the Empire collapsed due to internal resistance in the form of nationalistic, but democratic separatist movements? Seems kind of a weird combination to rise up in the face of a triumphant fascism. And since the Allies apparently never made it into the German interior, did they ever discover the concentration camps and the holocaust?

Is Germany still then the post-Anschluss union of Germanic states, or was the collapse total back to post WW1 borders? I wonder how the war in the Pacific went.
