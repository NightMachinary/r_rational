Fourthing this! It's confirmation of his worst fear about them (which almost paralysed him when talking with them before), but he treats it as though he was already pretty sure of it and was fine with it (even though there hasn't been anything suggested that he can /do/ about them, physically?). Either that or it hadn't sunk in yet and he's going to wake up in a cold sweat later, but he was thinking enough about it that that didn't sound to be the case.

If they come after him and he unleashes secret safeguards that we haven't heard about (which have been giving him extra confidence, and which he presumably hadn't told even his sister about?), I will be pleasantly surprised. If they come after him and he's caught blindsided and ruefully captured, I will be... annoyed.
