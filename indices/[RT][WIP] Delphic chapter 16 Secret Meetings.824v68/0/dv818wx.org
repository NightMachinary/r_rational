I'm sorry if this comes out wrong, but if I knew that there was a "seed asset" near me that was preparing to take me out, I would be wayyyyyy the fuck more freaked out. Like, what the actual fuck. "Oh, we are here to take you down, specifically," and then Hector goes, "Oh, huh, thats interesting, anyways, back to work." THIS IS WHAT GTFO GRAB BAGS AND SITUATIONS ARE FOR. This calls for a bugout bag asap and getting the fuck out of dodge. Like, "the wheels are not turning any faster than usual", I mean yeah, but like, what the fuck. I would bugout faster than somebody could blink. It makes no sense to stay at all. Inform Paris, and then bugout now, rather than when you get the knock on the door.
