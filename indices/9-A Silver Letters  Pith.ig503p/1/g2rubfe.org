I'm glad that Ana managed to, if not stand up to Lorne, at least risk losing his patronage before she got outed. She found her line and refused to cross it, she won't have to wonder "how far would I have gone, if Lorne had kept pushing me, if it hadn't all gone to pieces?"

I'm hopeful that this results in Ana (and the rest of them, but mostly Ana) turning on Paragon. I'd be surprised if they straight-up joined Tunnel Vision, but I can see them becoming more aware of the inequality and injustices that their society is built on when they no longer have anything to gain from supporting the status quo. Ana /desperately/ needs some class consciousness and this might just push her in that direction. Shame it'll likely ruin things with Tasia though.
