Well, /relatively/ passive. I'm sort of assuming that if you can get away with writing scripts to automate away work then you have lax enough management that you can do whatever else you want, which /does/ include a large variety of interesting projects. If people expect you to be at your desk in the back office all day anyway, there's no reason that you can't be sitting there coding up whatever your interesting project is (aside from possible legal issues).

If what you want is to be working in a wood shop, or hiking the Adirondacks, this solution to gaining money without doing much work is less ideal.
