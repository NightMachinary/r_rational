Honestly, I would probably get an office job where I could work with lots and lots of Excel files. Then I would automate away my job with scripts and not tell anyone that's what I was doing. Then I would just come to work, run my scripts, and surf the internet or write, both of which I would be doing at home anyway. This would necessitate a fairly inefficient company with a lax IT policy. It would also probably require some lies, and I'm not great at lying.
