  I suspect a lot of those problems have gone away, like being locked into a single OS. This system would definitely be running in userspace.

1. There's lots of systems like that running in userspace. They're more or less impenetrable to third party platforms, you end up with lock-in to a specific language or even application framework within a language instead of to an OS, which is hardly an improvement.

2. Why would you put your stream file content inside this virtual file system instead of the underlying stream file that's already there?
