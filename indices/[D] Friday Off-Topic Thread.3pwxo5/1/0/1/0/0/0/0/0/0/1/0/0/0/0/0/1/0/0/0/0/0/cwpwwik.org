  I kind of don't think that file formats and file systems are the blocker in this problem.

Yeah, but then I understood what he was on about -- he wanted simultaneous editing. In this thread he started with filesystems, shifted to in-memory caching, then shifted again to microservices and "shared memory RPC" (whatever that is). I can't figure out what he's actually looking to accomplish. Apparently I'm not the only one, which is reassuring.

I'm actually somewhat seriously wondering if we're looking at a chatbot...there's a lot of computer-related terms and phrases ("But premature optimization is harmful") being thrown around, but they don't fit together coherently. I give it a low probability, but not zero.
