#+begin_quote
  On first access that needs to perform bitmap operations, as opposed to exporting it to (say) a video player app.
#+end_quote

On first access of the pixels attribute, which is more or less the same thing.

#+begin_quote
  And it's not a PNG, it's a capnproto structure that contains compressed bitplanes that can be copied directly into a PNG.
#+end_quote

The distinction is unclear to me.

#+begin_quote
  That's also a good time to run the garbage collector.
#+end_quote

That is the garbage collector? Or the end results thereof.

#+begin_quote
  You only need to convert the compressed arrays to pixel arrays if you're using an accessor that requires you to do operations on the array that require uncompressing it.
#+end_quote

I think we're both talking about pretty much the same thing here. Compressed data, accessors transform them into things like pixel arrays, decompressing as parts of the data are accessed.

Of course specific memory management stuff is left to the particular accessors implementation.
