  It would probably overwrite the jpeg entirely.
#+end_quote

You wouldn't do that. If the object was originally a jpeg, you're probably going to want to use it as a jpeg some time, and as long as you have the storage there's no reason to throw it away.

#+end_quote

diffs for any highly compressed/globally compressed format are unlikely to be smaller than the original.
