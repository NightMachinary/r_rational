In theory they could be. "Start at byte 0xDEADBEEF, change the next 27 bytes to <foo>"

In practice, it's doubtful it would work. Even if it did, you'd have many of the same issues that you run into with backups and VCSes -- lose your base, you're hosed. Lose one change, you're hosed. Applying all the changes takes time. Base + changes takes substantially more storage than base. Probably more issues that I'm not thinking of offhand.
