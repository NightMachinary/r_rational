I don't think data is nearly that highly compressed in most cases. The changes might be trivial for something the size of a jpeg, but imagine a movie. Surely sending the diffs for a single frame, or a few frames, would be a lot cheaper then resending the entire movie?

Let's say you add subtitles, as pixels, not text, because you're a jerk. How many data block do you really think that's going to touch, even with compression?

I don't imagine that the compression algorithms are so efficient that you'd be touching /every/ block.

Should be pretty easy to test though.
