We do still need to save to disk at some point, and we might as well save in a known compressed format. Probably not jpeg though.

The alternative is using generic compression and just compressing the pixel array?

In that case you can just store the pixel array without any fancy accessor.

That would be a lot better for a lot of use cases I'm sure, but imagine trying to do that to a video? Sometimes specialized compression is needed.

I'd like this to at least start off being somewhat compatible with actual filesystems. The rawData attribute might by a symlink-equivalent to a real file sometimes.

I want to support the most flexibility, and part of that is accessors for things like jpegs, although hopefully mostly pngs.

If the issue is the specific case of jpegs, that jpegs are lossy, then I don't disagree. Jpeg is a terrible format, and people should use png.

It was probably a poor example. Just pretend I've been saying png if that's the problem.
