  What you probably need is a pluggable parser engine where vendors contribute their file spec and the engine can read the spec and generate the appropriate parser.

I'm imagining those as accessors, filling a similar role as FUSE filesystems. Pandas has objects that represent spreadsheets, with standard spreadsheets tools and all that.

They also have a "csv" attribute, a "xlsx" attribute, a "json" attribute, etc. Reading a csv file into into the csv attribute populates the spreadsheet object with all of its columns, in a common representation.

I'm imagining a similar system, but the csv, xlsx, and json accessors could all be different programs.
