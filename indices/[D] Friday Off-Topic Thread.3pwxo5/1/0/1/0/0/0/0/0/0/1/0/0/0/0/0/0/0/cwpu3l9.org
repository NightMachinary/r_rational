That's more of a reason to ban jpeg. We want to give users choice in as much as possible, which means not mandating that kind of thing.

I'd also like to avoid writing "canonical" implementations of accessors. We want a bizarre of accessors, and that means that accessors have to more or less manage their own memory and support multiple languages. Making them simply a capnproto RPC call has a very simple elegance that's appealing.
