Thanks for continuing to pick this apart

  because file systems are demonstrably not single-process.

Sorry, rather /files/ are practically limited to a single process. Although inotify comes a fair way towards making that fixable.

Does that make the rest make sense?

  When I say "file system", I'm using it in the classic Unix sense. [...] What are you using it to mean?
#+end_quote

I mean that I think unix-style filesystems are problematic. Basically, it's a tree data structure where every leaf node is a binary blob. This makes having more then one program interact with a file/blob at a time very annoying.

But yes, we could probably hack a better solution onto the existing structure. Maybe some kind of shared-memory mmap based thing. But I'd prefer it if we didn't insist that all leaf nodes were binary blobs to begin with.
