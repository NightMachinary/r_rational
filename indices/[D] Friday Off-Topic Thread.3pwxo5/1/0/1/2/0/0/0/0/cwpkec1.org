Cool thanks that clears things up, I like the idea of offering easy to use views of underlying data structures. Like a more general FUSE.

Also sorry for misinterpreting your reference to "the speed of grep". I pattern-matched on "at the speed of ___" being often used for fast things like "at the speed of light" and that sounded reasonable enough since in some contexts grep is really fast, as far as anything linear goes it is really optimized and can do gigabytes in seconds. It was just a different usage pattern that made the speed difference, so it didn't seem wrong enough for me to question it. I'm aware of Steel Manning, although I learned it as "the principle of charity" and I'll try and pay more attention to it whenever I make inferences about ambiguous references in the future.
