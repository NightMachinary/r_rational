Databases are pretty slow, because they're indexed. This has a lot in common with a document database (particularity rethinkDB) but it's not. You couldn't put any type of socket in a document database, as an example (Although I've seen at least one guy try to stream video over rethink).

Why aren't we using databases instead of filesystems? Part of it is that they tend to have fixed schema, or just be too slow because they focus on fast indexing.

A lot of apps store sqlite in a file system, wouldn't the reverse be better? Storing binary blobs in a database?

Well no, because databases aren't optimized for that.

Imagine search at the speed of grep, but data structures similar to a document store.

Or, to put it another way, right now a filesystem is a tree data structure where all of the leaf nodes are binary blobs. Why binary blobs instead of a more nuanced data structure?

  You need some kind of server to stop everyone from getting all the data.

A permission system. Like unix, or any file system. Postgres is working on per-row security. It's not really relevant.
