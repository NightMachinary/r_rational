  One thing I would like is to just have an easy, reliable way to link multiple devices together.

I have some [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nkz2y/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/cvp34mz][long rants]] around here somewhere about this. I think filesystems are the problems, because they're inherently single process. We need a filesystem alternative that syncs across the network and that multiple programs/people can use at once. I think it would solve a lot of problems.

Talking to [[/r/rational]] about it was very helpful in figuring out where I was communicating badly and narrowing down on some implementation details. [[/u/eaglejarl]]'s stuff about function blocks and [[/u/trishume]]'s stuff about capnproto.
