I very suddenly went from no romantic involvement with anyone to a slightly awkward situation.

A few months ago, I met an Italian guy online. Since then, we've played games and chatted/skyped several times a week. We're both bi, which will become relevant in a bit.

This week was my first week of university classes (compsci, though that's not really relevant). During lunch on Wednesday, a Chinese girl sat with me and we spent the rest of the lunch break and the next class together with a friend of hers. We didn't see each other on Thursday because our schedules didn't overlap, but we spent most of Friday together as well. The whole time, I had a vague impression that she had a crush on me.

We started texting that evening, and she told me she liked me. I responded, saying it's mutual (which is true). Meanwhile, I was chatting with my Italian friend and relating my conversation with her to him.

After that ended (she went to bed), he told me he had something to tell me and confessed to liking me, which he felt weird about because we have never met and he didn't even know what I looked like. We started a video call shortly thereafter, and the first thing he said was "Oh my god you're cute" (wording may have been different). That's when I realized the feeling was mutual.

In light of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vkeqf/q_rational_polyamory_fanfics/][this]] not-so-recent discussion, I brought up the idea of /not/ choosing one or the other of them. He was rather receptive to the idea, but I haven't gotten a chance to talk to the girl in person and won't until Monday.

Do you have any advice that you feel I should know?
