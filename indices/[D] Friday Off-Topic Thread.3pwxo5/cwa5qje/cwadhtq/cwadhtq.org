I had a bizarre experience in Psychology 101 where, in the unit on psychoactive drugs, my professor brought up NZT as if it were real, and showed a clip from Limitless, describing it as a fictional depiction of the drug. I looked it up on the internet later, hoping to obtain and exploit it, only to discover that my professor had lied to us all, and NZT was in fact a fictional plot device invented for Limitless.
