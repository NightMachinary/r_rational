  the same old crime procedural formula

I hate this. Yet, at the same time, I'm loving GitS: Stand Alone Complex.

It seems to be more focused on the overarching plot, which I've always wanted to see in shows... The last episode was entirely a VR chatroom discussion about the arc villain, and it managed to be engaging. But at the same time there are still the episodic procedural episodes. I suppose it's due to plot fatigue. Entire shows full of episodic procedural are bad, but episodic episodes interspersing arc episodes are less samey.

Is it safe to skip the entire first season of Person of Interest? Where does the show start to break free?
