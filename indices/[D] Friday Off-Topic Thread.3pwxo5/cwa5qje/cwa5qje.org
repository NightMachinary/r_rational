The /Limitless/ TV show is really disappointing me, even though I thought I was prepared to be disappointed. I'm half-tempted to write some fanfic that fixes all of the issues that could have been addressed in the second episode, but I'm not sure how easy of a salvage operation that would be. They're trying to create an overarching plot, but it doesn't really make sense because of how slow it's all moving.

I don't /really/ think that this is a case of writers trying to write someone that they're stupider than, it's more the limitations of the format that was chosen and the demands of writing to a general audience (and writing for "total satisfaction" rather than "logic", one of the key reasons that works of fiction end up irrational).
