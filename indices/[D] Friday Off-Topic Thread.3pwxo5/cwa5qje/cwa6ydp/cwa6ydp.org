On the other hand/continent, the /One Punch Man/ anime is stellar. In case you haven't heard of it, it's about a superhero who has become so powerful he always defeats his opponents in a single blow, and his struggles and boredom with being the strongest man on earth. In episode three some bad guys learn the protagonists are coming to their base, and activate all their trap rooms in their eight-floor tower. The heroes arrive, and the self-appointed sidekick promptly /annihilates/ the entire structure from the outside without even trying to enter.

Anime of the season for sure, not that there's much competition.
