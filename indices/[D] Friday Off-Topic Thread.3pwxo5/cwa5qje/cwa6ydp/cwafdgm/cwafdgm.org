Agreed this season's rather lame but One Punch Man is definitely the best one on it. If you liked that dungeon bypass you may also enjoy Fate/Zero, it has a very similar scene thanks to a 'mage killer' that uses modern tech and dirty tactics to take advantage of mage's lack of common sense and genre savvyness.
