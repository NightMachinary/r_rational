Anyone have suggestions for a moderate sized sub/reddit for discussing both writing AND illustrating fiction together? multimedia stuff in general?

I feel like I could use a place to go over my projects and things without being stuck talking just art, or just writing and I don't really make comics...

So it's confusing.
