I love operating system design and software architecture, but it's not really something you can get a job in easily as a highschool dropout with less then a decade of experience.

I make a lot of money doing web-dev, and it's even relatively painless if I stick to django. It's a very very big market, and you'll never want for employment.

User Experience is very interesting. It's got to be my second favorite in general. Right now user experience means "how to make things pretty" to a lot of people. But I think good UX shouldn't hide the nuts and bolts. It should present a gradual learning curve that ends with you being a competent programmer yourself.

Raising the sanity waterline and all that. I think that a big part of avoiding automated tyranny is making computers stop being magic boxes for most people. They need to be able to make informed decisions.

With VR/AR gaining a lot of support, UX is probably going to be a big thing, since none of our existing (kinda shitty) UI paradigms really work in 3D. Take a look at things like eaglemode as an example of a completely different set of UI paradigms.

Plus, that general skillset has a nice fallback in webdev and gamedev.
