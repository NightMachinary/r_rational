The monday and friday thread kind of blur together for me.

If you were a software dev of middling competence, what would you do to make a relatively passive income? What would you do if you were a highly competent dev?

I've seen a few interesting "super resolution" algorithms, and I can't help but think that there's a market for them. Sure, they tend to make things look a bit airbrushed, and they won't let you "enhance" a picture of a drivers license, the text would be statistical inference and not accurate.

But I think there's at least one industry that would pay for that as a service. There are some open source libraries and well known research papers that should be able to get better then bicubic filters.
