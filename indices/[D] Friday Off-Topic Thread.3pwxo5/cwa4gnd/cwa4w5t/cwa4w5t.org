I was out with a bunch of friends the other day and I thought to myself, /There's eight people here and every one of us has a smartphone. There's got to be something really cool that I can do with that, but I have no idea what./

My first idea was to work out a way to get really, really nice audio by placing people's phones in strategic locations and synchronize them somehow, but I have no real knowledge of audio engineering. I also thought that you should be able to take 3D group photos by having two people -- two phones -- take the shot at once, but there's lots of messy edge cases there too.

One thing I would like is to just have an easy, reliable way to link multiple devices together. I shouldn't have to setup a server on my laptop to have my phone talk to it, they both have built-in antennas, the option should just be /there/.
