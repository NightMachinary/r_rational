  It should save the jpeg after a while of inactivity, I think.

Why? Unless you know that you're going to need the data in JPEG format, you should never create it. If you /do/ ever create it (instead of, say, PNG) for any reason then odds are you are going to need it again, and only then should it be saved in that format.
