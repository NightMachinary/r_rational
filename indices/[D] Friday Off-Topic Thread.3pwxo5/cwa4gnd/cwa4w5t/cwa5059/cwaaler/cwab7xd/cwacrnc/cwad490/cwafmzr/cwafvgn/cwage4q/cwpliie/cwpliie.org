  There's lots of systems like that running in userspace. They're more or less impenetrable to third party platforms, you end up with lock-in to a specific language or even application framework within a language instead of to an OS, which is hardly an improvement.

I really like capnproto. We'll see if that can address some of those problems.

  Why would you put your stream file content inside this virtual file system instead of the underlying stream file that's already there?

There are costs to splitting things between two different api's. Mostly just to unify the address space honestly. But it would also let you register a callback to a file changing, like a nicer interface to inotify.

It would also let you use an equivalent to fuse filesystems. Something that would take a jpeg and translate it to a byte array, as an example.
