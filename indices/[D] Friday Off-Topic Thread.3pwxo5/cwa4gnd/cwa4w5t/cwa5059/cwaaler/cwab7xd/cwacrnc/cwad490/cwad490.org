Interesting. I haven't heard of that. Any google-able word?

I think that flexible typing is pretty important here. Programs should be very open about what they accept. If all I wanted was a simple binary protocol, I could do that damn easily today. Take capnproto, serialize to a file.

You know about duck-typing in python? An object is an iterator (thing that can be treated as a list) if it has the right methods for a list. I'm imagining a similar level of flexibility in your data structures.

A 3D scene is composed of some textures, some vector arrays, some metadata.
