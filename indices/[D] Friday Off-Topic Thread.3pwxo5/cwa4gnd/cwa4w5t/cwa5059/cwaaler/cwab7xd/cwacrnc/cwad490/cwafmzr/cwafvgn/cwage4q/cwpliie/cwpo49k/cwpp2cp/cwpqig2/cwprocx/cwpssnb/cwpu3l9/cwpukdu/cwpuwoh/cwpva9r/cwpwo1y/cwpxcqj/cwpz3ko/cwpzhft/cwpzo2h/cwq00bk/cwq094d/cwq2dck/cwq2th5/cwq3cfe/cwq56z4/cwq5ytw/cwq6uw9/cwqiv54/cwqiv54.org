  On first access of the pixels attribute, which is more or less the same thing.

Depends. If the access is simply a copy, and the target is a compatibly compressed structure (eg, for export), there's no reason to do anything but a byte copy.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

A PNG is not a capnproto structure. Capnproto is not just "we have a hierarchical structure and accessors". It's also a data format that can be imported/exported purely by reading/writing, and mapped directly to memory and used in-situ.
