  I don't really see how it's less efficient then a syscall to read from disk though.

I didn't say that. I am not making any comparison with using a syscall to read from disk. I'm saying that using a stream-based format (JPEG) for anything other than import and export is horribly inefficient compared to using /only/ a format optimized for direct access. And that using such a format is where most of the advantages of capnproto come from.
