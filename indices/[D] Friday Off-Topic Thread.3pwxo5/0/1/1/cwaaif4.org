So far they've been devoting about five minutes out of every episode to the overarching plot, which I'm hoping increases as the season goes on. They've got all the ingredients for something interesting; there's a smart guy roped into a shadowy conspiracy by an even smarter and more powerful guy who has significant leverage and a whole host of secrets. But they're taking too long to get there and I'm losing patience. More worryingly, they're losing viewers, which is a good way to get cancelled before getting to the interesting stuff.
