Things start picking up towards the end of season 1. The episodic plots all sort of began connecting together into something more coherent and intetrsting. If I were you I would begin watching halfway through season 1 and see how you like it.

In season 2 and 3 the show starts following a much more overarching plot. It ends up being more of a sci-fi show disguised as a criminal procedural.
