Ok.

I'm trying to figure out exactly how I want shards to work in this story and also whether the Undersiders should show up at all or to keep things entirely in the HP universe but with worm powers for some reason. Or just have the Undersiders be teenage wizards who decided to fight wizard crime for some reason. And then Hermione is like their Taylor I guess. So...I'll message you.

Also whether there should be an overarching plot or basically just a series of adventures.
