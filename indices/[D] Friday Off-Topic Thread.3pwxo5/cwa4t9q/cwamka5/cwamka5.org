I've found that I actually enjoy romance, I just hate the stupid, petty drama that comes with it in most original fiction. Most of the romance I read is the fluffy fanfic kind since I know going in that I'll like the characters/pairing and that there's a good chance that there isn't going to be too much drama.

If you like Zuko/Katara then [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5306755/1/Enslaved][Enslaved]] is a decent one. It avoids the usual cliches because Zuko's the one taken prisoner by Katara. It's incomplete but it ends at a point that feels like a pretty satisfying ending.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2431040][Humanoids]] is a Mass Effect femShep/Liara pairing that also has some very interesting worldbuilding to it. It follows the premise of "what if humanity had developed sentient AI, and then something happened so all the organics died out before humanity discovered the mass relays". All of the human characters, including Shepard, are replaced by androids. It does have smut though in case that bothers you.

I also like some romance anime. As far as that goes, Nana is easily the most realistic romance story I've seen in fiction, though it does have quite a bit of drama. Though unfortunately the source material is on hiatus so the anime will probably never see a proper ending. The main character is far from rational though and makes many mistakes, though to be fair they're the kinds of mistakes many people in real life make.

For fluffy romcom, I'd recommend Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. The focus is more on the comedy than the romance and the romance doesn't go anywhere quickly at all, but it's pretty funny, especially if you're familiar with the tropes of shoujo manga and anime.

Ouran High School Host Club is a pretty hilarious romcom. It's one of the most consistently recommended romcoms on [[/r/anime]] so I think it has pretty broad appeal even to men.

Eureka Seven is a mecha anime that also has a pretty nice romance as a major subplot/main plot. The main character's kind of annoying at first, but he gets better about a fifth of the way into the show. I liked both the primary couple and the side couple of Dominic/Anemone. Whatever you do, though, don't watch the sequel anime (Eureka Seven Ao).
