Do you, or have you ever, read (non-pornographic) romance stories (as opposed to adventure stories that happen to contain romance)? Which would you estimate to be your favorites? ([[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1xu1zn/d_romance_in_rationalist_fiction/][Have you found any to be particularly rational(ist)?]])

/Short answer:/

When I first discovered fanfiction (a few months before the completion of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/, in early 2011), most of my reading was NaruHina "fluff"--romance with hardly any plot to it. After reading /Time Braid/ and realizing the true awesomeness of fanfiction, I mostly switched to adventure, and looked for romance stories only when I couldn't find any good adventure stories, particularly in less-popular fandoms. /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8440324][Little Moments]]/ (/Ben 10/: Ben/Gwen--better than it sounds) is definitely my favorite romance-focused story, and [[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/8][Chapter Eight of /Background Pony/]] (/Friendship Is Magic/: Lyra/OMC--/absolutely heart-wrenching/) is probably my second-favorite. Some others that I've liked:

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3910130][Study of the Heart]]/ (/Naruto/: Sai/Sakura)

- The /Stalking Zuko/ trilogy ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7250783][1]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7325839][2]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8121138][3]]) (/Avatar/: Katara/Zuko--bad English is excusable because it's the diary of Katara the filthy peasant)

- /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19567][Then Tomorrow Came]]/ (/Friendship Is Magic/: Twilight/Rainbow)

- /[[http://www.fimfiction.net/story/180647][And They Call It Puppy Love]]/ (/Friendship Is Magic/: OFC/OMC)

- /[[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/f/fitzgerald/f_scott/gatsby/index.html][The Great Gatsby]]/ (original)

None are particularly rational, though, in my very limited estimation.
