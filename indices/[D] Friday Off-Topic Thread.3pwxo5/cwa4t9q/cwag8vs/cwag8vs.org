Nope. Or at least, not usually. I like reading about Interesting People, and one of my primary criteria for determining what qualifies as interesting is that they have interesting conflicts, and Romance rarely qualifies if it's the only thing the charachters are really conflicted about. That's not to say I haven't ever read romance stories, or adventure stories that get so fluffy they're borderline, but i never go explicate looking for the stuff.
