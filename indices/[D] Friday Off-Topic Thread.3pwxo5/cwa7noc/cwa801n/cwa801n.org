    Harry realizes he has...

  Too easy.

  It has been more than two years since the death of Voldemort, and only months since the purging of Azkaban. Harry and Hermione are on summer vacation in Portugal, looking forward to having the same DADA professor as last year while Mad Eye finishes hunting down the rest of Voldemort's horcuxes on Earth. There is a mysterious explosion resulting in someone who appears to have superpowers, and Hermione acquiesces to Harry's pleas to change their plans and check it out.

  While there they meet a young woman studying abroad on a scholarship for a degree in fashion design, who also is also interested in this new superhero and who Harry finds eerily wise, though she obviously knows nothing about the Wizarding World.

  While the trio are looking into the superhero situation (its still unclear what happened, and this Taylor person is much better at interfacing with the locals) H&H interfere with spies or something trying to abduct the superhero by identifying another wizard and convincing them to help since they can't use magic as underage wizards. Despite their best efforts, however, Taylor begins to catches on and, after a phone call back to America for reassurance, decides to follow-up on this, hoping it's just herself going crazy again. (Harry almost wishes he could Oblivate the muggle, but Hufflepuff reminds him that it ought to be an Unforgivable.) Taylor decides to spend the night with a friend who lives nearby, and offers them a place to stay since they ended up so far from their hotel. Herimone agrees since she doesn't want to spend the night in Harry's trunk, and Harry quietly tries to plan how to continue the investigation without giving away the Wizarding World and bringing down an obliviation on Taylor's head.

  Then something interesting happens the next day.

  I am taking this way too seriously.
