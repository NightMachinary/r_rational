Complex explanations of how magic and psionics between those two worlds interact and if there's a link between the big players in Worm and the magicians in HPMOR. As in, do they have a common ancestor? Were mages planned to be devoured or are antagonists of Worm's big players? What if mages were a backup plan in case the Worm entities didn't manage to defeat the superheros? Or what if there was a third one that created the mages and had nefarious purposes?
