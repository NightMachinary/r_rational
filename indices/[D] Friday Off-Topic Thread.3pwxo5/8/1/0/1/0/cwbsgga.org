What do you think works better, Hermione forming SPEWW (the Society for the Pulverization of Evil Wizards and Witches) with Gilderoy Lockhart and fighting a series of villains with worm-themed powers, or Hermione joining the wizarding equivalent of the Undersiders with a cockroach Animagus, a guy who invented Peruvian instant darkness powder, a Seer, and whatever other BS mappings I can think of? To also fight a series of villains yadda yadda.
