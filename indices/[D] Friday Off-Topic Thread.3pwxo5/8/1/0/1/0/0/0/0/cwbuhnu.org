Gilderoy is /sort of/ a Stranger and I can see him working in that context. But he's also comic relief, which means that it's harder to get him to map to anyone in Worm (because Worm has practically no comic relief). I guess I can see him grafted into Armsmaster, if you want to collide some personalities together.
