And now I ask myself if I scrap all the stuff with Gilderoy or have the Undersiders be a youth wing of SPEWW a la Taylor's warlord stuff with, what's her name, Forest? And Sierra Mist? Or have Gilderoy be some HP variant of Armsmaster, or maybe just scrap it all.

Actually, Gilderoy is basically the Wizarding equivalent of a Stranger, isn't he?
