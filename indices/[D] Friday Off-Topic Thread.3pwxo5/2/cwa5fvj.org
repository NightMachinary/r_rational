[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW9q6J4uPYs][This song]] is liquid happiness.

I'm still trying to figure out what "specialty" of Computer Science I should study while an undergrad. ML/AI is the hot thing in this subreddit for obvious reasons, but I'd rather focus on the human side -- it won't matter how smart the adviser is if the king doesn't listen to him.

We're finally coming up on truly efficient human structures -- Uber's ride-sharing technology and methodology is the kind of thing that I am very glad to see and what I want to see more of. It's one high-quality app which enables, essentially, a paradigm shift. However, I can also look over at cybersecurity and say *HOLY SHIT THIS IS MISSON CRITICAL AND THERE'S SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT NOW.* Which is better? And that's just two rough career paths out of like twenty I have access to. How the hell do I narrow it /at all/? Enrollment for next year is just two weeks away.

UFAI is way less scary than an entity which is only half as dangerously intelligent but led by humans, and around an infinity times more likely. We're practically there already. I fully expect to live to be a hundred at least, and I want as little unhappiness in all those years as possible.

The only thing I really, really, truly want out of life is to spend the rest of my life with my SO while not living under some sort of inevitable automated tyranny. What to do in the meantime?
