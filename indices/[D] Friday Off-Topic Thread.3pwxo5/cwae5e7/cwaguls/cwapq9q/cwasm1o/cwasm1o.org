Oh, so you want a junk food approach to fiction, a pandering /to baser instincts/ rather than something like in-group pandering (which for this sub would be something like dropping game theory into the middle of a story).

I was saying that for me, it's those points of interface, where I can see that there's some sort of ... resonance, where you find the points where the stories complement each other and the whole thing just sings in harmony. So Snape was bullied as a kid by people who everyone thought were "the good ones", as was Taylor, so either putting one in the place of the other or arranging a meeting between the two? That's the kind of thing that makes me squee with unreasonable delight.

But my problem is that there's not too much of that delicious resonance between the two series.
