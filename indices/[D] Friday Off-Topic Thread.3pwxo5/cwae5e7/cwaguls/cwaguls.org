If you're going to include Harry, Hermione, Draco, etc., I would prefer that they were aged up. Eleven and twelve are not the sorts of ages that most people can write well, and it detracts from more serious and complex plots, as well as cutting off most of the romance angles (because you can write a romance between twelve year olds, but it's going to lack gravity /in addition to/ squicking a fair number of people out).

I'm having trouble figuring out where there are compelling points of interface between the settings. I suppose the Harry Potter series shares the theme of bullying with Worm (with some parallels between Snape and Taylor), but not much of that carries over to HPMOR. The magic systems aren't really compatible; wizards are mostly fungible while parahumans are singleton. They both have elements of raging against the system and munchkinism under constraints, but I don't know what you really add by adding them together.
