Lots of experimentation.

Every Worm character spends ages working out tricks they can do with their power, and every power has hidden depths that can crack it wide open.

On the other hand, every HPMOR character has an almost limitless supply of specific, physics-breaking Things they can do with a little training, and (in canon HPMOR) the characters have to make do with "low-level" spells and think of clever alternative applications based on the details of their effects.
