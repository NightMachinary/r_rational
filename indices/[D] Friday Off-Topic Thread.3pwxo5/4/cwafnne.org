This week got an amazing idea for a rationalist book that plan to make on Transhumanism but still need to get the time to tackle the challenge. I consider myself below average with words but tend to find trouble getting a plot going without going to extremes (if I'm enjoying the comedy it ends up as a parody, if I'm making it about despair it ends up being a hopeless story) so want to get the planning right before starting it.

Got all the plots done and know how it will end, currently need to set aside some time to read about how to make a successful book and perhaps practice with some fanfiction.

Also my plan for a rational Madoka: Rebellion Story doujin is going well, minus the fact I suck at drawing and trying to get it solved. Made my first drawing of the cover but it took lots of time to complete, hope to get better at it and work faster.
