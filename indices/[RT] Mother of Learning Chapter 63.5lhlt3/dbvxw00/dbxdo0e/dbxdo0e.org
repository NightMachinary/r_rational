I have another idea for simulacrum abuse.

Simulacra share Zorian's mana supply. If simulacra were to do the mana-regeneration meditation procedure near the Cyoria well they should be able to regenerate Zorian's mana in parallel.

We have not yet seen any range limitation on maintaining the simulacra, or a numerical limit on the number he could maintain at once.

The apparent lack of a range limitation should allow Zorian to effectively bypass the constraints on mana use when far away from a mana well.

As Zorian can maintain a number of simulacra simultaneously while being principally concerned with their use of mana-intensive spells rather than any sort of constant mana draw, and on the other hand Zorian can regenerate his entire mana reserves in a matter of minutes when near the Cyoria well, maintaining such simulacra should provide Zorian with far more mana than they consume.

This idea may not work as well if mana regeneration is principally limited by the ability of the soul to assimilate mana. In which case Zorian should still see substantial benefits from having a single simulacrum dedicated to mana regeneration, however he would not see additional benefits from having more.
