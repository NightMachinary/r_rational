Actually, the politics of the mana assimilation plan don't seem so bad. If a simulacrum doesn't want the boring job, then Original!Zorian can do it, and send the simulacrum on the mana-consuming job instead. And besides, whenever their mana reserves are full, they can tap each other's senses. Not such a terrible assignment really.
