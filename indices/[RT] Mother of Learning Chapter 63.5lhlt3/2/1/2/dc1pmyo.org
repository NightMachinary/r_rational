It occurs to me that the spider has managed to break everything physical within reach. Rocks, golems, magical planes of force; it shatters them all.

There must be a limit. If Zorian makes a really big golem, focused on physical resilience - no need for warding against fire etc - maybe it can survive. Then they would have a real shot at the eggs.
