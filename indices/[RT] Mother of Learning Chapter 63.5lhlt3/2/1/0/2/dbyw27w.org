Lich vs spider would be funny, but no real contest. He's basically indestructible to physical force, therefore almost certainly bite-proof. He can teleport reflexively. He can fire magical projectiles that pierce all known shielding, like that green javelin. And the spider might well ignore him completely, like the simulacrum.
