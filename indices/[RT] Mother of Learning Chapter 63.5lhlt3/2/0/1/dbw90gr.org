Yeah, my first thought when reading Silverlake essentially trained the spider was, why not just find a different one then? It might be worth an investment of time to find another, younger and less experienced Grey Hunter that would be easier to subdue, after all there's no reason it has to be that particular one. Though if they're as rare as the author says, might not be possible.
