I had it on hand and it has approximately 400 gazillion beta readers and New American Library (a division of Penguin Group) behind it. The only mistake in it, IIRC, is how a scene got deleted by accident so stuff got confusing:

    *The first one has to do with Harry's amulet.*
  #+end_quote

  Okay, yes, Harry's amulet, right.

  #+begin_quote
    We saw it at the birthday party and never again ... did it survive the circle on Demonreach?
  #+end_quote

  Oh yes.

  #+begin_quote
    */Unintelligible, something about why it wasn't mentioned at all later/
  #+end_quote

  I believe it was, he was with his gear, right, he took his gear off and he handed it to Michael [ed: Yes, he says Michael here]. Did I not specifically mention...?

  #+begin_quote
    *Audience confirms he didn't mention it*
  #+end_quote

  *Unintelligible* although if that wasn't written, that was an oversight during the editing process, which was a little crunched. I think the post-production on that was, from start to finish, I think it was 15 days, so there was a lot of back and forth and a lot of me not sleeping during the process.
