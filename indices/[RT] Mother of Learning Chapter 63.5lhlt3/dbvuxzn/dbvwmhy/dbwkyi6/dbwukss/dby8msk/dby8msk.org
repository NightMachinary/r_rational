Literally how do you even manage?

Anyway, I hate the font choices, so I simply use Adobe InDesign for making PDF documents (and Adobe Acrobat for headers and footers because I'm a n00b at master pages).

Like, LaTeX is all about doing the formatting on its own while the user has less input (adding a font is OMGWTF in LaTeX, IIRC).
