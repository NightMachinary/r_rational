  I have heard that publishers make problems for authors that want to publish stories that already exist on the internet.

Sounds good. Once the time comes to publish, I'm sure the community would love to help, myself included.

Just as some food for thought, the author Mooderino who writes the online serial [[http://www.fictiongrill.com/how-to-avoid-death-on-a-daily-basis/][How To Avoid Death On A Daily Basis]] has been publishing this series as he finishes each arc. He's finished four story arcs so far, so he may have some ideas of how the process works. The books are available on Amazon kindle as well as two sites I haven't heard of: Kobo and Smashwords.
