  On that note, I'd love for every keyboard to include the endash, endash, and ellipsis. /rant

It's not useful to you, but it might be to others. On a Mac:

| Character | Key combination         |
|-----------+-------------------------|
| --        | option + hyphen         |
| ---       | option + shift + hyphen |
| ...       | option + semicolon      |

Linux GUIs have similar combinations, or such combinations can be set up.
