[[/u/Bighomer]] had it right. I was assuming a commercial ship I guess, where they wouldn't have the authority to request the ship to stop once a day. I guess a private charter might be possible with the money they have, so it's not totally infeasible.

But there's still the distance limitation of teleportation to consider. The Bakora gates exist for a reason, after all. As far as I understand the magic system, teleporting 1 mile takes more mana than teleporting half a mile twice to reach the same destination.
