Any series with teleports I start wondering about how it is affected by teleporting to/from a moving object, especially since the planet itself and everything on it is moving at different rates depending on latitude.

I feel like until the author makes a statement about it directly, teleporting to/from a moving vehicle is always an option. I can't remember if this has ever been addressed in the story.

I also wonder about what happens to pre-existing matter in the location being teleported to, but that's not the question at the moment.

The main issue here is that the basic teleport spell has a range limitation. It's not a big deal since we've almost always seen the characters stay in Eldemar: [[http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/Altazia-s-Central-Valley-525095257]]

Last chapter was the farthest we've actually seen them go away from here, but we don't know if they were able to teleport directly or if they had to make multiple jumps:

  In the Ishekatara Sea -- the southern sea enclosed by the two 'prongs' of the Altazian continent -- there was a pirate ship.

Koth (Daimen) and Bianyrre are other continents entirely.

The aranea colony with the Bakora Gate seems like the most likely route for Zach and Zorian.

Other possibilities involve teleportation and Gate spell variants, or even an established teleportation route across the ocean using islands/boats?. I think there's sufficient reason to have a much faster transoceanic route available for information/small goods/small groups of people, that would be prohibitively expensive for individuals to utilize for themselves. This chapter seems to argue against that because if it did exist Zach should have brought it up as an option, unless it's illicit knowledge that Zorian gained on his own.
