If Zach and real Zorian are traveling, they can't make use of the Black Room during the restart. The point of sending a simulacrum is so they can do their own thing while someone else does the traveling. Unfortunately, Zorian's simulacrum has a very limited amount of mana - hence him hiring other people to teleport him most of the way.
