Not sure what the range on teleport is, but if I were Zorian I would just use a simulacrum to travel to the maximum range of his teleport using a bird transformation (and to each telepathic relay point) and then contact Zorian and Zach for a gate so they could memorize the locations for future restarts. Rinse repeat until the entire way could be done in a series of teleports. Then they could just chain teleports at the start of the next restart to get there insanely fast. I believe this would be easier then dealing with different people for different amounts of money and their own schedules. With Zach's huge mana pool it would be a triviality to make the trip. This would also be much faster then having to deal with other people and/or border checks or the illegality of bypassing them.
