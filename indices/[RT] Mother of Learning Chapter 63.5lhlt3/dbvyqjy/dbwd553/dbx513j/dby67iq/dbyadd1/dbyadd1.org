Finding information on bird speeds is surprisingly hard. Most overviews don't seem to view it as relevant to note, or maybe its just hard to measure. In addition, when I do find data, it's unclear whether it lists the fastest observed speeds or something that can be sustained indefinitely.

I picked peregrine falcons because they are famously fast (even disregarding their absolutely crazy diving speeds) and also migratory, meaning they have endurance to sustain those speeds over large periods of time. Rock doves (common pigeons) do not migrate, so I was less sure about relying on their information.
