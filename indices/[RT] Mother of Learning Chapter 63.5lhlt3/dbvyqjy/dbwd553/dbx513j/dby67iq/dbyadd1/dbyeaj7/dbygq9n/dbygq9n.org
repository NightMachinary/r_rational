That second article is pretty amazing, thank you for linking that. However, I note that shorebirds aren't very big either.

In any case, I never intended for Z&Z to cross the ocean as birds - I just got my curiosity awoken by the original comment and tried to see just how feasible it was in general. As you noted, hiring teleporters is both faster and and has fewer complications.

Making a plane golem or (especially) ICBM would be a major undertaking that is beyond Zorian at the moment. In fact, it would probably be beyond one person in general. Zorian would have to organize and entire team of researchers, both mundane engineers and spell formula crafters, and direct their efforts for god knows how many restarts. Z&Z don't have time to devote themselves on a project like this.
