Huh, I only now noticed you are the author. Neat.

I used [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_by_flight_speed][this page]] for my sources on bird speeds. Here is [[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070913-longest-flight.html][another source,]] with one bird flying for about 1200 kilometers per day for 9 days.

In general peregrine falcons don't strike me as the kind of bird you would pick to fly across the ocean. They are small, which means they are unlikely to be able to fly 24/7, and would probably run out of energy reserves (i.e. fat) pretty quickly.

If we are talking about ways to get to Koth quickly in general, I think there are several good options:

- The easiest and the most likely to work into any other activities: use the same method Zorian's parents use at the start of the month, which likely involves a hired teleporter who knows the road. In later restarts Z&Z would know all teleportation locaitons and would be able to travel there independantly.

- Some sort of polymorph potion to turn into an extremely fast bird, along with some other potion to increase it's speed, letting Z&Z complete the journey in just a handful of days. Requires them to develop/buy the necessary potions, and I don't see what are the advantages over the first plan.

- A plane golem. Make some sort of semi-aerodynamic platform, inscribe enough spell formula into it to make it float and cut through air without any resistance, strap a big magical engine on the back, load it up with mana crystals, strap in and go. Advantage being that this platform can be used multiple times, and all it requires is a supply of mana crystals (and thus could be used by non-mages. Z&Z could get rich after the time loop by inventing aerospace industry and selling tickets to other continents)

- My favourite method: ICBM transportation. Use magic (Like that sphere Zach used) to gain enough speed to reach space and travel to Koth using a ballistic trajectory. Main advantage is that this method should be /fast/ when compared to something like a chain of teleports (since they would likely have to rest somewhere in the middle).
