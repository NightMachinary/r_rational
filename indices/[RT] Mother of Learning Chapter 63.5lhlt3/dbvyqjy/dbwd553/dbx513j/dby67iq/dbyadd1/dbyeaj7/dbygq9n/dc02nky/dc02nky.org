Googling for "fastest migrating bird" gave me [[http://earthsky.org/earth/great-snipe-is-the-fastest-migratory-bird-ever-discovered][this]]

In short, 3.5 days for 6800km (non-stop flight). Adding a day of rest and 3 flights like that would add up to 20400km in 12.5 days, which is the other side of earth. Which makes the bird idea far more reasonable than I would ever have thought.
