Yeah, this is pretty damn impressive. It is clear that I have greatly underestimated the ability to birds to cross vast distances quickly.

Since the story plan does not account for the 'fly there as a bird' plan, I'm just going to rule that Zorian isn't an ornithologist and never thought to consult one, and thus just dismissed the idea out of hand as implausible. Being a mage, he was more focused on finding a magical solution to the problem.
