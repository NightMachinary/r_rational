That's a good assumption: Zorian's simulacra should be able to check for the location of keys.

One issue, however, is how do simulacra respond to polyjuice? They aren't made of human material; we can't assume the potion will work on them in it's normal form---in fact, I'd guess the potion wouldn't work. That's not to say a /modified/ polyjuice potion couldn't do the job, but Zorian might have to recruit a few alchemists to work on that problem.
