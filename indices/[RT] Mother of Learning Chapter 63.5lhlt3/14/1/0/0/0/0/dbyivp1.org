In chapter 60, the lich shielded himself or dodged whenever he was attacked. So presumably he doesn't keep shields up continuously when not in combat.

I doubt that a cannon of any caliber could penetrate them anyway. At least, not in a single shot - and even if it could, the discharge of energy on impact would surely destroy the projectile. And you're unlikely to get a second shot.

Catching him with his shields down seems to me like the only way. Except for beating him in pitched battle. Which they still haven't done. It's all very well to make him flee and shore up other parts of the invasion, but that's a very different order to actually destroying his body - and preserving the crown in the process. He's like the murder-spider, except a hundred times worse; even an army couldn't really hurt him. The worst thing that happened to him was having his arms cut off, and he just stuck them back on. And continued to kill off dozens of soldiers.

No doubt the Lord British postulate applies, but for ZZ's purposes, the only practical solution is to catch him unaware and unshielded.
