Ch 29: Enchanting firearms

#+begin_quote
  Firearms were notoriously tricky to enhance with magic. Like all ranged weapons, they had the problem that you could only enchant the device to be more accurate and durable, and if you wanted the projectile to have any sort of magical effect upon striking the target you had to enchant the projectile itself. Bullets were unfortunately very hard to enchant, being much smaller than arrows and crossbow bolts and usually made from some very magically unsuitable materials. You also couldn't touch the bullet to channel mana into it once it was already in the gun... though maybe if he installed some crystal mana channels into the gun via alteration...

For a complicated enchantment like what Kael put on that coin, it may be difficult to make the "coin cannon" work. But Zorian is good at spell formula and can recruit a small team of researchers. They definitely should explore the tactic. If they can fire the gun before QI can cast a haste spell, they should be fine.
