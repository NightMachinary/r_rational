So, we know that one part of the Key is held by our undead supermage friend, one part is somewhere within a ridiculously well-defended encampment filled with traps and with a small army of battlemages on short dial (aka treasury), one is somewhere deep within the Xlotic desert, one is located within Koth jungles and finally one is on Blantyrre. Here is what I think:

- Crown will probably be either the last or the first part of the Key they will collect in the final restart. Collecting it first would involve first spying on QI, finding out where he is certainly located at a set time, and then catching him off-quard while he doesn't have his stack of buffs (haste, all his shields, likely perception magic, contingency teleportation, etc) up. This is best done as early in the restart as possible, to maximise the element of surprise (as invasion draws near QI will likely grow more and more paranoid). On the other hand, collecting it last would probably probably involve defeating QI during the invasion, if finding him before that point proves troublesome. Now, I can't guess how that would work, but I imagine it would involve a really big magical cannon that would be able to launch a projectile with similar properties to that coin Kael developed. It would have to be big because that projectile would have to be moving fast enough that QI wouldn't be able to dodge, and magical enough that it would break straight through all his shields.

- Taking dagger might be attempted in two different ways. One way to do that is to go at it all stealthy-like, sneak into the treasury and nib it without triggering the alarms. Personally, I don't think that is very likely, as the treasury seems incredibly well-defended. Alternatively, they could break through with brutal force, and then it should probably be the last part of the Key to get-as we have seen, otherwise local military won't let them do anything for the rest of the restart.

- We obviously don't know anything about the other parts of the key, but I think that the one on Koth will involve Damien, one in Xlotic will involve those wasp-creatures nobody103 wrote about on his worldbuilding blog, and finally one on Blantyrre will be in the hands of the lizardpeople. Personally, I don't see "you need to search a whole desert to find it" as much of an obstacle to them, since they could probably use a combination of simulacra and polymorph potions to swiftly search for it. Turn into an eagle->fly around triggering the key-searching part of the marker once every couple seconds->do that with 10 simulacra simultaneously and you can cover a whole lot of ground in a day. For example, Homing Racing Pigeons have horisontal flight speed of 177 km/h, or about 50m/s. Assuming marker can ping the key from 200 meters away, that's 20 000 square meters covered per second. I think that with the use of magical drugs and potions you should be able to make them fly for 16 hours a day, for a total of about a billion square meters covered in a day. You could cover something the size of sahara desert pretty quickly like that.
