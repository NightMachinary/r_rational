  Pigeons carrying miniature gates that are constantly open to a room with real Zorian on detection duty.

That's brilliant!

Zorian could hire a team of trained pigeons---no need to make simulaca. Then he gets a team of mages who can all cast and maintain a gate spell. If they can anchor the gates to the birds somehow so each gate follows a pigeon, they could essentially cover large swaths of land at decent speeds.

And maybe some aranea could help too, allowing them to control a ton of pigeons via relays.

It would be one hell of a circus to pull it off.
