  Pigeons carrying miniature gates that are constantly open to a room with real Zorian on detection duty.

If he can set up that, then why not go for the full Khepri defence and have a moving screen of miniature gates around him all the time? Hell, with his mind magic and access to an efficient way to generate moving gates that he can cast through, Zorian would basically be Khepri-lite in addition to all his other talents.
