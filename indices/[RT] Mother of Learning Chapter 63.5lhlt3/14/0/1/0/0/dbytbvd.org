That's possible, but not necessarily true.

First of all, can simulacra use the key detector at all?

Second, where does the soul reside?

If the soul resides inside a person's body, one might expect simulacra to experience a distance-related time-delay when using mana.

If the soul resides in a parallel dimension meant to store soul information, then that dimension does not have to map the distances of the spatial dimension---like how a holographic card does not preserve the distance of the hologram it creates.

This would mean that even simulacra could use the key detector if they indeed have access to it in the first place.
