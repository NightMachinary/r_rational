  Gate was among the Noveda treasures

That was what stuck in my mind.

The gate was no longer in Zach's possession- having been sold/donated. I find it curious that Zach is the controller of the Gate if he had no access to it.

This is what leads me to think that RR secured vicarious access to the Sovereign Gate through Zach by being the one to initiate it.
