  In addition, the Noveda bloodline ability is only loosely described as a capacity for high mana.

I still have my doubts about it being a bloodline. Zach said:

  "No one I consulted about [having a large mana pool yet good shaping skills] has any idea how that is possible. Most people think it's some kind of undocumented bloodline of the Noveda."

My pet hypothesis is that Zach's strange abilities are part of the whatever ritual gave Zach the loop marker. Like you said, the loop is the perfect environment for a huge mana pool in exchange for slow shaping maturation.

If Zach's abilities are the result of a bloodline that only pops up every once in a while, it's a /huge/ coincidence that the bloodline happened to manifest in the same generation that gets to use the Sovereign Gate. So, my guess is that Zach's abilities and the Sovereign Gate are intimately linked. Either the bloodline is somehow a once in 400-years thing or it's a part of the loop marking ritual. Or maybe it's a second ritual done in addition to the ritual that gave Zach the marker---and that's why Zorian didn't get the mana reserves boost when he got the soul marker.

As for Quatach-Ichl, I would freaking /love/ for ZZ to spend a couple restarts chatting his ear (skull?) off; he must be a fascinating person to talk to. Sadly, I doubt QI would give ZZ the time of day unless QI knew they were loopers, and if QI knew they were loopers, I'm pretty sure he'd find some way to make them into lab rats.

I'm really disappointed that ZZ aren't fighting QI at the end of every restart, trying to find ways to beat him. And if they could eventually disable him to the point where Simulacrum!Zorian could access QI's mind . . . hoh boi, would that be interesting.

(I say Simulacrum!Zorian because personally invading the mind of a 1000-year-old lich has NOPE written all over it.)
