You don't need to come in contact with the Gate to be the Controller. You just need to be marked.

And activating the Gate doesn't give you a mark, either. Remember how the Guardian said that the purpose of the Gate was between the Controller and whoever marked them, then corrected itself to say it's really up to the Controller, since nothing stops them from doing as they please?
