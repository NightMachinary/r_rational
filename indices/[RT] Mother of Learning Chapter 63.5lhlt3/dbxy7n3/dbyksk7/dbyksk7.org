There's no indication of Zach or Zorian picking up anything except the marker, but it would be hard to tell. Zorian's mana reserves might well grow a little bit more than he'd expect, but he doesn't have any precise way to measure that, since his magic missiles are way more efficient than when he started measuring.

The author has confirmed on his [[https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comments][blog]] that you could make a simulacrum of someone else, but you would need soul sight, not just personal soul awareness.

Of course the lich will become a tool of escape - or, at least, they'll take such a tool off his head. To actually recruit him, though, would unbalance the story. If he said to pack up and go home, or to massacre the cultists before they complete the ritual, the Ibasans would do it.

Sudomir also isn't likely to become an ally, but they will probably take the opportunity to disrupt the invaders' preparation by toppling him.
