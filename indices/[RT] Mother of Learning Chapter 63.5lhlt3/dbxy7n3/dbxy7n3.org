Hi, there. I'm new to this series. I've just had a huge binge read of Mother of Learning. It's great. I'm going to have to read it all again from the start. There's so much.

The simulacrum perspective is really good stuff as it picks up on Zorian's questionable status as a copy. Nice that this is being explored, and I like that it's adding a new PoV. Potential for extra runtime and replace his need for Black Rooms.

Nice that there are so many body/soul options that could all be possible escape exits from the Sovereign Gate. I have a hunch that Lich and Mayor Necromancer could become allies, or at least tools, for the duo's exit. This is tipped off by Red Robe's quick escape, and I think they may have to reconstruct RR pathway to get out.

Still wondering if/when the story will circle back on the soul alteration that started this story. This is so mysterious to me as the story has established that Shifters get benefits from having animal souls within them and inherit special abilities from that infusion. Did Zach get something from Zorian? Such as an improved his Shaping ability? Did Zorian get more that the Marker?

Speculation: If Zack carried Zorian's soul outside of the Gate with him, he has enough mana to manifest Zorian in a simulacrum. Don't know if the magic system supports this sort of thing. I'd like to see more Zorian's internal conflict over having to "kill" his true self played out in his simulacrums.

I miss those damn cute spiders.
