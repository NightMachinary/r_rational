Hey, thanks! There's clues sprinkled around this story, and it's a lot of fun trying to piece them all together.

I think Red Robe is an ally! I don't think he came from inside the loop- I think he is Zach's mage trainer and the one that put him into the Gate before the story started. He either entered the gate with Zach and a copy of his marker, or he knew he was copied into the Sovereign Gate, and was given a marker by Zach once inside. It's plausible.

I'm concerned for Zorian. It doesn't currently seem possible that he can exit the simulation without doing something drastic. I really enjoy how the author has so much restraint in defining Zorian's character growth. It's refreshing to read a coming-of-age story that isn't littered with false drama, and I have my fingers crossed that Zorian will remain both credible and consistent.

I'm looking forward to meeting Damien as it has so much potential for Zorian to get over his old hang ups. Damien, being older and having excelled, seems to be a parallel to Timelooped Zorian and his irl self. If Timelooped Zorian somehow exits the gate, I think Zorian Prime would be feel incredibly inferior to him for the same reasons that he feel inferior to Damien. Not sure how that going to play out so I'll be here for the next chapter.
