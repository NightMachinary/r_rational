All very good points.

What baffles me is how Zach got into the Sovereign Gate, and for what purpose? What are your thoughts on this?

It seem that the Gate activates once every 400 years, and may be tied directly to the Noveda bloodline. Otherwise, why put him in there. The same astrological conjunction that occurs is also the best time for summoning the Primordial, so maybe the SGate is a divine safety net against such an event. Possibly there's a reason that's yet to be revealed that Zach /need/ to be at peak mana. Zach's fantastic stats aren't as relevant in the final battle as strategy, though this could be story bias towards Zorian.

I agree that RR is the one that mind wiped Zach. On top of that, Zach has a compulsion to prevent anyone from undoing this. To me this indicates that there is a plot twist hidden inside- as the amnesia trope is often used to conceal information such as this. What does Zach's amnesia achieve?

RR is a covert agent that infiltrated the invasion force, and used it to hammer Zach until Zach matured and found way to defeat it. After that, RR collected the five keys- four that he has access to because he is an agent of the Crown, and the fifth he can get from Quatach-Ichl due to this previous reconnaissance. Why did RR leave at that point?

Zorian speculates that RR feared multiple time traveler. I think it's because the purpose of the Timeloop was completed. A solution to the invasion had been found- an alliance with the Arenae can foil the invasion without any input from Zach. Furthermore, the control conditions had become polluted with (seemingly) additional time travellers that were corrupting Zach.

Maybe RR departure should have ejected Zach, but Zach's tie to Zorian has anchored him from leaving. Zorian is the spanner in the works.

I think it's highly likely that the Zach has a lot of safeguards around him that will allow him to exit, and these are going to be the obstacle to Zorian's survival.
