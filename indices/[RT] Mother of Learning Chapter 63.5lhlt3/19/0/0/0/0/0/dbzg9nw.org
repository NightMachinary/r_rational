#+begin_quote
  Zach has a lot of safeguards around him that will allow him to exit
#+end_quote

The Guardian wouldn't allow Zach to exit. The Gate is barred.

On the other hand, since it previously was not barred, RR would not have needed to collect the Key.

#+begin_quote
  Zorian is the spanner in the works
#+end_quote

The loop remains, not just because of Zorian, but also because of Zach. It can't end while there is a Controller inside.

#+begin_quote
  an alliance with the aranea can foil the invasion
#+end_quote

If RR planned to ally with the aranea, he wouldn't have bothered to hunt them down and evict them from the loop. He would have simply exited, or else spent some time actually working with them.

And he ambushed and attacked Zach twice before leaving. He's no ally.

#+begin_quote
  may be tied to the Noveda bloodline
#+end_quote

I don't see any evidence for that. Whoever marked him and started the Gate may have seen his undeveloped potential - speculation only - but there's no indication that Noveda in general have any affinity with the Gate.
