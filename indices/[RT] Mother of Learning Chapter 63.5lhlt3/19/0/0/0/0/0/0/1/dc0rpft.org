  the Gate was among the Noveda treasures

Thanks. That's what chiefly stuck out to me.

In addition, the Noveda bloodline ability is only loosely described as a capacity for high mana. Hardly unique, as others have been mentioned to have this (e.g. Damien, Fortov) though not as absurdly high as Zach.

It was also pointed out (somewhere!) that Zach's high mana, and slow shaping maturation, was something that would keenly benefit from Black Room time dilation. The Sovereign Gate is a perfect aid for him to capitalise on these qualities, if indeed his bloodline are the "chosen ones".

Doesn't explain why the keys are scattered everywhere.

Qualith Ichl may have answers- if he's 1000 years old he's lived through two activations of the Sovereign Gate, and if the Planar alignments are evenly spaced at 400 years apart. We know from the Ghost Serpent that some entities undoubtably know of the Sovereign Gate's function. This is a massive can of worms- there are people copied inside the gate could keenly know the scenario, and may want a way out. May not be a plot point- The Gate may be too esoteric for anyone to operate, and a true Noveda family secret expunged from or buried in Zach's compromised mind.
