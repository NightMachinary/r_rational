Red Robe as Zach's trainer doesn't work for me.

- He criticised Zach's failure to shield himself from divination. A trainer would have told Zach to remedy the failure, years ago, or decades.

- He approached Zach as an enemy, assaulting him to get access to his mind. If he were any kind of ally of Zach, he would have just asked. We know Zach was lonely and jumped at the chance of companions.

- He's apparently a cultist, based on his easy access to the robe, and they're bad news.

- He didn't try to help Zach recover his memories. Either he did the wipe himself - probably, with his unstructured mind magic - or he didn't mind that someone else did it.
