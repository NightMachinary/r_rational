I was thinking about this. It should be easy to find someone to take them there thats been there before if the only issue is that neither of them have been to koth. But because they haven't done that there must be something else at issue. Otherwise Daimon, a avery skilled wizard who clearly knows how to teleport would be coming back frequently from koth to visit or whatever but it sounds like he hasn't been back in some time in the story.

My only thought is there might be a distance limit to teleporting and since its across an ocean there are not relay locations to teleport in between. This is backed up by the discussion regarding how it would be hard to teleport an entire army under the town from a great distance, then they found those gates that solved the problem.

My own theory to how he gets to koth is that he gave his mom an anchor stone to take to Koth that way he could teleport to that. That said, a Bakora gate would also solve the problem though we haven't seen any evidence he has figured those out. But we do know he knows how to make teleport anchor stones.
