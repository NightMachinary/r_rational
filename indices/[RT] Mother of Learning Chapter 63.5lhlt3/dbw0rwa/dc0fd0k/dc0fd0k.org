Along with the distance thing others brought up, maybe it's also possible that there're some kind of wards being maintained along borders to discourage sneaking across?

Though maybe implementation of something like that is a bit tricky. Zorian said before that there are three steps to teleporting - the divination, the dimensional barrier, and I presume the actual transportation. None of of these are the kind of things that can be prevented outright if you limit the wards' area of effect, so if an anti-border-crossing ward exists it'll have to be country-wide. Otherwise, countries could just place detection/prevention wards where they can along the border and physically maintain a presence in border villages to catch anyone who sneaked through.
