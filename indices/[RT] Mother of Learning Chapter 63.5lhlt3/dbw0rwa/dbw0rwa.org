What exactly is the limitation on teleportation in this setting? Zorian is able to go anywhere in the country it seems, so long distances isn't it. If he's limited by only being able to teleport to places that he's already been before, then he could make the trip to the other continent in stages across restarts. Better yet, pay someone to teleport the two of them.
