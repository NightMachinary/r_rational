So, what's the timing involved in the pipeline for a simalcrum memory packet? Ex: If a simalcrum sends over a full day's memories, how long does it take to a) make the memory packet b) send the packet c) for ZorianPrime to absorb the packet?

It does seem like Zorian is using them to good effect (clone per job!), but I'm still curious as to what the improvement ratio ends up being.

(Does the author hang out here at all?)
