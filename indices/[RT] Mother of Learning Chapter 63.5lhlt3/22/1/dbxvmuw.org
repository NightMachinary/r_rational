I think their most important goal should be to protect the shifter children.

If the primordial gets out, then the nation, maybe the continent, is toast. If they interrupt the summoning halfway through, /they/ are toast, and potentially the whole city, depending on exactly how widespread the effects are. So they should guard shifter children and stop the ritual from becoming feasible. Unless they were kidnapped before the loop started.
