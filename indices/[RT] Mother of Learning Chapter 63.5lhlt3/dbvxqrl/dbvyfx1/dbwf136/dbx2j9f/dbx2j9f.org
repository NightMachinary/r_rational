  Well... he wasn't the first simulacrum that was sent on this mission. And apparently one of the previous simulacrums was similarly bored out of his skull here and decided to go off the script and befriend her. And then never bothered to inform the original about it. Simulacrum number two didn't intend to inform the original either. The whole thing was harmless and imagining the original's reaction when he finally found out was kind of amusing.

I think Zorian is demonstrating some minor IdiotBall \ blunder-level behaviour regarding his management of the clones. Even after that grey spider clone sent him feedback on how quickly and dramatically clones' thought patterns can diverge from the original, Zorian still didn't establish some system of check-up and “quality control” on the clones' experiences and thoughts before dismissing them.

He just arbitrarily decided that <24h lifespan should be safe enough and went with it.
