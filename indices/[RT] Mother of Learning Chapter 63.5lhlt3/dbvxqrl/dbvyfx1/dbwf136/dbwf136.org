It isn't 100% harmless, and I suspect it may have minor ramifications.

If you have N divergent copies of yourself each revealing slightly different information to somebody as a joke, there's no guarantee those N bits of (mis)information won't allow the target to figure out something true.

This simulacrum made a joke about having a time machine. If the next makes a joke about actually being 100 years old, it provides a clearer picture for Neolu. And since none of them are telling Zorian-prime, none of the simulacra know whether they've collectively crossed a line.

To put it another way, if 100 witnesses each tell a fraction of the truth with no coordination, it will be possible to extract a much more accurate answer than any one witness revealed. Even if they've all got a motive to be deceitful, they'll all tell their fragment of truth in a slightly different way.
