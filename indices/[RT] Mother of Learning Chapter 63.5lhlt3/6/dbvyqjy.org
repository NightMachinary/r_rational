I have a theory for how Zorian might pull off transcontinental travel (besides Bakora gates).

If Zorian's simulacrum goes to another continent and then gives him the memories of the place, does Zorian gain the ability to teleport there? That way he wouldn't have to waste a restart traveling. The only problem is the simulacrum would have to remain active for longer than a day to do this (unless Zorian has the simulacra teleport back, dispel, and then teleport back out on a day-to-day basis).
