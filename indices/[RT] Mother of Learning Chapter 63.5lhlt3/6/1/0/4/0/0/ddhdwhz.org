I think you misunderstood what I was saying =/ I was suggesting that the simulacrum would travel by themself to the maximum range of Z&Zs teleport, then open a gate with the original to bring both Z&Z through. They would then memorize the location for future restarts and let a new simulacrum start towards the next teleport relay.
