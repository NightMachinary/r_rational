Teleporting directly is impossible, since teleportation has range limitations. I assume that by way points you mean they can just chain teleports to cross the distance, in which case yes, that is possible. But if the goal is just to get teleport destinations, it's easier and faster to use the already existing teleportation network and have other people teleport them to desired destinations.
