Out of pure curiosity, I did some quick research on this.

Peregrine falcons are one of the fastest flyers in the world. Their speed in level fight is about 65 to 100 km/h. Assuming the maximum is probably unreasonable so let's say they can fly at about 80 km/h normally. Assuming 10 hours a day spent in flight, that's a travel distance of 800 km per day.

But wait! Peregrine falcons are migratory birds ('peregrine' means 'wanderer') and while finding information about their migration speeds is surprisingly difficult, the internet is telling me that some individuals travel as much as 480 km per day. This is considered very impressive. Although it's possible that peregrine falcons are just being conservative with their energy, I'm going to assume they have good reasons for traveling at that speed. Let's round this to 500 km per day for easier calculation.

I have not thought too deeply about actual numerical distances in my world, but I consider the planet on which the story is happening to be the same size at earth. Since Altazia is temperate, and Koth is equatorial, that's roughly the distance between Northern Europe and Central Africa. Web calculators tell me that the distance between Copenhagen and Kinshasa is 6678 km. Since I assume actual peregrine falcons are way better navigators than shapeshifted humans, let's round that up to 7000 km.

7000 divided by 500 is 14, so the best case scenario says Zach and Zorian would need 14 days to fly to Koth as birds. Not unworkable. However, spending half of the restart traveling is clearly quite suboptimal. Not to mention that reality is unlikely to be ideal, and that they would likely encounter unfamiliar complication the first few times they tried that.
