Zach's sphere can go hypersonic? I'm not sure, The need for inertial dampening made me wonder, but here are some numbers on the matter.

Hypersonic means five times the speed of sound (Mach 5). The speed of sound is 1200 kph (750 mph).

In Ch 62, Zach uses the sphere to escape giant eagles.

The fastest bird, the homing pigeon, has horizontal flight speed of about 80 kph (sustained) to 140 kph (short distance) (50 to 90 mph). If the giant birds were going that fast (they were probably slower than this, seeing as they're giant birds and were each carrying a human), then we know Zach was also going at least 100 kph (for ease of calculation---well under the speed of sound.

Zorian's reaction to escaping the giant birds wasn't that Zach was going slowly to let the birds catch up---rather, he was surprised the eagles could keep up. This suggests Zach's speed when escaping the birds was comparable to the first time Zorian saw the sphere used. I take this to mean that Zach wasn't killing his speed too much to escape the eagles, so his max speed is probably somewhere between 100 kph and 500 kph, depending on how much more he can push himself, and probably closer to 100 kph.

How long can Zach sustain that speed? If the above is accurate to how the sphere works, then Zach can easily travel 100 kph, but not for extended periods of time. The first time we saw the spell, Zach used the sphere to travel from the invasion army to the Hole. At 100 kph, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes to travel across the city (it takes 15 minutes to travel the length of Manhattan at that speed)---after which Zach was exhausted.

I think they might do better traveling as birds or, as you said, dimensionalism---or whatever else Zorian has up his sleeve.
