Oh, right, I forgot about that bit in ch62.

So my reasoning was that the sphere was clearly pulling high-g maneuvers, while passengers were unaffected; it didn't give a damn about physical obstacles it encountered (which means it doesn't give a damn about drag) and it would not care about heating as it's not material anyway. If it was operating under proper Newtonian mechanics, it should have been possible to launch it like a ICBM.

But apparently that's not the case. Oh well.
