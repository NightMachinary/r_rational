There must be ways they can do this. Maybe they should attack it in its lair, negating its mobility. If Zorian can cover the entrance with a gate leading to a trap, they could then bombard it through the gate... Potion grenades maybe?

Or drop the trap right over the hole so it can't get past without touching it, and if it holds back, start psychically digging through its magic resistance.

Or make a simulacrum army and overwhelm its magic resistance with psychic brute force.

Or provoke it into jumping and catch it in the air. Once it's already off the ground, it will have a harder time dodging. Can they make a frictionless hemisphere of force for it to land in?
