Hmm, with all the dodging, I think they need to cast more Wall spells. Like wall of fire to herd it into a trap. Can't dodge a whole plane of attack. Box it in, then cast a non-lethal spell, so that if it dodges, it'll dodge INTO the lethal wall of fire.

EDIT: IMO, 1st, put a ceiling to things. Horizontal Wall of Fire, just right above human height. Can't jump well without headspace. Heck, just Maze the whole battleground.
