The simulacrum shenanigans and how quickly they've been shown to begin to diverge from the creator's best interests struck me as more material for the "Red Robe is a rogue simulacrum of Zach's" theory.

Other than that, I don't see extensive use of simulacra any less ethically challenging than marking people to retain memories in-between reboots. I'd like to see them explore the latter (and the other marker abilities) in future chapters.
