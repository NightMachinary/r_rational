  Let's face it, the magic system in this story has new shit added to it every chapter and we could get new information that disproves this, then makes it possible again, then disproves it again several times over. But Zach's simulacrum just feels right to me from a storytelling perspective. It's very elegant.

No? If anything the magic system has been extremely consistent, it's how we can figure out later plot points from explanations that were given in early chapters.
