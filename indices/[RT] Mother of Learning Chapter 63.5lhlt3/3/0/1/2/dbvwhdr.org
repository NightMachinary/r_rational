Zorian's been using simulacra for eight restarts so far; they don't seem to maintain themselves.

The memory packets theory is definitely possible. It's possible that Zach had been trained in a lot of things pre-timeloop. There is one major flaw:

Even Zorian would have a difficult time overwriting a person's life story that much. If Zach had been skilled enough to cast simulacrum, to have (novice or intermediate-level) unstructured mind shaping abilities like RR exhibited, etc., I don't think RR could have successfully purged that much information.

Plus, it is unlike Zach to have the patience or temperament to undergo that level of training, then hide it from his peers to pretend to be untalented in school. All that mastery would have required a few years of training.

It's still possible I suppose, but I find it really unlikely. Veyers also feels unlikely considering his volatile temperament, but we shall see. :D
