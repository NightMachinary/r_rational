I completely agree. After the previous chapter, I argued that it's implausible for even a skilled soul/mind mage to completely erase a trained "skill" of Zach's: soul-sense. We know the soul grows with training, like muscles, and, especially after what we learned in this chapter about how trigger-happy the marker is, I find it highly doubtful that anyone could have altered his mind and soul enough to have completely removed his knowledge of and ability to control his marker AND set him back to square one when he tries to re-train it.

I still think the most logical conclusion here is that Zach never knew what was going on to begin with when the loops started.
