You always ask good questions. For everyone else, here's the relevant discussion:

  If you had soul sight (and maybe a willing target), I would think you could attach a generic simulacrum body/mind to someone else's soul. I would expect it to work pretty much the same way as if the recipient had cast the simulacrum spell themselves.

  (In which case, Zorian would be able to cast it on Zach before the latter has sufficient mastery of soul perception, once Zorian uses blood magic to copy Kael's soul sight.)

  Yes, you could make a simulacrum of another person and it would work largely the same as if the target cast the simulacrum spell themselves. As you noted, you need soul sight first before you can do that. Necromancers a similar method to this to interrogate dead people.
