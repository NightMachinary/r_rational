No I'm saying that if you accept that doing something immoral makes you more likely to do something immoral, then using a proxy to commit that immoral deed just means that you're more likely to use a proxy to do something immoral.

The mental repercussions are a separate thing entirely, but I don't think it's important considering how many people's he has mindraped before who really though no fault of their own are on the side against him. It's not like all criminals are inherently evil.

Regardless if we simplify it to killing people ever, using a gun to kill people instead of your hands, doesn't mean you will kill people less (which is what I think he's worried about).
