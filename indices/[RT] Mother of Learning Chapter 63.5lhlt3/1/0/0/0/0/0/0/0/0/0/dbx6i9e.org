  I don't think it's important considering how many people's he has mindraped before who really though no fault of their own are on the side against him. It's not like all criminals are inherently evil.

It's not about his targets being “inherently evil”, it's about setting at least some kind of boundaries in his mind regarding who can be an acceptable target (e.g. eldritch entity summoners, their goons, their support network, etc) and who can not. Friend-or-foe differentiation is usually very important in matters like this for people, especially during wartime when soldiers have to kill or torture their enemies. For instance, even members of Unit 731 had to be trained to double-think around their victims being humans and think of them as wooden logs.

  if you accept that doing something immoral makes you more likely to do something immoral, then using a proxy to commit that immoral deed just means that you're more likely to use a proxy to do something immoral.

I agree with that, but only partially. What I was trying to point out in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5lhlt3/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_63/dbx0hre/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational][my original comment]] was that immoral actions are not all grouped together in a single homogeneous bundle, and that if a person is ready to make immoral choice A then it doesn't automatically mean that they're also read to make /any/ immoral choice at all.

Let's assume there're two versions of Zorian: one who's ok with mind-probing non-criminals personally, and another who's ok with doing that through a proxy clone.

The first one mind-probes people day after day, and gradually starts to realign his morality principles in an even more drastic manner so that all his personal experiences of what he considers mind-probing of innocent people wouldn't paint him as some kind of a monster in his own eyes. Eventually, this Zorian!A's moral compass will change so much that he'll not only be ok with mind-probing them, but also with mind-torturing them, mind-torturing their families for leverage, etc. And each immoral choice that's one step harder will warp his morality principles even more.

The second one, on the other hand, will know that he's mind-probing people, but since this knowledge is more of the academic variety because he himself has none of the first-hand “personality-contaminating” experience, through time he'll stay on the same level of only being ready to mind-probe non-criminals when there's a very dire need for that. He /may/ decide to make some harder immoral choices, but those decisions won't be affected by his deteriorating moral principles as much as it would've been the case with Zorian!A.

/p.s. This all is of course only my current opinion. Also, this is likely my last comment in this comment chain. Thanks for the discussion!/
