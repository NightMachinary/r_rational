Sure he is. Simulacrum 2 was heading back to report at the end of the day.

However, it appears that the simulacra are choosing which memories to send. Thus, pranking ensues.

What's more interesting is that this one didn't use a telepathic relay. But it does make sense: with multiple simulacra and non-hazardous missions, he really doesn't need to invest in making lots of relays.
