The simulacra could execute strong mind magic attacks in a controlled environment for Zorian to defend himself against. I'm sure there are plenty of interesting training regimens he could come up with---simultaneous and detailed pupeteering of highly sentient enemies and compulsions come to mind, especially of the "give yourself greater focus" variety.

Imagine he gets two simulacra and practices puppeteering them simultaneously while maintaining combat effectiveness for himself. It's essentially like turning enemies into mini-simulacra for the price of some mind magic---which is much cheaper.
