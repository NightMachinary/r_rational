"Professor Xvim? What can I do for you?"

"Ms. Boole, I have something you may be interested in."

"Really? What's that?"

"I have a student who is working with me on several advanced projects. For reasons I can't go into, this student has discovered an ancient artifact that may be of immense interest to you. However, again for reasons that I cannot go into, the research will require your utter secrecy."

"Uh, is this illegal?"

"No, Ms. Boole, but it is . . . significant. Tell me, do you know anything about the Bakora Gates?"

"Bakora Gates---oh my gods . . . when can we leave?"

"We can leave now, but don't you want to know more details first?"

"Tell me on the way, Professor. I've /got/ to see this."

As for Xvim traveling, I'm guessing he feels following two fifteen-year-olds on a quest to find a scroll of Simulacrum---especially because Alanic is around---is not something he'd be interested in anymore. But to conduct dimensionalism research on a Bakora Gate in an emptied out spider enclave with Zorian who is he instructing in dimensionalism? I bet he'd be willing to travel for that.
