  a Bakora gate... all the crystallized mana .. pay for a single activation, a one-way ticket.

There's three plot threads converging towards this. There are +Banora+Bakora Gates in both the timeloop, and the real world. Connecting them could make an exit. Silverlake, the Silent Doorway Adepts, and Xvim can manipulate dimensional gateways. Sudomir Kandrei's has a giant mana crystal that can absorb a cataclysmic amount of life force.

This seems possible.
