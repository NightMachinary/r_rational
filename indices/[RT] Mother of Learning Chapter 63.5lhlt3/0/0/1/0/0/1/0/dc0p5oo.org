This may not be true. The Sovereign Gate utilizes time magic and dimensionalism. Bakora Gates use dimensionalism. I'm not saying they're necessarily related, but there may be a connection that can be exploited.

For example, imagine there is a dimensional bridge connecting the loop dimension and the real dimension. What if Bakora Gates can punch into that exit path?

But I agree that the keys are certainly their best bet. I wouldn't be surprised if unexpected problems arise however.

I think the strongest case against these kinds of dimensionalism shenanigans is that, from a storytelling perspective, they would feel very deus ex machina, especially when the Sovereign Gate keys are a valid option.
