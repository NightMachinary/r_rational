Silverlake is going to be a large part of the answer. Zorian noted that her home is inside a pocket.

It's the nature of "tests" in Mother of Learning, that Zorian is going to have to develop some kind of skill that's crucial to getting the Grey Hunter eggs, that Silverlake needs him to know. The Haste spell that his simulacrum used during the encounter is also in that area of magic (and a big tip off). Zorian's dimensional gate also had some success against the Grey Hunter.

I'm trying to my best to be a good reader of what the author has constructed in this world. It's a struggle not to turn everything Zorian encounters into a Chekov's Armoury. This is my first encounter with "rational" literature, and it's full of novelty -not just the cheery spider.
