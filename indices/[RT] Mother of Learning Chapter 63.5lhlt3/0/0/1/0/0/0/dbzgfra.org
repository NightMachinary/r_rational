I'm pretty sure that it would be possible to ward against gates, just not with a standard teleport ward. And I get the impression that the invaders' gate consumes rather a lot of mana, though perhaps less than teleporting. Gates don't really bypass all the usual problems, although they may be a better tool in some cases for those who can actually make them.
