You're right, it doesn't. There's also too little information about them to make this work. So far, dimensional gates have been shown to circumnavigate all the known problems that teleportation suffers- such as distance, needing to know the destination, and wards.

  The only connection between the real world and the time loop is the Sovereign Gate.

The Sovereign Gate is barred, but it's not inactive if RR is travelling through it between the Timeloop and the Real world. If that connection didn't exist, then the Timeloop world would be already dissolved. Perhaps the Bakora gate can piggyback on this connection? All speculation. I'm desperately trying to find a way out for Zorian, preferably with his body intact.

It seems very possible that the Primordial is not within the Timeloop, and is being summoned from a pocket universe that is located outside of both the Timeloop, and the Real world. It's bridged by a lifeforce/blood connection. This is something that Zorian will have between himself and his irl self. If this is true, it indicates that another exit can be made, but will trigger the loop. A solution is to wait until the final loop.
