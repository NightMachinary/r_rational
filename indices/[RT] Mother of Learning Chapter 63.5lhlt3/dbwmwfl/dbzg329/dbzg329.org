Tell Alanic about Iasku Mansion. That pulls the entire invasion completely off-schedule and off-plan, the trial run happened while Red Robe was already out of the loop so most of his foresight is useless, and the reintroduction of access to extraplanar help is much less of a factor when dealing with a necromancer than it is when dealing with cultists.
