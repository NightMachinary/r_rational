On the contrary, Red Robe will be totally ignorant of their existence. From his perspective they should already be a done deal when he left the loop. They could make a fake corpse for Zach just in case RR tries to confirm and then totally take him by surprise.

Practice would be unreliable in this situation. The best chance for practice already left when RR quit, and the invasion and the city plays completely differently due to no inside knowledge and monster incursions already putting the city on high alert.
