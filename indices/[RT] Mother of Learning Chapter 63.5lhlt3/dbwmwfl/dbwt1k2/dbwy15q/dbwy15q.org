What's worse, outside the loop, the invasion should have access to the divine plane, so demon summoning may be a thing.

But I bet Zorian on his own could defeat RR at this point, and with Zach's help, I think it'd be a done deal.

The intel they /really/ need is: Who is RR, where is he going to be, and can they ambush him? If they can bring along Alanic and Xvim, RR is toast. I'm sure something will throw a wretch in all that though.
