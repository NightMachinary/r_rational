If the simulacrum is in Cyoria, it would have access to books, building materials, research notes, Kael, Kirielle, Xvim, etc. I'm sure it'd have no issue with spending a restart hanging out, giving Zorian a guaranteed max regeneration rate. The main issue is that Zorian hasn't been keeping any simulacra alive for more than a day, but it may be worthwhile to break the rule for this purpose.
