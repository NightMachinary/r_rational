The cranium rats don't have much ability as individuals. A single rat doesn't do anything that he can't easily overpower. It's the group that's formidable. I doubt enhancement rituals can take the cumulative abilities of a whole bunch of magical creatures. He'd be better off taking a bunch of any other creature instead.
