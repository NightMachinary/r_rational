So, I've been thinking about how Zorian could better abuse the simulacrum and this chapter completed an idea. Zorian has been musing about enhancement rituals and the author stated that many of those straight up copy magical abilities from magical creatures. So, Zorian should figure a way to copy the cranium rats' hive mind ability (which is a kind of mind magic, so it should mesh well with his natural ability) then figure how to make the mental connection through his soul (or just use relays if that's not feasible) and voila, hive mind Zorian and his simulacra. That'd be interesting.
