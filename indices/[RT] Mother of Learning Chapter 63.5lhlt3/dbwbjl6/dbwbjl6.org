Unlikely but possible note on rogue simulacrums: Can you steal a soul? Considering simulacrums don't have souls, that means it's only how your magic works that's the difference. Imagine the Matriarch's packet and instead just copy your whole mind over and delete the other one. I think of it as an unstructured mind magic thing, but that would be too hard. So imagine that the simulacrum spell creates a blank mental construct, and part of that is copying your mind over. It would be "simple" to change it to overwrite someone else's mind then, right?
