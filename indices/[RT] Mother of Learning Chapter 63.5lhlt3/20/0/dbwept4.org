stealing souls to power simulacrums seems easier than modifying the spell to take over people.I can imagine a necromancer premiering an army of simulacrums this way, it probably doesn't happen because you can't really trust the simulacrum in all situations , maybe whith mind magic like zorian's you can become a coordinated hive mind
