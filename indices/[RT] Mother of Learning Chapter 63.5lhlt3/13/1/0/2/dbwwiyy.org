I agree with you on this, but I think the effect is mitigated. Each "witness" is a copy of Zorian Prime from that morning. Zorian is pretty discrete and private, so his simulacra shouldn't get too crazy with things. Things might spiral out of control a little, but it's only a month until the slate's wiped clean.

Plus, Zorian knows that Zach has convinced Neolu that he's a time-traveler in the past and she was chill about it. That's probably why Simulacrum!Zorian is comfortable trolling Prime!Zorian with Neolu.
