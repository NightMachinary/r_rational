I think doing a factory reset every 24 hours is probably sufficient quality control, but I do wish he treated his simulacra more like his equals instead of his servants. It's all very well for the original to be excited about sending someone /else/ to be torn apart by the murder-spider, but he needs to remember that simulacra won't like doing anything that he would dislike doing /himself/.

Which is not to say that he should stop sending them on potentially lethal or boring missions. The ability to copy himself is just too valuable to pass up. But a little more consideration and sympathy might go a long way.

Consider: it was entirely foreseeable that when actually faced with the expectation of being torn apart by a super-spider, he would be scared. So he could have planned ways to mitigate that. Real-time memory uploads and a promise to promptly re-cast the spell afterward. Or letting it do something fun first, so it resented its existence less. Or planning a big victory party, so it feels like there's something worth being dispelled for, something to achieve. After all, these are copies of himself; it makes sense to care about their happiness.
