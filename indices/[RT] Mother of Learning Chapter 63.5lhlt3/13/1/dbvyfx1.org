It seems Zorian has been using a simulacrum to attend class for at least a few days if not longer. It's likely a previous simulacrum noticed Neolu's interest and decided to mix things up on the off-chance that Zorian has to deal with the aftermath. It's harmless enough and will annoy Zorian enough that the troll that lives in Zorian and all his copies can't resist. ;)
