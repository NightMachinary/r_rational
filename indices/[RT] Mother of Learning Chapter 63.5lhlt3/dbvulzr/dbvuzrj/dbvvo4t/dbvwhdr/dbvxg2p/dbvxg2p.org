  Zorian's been using simulacra for eight restarts so far; they don't seem to maintain themselves.

So far he has been reabsorbing them at the end of each day. I doubt he ever tried to keep one up during a reset.

And I doubt Zach forgot that much, yes. I don't think that's the solution, I just listed it as remotely plausible.

I suspect if the theory is true, the "how" might not have even been introduced to us yet.
