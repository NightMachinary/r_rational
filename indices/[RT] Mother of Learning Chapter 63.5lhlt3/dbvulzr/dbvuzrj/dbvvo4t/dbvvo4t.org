Well... We don't know the rules yet. Maybe Zach's simulacra actually share his marker, somehow. Maybe Zach actually knew a lot more about the markers and soul magic before his memory wipe, since he had one in the first place. Maybe it's the (very inventive) mechanism you've described.

Or maybe simulacra do just maintain themselves over resets. They're weird-ass soul magic, who knows how weird-ass soul magic interacts with the weird-ass soul magic of resets? I suspect we'll see what happens when a simulacrum is active during the reset soon enough. Then, if they do, it probably took over Veyers' body, like people speculated in the previous chapter's discussion and off it went.

Let's face it, the magic system in this story has new shit added to it every chapter and we could get new information that disproves this, then makes it possible again, then disproves it again several times over. But Zach's simulacrum just feels right to me from a storytelling perspective. It's very elegant.
