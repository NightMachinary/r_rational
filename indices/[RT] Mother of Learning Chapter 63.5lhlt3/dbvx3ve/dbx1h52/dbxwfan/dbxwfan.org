Zorian is studying dimensional magic, which is probably what she used to conceal her cottage, since Zorian physically walked through the spot where it should have been.

He's learning to make transformation potions. She's a potions master, probably the best he'll ever meet.

He's interested in enhancement rituals and bloodline powers. She's a witch; they love those, and probably know many useful things about them.

He's already benefiting from converting the grey hunter to enhancement potions, using a recipe devised by someone who never worked with one before. Silverlake's been after the thing for years; she probably knows lots more things they can do with it, especially with the corpse presumably in good condition.

She'll be useful, I have no doubt.

And some of Xvim's best stuff only came out after Zorian gained his respect. The same is probably true of Silverlake. She shows that much promise /and he only met her in one restart/.
