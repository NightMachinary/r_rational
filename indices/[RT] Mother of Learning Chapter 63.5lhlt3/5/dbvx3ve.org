I forget if I already mentioned this in previous threads, but Kael's coin has (temporarily) defeated Quatach-Ichl before, and Zorian was able to fool him into touching it. It probably works by making his lich defenses think he's undergoing a serious soul attack and severing the simulacrum automatically, but regardless, it's worth a try next time they fight him.
