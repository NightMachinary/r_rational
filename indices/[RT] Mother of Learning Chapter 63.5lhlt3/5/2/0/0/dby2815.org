  She'll be useful, I have no doubt.

What I mean - by the time Zorian&Zach get Grey Hunter eggs they will be the same or better in all or most important of those areas. Difference between Xvim and Silverlake is that Xvim didn't send student on suicidal mission. Silverlake actually made this mission much worse by "teaching" Grey Hunter with her own failed attempts. And it was not just single test of resolve - she want Zorain to make repeated attempts, which can only end with his death, if he would be a normal wizard.

It's difficult to understand her reasoning beyond simple witch's malice. May be she hope to lower Grey Hunter level of readiness by sending weak opponent. Or may be she has no other use for a student. I expect her to attack Zorian after he handed her eggs if she can't pay him with knowledge - she looks greedy enough for it.
