The Silent Doorway Adepts were willing to train Zorian for a huge quantity of crystallized mana. However, assuming they have a Bakora Gate, would they be willing to teach Zorian how to use it---the artifact that gives this web their very name? Perhaps, but considering how secretive the Adepts are and how protective aranea are in general about their most prized knowledge, I doubt the Adepts would be willing to give Zorian access to their gate.

As an absolute last resort, storming in, killing everyone except the elders, then extracting the Bakora Gate lore, then spending a restart studying it could catapult Zorian's knowledge of both spell formulas and dimensionalism. What's more could recruit Xvim perhaps even Nora Boole to help him study the artifact. Nora Boole might be brought to tears to have the opportunity.

And it may be that the knowledge gained would also help ZZ disrupt the Bakora Gate used by the Ibasans---which may be critical once the loop ends.

In my opinion, Zorian really ought to get access to that Bakora Gate if at all possible. Maybe it'll be a dead end, but it be well be an incredibly fruitful experience.

Plus, if violence is the only way he could access the Adepts' Bakora Gate, then it is unlikely he will ever get access outside of the loop. He might as well do it considering the Adepts will simply respawn in the next loop. He should certainly give them every chance to share the information though; I cringe to think of him gaining access by force.
