ZZ have already killed plenty of aranea for the sake of training to open the mission critical memory packet. Killing Adepts within the loop so as to use their Bakora Gate sounds like a (traumatic, ethically troubling, and yet) legitimate last resort. Also, Zorian has mind magic, so he might be able to get information on how to work the Gate with or without the consent of the Adepts.
