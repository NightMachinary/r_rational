There's no reason to suspect any relationship whatsoever between the Bakora Gates and the Sovereign Gate. The only thing they share is that they have Gate in the name and we learned about them fairly close together. They're different technologies from entirely different civilizations and time periods which work according to completely different principles.

They have a way out. Collect the keys, unlock the Sovereign Gate, walk out.

If the Primordial were being summoned from a pocket universe outside of both the loop and the real world, that would imply that a) all pocket universes would display unexpected behavior during the loop, in particular a Bag of Holding or somesuch would let you send information from one loop to the next and eventually out of the loop, which directly contradicts one of the primary design goals of the Sovereign Gate b) it wouldn't work more than once, since summoning the Primordial into a world and then destroying that world would either destroy the Primordial or cause devastating consequences across all nearby universes, neither of which is consistent with what we've observed.

Even if some kind of blood-bridge to summon looped!Zorian bodily back into the real world were possible, that bridge would have to go through the Sovereign Gate for the same reason that the ritual to summon the Primordial has to happen at the hole. You can only access a pocket universe at the point where the pocket universe connects to the rest of the universe. The problem with this is that /the Gate is barred/. You'd still have to unlock it, which would still require finding the keys, at which point you could just walk through. The only advantage is that the summoning thing might be able to move you through bodily rather than having your spirit supplant your original self, which is extremely useful but not necessarily worth the tremendous difficulty involved in designing such a ritual.
