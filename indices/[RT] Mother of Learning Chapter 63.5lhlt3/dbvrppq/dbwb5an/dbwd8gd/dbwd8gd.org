I reckon he should treat his simulacra more like equals. In personality and intelligence, after all, they're almost the same as him. Maybe, rather than assuming he's the master, they should negotiate tasks more. But I guess that wouldn't help Simulacrum 2, since the whole point of going to class was to test the disguise, so the original couldn't take that job. And for life-threatening tasks like baiting the spider, original!Zorian is harder to replace.

He could, at least, before creating a batch of simulacra, roll dice to decide which task each Zorian will have (including, when feasible, the original). Then they wouldn't have to wonder, Why did I get the boring job?

And maybe they could have social events! Team-building! He doesn't like chess, but maybe he'd enjoy a party where everyone is him. Or a football match.
