If you mean you'd still be affected by the act of mind-wiping even if you used your clone as a proxy instrument, then I don't agree. If you use a clone, you are shielding yourself from the the more “visceral” parts of the experience.

It's like if you had to kill a person for some reason. It would've been much easier if all you had to do was decide that they have to be killed and they just died --- you wouldn't have nightmares about it, your human psyche wouldn't have to re-align itself around this new important experience, etc.

It would still change you, but not as much on an unconscious level as the first-hand experience would.
