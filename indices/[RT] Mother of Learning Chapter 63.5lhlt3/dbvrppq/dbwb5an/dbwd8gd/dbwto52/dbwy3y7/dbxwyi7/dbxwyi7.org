More resistance training maybe?

Fighting himself would have limitations. He can't really learn new techniques that way, so not really helpful for things like martial arts, and he doesn't need a sentient target for things like making force spells transparent. He could encourage the growth of his mana reserves, I guess, but he's already using them plenty, and maxing that out is supposed to be a bad idea.
