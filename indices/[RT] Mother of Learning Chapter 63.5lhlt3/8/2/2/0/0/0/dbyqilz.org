  Literally how do you even manage?

Templates. If you have a style files that you just add to over time, you eventually have a lot less to figure out. My template had a font section, so once I figured it out once, I'd just change the font for that section and it'd be okay. Sometimes, certain fonts require certain packages, so you just keep font and package pairs commented out for when you need them.

  LaTeX is all about doing the formatting on its own while the user has less input

I think LaTeX takes that route because most people don't know typography well enough to make those decisions, and it tends to do a really good job of it---certainly better than MS Word. At the same time, it gives you the control to make the decisions where needed, albeit using a forty-year-old markup language.

Anyhow, changing fonts can be annoying---it depends on your pain tolerance certainly---but I didn't find it too bad. I remember making a few resumes in LaTeX and then spent an hour recompiling with different fonts.

I've never used InDesign, but I'd like to play with it sometime.
