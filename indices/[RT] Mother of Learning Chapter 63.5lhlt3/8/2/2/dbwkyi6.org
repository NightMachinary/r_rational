It's been answered, but he said that on chapter 40 on his Patreon.

EDIT: Wanted to clarify, but I can help somewhat. Literature I have: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garner%27s_Modern_English_Usage][/Garner's Modern English Usage/]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicago_Manual_of_Style][/Chicago Manual of Style/ PDF]], and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart's_Rules][/New Hart's Rules/]].

I also have /A Few Notes on Book Design/, but that's more of a thing for people who don't have the aforementioned books.

Aside from that, I'm also familiar with typography to an extent. Not really a professional, but oh well. Probably the best I can offer on that is the idea of [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9Gai7gRb5k][rearranging your keyboard]] so you can edit it on your convenience. There's an [[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/typography-keyboard-layout-download-now/][existing layout]], but it uses a QWERTY keyboard---I somehow doubt that'll work for you when you have a QWERTZ keyboard.
