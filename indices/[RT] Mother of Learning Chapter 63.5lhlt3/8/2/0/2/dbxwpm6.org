I don't have much advice, but from what I understand, most publishers won't touch a debut novel over about 100k words, tops. Each arc is around 200k, I believe. And it wouldn't be right to chop huge segments out of a story like this, with so much rich world-building. So that could be problematic. :(

At least, dead tree publishers. Publishing as an e-book might have more flexibility. Except it's already possible to make an e-book for free. But it wouldn't hurt to try, and I'd be tempted to buy it despite having the free version.

Actually, my only real hesitation would be, not the money, but the fact that I'd like to make a version with all strong language trimmed or substituted. It's not worse than a lot of other stories, but I'd really like an "airline version". Would definitely pay for that.
