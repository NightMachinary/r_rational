I've said in the past that I'll only start looking into publishing the story once it is done, and I remain committed to that. I want to finish the story first. In addition, I have heard that publishers make problems for authors that want to publish stories that already exist on the internet. Since I have no intention of taking down the free version of the story from the the net, that might be a problem.

Anyway, I suspect publishing MoL is going to be a long and somewhat frustrating process, so I don't want to deal with it at the moment. I'll gladly contact you for advice once I'm ready to move forwards with it, though.
