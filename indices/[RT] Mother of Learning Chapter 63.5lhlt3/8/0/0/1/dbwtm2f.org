Ew. This is like making an em dash out of two hyphens. Use the character that's designed for that purpose and let the typographers do their job.

The argument about not recognizing the character correctly is nonsense; they're already recommending the use of a non-ASCII character. Anything non-ASCII could be recognized incorrectly if the document is opened with the wrong character set. (Which is why you should always use UTF-8.)

The problem of “...” being rendered incorrectly is a matter of font choice. It's rendered poorly in Verdana, but it looks good in Helvetica and Times.

(I realize I'm effectively arguing with CMOS here.)
