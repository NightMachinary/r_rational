  . . . and let the typographers do their job. (I realize I'm effectively arguing with CMOS here.)

I agree with you on this. I'd rather use the character, ensure UTF-8 encoding, and be done with it.

Also, if one is not using a word processor, many are not even aware of being able to input these special characters. FYI everybody:

| Character | Alt-Code |
|-----------+----------|
| --        | 0150     |
| ---       | 0151     |
| ...       | 0133     |

On that note, I'd love for every keyboard to include the endash, endash, and ellipsis. /rant
