So ok. You're saying 1 of 2 things. In which case, your point still doesn't really apply.

1. You're describing this as a part of her power set - If that's what you're saying, then that applies to my statement about powers that use multiple constructs. It would obviously be broken in cases like that.

2. You're talking about another Tinker helping her by creating those things - yea, that would be a force multiplier. But that's one applied by someone else, with their powers working together. There are several powersets that would be very complimentary to the point of being broken, which is fine. My original point is just that, in and of itself, it wouldn't be very broken if Taylor was on her own. And that's without considering the cost of the situation you described, and Wildbow's made it clear that there is a cost to such things in his realistic-ish world.
