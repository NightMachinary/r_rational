Tinker - tech thought reading device + drones/dragon suits/remote-controled capes (with a little help from bonesaw). With unlimited multitasking, she could sit in the PRT HQ and send her minions anywhere in the world. If she can sense through them via feedback, she could have tens/hundreds of thousands of computer terminals with access drones - I doubt even the number man could beat her processing power with enough upscaling (he only has two hands).
