That's just not true. With people like Genesis or Panacea, then sure. But most power sets don't require a ton of multitasking. Any power that doesn't allow the use of multiple constructs (be they beams, lifeforms, other powers, etc.) won't be very much force multiplied, beyond the generic multiplier that would result from someone with increased intelligence/processing using said power.
