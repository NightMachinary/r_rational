Whoops... I can't believe I posted that to the wrong thread. Sorry about that...

But, to answer your questions, yes it's from A Practical Guide to Evil and yes, I think it's pretty good. As usual I recommend reading the first 5 - 10 chapters and checking it out for yourself but here's some further thoughts & opinions to help you decide whether you want to give it a go:

- It is definitely NOT rationalist Sherlock Holmes. No detective work. No deductions.
- It is definitely NOT rationalist.
- It's reasonably, but by no means completely, rational. The main characters are all intelligent in the way they gain and deploy resources to meet their objectives.
- It does a good job of over-turning the classic good vs. evil cliche.
- It's aimed at a young adult market so it's not overly complex. Reading it is more relaxing than taxing.
- We're into Book 3 of (if I recall correctly) 5 or 6 books. The author has been very reliable in providing weekly updates.
