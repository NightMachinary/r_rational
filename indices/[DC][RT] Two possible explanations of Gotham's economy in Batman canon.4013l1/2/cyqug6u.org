The crime wave of the seventies in our universe was almost certainly caused by leaded gasoline and the attendant negative effects on intelligence and personality. - Lead pollution knocks a few points of the average IQ and reduces impulse control on top of that - Which leads to lots more people failing at thinking the likely consequences of their actions through before embarking on a life of crime.

Riffing off this, I am going to blame Gotham and it's fucking weirdness on a similar environmental problem. in the 1920's an early Wayne, the founder of the Wayne industrial empire, discovered a very effective anti-oxidation steel coating. Very hard wearing, somewhat self-healing, a nice matte black, non-toxic. Huge commercial success. Unfortunately, while the Wayne coating itself was perfectly safe, the waste products from producing it include a compound with very interesting neurological effects.

And it got into the water. And the soil.

Primary: It's powerfully anti-akrasiatic. Gothamites do not slack off. It really, really, does not improve judgement, but the /average/ gothamite works insanely hard to make the most of themselves -

The primary job of fitness trainers in Gotham is to keep their clients from damaging themselves from overexertion, gothamite corporations put up with operating in a city with an endemic supervillain problem because the productivity of the local workforce is off the charts, and people stay in a city with an insane murder rate because the ability to work 40 hours per week, then go home and study / work out / ect for another 40 is very, very hard to give up.

Secondly, to a small subset of the population, it does more than this. Batman, and a very large number of his villains are all suffering from a similar toxin induced cognitive malfunction - Obsessed with costumes and a theme, high intelligence applied towards said obsession, extremely elevated pain treshhold, and so on and so forth.

Gotham also doesn't actually have that many more criminals than anywhere else, it's just because given that noone in Gotham is a slacker, none of the criminals Gotham does have are small time. Noone shoplifts - it's honest work or escalating all the way to a minimum of bank heists.
