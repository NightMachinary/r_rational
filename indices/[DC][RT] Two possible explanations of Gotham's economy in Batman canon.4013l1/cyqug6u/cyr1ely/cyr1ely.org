In the videogame Archam City (and probably other places throughout the franchise) they mention the existence of "Lazarus Pits" in the ruins below Gotham city. Because of their healing and literal anti-aging properties, Ra's al Ghul is known to use these pools to maintain his eternal youth, but they're also known to cause insanity and death in lesser men. It's very possible that this stuff is leaching into the Gotham water supply and having a significant effect on its citizens.
