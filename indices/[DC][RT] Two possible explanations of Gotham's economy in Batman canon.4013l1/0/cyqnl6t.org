I think people forget what a shithole New York City was. 1990 was the peak in murders per year; there were 2245 compared to 328 last year, and that's with the population increasing by 15% in the interim. The same applies to violent crime, property crime, etc. This change didn't just happen in New York City, it happened all over the place, for reasons that are disputed. Most of the large companies that are currently headquartered in New York City were there during the early 1990s and late 1980s, when crime got real bad (including large financial companies, pharama companies, etc.). That was /also/ the period when the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Families][Five Families]] start to get knocked around by RICO charges (Mafia Commission Trial dates to 1985) which I think eventually contributed to the drop in crime.

So I think that crime in Gotham isn't actually that difficult to swallow, if you assume that things happened a little differently there. Whatever factors you want to attribute to the reduction of crime just didn't occur. But that doesn't mean that you can't have enormous companies operating there either, because that's the scenario that New York City found itself in.

The other thing is that we have a severe sampling bias; obviously Batman goes where the crime is and the narrative follows him.
