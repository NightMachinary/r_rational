I guess we can now rule out the possibility that the stoning was something that "mother nature" and given the size of the blast it seems unlikely that it was a dilebarate attack of some country on another. I'd also find it unlikely that it was some technological accident since the 'stoning' are so complex, gives energy to keep the brain running for thousands of years and can regenerate tissue. So I am leaning towards either alien technology or some crazy scientist.

Possibly to prevent some catastophy such as some incurable disease or global warming. Or in the case of aliens maybe shoving us back to stone age to prevent us from exploring space.

Given that the people on the space station aren't affected by the bomb we can probably rule out any kind of radiation causing the stoning. Maybe some kind of resilient virus that aggresively bonded with human DNA(even dead) and were spread through the wind blast of the bomb?
