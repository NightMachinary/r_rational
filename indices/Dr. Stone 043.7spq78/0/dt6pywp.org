What is this "getting rescued"? They keep a Soyuz spacecraft docked at all times for a reason.

The stoning thing looks like it emanated as a sphere about some point on the surface of the earth. In order for the astronauts to escape it, the space station would have to be on almost the exact opposite side and the radius would have to be almost precisely the diameter of the earth. The ISS isn't really that far into space. Given that they can see it, and that it's not spreading extremely slowly, it doesn't seem to be likely. Maybe there's a big glowy sphere in addition to whatever force turns people into statues acting only on the surface.
