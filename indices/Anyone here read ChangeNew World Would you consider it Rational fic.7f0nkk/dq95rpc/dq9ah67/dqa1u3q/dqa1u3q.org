But the world does resolve around the protagnist. It so blatantly borrows from the Japanese Light and Web Novels in the harem department. The character gets everything and eventually his harem gets additional perks for falling over his dick.

Maybe their decisions were consistent but i dont like when author tries to sell me on a plan being particulary clever or intelligent when its something everyone would have thought of.

As i said its most similiar to the LitRPG harem LNs and xianxia in its terms of portraying the protag and makes it blatantly obvious by doing thins in such cliche way

also its edgy as all hell.
