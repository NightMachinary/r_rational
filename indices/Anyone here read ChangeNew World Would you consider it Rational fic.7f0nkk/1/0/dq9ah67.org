It speaks very highly of you to admit potential bias. Not that that it would invalidate your criticism.

I would, however, speak in defense of this author.

While I am absolutely familiar with the works of which you speak, wherein the story is nonsensical in order to fit the needs of portraying the protagonist as optimal in the mind of the writer, I do believe that this writing is not an example of that common issue.

The reason I brought this story up is that I believe that, while the decisions of the characters and the plans they make are infrequently optimal - as you said sometimes 'idiotic' - they /do/ fit in with the given information about the character making them.

I think, rather than "rational" the point of a good rational fiction is *consistency*.

The characters in this story consistently make actions according to their given motivations and knowledge. If the plans are bad, it's because the character is intentionally written with flaws in order to create character depth, and the plans reflect that.

If a plan is reckless it's because the character has been shown to value short term gain over safety. etc.

I think that this story is not one that is as shallow as the stories of which both of us have apparently read in which the world seemingly revolves around the protagonist showing off.

I think this protagonist is exceptional, but not without depth.

HPMOR is no different. Harry's plans in that story are rarely truly optimal, and the author himself stated that the character was a representation of his immature past.

I don't think it's about "best" objectively. I think it's about thinking about what the character would think is "best" given their current information, circumstances, and history.

To this point I think the author did a good job. The plans are rational if you assume the point of view of the characters making them.
