from what i remember i wouldnt consider it rational.

In many instances characters do stupid decisions out of the blue. Its just a power fantasy self insertion wishfulfillment so its always obvious whos gonna win, its just a matter of how will the author justify the MC being more and more OP. His plans are sometimes idiotic and they are sold to us as particulary intelligent or clever.

Generaly i cant see anything particulary rational about it but i also have a massive hate boner for those kind of stories so i may be biased. I REALLY dislake power fantasy self insert wishfulfillment things...i read to many in my days to count and got so sick of it...
