I think it definitely wasn't written with rationality in mind, but the writing does, imo, show signs of being written by someone with rationality in mind. Specifically the protagonist seems to think in fairly rational ways, even if it's not necessarily textbook methodology. Additionally the characters and decisions they make do tend to "make sense" in the way that they would in a rational fic.

I would admit there's a slight lack in striving to understand the logistics of the setting that you normally see in rational fic, but much of that is excused realistically by the Protagonist's personality where practicality for the means of survival is key.

That said, characters are written to realistic depth and realistically follow their given circumstances for the most part.
