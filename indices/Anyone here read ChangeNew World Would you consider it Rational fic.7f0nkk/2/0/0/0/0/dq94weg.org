Well, it's a good read that was in top spots for a while on RR (while it was still updated).

I don't know if it can be considered [RT] as I'm not really a regular on this thread, but anyways.

It is quite a classic LitRPG as far as the basic structure is considered, but executes it really well.

First arc is actually quite long and more or less self-contained, but all-important character growth is neither here nor there, the story is sadly now on hiatus and second arc that is currently ongoing feels like it lost the steam.

To conclude, yeah it's a good story, but it feels nowhere near finished, probably won't be either and I'm not sure if it is material for this subreddit. +I'm not really sure what I wanted to write here, but give it a read. The only disappointment would be the fact that it's on a hiatus.+
