Into the iron Teeth is interesting but again not rational or even rationalist; is a goblin protag who gets raised by a logical ranger turned bandit.

Arcane Emperor is also entertaining and might be rationalist; protag ends up in alternate world where everyone has stats screen/ knows about magic his goal ends up being to create his own magic guild to free share of magical knowledge but he is also super overpowered and doesn't actually try and uplift society by disseminating non-magical knowledge (new world is in a weird non industrialized state where as he comes from modern day basically)
