No. Not rational, though at times it seems to try to be. I think one of the things that really threw me off was the distance and time measurements seemed to change based on what the author needed them to be. Like, "we ran down the hallway for 15 minutes." dude, if you're running down a hallway for that long, your hallway could be miles long. That's ridiculous for a high school. I've been on university campuses with 40k students; 15 minutes running could take you across most of the campus itself, nevermind a hallway in a single wing of a single building.

I think I might be biased a bit though. This series was one I saw highly recommended at RR and was just... So poorly written. After reading it I came away with the distinct impression that the author likely started it as a high school or early college student with little experience in writing. The quality did actually improve a bit as it went on, but boy was it rough for most of it. The tropes we're groan-worthy as well, especially the protagonist's rivalry with the stereotypical "shonen lead with a harem of beautiful girls." Ugh.

It turned me off from the genre (self insert gamer progression) for a long time; I think I'm actually a bit bitter, because it kept me from reading a good series with a similar genre, "Worth the Candle."

Credit where it is due, the author makes some creative solutions to issues that come up. But creative doesn't mean rational. It has rational elements at times, but the world is set up and written in such a way that the protagonist is always going to get to show off.
