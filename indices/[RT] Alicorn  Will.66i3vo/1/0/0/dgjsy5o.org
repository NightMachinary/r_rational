I liked some parts of Elcenia, where there was a plot larger than the characters, but even that wasn't as good as Alicorn's other work (e.g. the political subplot in /Blood/ has weird emphases, and the other shoe never drops in Leekath's addiction.) And yes, /Silver/ did seem sort of pointless.

But there're some good parts even there.
