As an alternative viewpoint, I really enjoyed all of the Elcenia books (as well as Luminosity and all of Alicorn's other work), including /Silver/, /Siaddaki/ etc. Reading about normal, not world-shattering or "supergenius" characters, but in a fascinating, really well-developed fantasy world (or more exactly a collision of two fantasy worlds (ignoring Isatei)) was very interesting.

I loved Ehail, as a character --- how she tried to cure Shrenhood over tens (hundreds? --- it's been a while since I read the books) of years and then Kaylo fixed it in a couple of months, just to make his girlfriend happy (rather than because it was a huge humanitarian problem...) or how she coped with one of her adopted children being taken away, because the birth parents who had shunned their child suddenly want them back when they were cured.

I also liked the exploration, in the background, of fantasy societal issues such as the (horrifying) problem of Shrenhood and the stigmatisation of Shrens by dragons, the power-imbalance between Elcenia and Barashim and how their alternative attitudes towards the treatment of children, clashed. It's nice how the problems in the books are not just intended as metaphors for (or are a crude transplantation of) some real world problems, but organically develop within the fantasy world.

Also, the universe is realistic --- for instance, how the greatest recent jumps in progress were due to the interaction between two, until recently separate worlds and the sharing of knowledge/magic between them. (e.g. Kaylo is a genius, but he would have probably achieved slightly less if he didn't have access to Kamai).
