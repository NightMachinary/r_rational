It /should/ be taken seriously yes. I think you're thinking that; the AI doesn't "pay much attention" to the medulla pain-thought, cos it's not a "sophisticated" thought, so it doesn't act to stop it? Be charitable man. My dream-AI wouldn't set up a "10-year simulation of the-effects-of-this-pain-on-this-human-in-the-wider-society-simulation" [the sophisticated response] but would act with a basic "get rid of that pain source quick" [non-sophisticated, i.e. of same-sophistication response]. /That's/ not a fail mode man. It is cute though. (There are actually some pretty deep theoretical reasons for an approach like this as well.)

Hey thanks for the comment. It's nicer to have a discussion than to just throw my thoughts into the ether, so you should know that I will read your response if it comes :-)

Edit: about "sophistication" for the depressed girl, which you might have been thinking about when you interpreted my comment. The reasoning would go something like; acting to bring about the particular future specified by her in her depression is way more sophisticated than the source thoughts of the depression, so, all other things being equal, a less sophisticated solution should be found. As an example the other direction, a hug might NOT be sophisticated enough for this depression.
