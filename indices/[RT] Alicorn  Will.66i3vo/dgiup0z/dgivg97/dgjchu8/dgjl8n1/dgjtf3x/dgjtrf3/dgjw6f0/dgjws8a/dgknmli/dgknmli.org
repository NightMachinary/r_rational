To take a living person and make them be dead... I think we can all agree that murder is wrong. And in the case of accidental death or murder, if I could rewind time five minutes to save people, I'm sure I would (though I'm not convinced I should). But that's not what the story proposes. I am far from convinced that bringing someone back to life after the fact is better than leaving them dead -- and the more time between death and potential resurrection, the harder the question becomes.

If you have the power of a god, but not the prerequisite wisdom, you end up with the kind of situation here where you are now forcing the dead into a form of de facto slavery to the singular. I note that the protagonist did not do any of this because it would be better for the dead girl, but for entirely selfish reasons. And everyone she interacted with seemed to think that "waking a sleeping maiden" was sufficient reason for everything. This in a world proven to still be subject to the laws of scarcity.
