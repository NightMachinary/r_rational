As I indicated, I'm not sure time elapsed should matter, morally speaking. But on an instinctual level, it does. In general, one would suppose that the more god-like the powers needed to perform the action, the more god-like wisdom is needed to make such a decision.

Naturally, to the dead, the difference between a second and a billion years is the same. But the motives of the people performing "resuscitation" a billion years later are not the same, and are in fact quite opaque. Presumably a society doing so would be sufficiently advanced morally and ethically to know that what they are doing is right. Or perhaps they've been caught up in some kind of perverted oneupmanship game and are bringing back the dead just to prove some stupid point.

There are other, more current, issues where the passage of time seems to make a difference in peoples' moral judgements.
