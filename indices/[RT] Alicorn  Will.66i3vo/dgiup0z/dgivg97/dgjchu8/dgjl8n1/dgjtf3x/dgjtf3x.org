Perhaps by this communities standards, I'm eccentric. Not, I think, by the standards of most people, though.

Do I want everyone to die? I suppose so. Not in any particular case, though. Give me a person and a scenario, and I'd probably argue for life (though I'm sure someone could come up with an example of someone who just needs to not exist any more). But in general?

If /this/ is what people will do with forever... then maybe they and everyone else would be better off not having it. Person wants to die. Wants for her existence to come to an end. And then finds out that no matter what conditions she had set, society would eventually meet them and force her back into the world. Can they cure her of not wanting to die? Would she still be herself afterwards? And the whole thing about the perfect girlfriend. "If I'm not good enough, we can find someone else who is"? I'm pretty sure that's not how romantic relationships work.

Should people really be able to bring historical figures back from the dead? My first "celebrity crush" was Jane Austin. Of course I'd bring her back if I could. And I shouldn't be allowed to do so under any circumstances. So creepy!

How long can a mind live while still being fundamentally itself? It's easier to argue that we are constantly changing into someone else, the new self displacing the old. It must be so, else the old self would become stagnant and a thing no longer living. How can one balance long term stability with continual self-renewal? And how will you handle the heat-death of the universe? The fundamental problem of scarcity? Once you've solved those problems, you've probably attained godhood by any reasonable definition and can be trusted to make these decisions for other people. Then maybe you can be trusted to give immortality to others, and decide when, where, and how.
