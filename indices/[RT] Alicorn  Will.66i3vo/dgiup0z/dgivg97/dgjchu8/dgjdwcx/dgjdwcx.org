You'll have to be more specific. The living forever part? The multi planet human empire part? The cosmetic surgeries?

The optional suicide option for those who want nothing to do with it? I can sort of see why one would object to this, but having a will that outlines the conditions on which you'll permit yourself to be resurrected seems like a very fair compromise between the immortal camp and the camp apparently populated by people who share the opposite opinion.

Simply calling it all "creepy" doesn't help us narrow it down and optimize what might be wrong with it.
