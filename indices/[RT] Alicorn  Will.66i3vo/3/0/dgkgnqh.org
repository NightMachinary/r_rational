I'm actually happy to explain that, it just didn't fit within "Will". There's a superintelligent AI singleton which can do most things but not break FTL or do Prime Intellect style magic or nanotech absolutely everything into behaving itself trivially, so everybody is still physically instantiated and the Singleton is budgeting its negentropy because there's a limit to how much it can harvest more and bring it in and that trades off against how well it will do at supplying human colonies within reasonable travel distance &c. So it makes things very nice, but if you want something unusual you have to pay for a miracle. Because Markets.
