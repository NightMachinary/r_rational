I think I felt something like this, so I'll try to put it into words:

We went around the solar system, so whatever ideas I get by the end of the story, I expect any place in the solar system to have similar aspects.

There's clearly huge material wealth e.g. fabbing. The tone was casual, even when asking for economic things like work or production, or surveillance or behaviour restriction. Banks' Culture felt similar. I don't like trading such things. The actor who didn't like the show will return - presumably he'll get money, and the person who'll be surveilled gets money. For a utopia these feel to me like suspicious solutions. It seems to put a low ceiling over people's social kindness and intelligence.

WARNING: RAMBLE INCOMING.

I admit the body modification thing weirds me out. [In the rationalist reflex style, I try to come up with some I might like, and I have a vague idea about the interest of inhabiting an animal body for a while, so I give the whole idea the benefit of the doubt.]

...but my unease with that section continues. The person gives shallow aesthetic justifications for modification. (Damn that's a clunky sentence). I think I want such power to be used... responsibly? with more caution? but is there any harm? [In another rationalist reflex I think about this: what do I expect to go wrong if it's treated casually, with only a little aesthetic thought? Well I'd expect any possible modification that has some possible aesthetic justification to be tried. But wouldn't that lead to a huge mess overall? I think of a hypothetical crowd of people there - with such huge variation, it might to be ugly from any perspective! And if the justification is shallow, you won't be able to get other people not to do something you find ugly. Maybe this utopia, like Banks' Culture, 'solves' this by giving enough space for people to avoid each other. But this seems to put a low ceiling over people's social kindness and intelligence.

END OF RAMBLE - WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR FORBEARANCE.

The girl wakes up at the end, cured by miracle. There /are/ loads of good things about it. If she seems shallow, well she is young. I might have different thoughts if she was 120 and receiving such kindness without blinking. There doesn't seem to be any pressure on her to improve but it's a short scene right? And do we need everyone to improve in a utopia anyway?

RAMBLE ALERT SECOND WAVE What worried me? The /trivial/ wishes were treated /seriously/ . [The part of me that dreams about AI says that the wishes should be treated with the same sophistication as the cognitive processes that gave rise to them. The part of me that rewrites every story to make it nicer for me, says that there's a good principle making the singleton fulfill the letter of such wishes, and the person can improve themselves within their wished environment just the same as another environment, and she won't stagnate at the level-she-woke-up-in for eternity.] The prospect of her stagnating is what frightens me I think. The rest of society seemed like it might allow it: there didn't seem to be pressure to "increase WIS" at any of the locations we visited, avoiding things she doesn't like completely is economically possible, and even trivial dislikes, which wouldn't normally fix themselves in a human mind, might be taken seriously, and therefore fix themselves in hers. And I don't want space filled with stagnating humans. I want us to grow up together. CLEAR SKIES AHEAD - THANK YOU FOR FLYING WITH US
