I'm genuinely curious about what specifically creeped you out. Whatever it is, it's not as obvious to the rest of us as you seem to have expected.

I can see how one might find the "your dream girlfriend" thing kind of stalkerish, but your issue seems to be something stemming more directly from the immortality part, so I'm stumped.
