  If this is what people will do with forever... then maybe they and everyone else would be better off not having it.
#+end_quote

So, you feel equipped to make this judgement for other people? Why?

#+begin_quote
  If this is what people will do with forever... then maybe they and everyone else would be better off not having it. Person wants to die. Wants for her existence to come to an end. And then finds out that no matter what conditions she had set, society would eventually meet them and force her back into the world. Can they cure her of not wanting to die? Would she still be herself afterwards?
#+end_quote

Normally, when someone wants to die, they are considered mentally unfit. Depression, by the way, is treated and even 'cured' right now, in the present. It usually involves medication and is widely considered to be a good thing.

  Should people really be able to bring historical figures back from the dead? My first "celebrity crush" was Jane Austin. Of course I'd bring her back if I could. And I shouldn't be allowed to do so under any circumstances. So creepy!
#+end_quote

It would be creepy if you brought Jane Austin back from the dead and then tried to own her like a pet. It would not be creepy if you petitioned your government to use advanced medical technology to return her to life, give her full citizenship, and allow her to live her own life. How could that possibly qualify as creepy?

  And the whole thing about the perfect girlfriend. "If I'm not good enough, we can find someone else who is"? I'm pretty sure that's not how romantic relationships work.
#+end_quote

So, what exactly qualifies you to decree how romantic relationships work for an entire species?

  How long can a mind live while still being fundamentally itself? It's easier to argue that we are constantly changing into someone else, the new self displacing the old. It must be so, else the old self would become stagnant and a thing no longer living.
#+end_quote

This is literally you addressing your own problem. The self is fundamentally and obviously transient. Attempting to cling to a self-image as an unchanging constant is absurd.

#+begin_quote
  And how will you handle the heat-death of the universe? The fundamental problem of scarcity? Once you've solved those problems, you've probably attained godhood by any reasonable definition and can be trusted to make these decisions for other people. Then maybe you can be trusted to give immortality to others, and decide when, where, and how.
#+end_quote

So what you're basically saying is that if we have the power to enact the scenario described in this story, we also meet your arbitrary standards for being allowed to do it? Well, that's good to know.
