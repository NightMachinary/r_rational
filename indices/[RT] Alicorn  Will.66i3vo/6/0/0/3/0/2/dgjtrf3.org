I have to assume that Cory retains the option to return to being dead, if she chooses. We know that she had the option the first time, and there's nothing in the story to suggest that it's no longer available to her.

Also, it's implied that she chose death because she was clinically depressed, and she no longer is. Surely it's better for her to have the opportunity to decide if she'd prefer to be alive /sans/ depression, than for her to just stay dead forever because the only options she was ever presented with were "miserable" and "dead"?

I'm not sure I buy the argument that you need to know how to handle the heat-death of the universe in order to have the right to bring people back from the dead. Personally I think surviving /until/ heat death would be a damn good deal. Anything beyond that is icing.

As for the problem of scarcity, it's implied in the story that "Singleton" makes this a non-issue.

I can agree with you that resurrecting someone /for one's own gratification/ is pretty creepy, but I don't think that means all resurrections must be creepy, or that creepy resurrections are worse than being dead forever.
