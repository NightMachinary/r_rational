  the more time between death and potential resurrection, the harder the question becomes.

This seems to be the point of confusion in the description of your philosophy, that the moral value of resuscitation trends down based on the time elapsed since death. That's counter-intuitive to me, and seems to be for others as well. Is there some specific element of time that's causing this trend or is it an implicit element such as decay of social bonds, loss of familiar environments, competitive disadvantage or something else suggested by a passing of time?
