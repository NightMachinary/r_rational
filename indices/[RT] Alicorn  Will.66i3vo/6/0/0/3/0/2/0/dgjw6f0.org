That's just it! Where did "Dead = Bad" come from?! What is wrong with this subreddit?! In /American Gods/, was there something wrong with Shadow choosing "Nothing" as his afterlife?

But I find this is a complicated discussion that I don't really want to have. I tried to sum it up with a pithy and snarky line, but apparently this community doesn't appreciate that with viewpoints they disagree with.
