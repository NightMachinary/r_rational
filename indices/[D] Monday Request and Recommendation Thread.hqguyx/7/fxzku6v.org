Hey guys, I just finished A Thing Of Vikings and I'm looking for something of similar length or longer to read, preferably fantasy, that it's either finished or regularly updated. I've already looked into everything on the tvtropes, the wiki, top web fiction, the first 20 pages of royalroad's active only ranking and the most popular stuff(mostly quests) on sufficient velocity, I haven't really checked spece battles out. If it's a translation I'm only interested if the grammar is at least a 7/10, because I tried reading release that witch and it was impossible. And lastly while I don't mind if it's ff I really couldn't get into the original Worm.
