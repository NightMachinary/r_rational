Not really rational, but The Devil Is A Part Timer is an anime about fantasy universe stock characters getting portaled into Tokyo and getting part-time jobs. It derives a lot of its humor from characters handling this sort of thing like responsible adults, which should have some overlap with the tastes around here.
