Re:Creators is actually pretty fun just for the concept: the characters from various fictional hellworlds come to our world, and they have a few things they'd like to discuss with their authors.

On that note, Cop Craft also has fantasy-character-in-modern-world, although I wouldn't recommend it for any other reason or indeed suggest watching more than an episode since the storytelling falls apart completely later.

Hataraku Maou-Sama, on the other hand, although it's straight up comedy, has surprisingly good pacing and even worldbuilding.
