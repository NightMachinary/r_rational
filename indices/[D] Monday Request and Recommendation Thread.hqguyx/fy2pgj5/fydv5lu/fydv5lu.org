Maybe not rational to the standard you're hoping for, but Wildbow is pretty good at writing emotionally charged characters that are still smart. Worm is his most famous work but his other works are also good. I can especially attest for Twig, which has some great character work and dialogue. I've also heard good things about his latest story Pale.
