  Some readers think the main character is sexist because he doesn't like hurting women and doesn't expect them to betray him or beat him in a fair fight,

Well, that, and there's a definite male gaze going on, where he tends to describe women primarily based on how sexually attractive he finds them. Even his best friend's teenaged daughters, which gets squickier each time a few years passes and the next daughter hits puberty.

Yes, some of that can be excused by him being possessed by the spirit of primal instinct, but this was going on well before that happened.
