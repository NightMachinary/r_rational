Seconding to start on book three. If you like the series you'll go back to book 1 & 2 some time later to get the details or just read it on a wiki, but starting on books 1 or 2 will make you wonder why it was recommended. There are significant plot arcs started in book 3 that don't get tied up until book 10 /Changes/ or later.
