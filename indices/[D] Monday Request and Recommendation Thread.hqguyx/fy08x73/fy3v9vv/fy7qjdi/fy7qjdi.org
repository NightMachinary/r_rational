I think the pro-authoritarian slant is a consequence of writing a non-revolutionary in the Naruto setting but I would say that the other themes don't really show up for more than a second before the beginning of the sequel. To me, that seems an unfortunate consequence of the author's biases rather than a deliberate effort to affect the audience, which isn't a dealbreaker. YMMV.
