I quite liked Compass of thy soul and Direct thee to peace, but upon reflection the stories had super questionable pro-authoritarian politics. On a macro level the duology maintains that royalty is implicitly better than everyone else due to, effectively, the divine right of kings (in this case as expressed by the Uchiha doujutsu), and that everything would have been better if the Senju had just known their place.

There was also a bunch of weird Christian stuff in the background - there's very little mention of the Kamis at all but whenever it comes up the MC makes vague references to believing in monotheism still, and the reincarnated MC introduces a bunch of our-world songs to the Uchiha clan, at least one of which is from Veggie Tales. It's fine and mostly stays out of the way, up until like the last couple of paragraphs in DTP, where you're smashed over the head with a literal deathbed conversion.

Both stories were good, don't get me wrong, but if you dislike getting ambushed by Christian (or authoritarian) themes in novels you should go into them with your eyes open.
