[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]] is a Youjo Senki AU fanfic that has been recommended here before, but I'm writing this to let people know that it's finished. The plot is that the mostly-rational main character of the magitech WW1 anime enters politics following a moderately worse version of canon (ie, like actual WW1) and succeeds /Springtime for Hitler/ style. There are minor issues with the worldbuilding that most people (not having any experience in national politics or international diplomacy outside of strategy video games, a couple whiggish biographies and some movies) will not notice and the small cast of characters are written very well. At present the epilogue has yet to be posted, but the author's rationale that the story must end because the lead has won and is no longer an outsider to the establishment is valid. 4/5

I would also like to recommend the excellent animated films of multiple oscar-nominee Don Hertzfeldt and his associates. All but his three feature-length works are on youtube and they display an excellent concern for the open psychological and existential questions concerning human mortality, with the three feature length works critically examining the question of identity with respect to transhumanism. 5/5

Finally, I recommend the pre-canon Naruto fanfic [[https://fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1][Compass of thy soul]] and it's sequel, [[https://fanfiction.net/s/13388642/1/Direct-thee-to-Peace][Direct thee to peace]], which finished last week. It is a capably written story about the rigors of internecine warfare on the military families in the setting, and the author has clearly researched the living conditions of pre-unification Japan. The sequel drops the ball to become a moderately hammy story about a family of patriarchs and scions coming to blows over their differences but it remains engaging and the cast are mostly rational even if breaks SoD on the nature of civil and military governance. 4/5
