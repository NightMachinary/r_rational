There's a factorio multicrossover called Factory Isolation, where the protagonist is given a dimensional teleporter and access to the Factorio world to scale up his tech and go and uplift other worlds. Another story similar to that is called Cruel to be Kind, which is an SI story but without too much pandering (I think?). Cruel to be Kind follows the author as he uses his dimensional teleporter to go to different worlds to steal their tech and build his own kingdom. They can both be found on Spacebattles.
