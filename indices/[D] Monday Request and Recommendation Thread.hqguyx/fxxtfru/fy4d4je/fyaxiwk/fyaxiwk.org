Are the books better than the anime? Because I watched the anime, and while it's similar to IBBFW, it's far from rational. A real person in that situation would mess up /way/ more than Senku, wouldn't have an eidetic memory, and would probably go insane from getting stuck in a rock for 3,700 years while fully conscious.

It also treated science as a religion, often having it's characters preach the virtues of "believing in science".
