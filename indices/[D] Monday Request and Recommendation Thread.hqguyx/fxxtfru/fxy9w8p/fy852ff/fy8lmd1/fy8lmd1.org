My context can be off, but retrograde and anterograde amnesia are very common with traumatic brain injuries. Although typically only a few minutes of memories around the event disappear, that can escalate depending on the severity of the damage. The victim doesn't have to be unconscious either. Sometimes people recall what happened right after the concussion, but forget shortly afterward.

Though I do have to say, it's not a guaranteed outcome.
