Any recommendations for futuristic people getting isekaied, or crash landing, into a fantasy world? Preferably with a focus on them using the technology they brought with them rather than using their knowledge to build things. I read [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31468/the-cosmic-interloper][The Cosmic Interloper]] which is just what I'm looking for, but is incomplete. It has (minor spoilers) a paladin attacks the protagonist by summoning a spirit, which they realize is a brain wave like you would see from a scanner being broadcasted. So they record it, then start it up as a simulation on their brain computer and talk to the spirit. Also [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31129/fantasy-world-epsilon-30-10][Fantasy World Epsilon 30-10]] which wasn't nearly as good.
