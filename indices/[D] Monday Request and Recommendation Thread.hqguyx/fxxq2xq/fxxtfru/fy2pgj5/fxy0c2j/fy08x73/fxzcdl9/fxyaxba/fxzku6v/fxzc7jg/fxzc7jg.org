I've got two things two recommend today. TW: Ponies

*First*, I want to recommend basically everything by *Forthwith*([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3196486/Forthwith16][fanfic]], [[https://www.fimfiction.net/user/173607/Forthwith/stories][fimfic]]), especially the mlp fanfics [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/174671/seeking-power][Seeking Power]] , [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice][The Moon's Apprentice]] , and the Code Geass fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870721/1/Kallen-Stadtfeld-Countess-of-Britannia][Kallen Stadtfeld, Countess of Britiannia]].

Forthwith's stories are inspired by HPMOR, often fairly explicitly. Both the MLP fics have a main character very similar to HJPEV and relationships/strategies that will feel familiar. Also, as you might imagine, it doesn't take much for Lelouch from Code Geass to be a rationalist. Overall, the writing is high quality, the plotting is good, and the humor is fun. The Moon's Apprentice is complete, Seeking Power was just majorly revised with an eye toward continuation, and the Code Geass Fic updates in batches every few months. Also, I wouldn't be shocked if the author is on this subreddit, so hello! if that's the case.

*Second*, I kind of want to recommend the mlp fic [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/25966/austraeoh][Austraeoh]]

I say kind of because there are some major pros and cons to this fic, which I'll go through, but it's just so unique I want to talk about it for a little bit.

*What is Austraeoh about?*

Austraeoh is an epic journey. It is long. No, really, it's longer than what you're thinking. At almost 3.7 million words it is currently roughly 3 times the length of Worm and about 1.5 times the current length of A Practical Guide to Evil. It's one of the longest works in the English language. After a two-year hiatus it just started updating again, so who knows how far there still is to go. It features a single main character, Rainbow Dash, traveling east, and touches on various companions that join and leave her along the way. Book 1 is basically a standalone. Books 2-6 are a set which introduce some wonderful side characters. Books 7-8 mark a new start, and Book 9 (in progress) continues from book 8, but is clearly a significant break from the previous books.

*Pros:*

- Some very interesting plotting. In particular, the hero/villain plotting and counter plotting toward the end of the eighth book is some of the most unique I've read with a final outcome that hits like a freight train. The villains throughout are compelling and frightening without being copycats of one another. I'd say most characters behave reasonably, without too many egregious idiot balls, but there are a few. To be fair, the main character is not known for her intelligence. I don't recall anything that broke my suspension of disbelief too much, but I have a high tolerance for that type of thing.
- Fairly fast pace. Because the main character is constantly traveling, local plot points are brought up and resolved at a reasonable speed. Overarching points take longer but there is definite development fairly frequently. It's certainly not just a meandering mess of hanging plot points that you might fear from it's length.
- Characters are a strong point. They are by and large well rendered and enjoyable. Rainbow Dash really grows and develops as a person (pony) and in later books that comes into fascinating conflict with who she used to be. I don't like original characters as a rule, but the ones in this series really won me over with their diverse voices and unique perspectives. Good characters do bad things and vice versa, and they grow and learn from the experience. (One dude is blind but has a magical echo-location device, which obviously isn't personality based, but is awesome.)
- Epic scale/stakes. The series touches on things like ringworlds and cosmic civilizations. This is more the underlying plot than the main one, so think of it as a bonus rather than the primary reason to read the series. In addition, the stakes in each conflict Rainbow Dash gets into feel very real. She doesn't always win and when she fails there are real consequences for her or for characters she (and the reader) have come to care about. There are a few emotional farewells, and one in particular at which I shed a tear.

*Cons:*

- Writing is idiosyncratic. I won't say bad, because it's not, but it varies widely in level of maturity. Some of the emotional scenes are incredibly weighty and well written, while some of the humor is crude and goes on for far too long. Other sections are shockingly dark. Children get tortured/killed, both on screen and off. It's not for the faint of heart, but looking at a chapter at random you wouldn't guess how dark it can get. Also, the author uses words that I've never seen anywhere else. They're immediately intelligible, but somewhat strange.
- Length. I said it before, but in all honesty, I'm not sure this series is better than the sum value of the ten or so other books you could read in the meantime. Fortunately, it's written in fairly discrete increments, so it's relatively easy to put down and pick back up. I am glad I read it, but I can't imagine rereading it.
- Unfinished. The author is writing again, after quite a long time, but there is still clearly quite some ways to go before the end of this journey. I hope he makes it to the end, but I don't think even he would guarantee it.

*Final thoughts:* this is by the author of [[https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/background-pony][Background Pony]] which I can wholeheartedly recommend and is one of the MLP fandom's favorite stories. He knows how to write a dramatic and impactful story. I personally find something deeply satisfying about starting an absurdly long series and having it feel like a worthwhile journey as I slowly work my way through it. In some ways, odd as it sounds, this series reminds me of the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen][Malazan Book of the Fallen]] (another very good, very long, occasionally very dark series).

If you're uncertain, I'd say give it at least through book 2. The first book sets up a lot of things, but the second book is where the world really starts to expand and the secondary characters come into their own. As I said, it's not for everyone, but I think it might appeal to some of the people on this subreddit. At the very least, I hope you marvel at the time and energy this one strange person has put into a single story.
