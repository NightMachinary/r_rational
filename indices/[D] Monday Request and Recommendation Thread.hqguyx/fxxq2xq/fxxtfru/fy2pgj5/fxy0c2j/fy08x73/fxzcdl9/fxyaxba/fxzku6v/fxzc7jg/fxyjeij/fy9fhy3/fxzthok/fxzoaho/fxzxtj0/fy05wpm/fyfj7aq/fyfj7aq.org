You also may be interested in FanFicFare. It's a free and open source program that most people use as a Calibre plugin. It's extremely configurable and will create clean and consistent ebooks from pretty much any website you can think of, and a ton that you can't.

It also can be used to track updates so you don't need to manually check these things.
