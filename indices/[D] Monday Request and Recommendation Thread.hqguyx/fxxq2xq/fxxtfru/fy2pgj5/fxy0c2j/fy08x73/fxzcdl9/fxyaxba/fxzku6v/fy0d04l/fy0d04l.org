- Forged Destiny by Coeur Al'aran is a rwby litrpg AU. The world of remnant has levels and classes, which are further separated into castes basically. Jaune is a blacksmith who wants to be a Hero (basically hunters). Really good AU, pretty much a whole new world and cast of characters with the names from rwby. Not that rational but complete and writing quality is pretty good.

- Ar'Kendrythist and Zombie Knight Saga on Royalroad. They're probably in the first 20 pages in royalroad but if you haven't read either I strongly recommend both.

- I hear good things about Purple Days, a timeloop story involving Joffrey from GoT. It's also pretty long at around 730k words.
