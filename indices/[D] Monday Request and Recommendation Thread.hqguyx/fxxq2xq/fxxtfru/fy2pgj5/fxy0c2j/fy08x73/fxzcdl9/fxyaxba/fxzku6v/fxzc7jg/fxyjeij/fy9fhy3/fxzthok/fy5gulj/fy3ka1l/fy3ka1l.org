I read books in the first category, but that's because I find that once I get reading I don't really stop until some other stimulus is imposed upon me. The only reason I cant read something is that, 1 its really bad, like really really bad. 2 that I get angry at the situation or embarrassed for the MC. So when like in Rom com an easily avoided misunderstanding is happening I can't stand it. A more rational example is when in Pokemon OOS in chapter 58 they aren't listening to professionals and I am currently stuck and can't go further because I just know something bad is gonna happen to them.
