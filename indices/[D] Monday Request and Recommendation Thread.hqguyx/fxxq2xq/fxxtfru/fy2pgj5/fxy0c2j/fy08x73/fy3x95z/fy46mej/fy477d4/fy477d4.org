That's just bad writing, though, not something that's out of his control.

Given that he's a pretty good writer, I think if he hadn't felt rushed by his obligation to patreon and browbeaten by spacebattles, he could have figured a better plot for the the third 'book'. Maybe an inversion of the conceit of the first two books, e.g. she tries to succeed and actually fails.
