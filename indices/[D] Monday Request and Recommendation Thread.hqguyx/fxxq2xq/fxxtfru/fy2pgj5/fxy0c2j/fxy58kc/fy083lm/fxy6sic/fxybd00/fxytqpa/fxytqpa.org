Bokura no Kiseki is this, in a sense. It's not really a gender bender, despite the fact the MC is reincarnated princess from a fantasy kingdom. Reincarnated character have two sets of memories and struggle with that, so it's not a clear cut isekai, but it is enjoyable and the whodunnit-with-magic-experiments lets it be rational to a degree.
