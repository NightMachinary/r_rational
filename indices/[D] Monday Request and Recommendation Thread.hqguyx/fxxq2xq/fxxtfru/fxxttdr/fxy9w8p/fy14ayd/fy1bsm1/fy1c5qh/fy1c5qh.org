A 19th-century factory manager is knocked on the head & transported back to a semi-fictitious medieval England. He proceeds to use his knowledge of engineering, sanitation, and materials science to usher in an industrial & cultural revolution. It's Mark Twain, so quite funny and well-written but definitely old-fashioned.
