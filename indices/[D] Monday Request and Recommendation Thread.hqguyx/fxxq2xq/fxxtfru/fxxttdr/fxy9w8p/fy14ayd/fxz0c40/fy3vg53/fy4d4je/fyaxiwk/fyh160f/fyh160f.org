I loved the anime, but that was admittedly with consciously making some allowances for the fact that it's trying to be a fun adventure story (and pro-science propaganda) for young kids, basically copying battle manga/anime like Naruto and so on but making science the focus instead of battle. So I kind of have to agree with your criticism here as far as realism goes.

The bad guy is unrealistically strong, Senku unrealistically smart, devices tend to work unrealistically well, inspirational speeches tend to meet wide-eyed acceptance, etc., often just simply because it's that kind of story. But at the same time, it's a researched story, and conveys believable/true scientific concepts in terms of tech dependencies, and also pays good attention to things like continuity and character growth.
