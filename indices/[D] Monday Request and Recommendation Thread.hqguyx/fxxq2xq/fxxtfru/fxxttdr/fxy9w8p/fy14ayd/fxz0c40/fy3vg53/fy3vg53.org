The [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/43333-conrad-stargard][Conrad Stargard Series]] has this. It's an uplift fic where an american engineer is transported to 13th century Poland, a decade or so before the mongol invasion, which he prepares for by uplifting poland into the industrial age.

The caveat is that it starts moderately chauvinistic and weird, and gets more so with every installment. If you can get past that the first 3-4 books are decent enough.

Another one is the [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/215776-destiny-s-crucible][Destiny's Crucible]] series where a chemist is transported to a small island on another world that's getting invaded by a large, powerful empire. Their tech is around 17-18th century.
