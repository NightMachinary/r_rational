Nothing that's got the same "hard science to magic" vibe, no. Stuff that's related-ish:

- RoyalRoad:

  - "I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)" - has the main character actively experimenting with the weird mechanics of how the "Lavi" and "Qi" work, but doesn't have the mundane-earth-science side.
  - "Cultivating Earth" (on hiatus) - an ancient Cultivator decides to set up a sect on Earth because it's a planet that's developed civilisation without Qi due to his actions. Very well written and I'm still hoping it starts up again.
  - "Eight" - has the MC applying their skills at woodscraft and knowledge about spiritual matters they'd learned from their family, rather than science.

- Sufficient Velocity:

  - "Marked for Death" - inbetween attempting mostly successfully to survive in a rationalised version of Naruto (which is a horrifying deathworld), the quest-avatar character attempts to Do Science to chakra and seals. (With mixed results.)

- Fanfiction.net

  - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12863641/1/The-Optimised-Wish-Project]] Rationalised DBZ - I'm not particularly a fan of the setting, so I've stopped following this one, but it does fit

- Other

  - Ra, by qntm ([[https://qntm.org/ra]]) - "Discovered in the 1970s, magic is now a bona fide field of engineering. There's magic in heavy industry and magic in your home. It's what's next after electricity." Hard magic-sci-fi.
  - Saga of Soul ([[http://www.sagaofsoul.com/]]) - "The story begins when Eriko, an introverted bookworm, suffers a near-death experience. Instead of walking toward the Light, she takes it upon herself to perform scientific experiments, which leads to her acquiring magical powers."
