I think you're right about the random event being more compelling than disease, but would question whether the "thesis" of the short story is that free will doesn't exist. One of the last lines is "From the beginning I knew my destination, and I chose my route accordingly", and if you look at Chiang's later works concerned with the topic ("The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate", "What's Expected of Us" and "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom") I think you get the impression that he believes very strongly in the idea of choice even in deterministic paradigms. From the commentary of "Merchant": "I wanted to try writing a time-travel story where the inability to [change the past] wasn't necessarily a cause for sadness. [...] acceptance of fate is one of the basic articles of faith in Islam."
