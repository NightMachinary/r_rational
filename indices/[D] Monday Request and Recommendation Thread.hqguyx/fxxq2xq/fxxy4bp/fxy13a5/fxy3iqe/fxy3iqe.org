I haven't read his other works but your quote is exactly in line with what I intended. She chose her route to match what she saw. The important word is "accordingly". She was incapable of choosing other than the future. This is mentioned a number of times as I remember. I am definitely not suggesting that it didn't feel like a choice, otherwise she would just save her daughter. Maybe if you want to get in some semantics about free will but either way I think it was clear from the book that it is a deterministic universe (ignoring how seeing into the future wouldn't work if there were branching timelines anyway) and that everything happens at once, time is just another dimension. No more can you teleport from one spot to another or walk one way and arrive in another place can you change time. Any other explanation doesn't make sense with the actions of the aliens either. Choice must not actually exist for the alien plot of the book to work. I don't want to get into a semantic argument about free will and compatibilism, suffice to say by "free will" I mean determinism, and the movie does not focus on the acceptance of the determinism of the universe but instead as I said suggests that the universe is not deterministic and that she could have chosen differently
