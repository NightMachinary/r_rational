Some books I read a couple of hundred words and I can't put it down, and will read for hours at a time rather than do so. (Luminosity, Hunger Games, The Martian, The Handmaid's Tale to name a few of the most marked). I want to read them a second, third, fourth, eleventh time just for the pleasure of having my eyes so blessed.

Some books I read, but I have to put effort in to make the time, and overall I enjoy them, but it's a very different experience to the above. (Like right now I'm reading The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul, which falls into that category).

So, uh, do people tend to only read books in the first category? Am I wasting my time by reading too many books in the second? Do people have heuristics they use to choose books? Or do they just download Kindle samples with reckless abandon and if they're swept up happily buy the full article?

Oh, and since this /is/ the recommendation thread, what are books that fall into the first category for you?
