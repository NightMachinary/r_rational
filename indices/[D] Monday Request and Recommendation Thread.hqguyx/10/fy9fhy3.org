I've recently found [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][Dark Skies]] to be extremely addicting and enjoyable.

The POV character figures out life and challenges from a near tabula rasa state. They are both very clever and also intentionally written as lacking in common sense, which I greatly enjoyed. It's a well written perspective which I found scratched my rationalist itches as the MC figures out the world around them.

The author is very good at what I view as a sort of slow burn intensity. Obstacles are set up for the MC and then you watch over an arc as they figure out the bits and pieces to required to meet the current challenge. YMMV if this is a pacing style you enjoy - it can get rather drawn out and intense. I found it very addicting.

I wouldn't quite say it meets the bar of being rational, but some of the elements are there. Going by the sidebar, there is definitely focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of knowledge and resources. Plenty of intellectual payoff so far too.

On the non-rational side, worldbuilding is hit and miss. A lot of thought goes into many pieces of it, but at the same time some others feel like they were initially tacked on for the convenience of the current plot with acceptable but not great explanations later (one example: a species of small animals that can climb trees for a clear and pronounced benefit, but don't 'because they are too stupid to realize this'). The same is true for apparent goals and motives. Sometimes side character actions seem a little plot motivated, although mostly the motivations are well fleshed out.

Overall, I'd still recommend the fiction as a highly enjoyable read - especially for those that enjoy rationalist characters - although it falls somewhat short of the bar to be fully considered rational.
