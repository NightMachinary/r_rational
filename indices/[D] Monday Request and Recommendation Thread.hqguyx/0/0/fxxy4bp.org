  I didn't care much for the movie Arrival, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the original short story ("Story of Your Life") was much more focused and soulful.

I would like Arrival so much more if it didn't completely conclude on literally the antithesis of Story of Your Life. I read the book before watching the film and as it progressed I was getting more and more confused.

The book concludes that there is no such thing as free will. This is emphasised because the daughter's death in the book is a random event that could easily be stopped not some genetic disease. In the movie they say free will exists but having nice memories with a daughter is worth the pain and emphasises her choice to have a kid.
