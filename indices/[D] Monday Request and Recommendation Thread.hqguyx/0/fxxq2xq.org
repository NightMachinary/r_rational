his name comes up often enough on this sub, but I recently blew through all of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Chiang][Ted Chiang]]'s short stories for the first time and wanted to renew the recommendation for people who haven't seen them yet. I didn't care much for the movie /Arrival/, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the original short story ("Story of Your Life") was much more focused and soulful. His stories posit fantastical premises and follow them through to their logical conclusions, but more than that, they are constructed in ways that meld together seemingly-disparate themes and ideas in astonishing ways. All of his major works are collected across two books - /Stories of Your Life and Others/ (republished just as /Arrival/) and /Exhalation: Stories/ - but you can track most/all of them down with a quick Google. I don't think any of his stories are bad, but many are fairly insubstantial; of his longer stuff I most enjoyed:

- "The Lifecycle of Software Objects" - parenting and learning are big themes in Chiang's work (see also "Exhalation", "Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny", "Understand"), but this story might do the best job of exploring them? Also interesting discussion of AI and software development, but there's loads more going on here besides
- "Hell is the Absence of God" - a modern-day horror retelling of the Book of Job. Lots of Chiang's stuff kinda reminds me of /Unsong/ - see also "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate" and "Tower of Babylon"
