By and large nearly all the ones I'm aware of are HFY-style awesome-things-we-take-for-granted porn - fun, but not exactly [[/r/rational][r/rational]] material (if you want some of those, I can certainly make a list :) ). I love that kind of setting almost as much as time travel though (and there is some overlap), so gonna +1 the heck out of the question in the hope others know things I've not encountered.

Charles Stross plays in this space quite a bit, and has the least frivolous takes I can think of, though this is not a strong statement. The Family Trade series has quite a few characters going both ways between medieval/fantasy and modern worlds. The Nightmare Stacks, from his Laundry series, has a POV fantasy character cross over to modern Britain, and follows that up with a full scale invasion - you don't need to have read the previous books in the series to enjoy this one.

The Strugatsky brothers have some uniquely depressing takes adjacent to this; [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_from_Hell][The Kid from Hell]] is probably the closest.

EDIT: Neal Stephenson's The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O also has some of this.
