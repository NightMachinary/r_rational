Book 16 of the Dresden Files series drops tomorrow, so now's as good a time as any to recommend the series. It's about a private detective who is a wizard. I recommend the series for its very large and enjoyable world and the wide breadth of characters, both of which seem to grow with every book. You have interesting fairies (who love making deals), several flavours of vampires, fallen angels, vague Lovecraftian threats slowly coming nearer, vanilla mortal gangsters, wizard politics, holy knights, and all kinds of other fun stuff. Most religions are true to some degree, as well. Not rational/ist/, but most of the time the characters actively and intelligently pursue their goals, and there are some clever plots and traps throughout.

Downsides: Some readers think the main character is sexist because he doesn't like hurting women and doesn't expect them to betray him or beat him in a fair fight, but I do feel the need to point out that this is a character flaw that actively hurts him again and again, and he gradually learns not to make those mistakes. Also it was the author's first book series, so the first two books are significantly less enjoyable than the rest, but you can easily start with book 3 for vampires or book 4 for fairy politics and not miss much (The author made an effort to make them good entry points)... Or you can power through the first two books if you want. They aren't /bad/, they just aren't great like what comes after.

The audiobooks are fantastic, as well. Narrated by James Marsters, who played Spike in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
