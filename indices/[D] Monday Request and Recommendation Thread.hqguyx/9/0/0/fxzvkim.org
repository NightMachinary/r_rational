I thought it was rational because the spellmaking technology is suppressed due to an actual reason instead of just being arbitrary or because the protagonist was some sort of magical genius (The efficient light creation meta-spell is an antimeme because it potentially creates a false vacuum collapse that hasn't been seen yet b/c of the anthropic principle). The magic system does operate under an IP system which makes sense given the rules described, gives special keys to spells to access them, has an entity with all the spells to enforce the compact, and takes steps to catch people who have found the potential antimeme through monopolistic contracts to report new sellers. Animals and plants naturally evolve and cast spells but end up bottlenecked by the non-scalar law so are limited to local areas. People get around the non-scalar law with the communication trick measuring intensity changes in a spell. The villain is moustache twirlingly evil but gets rid of enemies because he doesn't want to teach dozens of new archmages who will then break his monopoly on the technology he makes all his money from after a leak of half of the secret meta-spell online makes it obvious to anyone. It definitely isn't on the level of HPMOR or Ra but attempts to take itself seriously as a system and doesn't throw out its own rules for inconsistent reasons.
