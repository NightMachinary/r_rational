Probably the easiest would be something that triggers when a circuit is broken- Nickels conduct electricity, so you could put it in a simple circuit.

Of course, you've just made it so you don't need a remote trigger for your device- Only useful if you need to make a fake remote to be taken before triggering the device with a nickel return.
