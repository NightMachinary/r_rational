Everyone's already going for high-concept stuff. Lemme try a few simple things.

- You can cheat vending machines and money-changer machines with it. Can't do it too much or else you get caught, but I imagine you might be able to make/save a few extra hundred dollars a year. Maybe more if you find a good place without surveillance.

- You can go to the James Randi foundation and use it to win the million dollar prize.

- If you press your palm flat against something, and then return the nickel to your palm, it should end up meshed in whatever you're touching. You could then rapidly teleport it over and over again, disrupting the chemical structure of whatever you're touching as the coin repeatedly tries to undo the changes to its structure. Probably a potent tool, that. Could drill through just about anything, given enough time. Not to mention the interesting potential for chemical reactions, depending on the structure it ends up forming.
