Depending on how it works I might be able to get mild time travel. It depends on what happens from the perspective of someone standing next to the coin.

For the sake of convenience in this example I'm the other guy and my friend has the coin. Bob summons coin if and only if the bad guys are attacking. Let's see if I understand lorentz transformations correctly. I'm moving rapidly away from Bob near the speed of light. Or maybe towards. I'm tired. I observe the coin disappear. If the coin disappears Bob-simultaneously with its reappearance then its reappearance should be in my future. I now know that the bad guys are attacking. Fiddle with the parameters enough and I can probably get a temporal paradox but it takes time to reload. Depending on the paradox resolution method that could be powerful. Best-case scenario, if I have a policy of causing a paradox unless x happens, x will always happen.

One coin won't make a big difference, but put coin in cold environment, teleport coin to self raising its temperature: free energy. Stand in high place. Drop coin. Summon coin. Free kinetic energy. Allow coin to get hot. Summon coin lowering its temperature. Reduce entropy.

I could do a hell of a magician act. I could probably make real money that way.

Would work on vending machines.

It's too small to use as an effective throwing weapon.

I can technically never go broke ignoring debt.
