The coin returns to rest relative to your palm- If the coin is sitting on the ground and you're on a plane, the coin appears moving a 500 mph (Relative to Earth) and at rest (To you)

If you're swinging your arm around, the coin appears on your palm at that same velocity as your palm is going- That is, it's at rest relative to your palm, but moving in relation to, say, your stomach.

The atoms you exchanged for the nickel are given the coin's velocity (NOT its momentum) at the time it was exchanged. That means if the coin was on a rocket a .2 c (Bringing up its own problems, but look past them for a moment) and you summon it, the coin appears at rest in your palm, and the water appears in rocket, going at .2 c along with the rest of the ship.
