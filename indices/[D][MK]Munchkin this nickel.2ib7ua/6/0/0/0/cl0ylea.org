Look at the middle of your palm. That is where the coin appears.

Imagine a point about half a hand depth down from the middle of your hand; That is, its halfway between the front and back of your hands. That is the center of your hand. The coin always appears half a hand depth palm ways ("up") from the center of your palm, even if the center doesn't touch your actual hand.
