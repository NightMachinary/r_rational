Ok so the nickel returns to just above your palm whereas anything that was above your palm is teleported to where the nickel was. Essentially you can teleport anything you want into the space where the nickel was. It sounds like any fluid my cupped hand was holding, whether it be air, mercury, sulfuric acid, or (not a fluid) vacuum, would be sent off to where the nickel was. I'm not sure how I'd stick my hand in a vacuum yet but I'll revisit that later.

Now, the first thing I'd want to do is be able to put that nickel anywhere I wanted it quickly, so creating some kind of railgun type launcher that I could hold in my left hand would be needed. Now we could go one of two ways, which I will need a question answered. Either I replace the nickel mid-flight, or I replace the nickel after it has struck its target.

My first question would be: does all momentum on both nickel-sized collections of atoms cease upon the command? If I commanded the nickel to return in mid-flight while holding my right hand in a bowl of water, would the water be moving with the same velocity? Same momentum? Or zero velocity relative to my palm?
