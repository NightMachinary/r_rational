I think they did some studies like idea number 2 with radioactive substances some time in the last century.

Though now that I think about it, the discovery of those studies was that 95% of the atoms in your body change by the year...

Which means that the atoms making up "Your Hand" ought to be spreading out so much that they ruin the ability...

I'm gonna cheat here and say "Your Palm" becomes defined as the object which you define mentally as "Your Palm" to get around the Ship-Of-Theseus problem. And it's what you /actually believe/ is your palm, not just you declaring that that piece of sheet metal is "your palm".

...Annnnnnnnnnnd I've gone off track. Back to your third idea: The coin exchanges whatever was where it was at with itself at wherever it was, so the wall will still keep. Of course, you've now got a wall full of nickel-sized slices of material unconnected to the area around them, so a good hit should fully dislodge the wall. Or you could move the hands a bit off center between each jump so the coin reappears in the air and then exchanges itself for more wall material, which is deposited on the floor.
