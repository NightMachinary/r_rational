I figured that a study like that would have been done. I'm not sure if there's enough of a difference between nickel and the elements they used to gain any new information from it.

  I'm gonna cheat here and say "Your Palm" becomes defined as the object which you define mentally as "Your Palm" to get around the Ship-Of-Theseus problem. And it's what you actually believe is your palm, not just you declaring that that piece of sheet metal is "your palm".

So If I define my palm as "my palm," and then cut it in half, do I now choose which of the halves is now "my palm"? What about my belief that "my palm" is in two pieces? I ask because the implications are fun. If I can change "my palm" between parts of whats was actually at one point my palm (to help with the actual belief part), you've got a network there. If you have to pick one half of the palm to become "my palm," does that mean if you subdivide further, you have to reassign, and on and on? Because eventually, you will get to a point where you have designated a single atom as "my palm." (At the cost of destroying the rest of your hand, but this is all theorycraft anyhow) And then by issuing a return command, you would be able to fix its position by returning the nickel to the center of that atom /by definition./ I'm not sure what Heisenburg would do about that.

My third point was supposed to imply the center point was moving slightly between return commands to burrow through the wall. My fault for lack of clarity on that one.
