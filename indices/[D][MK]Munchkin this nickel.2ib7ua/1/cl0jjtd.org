Dissolve it. Nickels are 75% copper and 25% nickel; they should dissolve in sulfuric acid, though I've never tried the experiment.

This will produce a solution of SO4^{2-} sulfate ions (how do you write that when Reddit doesn't do subscripts), and a mixture of Ni^{2+} and Cu^{2+} ions. The dissolution will also release a cloud of hydrogen gas.

I'm not really sure how the recall power will deal with the nickel being disassembled like that. I'm hoping for a lightning bolt, or maybe an explosion. Intuition says that I'd recall the exact particles that the nickel was originally made of, but electrons don't work like that. They're not tracked individually, two indistinguishable particles really are indistinguishable at the most fundamental level we know of. I could probably break quantum physics with this nickel, but I don't know enough to say how. (Also, experiment with FTL messaging, that's also potentially powerful.)

For an accidental version of the same phenomenon, allow the nickel to rust before recalling it.
