Oh, and test for speed-of-light delay. Make a friend in New Zealand (roughly on the other side of the world from me). Synchronise our clocks and use high-speed cameras to monitor the coin. In theory, there should be a 0.04 second delay between the coin disappearing on his end and reappearing on my end. If the delay is less, I may have proven the existence of FTL communication, and further tests are warranted.
