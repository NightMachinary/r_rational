You could use as reaction mass to drive a spacecraft, just need some sort of railgun to repeatedly shoot it out he back of your ship. It's not very good for FTL signaling since it only works once. You could attach it to a sensor and use it to telepathically trigger some machine, maybe as an emergency signal. Randi's prize is probably the best option.
