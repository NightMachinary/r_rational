A modern nickel is 75% copper, 25% actual nickel, weighs 5g, has a value of $0.05, is 1.95 mm thick and 21.21mm in diameter, per [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_%28United_States_coin%29][wiki]].

Of these properties, the most straightforward to begin to abuse is its mass: drop it down a vacuum tube of arbitrary length, convert potential energy into kinetic and then into heat at the bottom, return to top where your palm is facing down for it to drop again. Breaking conservation of energy in this way is convenient, but not exactly groundbreaking.

Perhaps more powerful is its property to be transmuted in form and then reassume its original shape at a new location. You could, for example, melt it down, grind it up, distribute it in a food supply, then hold that population hostage to having the copper in their body forcibly ripped at high speed from their body.

Make a copper/nickel bullet that leaves no trace?

Abuse the ability to make it resume tails down to convince people you can control fate, start a cult following?
