With the scraping method described, what happens if you move your hand less than a nickel's width? The material replaced by part of the nickel on the second cut would have to end up in the same location as the other side of the nickel, unless the magic was smart enough to turn the crescent around to fit in the hollow of the first cut. (If the magic's not smart enough, and if it prioritizes the 'unharmed form' of the nickel high enough, the ability to straight-up destroy matter sounds pretty exploitable)
