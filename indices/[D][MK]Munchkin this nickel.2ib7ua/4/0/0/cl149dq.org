The nickel always appears heads up, with the crest of the head aligned with towards your middle finger. That is prioritized by the magic.

Therefore, the nickel will appear in the second cut, with the new wood filling in the space of the old and another part of the nickel filling in the overlap. Since the amount of nickel /not/ in the overlap is exactly the amount needed to fill in where the nickel was, there's no wood lost.
