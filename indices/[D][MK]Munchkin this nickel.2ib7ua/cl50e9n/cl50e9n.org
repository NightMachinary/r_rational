Well...

*/You could use it to stop a nuclear reactor in meltdown : */

Reactor enters meltdown mode where the rods are overheating. A device is present that will quickly inject the nickel into the cooling water, preferably somewhere very very hot. Once in there, nickel 'instantly' absorbs heat. You summon the nickel back, which makes it arrive in your hand, at 20 degrees celcius, tails down. Your hand is on top of the nickel-injector, and the process repeats (thousands of times if necessary) until the reactor temp is low again.

*You could use it to propel a spaceship :*

Youre on a small spaceship with a bottle of LOX pointed out the back. LOX expands rapidly when heated, and is kept at extremely low temps. You insert the nickel into a slot, and the nickel enters the LOX bottle. Since the temp diff between the nickel and LOX is so high, some of the LOX boils off, creating pressure, which causes some of it to be pushed out the nozzle, at which point you have Newtons Lawed your spaceship forward. You then return the nickel to your hand, at 20 degrees and tails down, and repeat the process.

*You could disprove every theoretical physicist :*

You let the guys at CERN turn some atoms from your nickel into a teeny, tiny black hole. You then get those atoms back out of the black hole.

*You could cause huge bubbles in the ocean :*

You go on a cruise, and drop the nickel into a deep spot of the ocean. You wait for it to sink to a good depth. You then call it back. You just created a pressure drop that, if its replaced with the air that was just above your palm a second ago, makes a nickel sized bubble at whatever depth it was at. Since bubbles rise, and rising bubbles get bigger, 30 minutes later your ship gets capsized by a ginormous bubble. (someone do the math and tell us how big a bubble would be if one were formed near the bottom of the ocean) (This is assuming the pressure dosent just dissolve your bubble, Im not up to speed on the physics of gasses under pressure) (unless its taco night)

*You could validate satellite / spacecraft clocks timing to a very high degree.*

*You could punch someone /slightly/ harder than usual.*

*You could make a metal detector detect your 'empty' hand.*

*You could start a scam where you say 'you give 4 cents, and Ill give you a nickel' and make sweet, sweet pennies all day long on a street corner in NYC.*

Really theres not much you COULDNT do.....
