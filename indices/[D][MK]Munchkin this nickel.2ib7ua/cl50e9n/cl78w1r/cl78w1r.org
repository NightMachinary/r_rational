I think the bubble would collapse under the pressure.

When a bubble is injected at the bottom of a tank, the air of the bubble is already at the pressure of the bottom of the tank, so as it rises, it's losing pressure but amount of gas molecules is the same, so it expands.

When you teleport a nickel-volume of sea-level air down, you've increased the pressure but not the number of molecules, so it will collapse, possibly dissolving entirely.
