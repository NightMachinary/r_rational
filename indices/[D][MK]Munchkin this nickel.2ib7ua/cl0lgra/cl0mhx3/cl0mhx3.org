The big problem is that the effect isn't really large enough. With a heat engine in your hand, you're generating power, but you're not generating /enough/ of it to really make a difference. It's got to be something like making pennies per hour - probably even less. It's the same issue with using the nickel to generate power by dropping it over and over - while you're getting out more than you put in, you're not getting enough out of it to really make it worthwhile.
