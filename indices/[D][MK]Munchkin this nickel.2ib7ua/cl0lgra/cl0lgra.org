The return to 20c is abusable.

Have your hand surgically removed, place it with the coin in a specialised heat engine and spam the return command to generate electricity. Use this to generate actual power, or build a commercial empire around it to gain political power.

You could also abuse it to shed momentum for space travel, e.g. sever hand, attach to flywheel, get it moving arbitrarily fast with conventional power and them spam return for a zero-cost constant acceleration fuelless engine. Timing might be a problem, but you'd have to eperiment with that.

There are questions about what happens if the atoms of the coin no longer exist, eg if they're combined with antimatter. Also what happens if your palm is atomised over a wide area, does each surface atom of the palm get a corresponding coin atom, or is there a central atom? Also what happens to matter occupying the space when the coin teleports in? If its destroyed, then it could be used to cut hard materials.
