  There are questions about what happens if the atoms of the coin no longer exist, eg if they're combined with antimatter.
#+end_quote

If an atom of the nickel is made permanently destroyed, such that the components of the nuclei are made unfindable or destroyed, then a new atom is created or teleported in, similarly to the electrons from above.

  Also what happens if your palm is atomised over a wide area, does each surface atom of the palm get a corresponding coin atom, or is there a central atom?
#+end_quote

The nickel appears a little over a half a hand-depth over the center of your palm is, or the center of the components of your palm, if your palm happens to be over a large or oddly shaped area.

  Also what happens to matter occupying the space when the coin teleports in? If its destroyed, then it could be used to cut hard materials.
#+end_quote

The atoms of air where above your palm are exchanged for the atoms of the nickel, unless your hand is closed, or a vacuum, in which case very small pockets of vacuum are placed where the nickel atoms were.
