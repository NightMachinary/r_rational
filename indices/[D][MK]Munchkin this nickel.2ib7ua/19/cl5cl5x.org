I can gain mass as I slowly steal things from vending machines in my free time.

I can buy a ton of scratch off lotto tickets at the grocery vending machine- really slowly

I could win a lot of bets...

I would always have a viable guitar pick handy

I could destroy coin-star, 5 cents at a time.

I could set up some really nasty trigger mechanisms and snares. Really nasty- no true trigger required.

Playing catch would be easier, and probably rather entertaining for people to watch.

Save 5 cents on everything I buy for the rest of my life- it might add up over time
