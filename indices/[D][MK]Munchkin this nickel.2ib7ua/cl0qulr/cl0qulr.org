I think that the teleportation out of your palm is much more useful than bringing the nickel back to you.

A micro SD card is smaller than a nickel, so I could use it as better communication than other people have proposed by replacing the nickel with 64GB of data at the far end. This can be done with anything small or delicate as well. You can mail the nickel to another lab (without any special precautions) and swap it out for some cryogenically preserved biological samples once they're ready.

With constant/rapid commands, you might be able to scrape away material from any surface. Press you palm against a wall and summon the nickel. There will then be a nickel shaped hole in the wall, filled with the nickel. Next move your palm over a bit, and repeat. The first hole will still exist, but it will be filled with a nickel-shaped plug of material which can be easily removed. Repeat as often as you want for more holes.

IIRC, Gorilla glass works by swapping out sodium atoms for potassium in some complicated process, increasing strength. Find a process that can use this technique with nickel and/or copper, melt the nickel down, refine it etc, put a bit of the other metal (gold? palladium?) in your palm, then recall the nickel to swap out the atoms.
