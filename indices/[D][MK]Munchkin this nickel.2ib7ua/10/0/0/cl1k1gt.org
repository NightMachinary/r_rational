So... the most horrifyingly slow murder weapon? Throw coin, put hand to - let's say - victim's face/throat/skull, recall, repeat, rinse? Obviously could be a trivially stupid source of infinite kinetic energy/work/(entropy reversal), possibly something about clever use for electrolysis? That last usage could literally explode, unfortunately. It isn't clear what happens if the nickel is powdered/dissolved/annihilated, what with atoms not being labelled billiard balls and all.
