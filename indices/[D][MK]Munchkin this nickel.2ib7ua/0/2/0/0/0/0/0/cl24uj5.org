-shrug- Then you'll just have to be very careful, and only do it in emergencies or under observation from a materials scientist/metallurgist who knows what they're doing.

Honestly there aren't /too/ many cases where a rational person needs to telefrag something. It's more a neat party trick than anything actually useful. The Randi prize is probably the best tradeoff of useful and realistic (Even if you prove it without a doubt to be real, I doubt you'll convince any government to build and launch you a railgun ship so you could use the nickel as a reactionless drive)
