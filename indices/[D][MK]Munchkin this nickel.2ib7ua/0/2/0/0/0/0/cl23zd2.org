I'd expect the coin to appear within the glove in such a case. Or maybe even make a hole in the glove if it is very tight. If it were any different you could build whole devices that are technically a "glove" and teleport your coin there as long as your hand is in the provided opening. No reason to think that tele-coin physics would work like this.
