So, I don't know whether this is deliberate, but there is literally no such thing as simultaneous events in relativity. What is simultaneous for you is not simultaneous for someone moving at high speed relative to you. So I'll assume that "the return is instantaneous" is from your POV. You could use this to make a time machine, but to send one bit to the past you'd need to do a relativistic flyby of the Earth so not very practical.

Using the 20 degrees you could heat or cool something to 20 degrees. Or rather you now have a theoretically perfect heat bath. Stave off the heat death of the universe, destroy some entropy!

You could create a reactionless drive by firing out the coin and resummoning it. This could help you with the time machine above. A rail gun could fire the coin quite fast at the cost of excess heat, but we do have an infinite heat reservoir.

Also, what happens to things in the way when it returns? Do the just disappear? What happens when you melt a normal coin and your coin together and then summon your coin back? You'd be left with a piece of metal with 50% vacancy spread evenly, I suspect that this would be like nanoporous carbon except with metal and be quite good at storing gasses. Though it may be better to mix it with something already used like metal hydrides.
