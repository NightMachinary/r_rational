Entirely practical. What's the point of FTL magic coin if you can't violate causality?

What sort of heat bath would you make? You'd be losing useful energy whenever the coin was summoned back at a temperature > 20 degrees.

All atoms of the coin return when summoned; Anything the atoms were part of are filled with either air from where the coin now is, or vacuum if your hand was closed/in space.
