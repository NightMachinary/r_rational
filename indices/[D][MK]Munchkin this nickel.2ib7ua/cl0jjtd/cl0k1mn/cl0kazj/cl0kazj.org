Well... then I think I could use this to disassociate water into hydrogen and oxygen, providing free energy. A slightly more efficient way of energy generation than dropping the nickel down a hole and re-summoning it, but still not brilliant.

Still, that's the best I can think of at the moment. Stealing money 5c at a time isn't very profitable. The coin isn't very useful as a tool, even accounting for the fact that I can access it after being thoroughly strip-searched (there's no time in my life where that would have been remotely useful).

I assume it's cheating to show the coin to the James Randi foundation and the Nobel Committee, and just collect a huge amount of prize money. It's probably what I'd do for real though.
