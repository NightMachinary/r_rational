If you melt down the nickel, use the result to create a hollow shell, then fill the shell with whatever substance you want, you can use it as an untraceable delivery for said substance. Probably nerve gas, if we're talking weapons. Or just use it as a stopper, for a larger quantity in a container. Or brown recluse spiders, if you want something exotic.

Another idea is to give a solution of the nickel to somebody, then see how it affects the body when removed. Repeated enough times could give a map as to how the body absorbs certain substances (Possible medical uses? I'm not certain there would be any benefit to this. Besides torture, since I can't see this being easy on the body. Actually, by varying the times you issue the return call, you can probably chart out the optimal times to return to get certain responses)

I can see the FTL signalling having some use as a single-shot undetectable communication for coordinating two groups without any visible interaction. Nickel disappearing is the go signal, and nothing was sent, so nothing can be intercepted. This would gain more usefulness in higher surveillance areas.

  The nickel appears a little over a half a hand-depth over the center of your palm is, or the center of the components of your palm, if your palm happens to be over a large or oddly shaped area. (quoted text from an earlier comment by OP)

Definitely abusable. If you split your hand in two, and pull the two halves apart, the way I read this is that it would return instantly to the point halfway between. So it can be teleported into walls, and by spamming the return command, you could keep replacing nickel sized holes in the wall, until your through. So a perfect wall breaker if you can manage to get to any two equidistant points from that wall.
