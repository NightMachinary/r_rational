This is something that I have been thinking about for a few weeks now. I'm going on a bit of a tangent unrelated to your last paragraph, so sorry for the rambling but I kinda want to write this somewhere before losing it, at least it's on topic.

The difference between writing a book or a short story and writing a serial or for a magazine seems to be rarely acknowledged, even in fanfiction where the difference between authors who post 14k words chapters every few months and authors who post 3-4k words every week is so common and pronounced.

One could argue that writing is writing, and that as long as your work reaches completion that is all that matters. But as a writer the feedback and reviews that you get from a book, a monthly 14k word online chapter or a weekly 4k one is vastly different from each other, e.g. readers of a serialized work are biased towards short term goals and instant gratification because their response is an immediate one due to them not being able to look at the work as a whole until it is complete.^{^{1}} Meanwhile books tend to get a lot more leeway when it comes to slow build ups, slower pace, and a focus on the world itself rather than the plot/characters not only because of the expectations (easier to immerse yourself in a complete work, specially one that has been 'vouched for' instead of just being merely posted online by someone you know nothing about)^{^{2}} but because they simply can afford to 'bore' some of their readers since they can either skim/skip ahead or know that the action or development is readily available in the next chapter. Also, because of the sunk-cost fallacy reader retention isn't as much of a problem as it is with serials or fanfiction.

  Another interesting point in the discussion of pros and cons of serialized writing: that style of writing which best engages an audience when the chapters are coming out every n days isn't that which works best as a complete, collected work.

You're absolutely right about this, although it's not only about engaging the audience necessarily but also retaining it: keeping your readers invested, having them tune in next week, buying the next issue, etc.^{^{3}}

The golden path for writing a serialized work, the one that seeks to satisfy the most people (at, sometimes, the expense of the story's message, creativity, or the writer's wishes) is one where progress is being constantly made, one where you're not allowed to stagnate for too long, and one where regress is nearly forbidden and at best should be left only for the very end of the story. This doesn't mean that the protagonist has to win every fight and never lose, victories and defeats are only tools in your writing toolkit, no, what it means is that the story must always be rising, always moving forwards to a destination. The protagonist winning a fight, overcoming a fear, leveling up/gaining a skill/learning a trick, the relationship between characters growing, the antagonist becoming powerful or gaining allies, the world changing or reacting to changes being made, etc. The important thing is that the chapter ends in a positive note and if possible wanting more, win and lose, good and evil, protagonist and antagonist, those are conditionals, what matters most is escalation.

So, in contrast to all that, in a serialized work, it's important that you don't reset the progress that has been made, you can certainly play with the idea but you must always bring 'more' than what you had before. Your reader knows that the protagonist will go back to using their powers, your reader knows that these two characters who just had a falling out will get back together/resolve their differences, etc. what the reader wants to know is what all of that is leading to, they want the positive that comes from this negative (that they know isn't a real negative). The problem with negatives and with resets of progress is that they make the reader think you just wasted their time, and that's an easy way of losing them, hell even just the feeling that you went back to zero or that you have to start over is enough to sour them or keep them away for good.

This isn't as much of a problem for a book, nor is it if you don't care about maximizing your number of readers or are more focused on writing the story you want to write*. People who read books or binge long or complete works tend to have a higher tolerance towards negatives, glacial pace, minutiae, excessive world building and even character deaths. They notice the themes, metaphors, symbolism, parallels, and consistency much better than they would in a work that they have to read week to week, so they can handle something like the death of a main character because they can appreciate the aspect of the book that it is trying to reinforce (injustice, a cruel world, sacrifice, patriotism, etc).

I'm running out of steam on this idea, but I'll end it with this sorta obligatory disclaimer: none of this is absolute, merely the stuff that I have either noticed or knowledge from other writers I have shamelessly integrated. What I want to point out is that the way in which you distribute your work can influence the reader as much as the work itself does, and that what works for one approach usually isn't the best for another, so the best thing a writer can do is find the format the better suits their needs. Even so, all of this is a guideline at best, just like most writing advice is, because the more skilled and the more experienced you are as a writer the more you can get away with things that others wouldn't be able to.

 

1 - Also because of how fanfics and serials are structured (or the culture surrounding them?) feedback and reviews seem to dry out as soon as the work is completed or considered done. There will be reviews and some discussion, but it doesn't compare to what books get or even to what the work itself was getting during its run. I guess that could be considered the trade-off of having a 'live audience' willing to help you steer your work and improve while you're writing it.

2 - Not my intention to come off as a book supremacist here, but I think it's important to acknowledge the cred that comes with having a physical release and living from your writing as a professional. Not to dis little xXBilly_98Xx and his fanfic hosted in wattpad but ya know, he aint writing no Lord of the Rings and it's a bit unfair to expect that of him.

3 - I know this is a bit of cherry picking on my part and might even be slightly contradictory to the argument that follows, but keeping the reader engaged and keeping the reader reading aren't mutually exclusive. You can have chapters that are not engaging yet keep the ball rolling, what matters there is the context (the genre, whether you're building up to something, etc) and even technical writing skill (a beautiful prose makes reading even paragraphs full of nothing a pleasure to read). Of course, if you don't care about retaining readers and only care about engaging the audience then none of that matters, so long as what you write is interesting enough (or is a novel concept) you should be covered.
