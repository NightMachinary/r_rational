Something interesting about delve is that I've found that its pacing works a lot better as a finished work than as a weekly serial. There's one contingent of people who complain about the story not going fast enough/the main character not gaining power fast enough (uncharitably described as 'the numbers don't go up fast enough'), but I think a lot of that is that the chapters release at a snail-like once-per-week pace. In terms of action per word, I think it isn't really that slow.

Another interesting point in the discussion of pros and cons of serialized writing: that style of writing which best engages an audience when the chapters are coming out every n days isn't that which works best as a complete, collected work.

This suggests that a work must either be suffer in popularity while being written, or suffer in quality in the long run as a finished product. Maybe there's a way to write so that re-writing/editing once the story is done is comparatively easy, but probably not.

Then again, it depends on the reading habits of those who read serial fiction. How many just read each chapter as it comes? How many leave off and come back after, say, 5 chapters have accumulated? How many binge-read a story up until the latest chapter, then forget about it for a few years, then find it again and read it all?

I wonder how you would try and figure that out. I'm sure google/big web data could. Maybe they have...
