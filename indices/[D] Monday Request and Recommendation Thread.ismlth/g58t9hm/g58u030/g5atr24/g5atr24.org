I'm going to throw a rec out there for Ar'Kendrithyst to counter your derec.

I will concede that the MC isn't anywhere near rational nor are his actions even always intelligent which is obviously a deal breaker for many in the rational community. To me however that feels balanced out by the world itself being rational.

There is no low-hanging fruit to exploit that aren't already exploited. Basic knowledge is shared and people that want to be adventurers are educated instead of everyone in the world deciding to keep basic things secret for pretty much no reason. The leaders in the world participate in real-politik and act rationally to the best of their ability, which of course includes the gods themselves.

The big contrast to me is Delve, where the MC is largley rational (aside from him deciding on a build without doing any research first), but the world is very much not and low hanging fruit are everywhere for people to exploit but rarely are with the most obvious example being basically everything that makes the MC OP being stuff that should have really been figured out a very long time ago.
