  I hope the erotica isn't intrinsically tied to the plot but as long as it reads well it should be fun.

It depends. The overall plot is very much not all-ages, and to an extent is a parody of other harem RPGs. That said, the most sexually explicit moments are entirely skippable, and iirc there isn't much in the way of explicit images.

Note that it's an RPG, not a litRPG. It's a traditional rpg along the lines of older Final Fantasy games, but very much worth giving a go, especially for quality of writing.
