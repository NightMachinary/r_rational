Try Castle Kingside on Royalroad. It's going on indefinite hiatus unfortunately, but it's really good for its 950ish page run.

Brockton's Celestial Forge has base building, but it's literal base building. It's a worm tinker fic, where the tinker gets new powers every n-thousand words. It's generally really good, probably one of the best tinker fics in the fandom.

Wake of the Ravager on Royalroad has base building, but it comes up much later in the series once Calvin takes care of the most pressing crises and gains enough power to have a solid base.

Savage Divinity has base building, but also much later, and not sure if it's worth it to read that far to get to the base building.

The Dao of Magic has base building (it's on royalroad). It doesn't start off that good but steadily keeps getting better. Gets to a solid point and then the latest arc slows everything down in a bad way.
