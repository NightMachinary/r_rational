You're welcome!

Close to your request, but I expect you've already read: [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake Of The Ravager]] (LitRPG, trashy adolescent power fantasy but very well-executed, main character lucks into overpowered abilities but proactively exploits them) and [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning][Mother Of Learning]] (wizard school time loop, slow build to being a better and more competent person, lots of planning).

Much further from your request, only fanfics I've ever intentionally re-read: I Just Love Killin' (as you saw), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter And The Natural 20]] (funny and well-written genre cross, lightest thing I've read where different characters use different epistemologies), and [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/loaf-worm-post-epilogue-humor-complete.467128/threadmarks][Loaf]] (the best and dumbest Worm fanfic).

Every good rec list needs something really far out there: Ever watch competitive Starcraft: Brood War? It's a game where two players try to execute complex, contradictory plans in an environment actively hostile to any sense of organization. Day9's [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgmCLtUkEutKY8IlwyVCUFoRtgQe3LCf1][Let's Learn Starcraft]] series is a good in depth intro to the game. The game's [[http://satirist.org/ai/starcraft/blog/][AI scene]] is also an interesting (and active) take on it. (The sequel is also a good game, but it's much more about reacting and predicting, compared to the original's disorganization and positioning.)
