HTADADB has a really strong early game, just for how shitty the world feels. I thought the protagonist was funny and absurdly amoral. His periodic inner dialog expounding on how he wasn't misogynistic felt like an exceedingly specific denial, and was kind of offputting. Maybe that was the point? I'm not sure. In any case, I'd recommend it to anyone in the mood for semi-gritty absurdity and entertainment.

My enjoyment of the series peaked hit a zenith at the end of the Nekromel arc (Book 5), the Reqbar was a decent return to form, and then my continued understanding of the plot became extremely melty from Gorgoth onwards.
