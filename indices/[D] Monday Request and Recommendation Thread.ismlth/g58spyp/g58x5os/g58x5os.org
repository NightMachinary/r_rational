- Migi from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasyte][/Parasyte/]] matches the request; the story's rational enough.

- the Symbiote from [[https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/about/][/Symbiote/]] is a fuzzy match for both parts of the request; the story itself is high quality and highly rational.

- the female protagonist from the /[[https://www.goodreads.com/series/179564-doc-future][Doc Future trilogy]]/ is somewhat of a match, since (IIRC) the Doc mentions several times how he had to often hold her back from trying to strongarm her way to world piece. She gets quite a lot of character development through the books, but I don't know what her personality looks like by the end of the story. This story's also HQ / HR.

- [[https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Spike][Spike]] from Buffy fits your description rather well, but the show itself isn't strictly rational (even if it is mostly rather interesting and well-written).

- Perhaps also Draco from HP:MoR? Not sure if it should be included.

--------------

- The protagonist of [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale][/The Iron Teeth/]] was matching the first half of your request, but I don't know if it takes the proper character development later on to match the second half as well (since I've only read the first several arcs of that story so far).

- [[https://hellsing.fandom.com/wiki/Alucard][Alukard]] also matches only the first half, and also isn't rational.
