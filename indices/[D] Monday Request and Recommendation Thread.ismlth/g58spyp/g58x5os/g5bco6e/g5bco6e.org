Gonna add in some more examples.

- Zombie Knight Saga has a character that is veritably psychopathic, but his upbringing influenced him enough to behave in a mostly ethical way (and this actually gets developed later on). Unfortunately, this happens much later in the story, like 2000 pages in.

- Wake of the Ravager has a protagonist like this. He grows up pretty sociopathic, but the combined efforts of his wives (yeah it's a harem story but it does it in a pretty funny way) and friends slowly develops him into a normal(ish) human being.
