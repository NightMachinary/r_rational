[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/kill-them-all-worm-gamer.830187/][Kill Them All]] (Worm Fanfic - 'The Gamer' Taylor + Planeswalking | Ongoing): The author (ShayneT) has a reputation for writing sociopathic and brutal Taylors. In this one he starts her off that way, but she becomes more moral over time.

Edit: Hmm. (2020-09-29). There has been some recent dubiously justified genocide. Still possibly a reasonable choice from a consequentialist perspective, but she failed to explore other options enough.
