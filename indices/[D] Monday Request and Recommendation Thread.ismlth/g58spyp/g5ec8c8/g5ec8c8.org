A Certain Magical Index had two great episodes (19 and 20) where Accelerator has a fit of kindness. I'm still watching the show so I don't know if he continues that way. Fair warning, the show is mostly harem garbage with an idiot protagonist, but sometimes it has flashes of genius, and thankfully, the protagonist is completely absent in these two episodes. If you skip the other episodes but want the context watch episodes 10-14 before. Its streaming free with ads on Crunchyroll, but make sure you pick the right (first) season.

Greed in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, though his arrival is late and as an sometimes-antagonist he isn't always around, though he's prominent. Also free on Crunchyroll. One of the most loved anime/manga.

I guess Batman vs. Superman counts. A cruel yet utterly inspired Batman faces a self-righteous yet noble Superman, while the struggle grows increasingly hollow in the face of the devil's faithful servant, Luthor. Get the ultimate cut if you watch it, the theatrical edits ruin it. This was one masterpiece that was thoroughly underrated. "Men are still good."
