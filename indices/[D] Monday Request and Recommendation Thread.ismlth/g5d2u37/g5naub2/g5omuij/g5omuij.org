I'm pretty sure it's blasphemy that you didn't like Deadhouse Gates. Though maybe we just have nearly-incompatible tastes, as you also liked Midnight Tides, which I disliked so much it made me drop the series for six years. I eventually picked it back up, but getting through MT was still a slog. It's integral to understanding the world of Malazan moving forward so you can't skip it, but it's easily the least interesting book in the series for me.
