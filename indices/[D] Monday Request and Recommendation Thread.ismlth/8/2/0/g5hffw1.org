Is it good?

I loved the story until the arc where Hachiman abandoned his ambitious plan to turn Orario around and decided to just go with the, "flow."

I felt like the story devolved into a basic harem comedy one that leaned too hard on the joke the Hachiman was extremely perceptive about everything except the fact that a bunch of women had feelings for him.
