[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12904733/1/Man-off-the-Moon][Man off the Moon]] has Nameless from the Fate franchise (it's basically archer from f/sn) get materialized in the mass effect world. What follows is lots of competence from him, a curbstomping of potential enemies, and some really good recurring jokes. It has some pitfalls due to archer's own character, but overall he's really competent. Take that as you will.

Inexorable Chaos on RR fits. The protagonist is kinda cartoonish though, and it's not that funny.

Reborn: Apocalypse is like death note xianxia, where a protagonist who went back in time does everything right. It starts off really good but the 3rd book was not that good, and the author has been on a hiatus for a while.
