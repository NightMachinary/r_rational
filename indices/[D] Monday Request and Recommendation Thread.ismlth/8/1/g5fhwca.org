[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/threadmarks][I Just Love Killin']]. Worm/Rick And Morty cross. If you're not familiar with R&M, looking up every scene with Krombopulos Michael is enough background info (he's a background character with around two minutes of screen time). Taylor gets her power replaced with having a cheerful alien assassin coach her. Competence porn as requested. On indefinite hiatus, but I don't think stopping off randomly hurts this one.
