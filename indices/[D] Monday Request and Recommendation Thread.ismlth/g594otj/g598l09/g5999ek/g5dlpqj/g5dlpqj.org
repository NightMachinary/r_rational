Regarding Savage Divinity I can recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/savage-khepri-post-gm-taylor-savage-divinity.803200/reader/][Savage Khepri]], a fanfiction that puts a post GM Taylor into the place of the original MC. It's a fun read, moreso than the original I'd say.

It's pretty damn slow to update, but at 100k words as of the time of this post I think it's worth a read.
