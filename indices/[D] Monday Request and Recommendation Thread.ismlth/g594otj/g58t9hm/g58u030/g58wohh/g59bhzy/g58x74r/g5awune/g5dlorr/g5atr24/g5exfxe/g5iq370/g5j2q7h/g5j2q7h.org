Yes but the romans had ok math, trigonometry, geometry etc. The people in Delve as they are portrayed don't, basic subtraction is already at their limit. It's flawed worldbuilding, the level of math they portray and the architecture they have are quite mismatched.

Stavo shouldn't have a 5 story tower, multistory buildings shouldn't be a thing. What would fit architecture wise with their math knowledge would be stick and mud huts similar to the ones most europeans lived in 2500 to 1500 years ago depending on the area.
