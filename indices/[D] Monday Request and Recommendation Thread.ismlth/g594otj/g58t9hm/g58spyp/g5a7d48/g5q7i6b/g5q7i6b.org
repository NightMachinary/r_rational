I've been planning to make a larger post about this in next week's thread, but if you're at all interested in an RPG, [[https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/][The Last Sovereign]] handles this about as well as I've ever seen an RPG do it. Now, it needs to be warned that it's an unapologetically adult game, and a harem at that, but it you can look past that it's one of the most rational RPGs I've played.

The premise is that a perverted and incompetent, but frighteningly powerful overlord has invaded the continent and is slowly conquering his way through it. You play as a middle aged widower who has been escorting a succession of arrogant "chosen ones". After yet another failure, it turns out that he has been infected by the same power as the "Incubus King" that has been plaguing the land. After some deliberation, he resolves to use this power to stand against the invader.

Where the kingdom building comes in is that he takes a very rational look at gaining power. Knowing from experience that raw power requires economic and logistic support to accomplish anything, he begins building up an economic base starting with private investment, but soon resulting in taking control of a wartorn kingdom. This leads to a very well done mix of investment, economic and social development, and military preparedness, with a ton of interesting "guns vs butter" decisions that change how future events play out.

The game does an absolutely wonderful job balancing traditional RPG mechanics with kingdom development. Frequently the game's events swap between traditional "dungeon" segments, freeform investment/building rounds, and special events that can be anywhere from full fledged wars to tense religious summits whose resolution depends on what decisions you've made so far.

I know that some people can't look past the lewd nature of the game, but for those who can I'd seriously consider it one of the most rational RPGs I've ever come across.

Very strongly recommended.
