I think op!Hachiman said at one point that he knew they had feelings for him, but he didn't want to accept it. It makes sense for his character because a) he goes to great lengths to find rationalisations for doing what he was already doing (to great comedic effect) and b) he doesn't want to form close bonds to people, because he doesn't want hurt them when he reaches lvl 100 of the dungeon and leaves.

I wouldn't say it's a basic harem comedy, given that I like this one, and I don't typically like harems. Note as well, that hachiman most certainly doesn't want a harem.
