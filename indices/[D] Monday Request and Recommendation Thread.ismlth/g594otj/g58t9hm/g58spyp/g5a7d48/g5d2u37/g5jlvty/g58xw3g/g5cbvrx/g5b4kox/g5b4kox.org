I'm looking for more *competence porn*! Stories where the MC just does everything right. No keeping secrets which come back to bite them, no contrived win-only-by-luck situations, and no dark setting, I want to have a good time not get depressed please! -

I've read or tried all the staples here, everything on the first 4 pages of royal road etc so obscure recommendations from hard-to-navigate sites like Space-battles etc would be appreciated.\\
Some key examples/recommendations for others with the same taste:\\
[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/slouching-towards-nirvana-worm-my-hero-academia.863129/][Slouching towards nirvana]] - My favorite atm. worm/hero academia cross over, and because the MC is Taylor + an altruistic pacifist, the characters make up for the others weaknesses leading to very good decisions.

Other good ones would be [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/my-hero-school-adventure-is-all-wrong-as-expected-bnha-x-oregairu.697066/][My Hero school adventure is all wrong]], [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][A Young Woman's Political Record]], [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][Battle Action Harem Hischool S...]] and from RR Blue core, Super minion, to some extent delve would fit this criteria.

Pls more recommendations! I think I am suffering from addiction withdrawal!
