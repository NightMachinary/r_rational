[[https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35994830][Kings of Paradise]] -

blurb: On one side, a disfigured boy must survive and get revenge in a harsh land with nothing but his genius. On the other, a rich, handsome prince in a tropical paradise has everything, but must find what he actually wants from life.

If you couldn't tell from the blurb, the two POV characters are basically opposite reflections, a theme that is present throughout the story and is very well done. Probably the best indie book I've ever read, and the sequels are also magnificent. My only quibble is its very start, which plunges the reader right into the intensely brutal action right away, and which is not very representative of the overall tone of the book.

blurb: A genius young woman whose people and culture was swallowed and subsumed becomes a cog of the machine of empire, charged with doing the same to another people and culture.

Very well paced and written well, does an amazing job at depicting its major themes of imperialism, assimilation, exploitation.

blurb: A first year university student in an alternate version of byzantium gets caught up inadvertently in a conspiracy.

I love this story in large part for the first half of the first book which is an intensely introspective narrative of a young man coming to terms with his place in another world, a quintessential bildungsroman. The narrative eventually changes to become more plot driven rather than character driven, but doesn't really decline in quality.

blurb: A man who is the result of a millenia-long breeding program ventures back into civilization just as a holy war is being launched.

Gorgeous prose and deep, intense metaphysics. Pretty dark though, bordering on grimdark.

blurb: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

3 million words and with hundreds of characters and plot threads to keep track of, this is the epitome of epic fantasy. Worth it if you can get past the first 1-2 books, which start out by throwing the reader immediately into the deep end of the pool, no handholding. My favourites are books 3, 5, 6, 10.
