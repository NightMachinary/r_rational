Will Wight's Elder Empire pair of trilogies follows two main characters. The MC of the "Shadows" trilogy is Shera, an assassin who openly and unapologetically doesn't give a fuck about human life and morals. But her friends do. So /fine/, she's willing to put forth a bare minimum of effort to apply non-lethal measures.
