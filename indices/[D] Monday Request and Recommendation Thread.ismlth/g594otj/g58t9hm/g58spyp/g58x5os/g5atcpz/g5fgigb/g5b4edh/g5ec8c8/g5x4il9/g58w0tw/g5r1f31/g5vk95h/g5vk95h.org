TL;DR: I liked the first book enough that I was kept strung along across all of them, and now looking back I feel only pain.

I liked the protagonist to begin with, but I found my distaste for him and the other main characters growing as the books went on, peaking by the last one, which I was mostly reading out of a perverse feeling of disgust.

I guess there's only so much 'lol ironic misanthropic self-loathing!' you can read before you get sick of it. Worse when it gets stale from overuse and repetition.

Add on the writer wanting to add a twist every five chapters, and I retreated to a position of not caring about any of the apparent goings-on, or whether a given character would live or die, because I knew I could expect every currently apparent relationship or live-dead status to be reversed/subverted as being a plot within a plot with a 50% probability within the next 50 chapters (sometimes repeatedly, for the same character), leading to me just not giving a shit about any of these people- at least partly because in the face of this, the main character just kept going, same as ever, without even giving a nod to the higher-level fact that his worldview of what was going on, who was on his side, who was alive or dead, etc. Was shifting at a ludicrous rate.

I think it's a case of quantitative difference making a qualitative one, maybe combined with serial fiction drama addiction syndrome: if you're releasing once/twice a week, it pays (literally, in patreon bucks) to have every chapter be as individually interesting as possible. So there's an incentive to have as many reveals and cliffhangers as possible.

But I was reading these all at once, as faits accomplis. So what might have come across as exciting and a bit hectic when you're reading one/two chapters a week came across as a stupid rollercoaster of mood/'basic apparent facts about the world' whiplash that was never addressed, because it wasn't the sort of thing that would seem to need addressing when you're following the story being released serially.

And there's something else about Moodylit's writing that aggravates me, that I noticed in the first book of the good student as well (the only other thing of his that I've read) that's hard to put into words: it's like, in his mind/rules for writing, the protagonist is never allowed to have dignity, no matter what.

This isn't directly what I have a problem with. The issue comes up when, in the course of the story, the protagonist happens to end up doing something good or heroic, or shows some strength or backbone, or thinks in a way that goes outside of their 2D predefined character. It's like whenever this happens by accident, moody quickly cringes back, as if anticipating being struck down for this sin, he makes sure to put that protagonist back in his place, with vengeance. Like he's conspicuously desperate to not write wish fulfillment, to the point that he smears his protagonist's face in the dirt in a conspicuous way that doesn't feel genuine.

In HTADADB, this is done mostly by pulling the rug out from under the MC and the reader ever 5 chapters, without letting the MC think about the situation on a meta level of 'hey, it seems like every few days all of my knowledge about the world gets turned on its head, either I should figure out a way to live that deals with this or I should just tune out instead of just acting like a brain-dead snark-automaton who behaves no differently than on page one of book one'.

And for all of this complaining, I read all of these fucking books. What's wrong with me?
