Having just read this at the recommendation here: not really, 61-75 are pretty egregiously bad, but the same mistakes continue across all of the most recently published chapters. An attentive proofreader would have gone a long way.

I'd accuse it of being machine translated (though it's pretty clear that's the base), but looking at the actual machine translations make me want to poke my eyes out as opposed to just scratching them a bit.
