I'd say Forty Milleniums of Cultivation does it better than any other. I remember it being recced here a couple years ago and I'm surprised to never see it in recommendation threads.

Anything I'd say would be inferior to the quality of that recommendation, so I'd check that out to see what it's all about. And as someone who's been keeping up with daily updates, FMoC is incredible.

There truly is no other xianxia like it, it is cultivation taken to its rational endpoint, with modern or even futuristic advanced civilizations, multiple in-depth beliefs of what it means to be a cultivator, absolutely phenomenal characters and the best xianxia villains, and more.
