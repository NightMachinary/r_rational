I feel like The Menocht Loop is not so much a time-loop story than a post-time-loop story. The first book is a bit all over the place, but once you get into book 2 you start getting more of a sense of where the story is going and how the consequences of the time loop mechanic will play out in the "real" world. The MC isn't necessarily 100% rational, but that's pretty understandable given his circumstances and I find him easy to empathize with.
