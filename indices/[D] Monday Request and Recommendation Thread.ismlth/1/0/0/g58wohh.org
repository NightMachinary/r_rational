Cinnamon Bun has been a disappointment after a promising first ~50 chapters, not really doing anything interesting with the theme. The story has just seemed to clear a particularly dull stretch so hopefully the next section does something interesting.

--------------

Ar'Kendrithyst must have as many anti-recommends as recommends at this point, seems like a very divisive web novel thus far. I will say that some of your particular complaints have been well dealt with, particularly the father's inconsistent and sometimes dangerous pacificism. I feel like the author wrote himself into a corner with that one, seeing it as an interesting solution to the early problems that then made no sense once the story developed, but he's managed to write himself out of the hole mostly. And things like the flaws of the gods do have great relevance to the overall plot.

Nonetheless, stories that take hundreds of thousands of words to solve initial issues are never going to be good recommendations for a lot of people.
