   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: thieves-dungeon
   :END:

- PROs: • quite a few interesting / original ideas • thematically somewhat similar to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns][/No Loot, Only Puns/,]] but only somewhat. So readers who have finished /Puns/ may consider giving this one a try • depending on reader preferences, the story may have some pretty creature and area designs.

- CONs:

  - False promise in the synopsis / title: the dungeon is not a thief, it's a robber, burglar, murderer, etc.
  - Prot has almost no agency (e.g. in its own words: 'I'd spent much of my time recently reacting to one situation after another') • makes rash and stupid decisions • has inconsistent personality, 'morality' • has ridiculous plot armor • unnecessarily aggroes at gods for something they weren't even responsible for at the time (earth elementals) and takes this to the extreme, immediately deciding to outright kill them.
  - Random things keep happening to push the plot, • the second half of the story is much worse in quality.
  - Too many cases of wishful thinking, contrived coincidence, extremely unlikely events happening, prot winning / surviving by the skin of their teeth, etc. • the setting not only has prophecies, but they are also used to handwave away poor and unlikely plot developments, to the extent of many characters acting extremely OoC just because they're aware they're inside an active prophecy and being affected by it.
  - Almost all 'enemies' make a chain of unlikely / stupid decisions for the prot to be able to 'win'.
  - The prose tries for being beautiful / exquisite, but ends up being excessively purple instead.
  - Despite the story's website status, it's not completed. Apparently it's just book 1 that's finished, and even that one ends very abruptly, seemingly at a random chapter.

Somewhat similar to [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare][/Threadbare/,]] in that the prot is often able to communicate with mob-class creatures and thus unlock new solution pathways and possibilities for herself thanks to that. It's a fluffy story, so the reception will probably depend on the reader's tastes and current reading requirements. The overarching story has potential but the current WIP progression hasn't produced anything particularly promising yet. Maybe check back on it in 3-6 months.

   :END:
Feels thematically similar to [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/210566-the-system-apocalypse][/System Apocalypse/,]] but is being released for free. The prose and plot quality are notecably worse (e.g. so far, underwhelming fight scenes against mobs, unoriginal mobs, unoriginal strategic solutions, missed munchkining opportunities, unnecessary sentences and paragraphs, etc). The story has potential though (esp. as a 'political' / strategic LitRPG), and may be worth re-checking once it's finished.

- CONs:

  - Anti-recommendation for this one. There are two main characters: a dad and his daughter. For both of them their back-stories are being used to explain away why they end up quickly getting so powerful when compared to the native population. Both also make one stupid mistake / decision after another --- dad's PoV chapters are downright aggravating to read. The daughter decides to stick her head into serious trouble even when there really isn't any need to take such great risks. I've dropped this story around chapter ~40 (so these notes are only for that portion), but by that point it wasn't showing any signs of improvements and was only getting worse.
  - In general, it's a feel-good fiction (ego-boosting, HFY, etc) with too much wishful thinking. The handwave excuse for prot's OP magical abilities is his Earth-based knowledge regarding laws of nature, but most of the time he doesn't even demonstrate any deep understanding of such knowledge. Aside from maybe the lightening-related scene, those physics-related trivia are used more like a set of [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NMoLJuDJEms7Ku9XS/guessing-the-teacher-s-password][teacher's passwords]] rather than anything actually meaningful or insightful.
  - The dad is a nonsensical pacifist. He keeps prattling about not wanting to harm or kill anyone one moment, the next moment suddenly jumps to being ready to annihilate an entire country-wide area of sophonts. In more general terms, 'cares' about human and furry lives but doesn't care whatsoever about similarly intelligent 'dark' creatures. Also doesn't try to verify in any possible way what the humans and furries are telling him about those dark creatures, believing their side of the story immediately and immediately becoming ready to exterminate those dark creatures in large numbers. An extreme doormat, changes his opinions at the drop of a hat based on what others have told him a few moments ago.
  - The dad also spreads dangerous knowledge even after being criticised for it and warned about it by several people, and after agreeing with them that what he was doing was stupid and that he should stop doing it.
  - The setting in general is also too much of a walled garden to not be uninteresting --- Stats, quests, etc can be given out by city administrators, etc. • The gods actively meddle and micromanage, especially when it comes to the main characters. The dad gets yanked into celestial court proceedings a few times after each creation of a new spell. • Any magic that is deemed dangerous gets banned and restricted on the Game System level • Game System itself is controlled by those actively meddling gods. • And those ancient gods show the intelligence of average mortals / beuracrats at best.
