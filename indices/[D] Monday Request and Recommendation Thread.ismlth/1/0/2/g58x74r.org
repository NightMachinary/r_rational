Ar'Kendrithyst hit the nail on the head. I tried it and ended up dropping it after a few chapters, largely because of how terrible the characters were.

Solomon's Crucible is weird in that it could have been good, but the author tries to make the MC some morally upright paragon of virtue who looks down on people who were forced into servitude. Luckily his family isn't forced to make the choice others were; his sister holds out long enough for him to come rescue her. The people he helps are good (especially his family and friends), while the people against him are bad.

What's weird about Solomon's Crucible is that it's by the same author who's writing Heart of Cultivation, which is really good, and in a lot of ways almost the exact opposite.
