I don't think it's necessarily that strange. As far as I can tell, the Romans didn't really have a concept of 0 the way we think about it, but they still did math. I think it's important to distinguish between the concept of nothing -- which the denizens of delve surely have -- and the concept of zero -- which they really don't have a need for. I get your point about banking, but I think it's important to remember that (1) They're using ancient relics that they don't really care too much about understanding and (2) Any knowledge about math and numbers the bank has is unlikely to be distributed to the wider world. That's one of the things Rain bemoans the most, the lack of cooperation means information isn't shared and nobody ever takes any support classes.
