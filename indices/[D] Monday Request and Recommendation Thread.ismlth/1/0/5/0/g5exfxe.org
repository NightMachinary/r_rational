It's quite strange that Delve has an ancient advanced civilization but people somehow forgot the number 0. It makes very little sense. There were people living in huts in the americas that came up with 0 as a concept by themselves, but in Delve you have this post collapse civilization that has lost so much even basic numerals weren't only lost by most people but by everyone even the educated elite..

They have banks but don't understand the idea of 0. The worldbuilding in delve is very convenient.
