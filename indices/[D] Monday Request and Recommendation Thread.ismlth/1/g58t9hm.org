Hello, everyone! Some reviews, notes, and recommendations:

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies][Dark Skies]]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dark-skies
   :END:

- PROs:

  - Detailed description of pseuxo-Regency era culture, of stratified society, of problems that people of various classes have to face and deal with, etc.
  - Mostly well-designed and well-described incremental improvements of the protagonist, both in terms of magical power and intelligence / knowledge.
  - ActLikeYouBelong is pretty much a theme of its own in this story.

- General notes:

  - An interesting, somewhat experimental premise that combines regular elemental fantasy setting of actively meddling gods with something like /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Little_Princess][A Little Princess]]/ (e.g. [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie][Break the Cutie,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CinderellaCircumstances][Cinderella Circumstances,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment][Denied Food as Punishment,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOrphanageLady][Evil Orphanage Lady,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician][Impoverished Patrician,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterclassFriendship][Interclass Friendship,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook][Older Than They Look,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessInRags][Princess in Rags,]] [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches][Rags to Riches,]] etc).
  - It's a slow-paced story, but features magical theory developments and magical experimentation every once in a while.
  - Exploitation genres are Angst, Hurt/Comfort.

CONs: Not particularly rational. Too many characters behave incongruently when they have to fall in line with the approaching plot development or have to quickly fall into orbiting the protagonist girl despite their otherwise strong personalities. • Recurring soap opera-type dramas, drama balls.

** [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31514/the-menocht-loop][The Menocht Loop]]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-menocht-loop
   :END:
The initial chapters thematically feel like a sequel to MoL. After the first layer of the loop, however, the quality of the worldbuilding starts dropping, as does prot's level of intelligence / quality of reactions to new environments and problems. This continues to the end of 'book one', at which point the plot arcs seem to abandon the prot-in-loop genre altogether, transporting him into the "real" world. That said, there are still some interesting ideas explored even in those later chapters, e.g. what would a setting look like in which a significant portion of non-muggles had Sharingan-similar predictive capabilities.

- Some other positive qualities of the story:

  - the author seems to have spent quite some time refining an accurate represantation of the setting they've decided to design
  - non-muggles inside loops display high tier intelligence thoughts and behaviour
  - good fight scenes
  - relatively original magical system --- no particular element of it is original by itself, but their combination is somewhat unique

- Misc: the story has some similarities to [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/185188-i-shall-seal-the-heavens][/I Shall Seal The Heavens/]] --- it feels like some specific ideas and plot arcs were taken from /ISStH/, and refined into their own standalone story.

- PROs:

  - one of the few stories I've seen so far that features meta-gaming elements (in this case, gaining benefits from 'monetisation' of audience ratings, advertisers, etc). The upside to this is that the story can be used (by the author and reader both) as a literary discussion / analysis on the nature of the genre as a whole and that plot railroading handwaves can be made to look more natural. The downside is that the writer relies on such handwaves too much, with the eventual result being suffering story quality.
  - One heavily featured idea that I don't remember having seen much elsewhere is 3D manufacturing of full-fledged humans, with fake memories, on industrial scales (Blade Runner style).
  - The portrayal of the cat character is rather detailed, partially likely due to the author having such a pet himself.

- CONs:

  - The story's rather rough at the starting chapters (especially prose, and the style of System messages), but picks up in quality once it gains its footing.
  - The gamification system is not impartial, and the game itself has owners who aren't impartial either. This can be subjectively unpleasant, depending on the reader's preferences.
  - In some aspects, the audience ratings feel like just some numbers going up.

- General notes: Mostly a fun read. Prot and his team usually try to munchkin their way through, but the author often finds some excuse or another to explain /why/ they end up making supbar (or sometimes outright stupid) decisions to liven-up the plot and prevent it from becoming a full-out corporate-style grind.

   :END:

- PROs: • Interesting perspective on what supernatual and extra-dimensional shenanigans could look like from the PoV of the local spirit that's messing with mortals, etc. • Some interesting experimentation inside the setting's magical system, creation of pretty artefacts and magical machinery.

- CONs: • Prot is OPed and gets an inordinate amount of beneficial coincidences, etc (even if those are explained away as indirect effects of his nature). • I think it has some recycled tropes and plot devices taken from /Release That Witch/ and a few others (e.g. attacking floating islands, the designated antag revealed to have had no choice but to have chosen the lesser evil, 'Blight', etc). • The harem women don't have particularly interesting personalities. • Has some smut scenes, but most of those are underwhelming and feel like they're just there as the pro forma requirement for the chosen genre.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: infinite-realm
   :END:

- How to read: I recommend altogether skipping the 'past' chapters as distractions and focus on either just present-Ryun, or present timelines of both characters.

- PROs:

  - A few interesting scenes and ideas (slave's artefact, her escape, her owner's actions and rationale);
  - Interesting setting design element: a gamified setting that has existed for long enough to produce hidden conspiracies and forces at play, as well as powerful players that have their pet projects discreetly operating somewhere out there (e.g. the lich's auto-farming underground army).
  - Interesting character designs for other top-tier powergamers (e.g. interlude chapters).

- CONs:

  - False promise in the premise / title --- aside from the tell-don't-show, there is nothing in the story itself that would showcase an infinite realm. Both prots take root almost immediately after entering the new realm. Similarly, the story starts with telling how there are infinite iterations of Earth, but later on shawcases people from only 7 of them.
  - Prot's actions and behaviour don't match his background story from the intro chapters. Rather, those intro chapters are more just a backstory / training-montage analogue that's there to ease suspension of disbelief and explain away prot's overpowered abilities.
  - Ryun often makes excuses to explain his actions that are there for plot railroading --- if the plot has to advance from point A to point B, he will start moving in that direction, and the narrative / inner monologue will try to explain his choices in terms of some moral stance or another, even if those choices don't make much sense or contradict his earlier tell-don't-show moral values. He also has very little agency --- things just keep happening near him, and he keeps reacting to them in a manner of such narrative-enforced, inconsistent personality.
  - Both protags are rather template-cut and unoriginal, each in his own way.
  - In the setting, 1-sentence “epiphanies” can give a cultivator a power boost for which they'd otherwise have to work years or decades. Naturally, the protag is somehow a genius at pulling such epiphanies out of nowhere.
  - Ryun's morality / 'life philosophy', and even to some extent the story's global narrative are too simplistic and naïve. (e.g. things like “I don't lie, ever”, “I judge people by their actions. Even if I know a group of people is planning to betray me / coup against me, I'll do nothing up till the last moment because all the planning in the world isn't a definite action of betrayal by itself.” “I don't hold secrets about myself, and freely divulge information about myself, even potentially sensitive information, even to people I barely know.“, etc)
  - Many times prot makes a stupid decision, gets an out-of-jail free card by having a system-related epiphany at the last moment, and doesn't learn anything from his mistakes, keeping insisting that it's his “nindo” to behave that way.
  - Ryun has double standards: him v.s. others, others v.s. attractive females. Regarding the latter, he ends up helping and favouring one female character after another, even though he keeps talking about how people have to earn their own power and how nepotism is bad, etc.
  - The fights aren't particularly interesting, the setting is mostly a generic version of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ELEMENTALPOWERS][Elemental Powers]]
  - The global plotline seems to be headed towards the cliche of getting manipulated or helped by one god to end up killing all the gods.
