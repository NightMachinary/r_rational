Getting into this thread a bit late, but I'd like to recommend [[https://w11.mangafreak.net/Manga/Oshi_No_Ko][Oshi No Ko]]. Basically any summary of this story is spoilery, so I'll go with "an idol-obsessed doctor finds the idol he's obsessed with has become one of his patients-- because that idol is hiding an unplanned pregnancy. And then he's killed and reincarnates... as one of the idol's newborn baby twins.

(note: this is not a fluffy wish-fulfillment story.)

If anyone has any other "reincarnated back into the real world" stories to recommend, please do. (ERASED is another good example of this genre.) Would accept historical or modern reincarnations. I'm progressively less tolerant of isekai reincarnation stories, though, since it seems like, to me, they've become too cookie cutter.
