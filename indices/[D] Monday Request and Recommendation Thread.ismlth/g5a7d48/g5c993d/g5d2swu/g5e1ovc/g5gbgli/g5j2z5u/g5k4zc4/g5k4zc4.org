I had Dao of Magic and Brocktons Celestial Forge on a plan to read but I'll raise their priority now.

I did read wake of the ravager and castle kingside, I think I probably stopped in both of them when they were still litrpg/isekai fantasy so I didn't know both of them had base/kingdom building.\\
Savage Divinity's gonna be a pass for me, not sure I can put myself through it long enough to get to the relevant part.

Thanks for your suggestions/recommendations.
