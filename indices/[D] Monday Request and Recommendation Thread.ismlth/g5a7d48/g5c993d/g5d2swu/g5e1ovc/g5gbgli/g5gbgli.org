Sure I'll keep editing this so incase you see an earlier version just check back later(I'll try to hyperlink each title for ease in the future).List deviates from what we usually put in as rational so bear that in mind.

*Webnovels* (or whatever this is called, CN/KR/JP novels) is a pretty hard category to sift through. Some of them start off pretty well but slowly transition to other genre or have the characters not have a realistic sense required for Kingdom building.\\
[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/hail-the-king/][Hail the King]] : Got dry very quickly and didn't have the ability to keep readers.\\
[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/bringing-the-farm-to-live-in-another-world/][Bringing The Farm To Live In Another World]] : This was good at the begining where he has a cheat code to build up his kingdom but quickly devolves from kingdom building into some xianxia travel fiction.\\
[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/genjitsushugi-yuusha-no-oukoku-saikenki/][Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom]] : Starts off well and falls off a cliff to the readers who can follow through that the intricacies of actual building and supply/demand arent being done.\\
[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-world-online/][The World Online]]: This is actually complex and was kind of hard to read but MC does have kingdom building,I dropped it pretty early because plot line diverged while the MC did some typical xianxia game fusion stuff and the kingdom building and running was neglected.

The better ones from this category would probably be\\
[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/][Release the Witch]]: It's some solid kingdom building and progression alongside the technological uplift for ~800 chapters and then it gets into some magic dev arc so I stopped there.\\
[[https://www.novelupdates.com/series/common-sense-of-a-dukes-daughter/][Common Sense of a Duke's Daughter]] : Very Slice of Life, it gets a bit monotonous at times but it does hit the itch.

*Royal Road*:\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire][Enlightened Empire]] : Apparently this is a pretty favorited thing but I just could not get into how sporadic the story started off and never had the willpower to continue it.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war][A Hero's War]]: Solid stuff, the pov switches get annoying in the middle but generally a good read.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31377/an-advance-in-time][Advance in Time]]: This was great, bingeable and the progress didn't let down, unfortunately its on hiatus and has only 30 chapters or so.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19290/rise-of-the-lord][Rise of the Lord]]/Etc : There are a lot of cultivation world feudal system fics but most of them are either abandoned or fall off a cliff.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2666/atros-imperium][Atros Imperium]]: Pretty confusing pick because it also starts off as a kingdom building but that gets sidelined for the MC to galavant the lands with his romantic interests but the kingdom maintenance pops up here and there.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32081/a-world-forgotten][A world Forgotten]]: Pretty much cookie cutter, Isekai fantasy world with settlement building.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall][Defiance of the Fall]] : Base building but it's just a subplot not the focus.\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19690/out-of-space][Out of Space]]: I included this because while not exactly on theme, it did have the feel of it and did somewhat have entire arcs dedicated to a technological introduction to fantasy world thing that I was looking for.

[[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RSDP4ZT?ref_=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_tkin&binding=kindle_edition][The red lands]] : I found this on RR but it is hosted independently on the author's [[https://onlinewebnovel.com/index-for-new/][site]]. I liked it, Isekai'd orphan in a feudal world where everything is out to get you. I believe the first 150 or so chapters focus on the MC's rise and development of his power station/base/settlement before he goes out to travel the world.

*Other*:\\
[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/cruel-to-be-kind-si-multicross-rehost.3509/reader/][Cruel to be Kind]]: Guy gets some advanced multiverse technology and decides to build an intergalactic empire that spans the multiverse. I liked it in the early phases (~200-300 chapters) but after that it starts to be a mixed fantasy/sci-fi war/politics/drama journey which wasn't as satisfying as some of the earlier content. Life Reset : pretty standard novel of guy turned into goblin and now must build up the race to take his revenge etc.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13338339/1/Compass-of-thy-Soul][Compass of thy soul]] : Pretty unique one as a Naruto SI fanfic where MC tries to fix the lifestyle of the clans and builds on that for a kingdom/village etc. Would only recommend if you like the world of Naruto

Taking a break will update more later.
