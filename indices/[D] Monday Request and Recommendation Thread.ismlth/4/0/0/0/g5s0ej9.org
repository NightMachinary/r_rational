A big problem I had with the series was the obtuse, enigmatic inner monologue that composed most of the writing. In order to understand the plot or the backstory you basically had to put on a deerstalker hat and make deductions. Memories of Ice was 1000% better in that regard, and so was Midnight Tides.

That said, I read the books pretty much on release, so it's been a long, long time. I do not have a firm grasp on them at all, and I've been meaning to re-read the series for years.
