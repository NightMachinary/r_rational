Along with Forge of Destiny and Heart of Cultivation, I quite enjoy [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/][Ave Xia Rem Y]]. It's similar to Forge of Destiny -- not really rational, but mostly because the protagonist is just a kid. He wants to learn medicine and calls his rival a butthead; he's not really trying to minmax his cultivation.

Spoilers for the last few chapters: Due to [spoilers], the MC is now on his own. We'll see if this results in him making smart plays to rapidly increase his power, or not.
