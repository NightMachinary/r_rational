I only read the two first chapters, but the main character says something like no wonder everyone likes lolitas so much and when the little girl hears him he tells her never to tell anyone. I found it a little gross, and it also made me expect that it would be more stuff like that throughout the story. Combined with the weird style I did not feel like continue reading.
