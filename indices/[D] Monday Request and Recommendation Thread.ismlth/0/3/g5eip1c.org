I always think of [[https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Reverend-Insanity/][Reverend Insanity]]. Not only is the prose, creativity, and world building in the very top tier of xianxia, but deus ex machina events that continuously save the MC and guarantee him "fortuitous encounters" are significantly less prevalent that in almost any other story in the genre. It's worth noting that the MC is a total sociopath, but I still consider it the best-written and most fun xianxia I've read to date. It's been recommended a couple of other times in this sub, but it still doesn't get the attention I think it deserves.

Thanks for the rec as well!
