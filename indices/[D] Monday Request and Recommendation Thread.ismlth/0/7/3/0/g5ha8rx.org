I'm of split mind on the story, on one hand, the 'expensive' part has been paid already, and we're starting to make concrete story progress again.

On the other, I wouldn't recommend anybody read several million words to only get where we are today, including many many chapters where they could be entirely removed with no editing without affecting the story at all.

I'm going to keep reading it, and enjoying it, but I don't think it was worth it.
