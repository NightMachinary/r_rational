I'll have to anti-recommend Savage Divinity, unfortunately. Had a good start but lost itself along the way.

Forge of Destiny is really solid. Not necessarily "rational", per se, but generally most of the characters are reasonable, smart, and proactive. Stakes are relatively low and personal for the first book, but that mostly adds to its charm. If anyone ever wanted to see a "magic school" xianxia, this does it very well.

Heart of Cultivation has a promising start so far, with some interesting transhumanist themes, but the pacing so far has been a touch slow and it isn't long enough yet to tell if that potential will be lived up to. Tentative recommend so far.
