Yeah, I felt somewhat let down when I started reading it.

It's... not really so much rational in terms of character actions - though the only actually irrational things I can recall are a few quick gags that have no real impact beyond the scene they're in. But the entire system of cultivation, and the worldbuilding, all makes a lot of sense in explaining how the world is the way it is. In some ways, the impact of that won't be as great if you haven't read any other xianxia before.
