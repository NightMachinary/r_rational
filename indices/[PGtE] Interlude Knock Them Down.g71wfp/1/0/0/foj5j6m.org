Bard wanted out of the Game, and Cat beat her to it by getting out of the game even earlier :D

But I wonder about Bard's endgames overall. Most of the redditors on this sub would relish having her powers even in the specific context, and probably would shape Creation towards very long-term optimisation. The character we're shown basically wants out, like she ran out of want and perspective long ago. Are there explicit constraints that make it impossible for the world to evolve, and force Bard to be stuck in a static world ?

And if so... Is Cat's adventure how the world fixes this ?
