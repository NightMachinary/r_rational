Meta narratively it's interesting that Cat ended things with rejecting the whole framework of the game they were playing. Ties into the theme of rejecting stories and constraining narratives

Reminds me of the ending of watchmen and War Games.

Does give rise to a problem with how to end the story on a satisfying way. How much can you make it about the protagonist rejecting stories while still having satisfying story beats
