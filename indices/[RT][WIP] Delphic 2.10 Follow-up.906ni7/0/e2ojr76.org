I guess at this point the use of the name Juniper is just a calling card for rational fiction.

/Ninja Edit/: Ah, I just double checked the post about it from a few days ago and see that this was deliberate. I feel like Juniper is now the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAtAyycx-uY][0451]] of rational fiction.

I kind of like that Hector appears to be about to do a phenomenally stupid thing over a hook-up. Characters in fiction too often struggle with deep, emotionally fraught flaws that define who they are. Real people more often seem to struggle because of doing stupid things based on momentary circumstance.
