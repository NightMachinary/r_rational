That seems like a good extension but I prefer rss feeds because that way I can monitor all of my fics from spacebattles, Royalroadl, AO3, etc. I've found this fic on AO3 and used [[http://createfeed.wprssaggregator.com][this rss feed creation tool]] , pointed at the [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/navigate][chapter index page]] in AO3, to create [[http://createfeed.wprssaggregator.com/extract.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Farchiveofourown.org%2Fworks%2F15996890%2Fnavigate&in_id_or_class=&url_contains=15996890][this rss feed]].
