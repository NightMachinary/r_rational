The interesting thing about this fic is how the story focuses on examining the characters, but manages to work in a pretty solid background plot that not only maintains momentum, but also my interest.

I wouldn't call the characters in this fic that rational tbh. Everyone is given a clear, consistent motivation to justify their actions, but for all their strengths in making strong, logical choices, the story itself puts equal emphasis on their flaws and weaknesses. And I like that, since Tom Riddle in fanfiction is a tricky character to write, especially as a protagonist. He tends to waver in between two extremes - the too dumb to live Saturday morning cartoon villain Voldemort reminiscent of late stage Deathly Hallows canon, or the emotionless genocidebot from something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] which reads like a videogame fic, where the narrator has read the manual and gave himself all the power ups, and everyone but the narrator is an NPC to be used, manipulated, or steamrolled at will.

Riddle in this fic is clever and stupid at the same time, but most importantly, he feels like an actual human bean and not a plot device or videogame avatar. The chapters are hefty and could probably be shorter, and the first half is a lot of slow build up with more character interaction than genuine plot. However, the writing is excellent and the attention to detail in setting, historical accuracy, and character voice is enough to make up for it.
