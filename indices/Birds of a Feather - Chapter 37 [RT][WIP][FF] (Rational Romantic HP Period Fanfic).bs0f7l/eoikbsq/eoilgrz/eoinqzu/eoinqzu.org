I've noticed some romance cliches, eg. the hints to a possible love triangle, being mistaken for a couple, but it's relatively minor and set up in a way that doesn't scream that this is a story written on narrative convention over character decisions and consequences. The illusion of character agency is pretty well maintained, but I def agree that on the spectrum between rationalist and rational, this is on the rational end. There's a focus on intelligent characterization, but it's not written to be particularly intellectual, as in a story where readers are rewarded for predicting the twists ahead of time, based on prior established plot points.

  Perhaps I've become used to thick chapters because of web serials in general but I've found the pacing to be very good.

Reading lite novels and Asian serials, I'm used to 1-3k bitesize chapters, so these chapters are lengthy in comparison. The chapters have enough plot progression that it doesn't feel like a drag, but comparing the prose to the sparse style of lite novels, most of the wordage comes from the introspection and descriptions. I don't mind slow payoffs, so it doesn't bother me hugely.
