  I wouldn't call the characters in this fic that rational tbh. Everyone is given a clear, consistent motivation to justify their actions, but for all their strengths in making strong, logical choices, the story itself puts equal emphasis on their flaws and weaknesses.

I guess it feels more rational in the way that history is rational.

  In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

Unlike your examples it doesn't feel like a video game, or a story, it feels very realistic. Apart from the innate tropiniess of him ending up being heir but that's nothing to do with character actions. Characters always seem internally motivated not saying things or doing things because it's a story. For me that's the biggest thing about rationality but I guess that's just semantics or the difference between rationalist and rational

  The chapters are hefty and could probably be shorter, and the first half is a lot of slow build up with more character interaction than genuine plot.

Perhaps I've become used to thick chapters because of web serials in general but I've found the pacing to be very good. I read this chapter and never felt like I wanted it to be cut or chopped sooner but maybe I just enjoy the story too much.
