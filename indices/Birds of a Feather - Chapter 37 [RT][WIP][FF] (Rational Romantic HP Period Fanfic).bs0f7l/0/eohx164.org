This story was mentioned in a few monthly recommendations but I felt like it deserved its own post for those who don't check those out (which I recommend doing so).

The basic gist of the story is imagining if a girl like Hermione went to Hogwarts the same time Tom Riddle did. The story is excellently paced, written fantastically, all of the characters make believable choices and you get a lot of insight into the reasons and motives behind the two main characters. It's also extraordinarily immersive, really excellently done in a way that puts to shame the Grindlewald movies, you really get the sense of WW2 Britain.

We've spoken a lot on this subreddit about the difficulty of writing rational romance and I'd say this is at least a good example of two intelligent characters moving towards that. Obviously it's set some time ago so the attitudes are not the same as modern ones and Tom is not a moral bastion. All of the (not romantic) relationships between characters feel real.

In the background of the story the author is also creating a quite sensible universe without tearing everything up.

Even if you're not into romance I think that the vast majority of this subreddit's users will really enjoy this story. I will say that it's not too rationalist (just rational), there are some introspective moments but not quite the listing of biases and things like that.
