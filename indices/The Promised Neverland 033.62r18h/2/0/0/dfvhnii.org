I would normally object, but they get a pass after killing Norman. Assuming they genuinely did so, of course, which isn't /quite/ certain. I wouldn't be surprised if he was, though, seeing as his death was actually a meaningful motivator for everybody, rather than just an additional, slightly unnecessary, point to an already excellent plan.
