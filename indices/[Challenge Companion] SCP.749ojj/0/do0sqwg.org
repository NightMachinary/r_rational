A few of my favorite SCPs:

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1171][Humans Go Home]]. I laughed pretty hard at this.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2006][Too Spooky]]. Short, funny, slightly unsettling.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3263][Mr. Headgeworth's School for the Magically Gifted]]. A unique take on Harry Potter-type fantasy.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-946][A Formal Discussion]]. Very short. I found this one to be existentially terrifying.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317][A Doorway to Another World]]. What lies beyond depends on your security clearance.

[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-453][Scripted Nightclub]]. On the long side. A nightclub in Italy which induces the patrons to act out scenes from the days of the Roman empire.
