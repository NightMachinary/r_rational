Being aware of your own irrationality isn't rationality. One of the themes of UNSONG is that the world has gone mad, so deliberate and lampshaded irrationality helps convey that theme. Which is good writing. Very good writing, even. But it does not make the story rational.

Nor is it exactly rational fanfic. If HPMoR is our gold standard for rational fanfic, then it's about taking the arbitrary and irrational features of the original story and inventing the consistent and simple rules that led to them. (E.g. in Harry Potter, the Philosopher's Stone creates gold and immortality. In HPMoR, those two apparently unrelated uses stem from a single power.) A rational fanfic of Judaic myth might look at the Bible and describe how God chooses when to perform a miracle and what form that miracle should take. UNSONG has a few elements of rat-fic, but mostly it's its own thing.
