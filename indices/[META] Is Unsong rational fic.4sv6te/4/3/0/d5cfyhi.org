You don't need brain parasites, humans come like that out of the box >_<

Well, the /universe/ is story based - there is a stipulation that your action is more likely to succeed if the outcome is aesthetically pleasing, and convincing the universe is a worthwhile thing to do.

But do you think the /characters/ of unsong are infected by story-logic? In fact the humans are /insufficiently/ influenced by story logic...no way /actual/ humans would put DRM on the Names of God or ally with Hell for pragmatic reasons, our species is far too superstitious to do something like that.

On the other hand I guess you could argue that it's story logic that they didn't seriously consider that if they ally with hell they're probably the baddies.

I'm mostly defending why my "I know it when I see it" intuition activates here. There are definitions under which this falls outside.

It's like if a Film Noir detective had a pink fluffy bunny on his head, and all the characters were constantly pointing out the fluffy bunny as seeming out of place. You're still referencing the aesthetic of Film Noir in some important way. Maybe it's not Film Noir because the fluffy bunny breaks the rules but it's still pattern matching to Film Noir in a non superficial way.
