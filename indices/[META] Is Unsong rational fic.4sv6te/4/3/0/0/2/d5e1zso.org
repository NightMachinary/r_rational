Heh, I wonder what Scott would think of his work being called post modern.

I don't really find myself strongly disagreeing with anything you wrote. I think we're just doing word-concept mappings differently or zeroing in on different aspects of the category as what we take to be defining feature. (Is it a blegg or a rube?)

I think you're focusing more on "are there solvable puzzles, is there conservation of detail" and I'd agree that there aren't, whereas I'm focusing more on "what sort of epistemic stance is implicit in the writing".
