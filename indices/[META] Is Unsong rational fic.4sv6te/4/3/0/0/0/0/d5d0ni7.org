Right, I get how the magic systems work.

What I'm saying is that in this particular case (and other places in Unsong), it's a black box. If you stopped reading the chapter right at "Then a miracle occurred" you wouldn't have near enough information to work out what that miracle is, beyond /perhaps/ "animate the Statue of Liberty" (though the rabbi says that this is a specific Name which animates copper, and we haven't seen that one before). If the best guess that could be offered beyond that is "then the rabbi used Names and beat the demons" ... I feel like we would get into a big, pointless discussion about how and whether Names could accomplish that, which the text (up till now) hadn't given us enough information to actually say one way or another (though this in part stems from the equally sparse physical descriptions of the demons).

We know that there are Names that are useful in battle, but for most of them we don't know what they /actually do/, so we can't use them to anticipate solutions to problems. The reader isn't meant to engage in any thinking or analysis, and isn't given the tools to do so, they're just along for the ride.

(For large parts of Unsong, anyway. And I still think it's good, just not rational. RIGBY.)
