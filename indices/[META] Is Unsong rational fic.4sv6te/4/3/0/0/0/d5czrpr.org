The idea that there are spellcasters who can cast spells based on their beliefs and a more consistent ability to use magical names of god to hurt people is a fairly common thing in the story. There's already a consistent governing logic behind what the Rabbi did. I'd assume she did one of those. Based on the names, I'd assume she had some names of god stored up to use as weapons.

Just as in Harry Potter if you say wingardium leviosa you make something fly in this world if you say certain words you kill things and if you're sufficiently elaborate you can do other stuff with belief.
