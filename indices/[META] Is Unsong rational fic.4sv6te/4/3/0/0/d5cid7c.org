I think that there are certain /scenes/ which match the pattern very well, like Aaron's escape from the library, but that this is not true of the majority of the book thus far.

As an example, the most current chapter features demons, whose characteristics are virtually unknown to the reader, being beaten back by a rabbi wielding spells which the reader has also had no exposure to. Yes, you could say "but surely there's some governing consistent logic that the reader just doesn't know", but in my opinion that's not enough for rational fiction, and there's been no indication that Unsong is going to start delving into those areas or properly explaining the abilities or thought processes behind scenes like this.

It's always iffy to analyze a book that's in the process of being released/written, so I reserve the right to say that I was wrong, but so far it doesn't seem like Unsong is rational (nor does it seem like it's commenting on rationality). I would definitely call it postmodern, which it shares with a lot of rational works, but postmodernism is its own thing.
