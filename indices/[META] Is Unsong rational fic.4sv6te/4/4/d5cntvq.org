That chapter was decent, but AE has made other comments that made me believe she completely and utterly failed to grasp the concept of Less Wrong style rationality. She responded to some unfavorable comparisons of her own work with MoR by seeming to think MoR was a positive claim to be refuted (which she demurred to undertake).

As to that linked chapter, going by my recollection from when it was posted, an aware universe that actively interfered with attempts to experiment scientifically is still not immune to the experimental method. You just have to go up one level, and start testing for what sorts of efforts will provoke sabotage.
