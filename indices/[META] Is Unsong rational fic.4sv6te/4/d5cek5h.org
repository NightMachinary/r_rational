It's rational (despite the author saying it's not) because, in every instance where it departs from rationality it does so in a self-aware manner.

#+begin_quote
  Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'
#+end_quote

We are explained that this is a sentient universe which favors plots. It therefore falls under the category of "self aware/deconstruction/subversion".

#+begin_quote
  Any factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil"
#+end_quote

Excused as self aware subversive deconstruction and /also/ excused because it makes sense. We understand that these are angels and demons so there is a very clear reason and backstory for why they are "good' and evil - there are absolutely no unstated assumption about good/evil as natural divides. Besides, angelic "good" is clearly either distinct from human good or similar but somehow severely stunted, so orange and blue morality applies. And we see all this cosmology taken to fairly logical conclusions (Would you want to end up like Neil Armstrong? Of course not...)

#+begin_quote
  The rules of the fictional world are sane and consistent. They are mostly insane and inconsistent.
#+end_quote

I wouldn't say that actually. It proports, in a self aware manner, to be insane and inconsistent (the tone of the narration and the human characters betray clear awareness that it's all insane) but that's because the universe respects plot-thinking. There is still meta-consistency - there are /reasons/ for the apparent inconsistencies and those reasons remain constant and consistent.

Or are you saying hpmor's universe rules made sense? They didn't, at all! There is even that scene with the bats where Harry /tries/ to do experiments and none of the results neatly collapse into any sort of reductionist model. Yet for both stories, we can at least say stuff like "the spell does the same thing each time it is spoken".

You might consider this a rational fanfiction of Judaic mythology (the same way hpmor is a rational fanficiton of harry potter). The universe is irrational because it is a borrowed universe. Also, I understand why you do but I feel like you shouldn't /have/ to borrow the universe for the reader to excuse the universe for being insane. If HPMOR is allowed insane rules so is Unsong.

See also: the tales of mu reply to hpmor: [[http://www.talesofmu.com/other/mumoo]] (ToMU is /actually/ not rational, but this chapter is)

I think if a story is obviously, acutely aware of every single point on which it departs, deconstructs, or subverts the usual rational worldview and makes a point of telling the reader so, it's definitely rational. At no point in Unsong are violations of the rational genre just quietly part of the background, each so-called violation is /loud/ and /intentional/ and explained by meta principles which aren't actually in violation.
