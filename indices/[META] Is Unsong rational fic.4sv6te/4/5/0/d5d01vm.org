  I'm not sure I understand this... Imagine that in a world based on reality sudden, a character has an incurable disease, and is healed by the power of love, and this is confirmed by the narrator ("Yes, guys, he really as started to walk again because of the power of love; this is not a mystery for you to figure out; it just is"). If the narrator then remarks on how unlikely and this is and it breaks the laws of physics as we know them, does this make the story rational fiction? I think it doesn't.

I'd have no issues reading a story where love was a consistent magical force. For example, attractive women would get paid a lot to go into hospitals to heal people with the power of love. Warlords would have harems of devoted lovers to make them immortal. People would experiment with drugs to enhance love and make healing easier.

  I didn't read the whole story (got bored), but I remember the scene with the bats. The idea I got from that scene was that consistent rules existed, but the protagonist was simply unable to find them. Do they ever revisit this experiment and find them? I don't know. But the idea I get from Unsong is that there are no strong consistent rules, and the characters don't expect them to exist, and the universe is just trolling you at every step. This is a matter of feeling rather than an objective assessment, and you're free to disagree.

Names of god clearly have a consistent and powerful effect. Angels and demons have consistent powers. Knowledge of connections between things grants power. If you can convince the universe to help it can offer some minor aid. Physics and maths are not reliable forces.

For some reason or other he knows lots of magic. In universe, age increasing is something that can be done. He uses lots of different sorts of magic together to power the ship.

If enough people believe in a magic, it works somewhat. Not as much power as a name of god.

Drugging people up so you can use mind magic on them more easily isn't that unusual. We're not yet sure why he's magic of course, since the mystery of what heaven is and what god is is one of the central mysteries of the story.
