  And UNSONG's universe is math, because Uriel, simulations / emulations, etc etc.

Unless I'm misreading you, I don't think this is a correct reading of what Uriel did. He converted the world from a substrate of divine light to a substrate of mathematics, but this conversion was imperfect and then broken by the impact against the sphere. Unsong's universe is /not/ math and logic, it just has a broken, imperfect, math and logic layer to it. Uriel even remarks that incoming divine light had to be channeled away from the clockwork he'd made in order to keep the clockwork running.
