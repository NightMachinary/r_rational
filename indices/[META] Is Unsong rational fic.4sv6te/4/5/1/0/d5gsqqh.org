The real universe has laws that can be investigated. But I don't think that holds with the settings that stories can be set in. The author can just say whatever they want and it doesn't have to contribute to the wider universe. It's perfectly possible to write a story that doesn't make sense.

Edit: For example, I would describe the setting of /The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy/ as an irrational universe. There is no physical theory of the universe that explains all the events of the series, let alone the background details occasionally brought up.
