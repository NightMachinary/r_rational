You make some good points, but ultimately I disagree with all of them except for one.

#+begin_quote
  It's rational (despite the author saying it's not) because, in every instance where it departs from rationality it does so in a self-aware manner.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure I understand this... Imagine that in a world based on reality sudden, a character has an incurable disease, and is healed by /the power of love/, and this is confirmed by the narrator ("Yes, guys, he really as started to walk again because of the power of love; this is not a mystery for you to figure out; it just is"). If the narrator then remarks on how unlikely and this is and it breaks the laws of physics as we know them, does this make the story rational fiction? I think it doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  We are explained that this is a sentient universe which favors plots. It therefore falls under the category of "self aware/deconstruction/subversion".
#+end_quote

Again, I have a hard time agreeing with you on this point... It's again a bit like saying that the laws of internal consistency can be broken, as long as the narrator remarks on it.

#+begin_quote
  Excused as self aware subversive deconstruction and also excused because it makes sense.
#+end_quote

Here I agree with you. I admit that was my weakest objection. It's plausible that non-human characters might have non-human motivations.

#+begin_quote
  Or are you saying hpmor's universe rules made sense? They didn't, at all! There is even that scene with the bats where Harry tries to do experiments and none of the results neatly collapse into any sort of reductionist model.
#+end_quote

I didn't read the whole story (got bored), but I remember the scene with the bats. The idea I got from that scene was that consistent rules existed, but the protagonist was simply unable to find them. Do they ever revisit this experiment and find them? I don't know. But the idea I get from Unsong is that there are no strong consistent rules, and the characters don't expect them to exist, and the universe is just trolling you at every step. This is a matter of /feeling/ rather than an objective assessment, and you're free to disagree.

#+begin_quote
  You might consider this a rational fanfiction of Judaic mythology (the same way hpmor is a rational fanficiton of harry potter)
#+end_quote

I would agree if the text was faithful to the Torah, the Bible, the Book of Revelations or something else. Actually, you have a comet impregnate a girl with a fast developing baby that becomes some kind of Kabballah master who builds a crazy ship and besieges Hell, placebomancy that seems to work (it powers one of the sails of said ship), and an ascended astronaut that communicates with people through LSD. These things are revealed gradually, approximately one per chapter, and without apparent rhyme or reason, so you can't even argue that a consistent universe is established from the start. This is a guided tour through an original imaginary universe, and it is not consistent.

#+begin_quote
  At no point in Unsong are violations of the rational genre just quietly part of the background, each so-called violation is loud and intentional and explained by meta principles which aren't actually in violation.
#+end_quote

If you invoke enough meta principles to explain each inconsistency, you get something that is indistinguishable from inconsistency.

I didn't have time to read your link, but it looks good and I'll look into it.

Again, you raise some good points, but I still stand by my original assessment. Thanks for your detailed response.
