  There is even that scene with the bats where Harry tries to do experiments and none of the results neatly collapse into any sort of reductionist model.

No, they just don't fit a reductionist model /discovered by Harry in the first day of experimenting./

One of Harry's character flaws is that he expects the world's problems to be easily solved by the first rationalist wizard to come along ... and that he expects this /first rationalist wizard/ is himself.

He persists in this delusion even after being given the diary of Roger Bacon, which is first-class evidence that a rationalist wizard lived in the 13th century. He exhibits no subsequent curiosity about Bacon and makes no effort to learn Latin in order to read the diary.

Basically, Harry systematically fails to notice confusions that would lead to the conclusion of his own non-uniqueness, particularly the existence of other rationalist or scientifically-minded wizards prior to himself.

(For instance, he expects that economic strategies that would be available to the first rationalist wizard to come along --- such as arbitrage between the Muggle and wizarding economies --- will be available to him. If he were reasoning clearly about wizard/Muggle history, he would recognize that the fact that this exploit isn't being used is pretty good evidence that it doesn't work.)

(On the other hand, he /is/ eleven years old.)
