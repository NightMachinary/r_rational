  No, they just don't fit a reductionist model discovered by Harry in the first day of experimenting.

That's what I meant by "neatly". The reader never gets the satisfaction of a tidy model, and that's okay because that matches real life.

(Also, your criticisms stand but I don't think the author of HPMOR necessarily intended that reading: because 13th century was pre-isolation-and-stagnation, also because there were prophecies fortelling Harry's uniqueness, also because Harry continuously /did/ find exploits that worked, also he would have spent that money to save her even if he wasn't certain so that's not evidence of overconfidence.

As an aside, and this is a lesson I've learned from personal experience: always remember to at least /check/ to make sure the clever exploit you thought of doesn't in fact work before concluding that it doesn't for that reason.)
