I'm pretty sure the author has explicitly stated more than once he does not consider it Rational or Rationalist fiction. It gets posted and discussed because even if it's not rational fiction, it's certainly rational-adjacent fiction. Our traffic isn't very high, so it's not like it's bumping content off the front page or anything. I don't consider it a problem.
