FWIW, I agree with you. I expect (and hope) that the majority of works posted here fall somewhere on the spectrum of rational works, but the /occasional/ deviation from that is alright, so long as it's both high quality and in the set of things I might like if I like rational fiction.

It's not really something that I think we /want/ to police, because there are debates to be had about what is and is not rational fiction (as seen in this post and numerous conversations on this subreddit). We do occasionally police it though, because if we just didn't police it /at all/ then the subreddit would start to shift in such a way that the label and focus would become muddied.
