  This falls into the more general mistake of "not realising that UNSONG booby trapped the Moon-Finding Name"; there's no reason for Aaron to hide from the Sentinel Name if he doesn't think they can track the Names he's using.

I'm going to assume that you can program a blacklist of known names into Llull, which Aaron is not said to be doing but which is commons sense. You don't need to suspect a booby trap. You just need to suspect that Unsong might be sitting on some secret names, and that some of those names might be important enough to have dedicated sentinels actively looking for them. While I'm sure invoking the "Wakening Name" or the "Paint My House Blue Name" won't attract their attention, invoking something like the "Spectral Name" will (if Unsong knows about it, of course). The safest defense against this attack seems to be to start Llull away from major population centers, where Unsong won't probably be able to afford sentinels. And Aaron isn't only in a major population center, he is in a city with a high concentration of Theonomic companies Unsong might be listening to.

  Not thinking about the deeper implications of ensouling a computer
#+end_quote

This is something Aaron and Ana don't even discuss prior to ensouling the computer. In fact, this is so out of character that I have trouble imagining that they are acting on their own free will. Come on, Ana is studying theodicy and doesn't even comment on giving a soul to a machine? Would that allow the machine to go to Hell? There are some reasonable anti-natalist arguments in Unsong... They must apply when ensouling a machine, right?

  few of the readers were seriously considering that possibility either
#+end_quote

It's in the beginning of the story, which by the way starts /in media res/, so we are naturally quite confused in the beginning. I, for example, was expecting a corporate story about disrupting the monopoly of the Theonomic companies, which happened to cause the apocalypse.

And of course, by now Aaron knows that Sarah showed up on Ana's desk and disappeared afterwards. the possibility should have occurred to him during the telepathic conversation. He hasn't had a lot of time to think about it yet, but if by next chapter he hasn't considered the possibility, then he is either being stupid or mind-controlled

Of course, we might still be wrong about Sarah, but it is a possibility I think Aaron should have thought of.
