  Using Llull in a densely populated area, potentially in range of Unsong's tattooed goons

This falls into the more general mistake of "not realising that UNSONG booby trapped the Moon-Finding Name"; there's no reason for Aaron to hide from the Sentinel Name if he doesn't think they can track the Names he's using.

  Not thinking about the deeper implications of ensouling a computer (namely that Sarah might be acting on her own)
#+end_quote

We have access to evidence that Aaron doesn't. Until Sarah showed up on Ana's desk, few of the readers were seriously considering that possibility either. The Vital Name that gives a soul isn't the same as the Names that create golems; we didn't think Sarah was going to start walking around of her own volition.
