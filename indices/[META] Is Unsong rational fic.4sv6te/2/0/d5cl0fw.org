  The only aspect of the story I've found irrational to the point of interfering with my enjoyment of it was Aaron's behavior. Granted, a stupid protagonist is a pretty bad offense

I can think of 4 major mistakes:

- Using Llull in a densely populated area, potentially in range of Unsong's tattooed goons

- Trying to get inside Ithaca without thinking first. He might be acting in the heat of the moment, but I consider this one inexcusable.

- Not thinking about the deeper implications of ensouling a computer (namely that Sarah might be acting on her own)

- Not being suspicious of the fact that the ensouling name was discovered accidentally by someone who is probably the only one sweatshop worker that is able to memorize it after saying it only once. Strangely, he does not remark that "This is not a coincidence"...

I don't consider major mistakes the following:

- /Not giving a random seed to Llull/ - Unsong's attack is really clever, and a whole level of paranoia. Note that for this to work, Unsong must keep a high populational density men with the Moon Finding named tatooed on their foreheads, while keeping the whole project a secret (amnesic name, maybe?) and while keeping the name iteself secret, lest it would become useless. I like to think that I'd have thought of the possibility were I Aaron, but it's a comprehensible mistake.

- /Hiding the purple dragon/ - We have reasons to trust Jane (she has a flying kayak, so we know she's probably related to the Comet King, etc.). Aaron doesn't. Jane's been threatening before. I disagree with his course of action but I don't think it is that stupid.

On the other hand, he does some pretty amazing things:

- He's a good mnemonist

- He is a klipot expert

- He figures out Unsong's attack very quickly

- He escapes Malia Ngo

- He finds his way around the Angel library pretty quickly

And all of this in about two days! So, while the obvious mistakes are certainly annoying, I'd call him smart but impulsive and na√Øve, not stupid. YMMV, though ;)
