The only aspect of the story I've found irrational to the point of interfering with my enjoyment of it was Aaron's behavior. Granted, a stupid protagonist is a pretty bad offense, but the fact that there are so many different plot threads dampens that a lot. Aside from some stupid characters, I think Unsong qualifies as rational, regardless of what Scott says. Having absurd things happening like the number eight being down doesn't make it less so, it only underlines the fact that this is not a world running on mathematical laws of physics (those were just part of Uriel's VM). Of course birds can fly, God created them to fly. Airplanes, on the other hand, depended on physics and those are going out of commission. That is consistent, it just relies on a twisted sort of logic which is hard to grasp.

Thamiel and the Angels are a simply a matter of artificial beings created with very specific values. Thamiel's utility function is fulfilled by punishing people and he does so with horrible efficiency. That's what he values, and his actions are directed by that.
