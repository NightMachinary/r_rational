You make some of the same points as [[/u/ishaan123]] regarding consistency, and my response is the same. I think that extreme weirdness and arbitrary rules, even if you can invoke some vague meta-principles, are indistinguishable from inconsistency, but I can certainly understand your point of view.

I agree with your point on Thamiel and the Angels - they are artificial beings and can have artificial values without breaking suspension of belief.
