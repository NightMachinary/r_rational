Thanks for warning me. I come to this subreddit for rational fiction and discussion of it in literature. I was going to start reading it soon, but thanks to this discussion I understand it's not now.

Personally, as someone recently (last 6 mos) introduced to the rational subreddit, and I know we don't have much going on here, I think the sub would benefit more by not having it. That's because its very presence on the front page here so often indicates its 'rationality' if you will.
