No, I don't think it is. I don't have a problem with that, except to the extent that irrational elements detract from my enjoyment of /any/ work of fiction. I would also prefer that people not read Unsong as though it were trying to be rational fiction, because that almost certainly gets you a less enjoyable reading of the text.
