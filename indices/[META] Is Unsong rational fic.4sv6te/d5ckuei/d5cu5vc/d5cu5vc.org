I don't think any angels are acting rationally when they're just pretty much drunkards when they fall. They don't try to find ways to become inspired again.

I'm also not sure whether one can call pure evil or pure good rational.

God is acting irrationally, depending on what his goals are. Metatron, as an angel, is certainly acting irrationally since he should be helping in the war and talking would probably help.
