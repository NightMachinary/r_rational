I think /that/ would be a mistake, though. I think there is, and should be, quite a high barrier-to-entry for nonrational fic, and even though there's a bit of doublethink and doubletalk around Unsong-vs-other-stuff, I believe it's the optimal way forward.

If we put the statement you suggested into the sidebar, then nonrational stuff becomes (part of) the rule, rather than the exception. In a sense, I think Scott "earned" the right to have people on the subreddit give his story a /first/ look, and I wouldn't want a bunch of other fiction being given that same privilege. Like, I'd rather /not/ have to decide whether or not to click on a bunch of nonrational stories when I'm on this subreddit; I'd rather that choice come up like once a year or whatever than once a week.

Me, personally. Note that I've got nothing to do with the maintenance of [[/r/rational][r/rational]]; I'm just a board member and not even a particularly active one at that.
