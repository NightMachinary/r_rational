It's not a rational story. Its presence on this board is correct.

There used to be huge debates in the parkour/freerunning community about whether parkour and freerunning were the same thing, and whether flips were parkour. Those debates were interesting, and worth having, but they overlooked the key point, which was that *people who enjoy one almost always enjoy the other, too.*

Unsong is an irrational story, but its one that consumers of rationalist fiction are extremely likely to enjoy. If we look at it as a slippery slope, then it's out of place here. But I prefer to see it as that one high-quality video full of flips that gets consistently upvoted even though the subreddit is dedicated to parkour.
