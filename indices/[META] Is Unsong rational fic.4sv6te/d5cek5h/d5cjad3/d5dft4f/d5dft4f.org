  One of Harry's character flaws is that he expects the world's problems to be easily solved by the first rationalist wizard to come along ... and that he expects this first rationalist wizard is himself.

You need to distinguish "the character is supposed to be arrogant within the context of the story" and "the character is supposed to be justified within the context of the story, but he actually isn't, so when you look at the character realistically, he's arrogant".

This is especially a problem when the character is an author mouthpiece.
