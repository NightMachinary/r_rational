Admittedly, in real life physical laws take a long time to be discovered because precise experiments are hard to do, consistent mathematics to process the data is hard to develop, and approximate intuitive theories for getting around in the world are very easy to learn.

I imagine that if you could change stuff into other stuff by willpower, science might get easier in some ways.
