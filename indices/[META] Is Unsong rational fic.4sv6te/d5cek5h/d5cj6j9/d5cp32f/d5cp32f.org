The characters of the witches are definitely rationalist in some of the stories. Their powers are described in one of the books that follow a new witch-in-training called Tiffany Aching as:

1. First sight, i.e. seeing what is really there as opposed to what you expect or want to see. You could argue that all knowledge depends on accurate observation.

2. Second thoughts, i.e. self-reflection and analysis of why you think what you think. This maps nicely onto knowledge of biases and how to overcome them.

They also have a lot more scientific knowledge than most people (the example I can think of off the top of my head is knowledge of germs).

However, this isn't consistently followed. Compare /A Hat Full of Sky/'s witches with those from /Equal Rites/, and those in /Lords and Ladies/. Early Diskworld characters are very different to those from later on, as the world matures and roles and niches become more developed, so at best parts of some of the stories are rational.

Vetinari is also fairly rational, but more in a calculating and efficient way where he avoids a lot of inefficiencies rather than any deep self-analysis or overcoming of his personal flaws.
