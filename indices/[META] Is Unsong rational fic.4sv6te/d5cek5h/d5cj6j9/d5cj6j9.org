  in every instance where it departs from rationality it does so in a self-aware manner.

Interestingly, while Discworld doesn't /completely/ fit this, if we apply this self-awareness rule then it looks more rational than eg. Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, even though its setting is sillier. Many of the main characters - eg. Vimes, Vetinari, Granny - are basically rationalists.
