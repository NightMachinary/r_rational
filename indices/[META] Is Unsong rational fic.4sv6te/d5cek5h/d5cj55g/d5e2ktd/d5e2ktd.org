Okay, so I see several people in this thread saying this but: *a universe cannot be rational / irrational / arational*. Rationality is a feature of /agents/, not universes. According to a rationalist worldview, if you think the universe is weird, inelegant, inconsistent, or not intuitive, that's a problem with /you/, not the universe. (See: people's initial reaction to quantum mechanics for a real world example of people making this mistake).

The rationalist worldview assumes /axiomatically/ that at least one consistent explanation of everything must exist. If the answer really is "God believes in the power of love and he seems to be watching and micromanaging stuff" you can still, in principle, explain God's internal workings using math. If the power of love heals things, /that's totally fine/ - but, you can still explain it using math. The universe can be as crazy as it wants to be - you can still put a rational agent in it that says "fine, I can still try to find the simplest possible mathematical model to describe this". And UNSONG's universe /is/ math, because Uriel, simulations / emulations, etc etc.

That's why I think the attitude of the narrator and characters, and not the setup of the universe itself, is what really matters for the genre. Of course, you can choose a different defining criteria if you like, that's just semantics. But saying that universes can be "irrational" even in principle - that's more than semantics.
