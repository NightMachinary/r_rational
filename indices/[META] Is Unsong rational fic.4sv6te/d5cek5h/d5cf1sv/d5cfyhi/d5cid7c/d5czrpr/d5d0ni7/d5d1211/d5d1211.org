I feel there's a difference between interludes, cutscenes essentially, and main chapters. You can show flashbacks to past eras where you blackbox the spells, and that's fine, but it'd be more of an issue if you did it in the main chapters. If there were unknown spells that determined the character's fates and they had no real way to untangle them then the story would be less rational but flashbacks don't need the same depth.

We know from the wrathful name that some names have the power of hydrogen bombs. That seems like more than enough firepower to kill a bunch of demons.

Plus, it depends on how you intend to have the main character solve their issues. Are they just going to bumble from one issue to another till Uriel fixes everything? Are they going to accomplish their goals via use of their magic? Is some random circumstance going to resolve the plot? Are the difficulties between the protagonists and Unsong going to all turn out to be communication issues that could be resolved with a good long chat?

We know enough about names and logic to anticipate the story somewhat. It could be rational- that's up to you.
