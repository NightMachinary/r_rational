I don't think being cheeky about the points where your story is story-like instead of reality-like is enough, nor is saying "the world runs on story logic".

If I put a chapter at the beginning of the Harry Potter series (or any series) which explained that characters were all affected by brain parasites that caused them to behave in irrational, story-based ways, then proceeded to tell the story exactly as Rowling (or whoever) told it, would you call that rational fiction? I certainly wouldn't.
