Taking Eliezer's Fun Theory sequence into account, I think Good and Bad are both bad. I actually haven't read it yet, but being forced to pray or be tortured is still bad.

Thamiel is the duality of god, and both sides seem evil to me. Therefore, god is evil.

Think about it: Uriel's Science is the Goodest thing that happened. People's lives are worse off with Science broken.

Also, Scott has definitely read that sequence, and likewise is taking it into account.
