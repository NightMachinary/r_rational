Here's some stories that I've read over the past week which I enjoyed. I know some of these have been recommended on this sub in the past but I ignored them for one reason or another until now and figured others may have as well:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13002064/1/A-Young-Woman-s-Political-Record][A Young Woman's Political Record]] (seconding [[/u/Robert_Barlow][u/Robert_Barlow]] above)\\
[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/][Break them All]] - basically just munchkining a magic system\\
[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/][Dungeon Keeper Ami]] - read this without knowing the supporting works... it has its faults but it does what it's trying to do well\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/13168/fork-this-life][Fork this Life]] - Isekai'd as a fork. Silly premise but transforms into a neat exploration of the world & magic systems

Less rational works, but still tentatively recommend:\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human][Post Human]] - Human turned AI. Unpolished but some good ideas\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23290/deeper-darker][Deeper Darker]] - fun romp, space opera, great (but somewhat inconsistent) characterization\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24241/sundered-soul-a-cultivation-wuxiaxianxia-novel][Sundered Soul]] - YA western-style xanxia\\
[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24203/homicidal-aliens-are-invading-and-all-i-got-is][Homicidal Aliens are Invading and All I've Got is This Stat Menu]] - early days yet but the premise is that two aliens societies are fighting and in order to protect / co-opt help, some humans on earth are given special powers

I recommend ff2ebook.com for getting ebooks off fanfiction.net and [[http://fanficfare.appspot.com][fanficfare]] for scraping forums and turning them into ebooks.
