You decide upfront that "should X happen I will /definitely/ do Y, no matter what." Even if it seems like a bad idea at the time X actually happens. If you reliably stick to it then you can make deals in which your opposition knows you will not respond to any bribes or threats. There are other applications, but the only ones I can think of require currently impossible events to happen.
