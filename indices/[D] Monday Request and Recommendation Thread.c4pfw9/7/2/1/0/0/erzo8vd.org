Yeah there was a scene in /Waves Arisen/ where Naruto decided to never commit a very specific action ever again, and that was taken as precommitment when he really was just doing regular commitment with nothing actually preventing him from doing the same thing all over again.

It bothers me too when people confuse commitment with precommitment.
