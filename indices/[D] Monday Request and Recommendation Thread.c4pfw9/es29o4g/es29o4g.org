[[https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/Lord-of-the-Mysteries][Lord of the Mysteries]]: a translated-from-Chinese webnovel that I've been recommended recently and found quite good. The translation quality is average but the few issues I have with it doesn't distract from the plot at all.

You can find the premium chapters available on Boxnovel.

The setting is based in a steampunk early Industrial Revolution Europe and mixing in inspirations from the SCP Foundation, Cthulhu mythos and the video game Bloodborne, with plenty of dark elements you'll expect such as monster-derived alchemy, murderous cults and cannibalism. The writer is pretty good at foreshadowing and has written multiple successful series before on Qidian (Chinese equivalent of Royal Road).
