I haven't come across this one before, thanks. ETA: ohh it's a Greg Vader prequel

Interestingly, I was going to recommend a different Work/Gamer fic: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/][A Bad Name]]. I guess stories in which you can artificially increase your intelligence would be more ripe for this sort of thing.
