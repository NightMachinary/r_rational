[[https://invislib.blogspot.com/][The Invisible Library]] is a "catalog of books that exist only within other books". Wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_books][list of fictional books]] provides even more such examples.

A recommendation on cities: since you like Unfamiliar City travel guides and things that claim being real without actually being real, check out [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9809.Invisible_Cities][Invisible Cities]] by Italo Calvino.
