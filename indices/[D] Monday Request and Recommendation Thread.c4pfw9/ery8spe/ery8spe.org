Have you encountered any fictional libraries? That is: libraries that do not exist, but claim to, which contain books that do not exist, but should?

I'm looking for something like Suricrasia Online's Online Library [[https://suricrasia.online/library/]] or my own [[https://irradiate.space/library/]] (inspired by Suricrasia's)
