/Strange Bodies/ by Marcel Theroux is roughly what you're looking for. An operation is developed that can bring the mind of an ~18th century person into a living 21st-century body. It's a very weird book and takes a while to get to the point, but pretty interesting.

Also, /The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O./ by Neal Stephenson has a marvelous character who (minor spoilers) is the last living witch, having used her last spell to enchant herself to age much slower than normal in order to live long enough to access the technology necessary to resuscitate magic.

EDIT: Also also, /Anathem/ by Stephenson has characters who have been cloistered in their monastery/university for their whole lives and/or multiple generations, who get exposed to the modern culture of the story (which is roughly Earth-analogous, but is not Earth). It's also one of the best sci-fi adventures ever written, I'd say on par with Dune.
