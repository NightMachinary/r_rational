I think it was very well foreshadowed in chapter 4 (I think, or whichever one was the first symmetra chapter). It may have stood out for readers not used to looking for foreshadowing or reading rational fiction but it was excellent.

Im about halfway through and the character interactions are so fantastic. They feel real and using Winston's social anxiety is perfect for deconstructing dialogue and getting characters to talk about why they act or feel the way they do in a way that IS show dont tell.

100% recommend this to anyone even slightly interested in the premise.

Fridge horror is the best horror imo.
