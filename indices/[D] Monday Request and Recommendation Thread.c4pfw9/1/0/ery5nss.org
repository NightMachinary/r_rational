  Countless close calls, just like this one, he realized. Bombs, for sure. Dozens of them. So lucky, that they'd all had just enough concussive force to knock him out without doing lasting structural damage. A vat of molten iron, once. Several face-to-barrel encounters with Reaper's shotguns. Why was Amel- Widowmaker so fond of mysteriously self-destructing tranquilizer rounds?
