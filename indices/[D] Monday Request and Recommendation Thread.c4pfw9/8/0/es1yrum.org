Saga of Recluse, Wheel of Time, Incarnations of Immortality, Deathgate Cycle, Vlad Taltos, Robin Hobb's Assassin trilogy & sequels, Dresden Files, Discworld, Harrison's Hollows, Garrett PI

Sci fi but that read like fantasy and are well worth it: Vorkosigan saga, Theirs Not To Reason Why, Sten Chronicles, Solar Clipper series

Should be enough for a couple of months ðŸ˜Š
