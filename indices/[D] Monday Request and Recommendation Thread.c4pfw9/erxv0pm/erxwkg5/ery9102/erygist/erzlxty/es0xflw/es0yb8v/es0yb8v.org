There was a bit at the very beginning about the different patterns of outside societies and the different ways to manipulate them in response, which made me think that the monasteries were good at social engineering and were inclined to treat the outside in a reductionist fashion. I remember that there was a ten tiered punishment system with one of the earlier tiered punishments being memorizing the digits of pi, and it was sometimes used on acolytes for internal political reasons. I remember that acolytes made all their friends on the inside and that leaving was considered analogous to dying. That nobody cares about the outside world bolsters this point - that's not a natural state of affairs. IIRC, wasn't the explicit reason for the monastery system to isolate geniuses from the levers of power so they could not destroy the world?
