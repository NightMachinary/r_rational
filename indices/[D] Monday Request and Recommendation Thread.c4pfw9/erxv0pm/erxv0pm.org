I want to recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149][The World As It Appears To Be]]. It's a rational Overwatch fanfic by the guy who wrote Cordyceps. Haven't seen it linked or recommended in a while now. Of course it ignores characters or story stuff that hadn't been revealed by Blizzard at the time this fanfic got into its stride, but that shouldn't really matter.

In return I am looking for a recommendation for a time travel or crossover fic in which an /intelligent/ character finds himself transported into (and confronted with) a world more advanced than his own. Preferably said world should not be much more advanced that current IRL. The basic idea is that I want to see something approaching the typical knight gets ported to current day city kind of situation but not, you know, dumb. And because this is niche I am of course willing to read it even if fantasy elements are involved and/or the time jump from 19th->21st to neolithic->classical age or anything in between or fantasy/magical equivalent.
