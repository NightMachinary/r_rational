I'm looking for a book or series that I can sink my teeth into, and will last me for a while. I'll read and enjoy most types of fiction though my preferences have been leaning closer to magic than sci-fi as of late.

I've read Worm, Pact, and Twig though i'm having trouble getting invested enough to binge Ward.

I've also read HPMoR, MOL, PGtE etc.

Growing up I enjoyed series like Dragonriders of Pern, Xanth, Eragon, Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter.

I've tried to read the Malazan book of the fallen but I could not for the life of me get past the first book. I'm fine with stories that have a lot of characters, I enjoy Stephen Kings writing after all, but nothing clicked to make me really engage.

Thoughts?
