Yeah, you know how with a lot of fantasy books people will say "eh, it's a bit of a slog but yeah it gets good on page 50"

Homestuck gets *tolerable* around panel 500 and it gets good around panel 2000

But there's a whole... experience, when you zoom out far enough and see the insane /scale/ of this endeavor, and then you're hooked.
