The Recluce books by Modesitt were good. There are a bunch of them too. Fantasy in most books, but some of the books have heavy science and industry elements.

Sanderson has written a lot of good books, but his superhero fiction bored me to tears, though I know some people like it.

Weeks's Black Prism series is a solid series as well.
