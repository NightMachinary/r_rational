I figured it had to be pretty quick, because all of those vote interrupts were definitely quick. I believe the author waits a little longer for the more significant choices, too. The numbers were higher when they were doing the vote for whether or not to burn Zuko - it was a good seventy people, whereas earlier and later it rarely reached forty total. It's fudging the numbers a bit, but given how much that choice dug the players own graves, I'd have been hesitant closing it too soon as well.
