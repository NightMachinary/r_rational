No, I don't think so. Quite the opposite, actually--the outside world has all sorts of false stories about what goes on in the monasteries, but the monasteries don't really concern themselves with what goes on outside. To the point where they don't keep track of what the dominant form of government is, instead calling whoever's in charge "panjandrums" as a catch-all for "whoever those dummies have picked to rule them these days." In fact, the whole point of the monasteries is to shut out what goes on outside, so spreading propaganda would defeat the purpose.
