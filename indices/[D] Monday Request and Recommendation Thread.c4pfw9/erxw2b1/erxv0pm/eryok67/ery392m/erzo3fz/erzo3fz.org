There's /some/ mention of it in the Skulduggery Pleasant series. It's YA fiction, but surprisingly dark - just not explicitly so. Elemental magic is one of the main disciplines and what the main character and her mentor use throughout almost the whole series. The writing starts off good (quite funny) and gets better and deeper as time goes on.

There's also Codex Alera. I've no real idea how much munchkinning there is in the series since I've only just started reading, but it's a long running high fantasy series with elemental magic as one of the sole abilities, so it's probably bound to have some.

The magic takes the form of spirits that someone can bind to themselves, and the spirits are aligned with one the the six elements (the standard 4, plus wood and metal). It's written by Jim Butcher and IIRC the original premise when he started writing was "what if the Roman Empire had Pokemon?".
