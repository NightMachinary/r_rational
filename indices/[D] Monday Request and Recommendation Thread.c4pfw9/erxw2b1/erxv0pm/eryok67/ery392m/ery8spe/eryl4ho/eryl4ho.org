Maybe not exactly what you were looking for but the [[https://libraryofbabel.info][Library of Babel]] was inspired by Jorge Luis Borges essay - "[[https://www.gwern.net/docs/borges/1939-borges-thetotallibrary.pdf][The Total Library]]" (pdf).

Borges's imagined library contains not only every book ever written, but every book that could be written, every book-length combination of characters in every possible sequence.

Like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem][infinite monkey theorem]], one could find there among the infinite amount of gibberish writing all the wisdom of mankind.
