hat Library of Babel is interesting, but it is sadly not what I am looking for. I guess I'm looking for things that exist in our reality, claiming to be a library without being one, presenting books that do not exist in this reality. The library itself is a fiction. Rather than delving into generic possibilities as that Library of Babel does, it dives into specific possibilities.

The sort of library that I imagine is to real libraries what Mouse Reeve's [[https://unfamiliar.city/][Unfamiliar City]] is to real travel guides.
