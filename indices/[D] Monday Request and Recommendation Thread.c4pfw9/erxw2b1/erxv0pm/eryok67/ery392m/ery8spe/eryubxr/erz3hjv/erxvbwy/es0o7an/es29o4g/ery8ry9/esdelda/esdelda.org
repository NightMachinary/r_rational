I strongly suggest David Baldacci's 'Memory Man.'

Rational, not rationalist.

Detective fiction. Shades of Singularity human memory capacity, but people with the gifts and issues he has do exist in the real world.

I have been pleasantly surprised to be able to logically stay one step ahead of the protagonist, based on what the protagonist himself discovers. While at the same time the author isn't making it entirely obvious exactly what is going on. I am currently five hours from the end of the audio book, and I /think/ I know who the guilty persons are, but I am not entirely certain.

If the author Deus Ex's the story, I will be sure to return and burn this recommendation to the ground tomorrow.

EDIT ADD: Finished the audiobook. I was wrong about who I thought the antagonist was.

There was a little more data hiding in the end of the book than the first half, but still enjoyable.

Decker's mental abilities, issues, and quirks make him a lot like a pseudo Sherlock Holmes, but the author provides the readers a lot more information than Doyle does, as far as I can remember.

EDIT ADD 2:

Upon further thought, I am going to continue to recommend this as a good read, with some good rational aspects, but the rational parts are more directed at eliminating suspects than solving the mystery. While this is, in fact, how a lot of real police work is done, the final chase and resolution are marred (in a rational reading sense) by quite a few instances of the author hiding behind the main character's psychological quirks to keep the reader from knowing what he is thinking.

I am more than a little convinced that an editor requested/required a major rewrite of the last half of the book to change the primary antagonist from the character I had pegged, to another character which only makes an appearance directly in the last half of the book.

TLDR: Fun read, but less rational overall than the first half of the book led me to believe.
