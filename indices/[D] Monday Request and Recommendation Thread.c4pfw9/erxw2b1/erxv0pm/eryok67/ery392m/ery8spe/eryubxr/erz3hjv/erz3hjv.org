If you have read Dresden Files and Worm I would highly recommend [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-high-priest-worm-dresden-files.752524/][The High Priest.]] It is a fanfiction crossover where Eidolon gets transmigrated to the Dresden universe post Echnida arc. The key to this fanfiction is the spot on characterization. Mischaracterization is a huge turn off to me where canon characters are turning into OCs but the author of this fanfic has it on lock. I would say its rational-adjacent due to the fact that certain higher powers in the Dresden universe are acting how they should toward Eidolon. It's ongoing and the last chapter was left on a real big cliffhanger that I can't wait to see how it unfolds.

While I'm here I am getting really addicted to fanfiction crossovers where a canon character from a higher tier 'power level' is transmigrated into another canon universe. Any recs?
