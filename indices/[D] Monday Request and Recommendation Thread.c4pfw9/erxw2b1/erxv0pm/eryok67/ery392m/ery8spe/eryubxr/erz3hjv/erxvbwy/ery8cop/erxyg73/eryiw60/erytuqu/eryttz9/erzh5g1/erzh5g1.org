Actually, you have described regular commitment.

Sorry, but this is a really annoying common misconception to me. If you tell someone else "if X, I will Y" then that's just something people do. And, a lot of the time, there's no reason beyond "I said I would" to actually do Y once X has happened. This means that Y, if it costs both people something, isn't a very credible threat.

For example: We're partners in crime for a bank heist. I took a much larger fraction of the loot than you did, so you threaten to go to the cops unless we share the gains equally. But I refuse, because I know you don't want to go to prison yourself, and so will probably not actually follow through.

Precommitment requires that you are somehow forced to do the (often mutually-bad) thing if/unless some condition is met. So, a dead man's switch in case of betrayal would be a good example. This removes the point of choice, where you have to decide to follow through with whatever you said you would do.

Saying that you will follow through is, to put it bluntly, not actually something that will guarantee you follow through. It's a mildly recurring problem in worse ratfic I've read, so please don't think that I'm angry at you - but I really hate this misconception that deciding you will do something is a game-theoretic superpower.
