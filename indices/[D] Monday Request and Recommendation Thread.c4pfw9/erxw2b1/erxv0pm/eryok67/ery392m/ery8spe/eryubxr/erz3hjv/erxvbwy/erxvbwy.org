I have three requests.

One: Works describing pre-commitment and how to use it effectively.

Two: Works where characters use pre-commitment to achieve their goals. I have read TNtBS, Waves Arisen, and HPMOR.

Three: Works where antagonists either use pre-commitment themselves, or use the protagonists pre-commitment against them.
