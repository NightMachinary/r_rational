Are there any fictional stories or biographical works where the protagonist goes from being significantly psychologically impaired to being significantly above average in only a few years, without using any unrealistic cheats/magic to do it? Maybe through some kind of combination of the following factors:

1. getting the right help and educational resources and friends/supports at the right times
2. improvements to diet/exercise/medication
3. high stakes: if they don't overcome their psychological impairments and become more skilled than the average person and do so as fast as they can, then they will totally and permanently fail at life

I'm trying to figure out if there are any examples in the world at all of people either real or fictional who fit this description besides myself and any self insert characters I write. So far google isn't helping me at all.

Thanks!
