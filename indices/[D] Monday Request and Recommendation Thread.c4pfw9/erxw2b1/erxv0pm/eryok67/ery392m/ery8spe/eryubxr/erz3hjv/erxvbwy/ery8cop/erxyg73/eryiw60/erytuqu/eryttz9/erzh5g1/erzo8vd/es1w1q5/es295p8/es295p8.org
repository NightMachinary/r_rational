The importance of this varies. Odysseus/The "giving the designated driver your keys" example point out the advantages - if you know when and why you need something strongly binding, you can come up with something that'll do the job.

In some other cases, just making a promise (publicly) might do the job. (In chess, I might say, if you move your knight here, I won't take it with my bishop. And then if they move there, I take it with my queen or something.)
