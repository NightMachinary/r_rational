[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/][A Daring Synthesis]] is a Worm/Gamer fic which does exactly this. It's actually really, really good, with multiple people in the thread describing it as the best fic they've read on spacebattles. It makes use of symbolism and themes, which is a bar I haven't actually seen many fanfics reach.
