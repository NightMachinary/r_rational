Fair enough, I can see where you're coming from and I did miss that part of your request. But! I think there's still some self-improvement in these sorts of things, if only in that the character realized their faults, wants to fix them, and puts in practice a plan to do so. But I can see, as someone who bettered themselves the 'hard' way, why that might be less than appealing.

I am drawing a blank on anything I can recommend. If other people are equally unhelpful, I would look to lists such as the following to give you a start: [[https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/10086.Mental_Illness_in_Fiction][Goodreads' Mental Illness in Fiction]].
