Speaking of looking for works with precommitment, have you considered gambling manga?

I'm a little busy right now and soon I will likely won't be able to access a computer for a few days and can't look up any examples for you, but I remember manga like /Kaiji and Gamble Fish/ had the protagonist perform precommitments where he was guaranteed to commit an action that forces his opponents to fold and lose the game instead of taking a greater loss.

I can't name any specific examples, but I know stuff like that comes up every so often in gambling stories.
