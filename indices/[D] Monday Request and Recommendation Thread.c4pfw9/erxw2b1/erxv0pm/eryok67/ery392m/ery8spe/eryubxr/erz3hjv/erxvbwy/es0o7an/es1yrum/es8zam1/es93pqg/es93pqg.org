It always blew my mind that Card could write such great books about understanding and valuing the Other then actively try to hurt people he didn't understand.

That being said, the whole premise of Speaker for the Dead always bothered me. You're telling me that funeral rites /weren't/ practically the first thing any self respecting alien paleontologist would study?? They give huge insights into the culture, religion, morality etc. Etc. of the cultures they come from!
