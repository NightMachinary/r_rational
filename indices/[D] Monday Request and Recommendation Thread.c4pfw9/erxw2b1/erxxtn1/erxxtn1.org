  Non-Worm stuff: more quests! I went into the Discord and asked for recommendations, which they kindly gave to me. I'm still working through some of them, but I did manage to finish one. Deep Red is an Avatar: The Last Airbender quest where the players control an OC older sister to Zuko and Azula, named Akane. The writing in this story is unparalleled for quests, which is why it's a shame that the players are dumb as bricks. The voting goes on somewhere other than Sufficient Velocity, I think, and the author just posts the finished chapters there. But wherever they are, the voters seem to have a very heavy bias for and against certain characters, which leads to predictably bad results. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes, and I'm really happy that the author seems willing to punish the players for acting too stupid, but I'm concerned about the impact that will have on the pacing. It already feels like an arc has been cut too short because of their actions, and I can only imagine what that means for the future.

The site in question is fiction.live, which used to be called anonkun I think. It's definitely lower quality than SV, and there's a lot of porn, and the site has some pretty janky/terrible design the owner refuses to fix or allow other people to fix. That said, the basic idea of the posting system does make it easy to churn out quick posts and quests, as I described in the Deep Red SV thread:

  Whilst I mostly agree with you, for all its faults fiction.live does let a QM churn out their content at a pretty high rate, with fast votes being called and resolved quickly to help move things along. In a less serious quest where you just want people to decide how many hats your wizard is going to steal from the defeated gnome warriors before moving on, having an answer in 60 seconds (5, strapped to your head and beard in a pentagonal format to boost your demonology stat, obviously) is much more convenient.
