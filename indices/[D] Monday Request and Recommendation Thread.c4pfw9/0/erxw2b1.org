Alright. I've been busy reading a lot these last few weeks, so I've got a few stories to recommend. First and foremost, if you're not reading [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/][/A Young Woman's Political Record/]] you should be. It's been recommended here before, but I can vouch for its quality even if you haven't read/watched /Youjo Senki/. Very funny, a neat piece of alt-history fiction if you can get past the silly names for all the countries, and generally deserving of the popularity it's gathered.

I've been reading a lot of Worm fanfiction, again. I read through that one Gamer!Greg story I told myself I wouldn't ever read, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/greg-veder-vs-the-world-worm-the-gamer.601118/][/Greg Veder vs. The World/.]] It's okay for a gamer story. The power level is only just really starting to escalate to ridiculous levels. Somebody mentioned that the Lung fight was the best in recent memory, but I personally think the fight scenes in the last few chapters have bloated the story and really slowed it down. Other than that, it's okay.

[[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/][/Nemesis/]] by BeaconHill is still excellent. I'm really loving the premise, and showing the contrast between Taylor's utilitarian practice sessions and the actual silly results is a stroke of genius. It's goofy and I love it.

[[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/magical-girl-escalation-taylor-worm-nanoha.28074/][/Magical Girl Escalation Taylor/]] is a Worm/Nanoha quest that's taking entirely too long to get to the interesting crossover bits. It's finally starting to ramp up in that regard. The first arcs were a little stiff, but after the story moves to Philadelphia it really grows into its own. I think by trying to emulate Wildbow's method of building an ensemble cast (different gangs with different motives, all thrown into one place and given something to fight over) the author became better at writing Wildbow characters in general. The highlight of this quest for me was the After Action Reports the author creates at the end of each arc. I've never seen something like it done in a quest before, and it really opens up a new avenue of communication between the GM and the players. In them, the author tells the players what they did wrong, what choices were dead ends or red herrings, and on occasion, how they exceeded expectations. I really hope this is a device that more authors pick up on and use. I'm definitely going to keep it in mind if I ever write a quest.

Non-Worm stuff: more quests! I went into the Discord and asked for recommendations, which they kindly gave to me. I'm still working through some of them, but I did manage to finish one. [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/][/Deep Red/]] is an Avatar: The Last Airbender quest where the players control an OC older sister to Zuko and Azula, named Akane. The writing in this story is unparalleled for quests, which is why it's a shame that the players are dumb as bricks. The voting goes on /somewhere/ other than Sufficient Velocity, I think, and the author just posts the finished chapters there. But wherever they are, the voters seem to have a very heavy bias for and against certain characters, which leads to predictably bad results. I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes, and I'm really happy that the author seems willing to punish the players for acting too stupid, but I'm concerned about the impact that will have on the pacing. It already feels like an arc has been cut too short because of their actions, and I can only imagine what that means for the future.

Finally, I think I'll talk about [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum][/The Simulacrum/]], because it's something that's been posted to the subreddit before. The premise is that the main character is in a world strangely reminiscent of a generic harem battle anime, without any memories of how he got there. I really feel like this story squandered the potential of the introduction and the first few chapters. First of all, the fact that it's strangely reminiscent of a generic harem battle anime is a problem because in order for those tropes to be recognizable, the characters and worldbuilding need to be as generic as possible. But instead of leveraging this unreality to do something /cool/, the story and the protagonist just sort of forget about it and thrive within the system. The whole "we're in a fictional universe" thing is mostly put on the back-burner until the protagonist wants to hang a lampshade. Which leads us to our second point - the protagonist. He starts off strong by making interesting observations about the simulated nature of his reality, and seemingly "breaking free" of his programming. But then he just slots himself right back into the main cast, without a thought as to whether /they're/ mysteriously compelled to act the same way he was. And then, when he starts to supplant the harem aura of the /actual/ protagonist, his best friend he's just as clueless about girls liking him as he would have been if he had never read TvTropes. +10 points for noticing the status quo, -âˆž points for doing the bare minimum amount to change it, beyond being slightly more lampshady than your average harem anime. Call me again when your protagonist is so scared by the harem aura that he decides to move to a different continent, or something.

None of these stories are really rational, but I considered them all worth reading to the end of the current content, even if I had to prod myself a few times to finish /The Simulacrum/. All of them except for /Magical Girl Escalation Taylor/ have the common theme of the protagonist's picture of themselves being different from how the outside world sees them, to varying degrees. I know I wasn't super clear on quality. If I had to rank them, the order would be this:

1. Nemesis
2. A Young Woman's Political Record
3. Deep Red
4. Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest*
5. Magical Girl Escalation Taylor
6. Greg Veder vs. The World
7. The Simulacrum

EDIT: Come to think of it, I did have a bit more to say. I read [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/][/Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest/]] after /The Simulacrum/. I gave up a little bit before the latest chapter, at a good stopping point, because it's nearly dead (unlike any of the other things I posted above) but I feel like it did a better job doing what /The Simulacrum/ tried to do. The characters are intelligent enough. The setting distinguishes itself from other generic settings by having the "Antagonists" be a genuine ongoing world-ending threat. And by playing /as the Waifu/, you get to avoid falling into the same trap /The Simulacrum/ did where the main character basically just supplanted the "true" main character of the story. I'd place it higher than /Magical Girl Escalation Taylor/, with the caveat that it's not and probably never will be finished.
