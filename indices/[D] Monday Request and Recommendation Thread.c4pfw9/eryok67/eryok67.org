Just blitzed through "The Traitor Baru Cormorant". Good shit. Hard fantasy political intrigue, with an enlightenment-era aesthetic and interesting social and historical commentary. Currently starting to read its sequel "The Monster Baru Cormorant", which is also good so far and has a little more fantasy in it.
