I am late.

Have been reading a story on RRL titled "[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/9500/the-eagles-flight][The Eagle's Flight]] ", and so far I'm really impressed.

Now, I'm not smart enough to tell you why I think this story should be featured more in this subreddit, but I think it does belong here.

It has, what I think, the hallmarks of a good rational story. And if not, it's a great story I want to share to you anyway.
