If you want to learn more about meditation and liked Slate Star Codex, try his book recommendation [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/][Mastering the Core Teaching of the Buddha]].

I haven't gotten around to reading it, but his book review makes me really excited about reading it when I have the spare time.
