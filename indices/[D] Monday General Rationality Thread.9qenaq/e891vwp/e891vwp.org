I ran into [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rmj9vuCUh5zfZag0sVkYNCCI3lJEbqLjP79vkXT9cCo/edit#heading=h.nbcyuc45jzhs][this guide]] in the so called "[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/19/classified-thread-5-classified-never-sinned-2/][Classified Thread]]", hosted on Slate Star Codex (Which is an excellent blog, btw, if you're interested in science, psychology, and sometimes politics).

It describes an interesting technique for falling asleep. Its basic claim is that sometimes, you cannot force yourself to relax, and you should instead try to focus your attention. Specifically, It suggests focusing your attention on visual artifacts you can see while closing your eyes. (I suspect this technique could work with different focus as well, but this guide does not explore that option)

does anyone knows any research on similar techniques? I'm curios how effective this could be.

This relates to my general interest in meditation-related topics - if anyone has sources on that (preferably evidence based, and with minimal spiritual-speak), I would appreciate it (-:
