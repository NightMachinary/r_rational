I rarely have any difficulty sleeping, but this works for me when I do.

​

Keep your eyes open, don't blink a minute or so. It works wonders, technically it requires some focus, while also tiring and drying your eyes which also makes you feel really sleepy, and fall asleep faster.

​

Generally just avoid arguing or posting things on reddit before bed. At least for me, my brain get's into full power mode, think of every possible counterargument and make your counterarguments for it, that kind of thing.

​

I also like watching really boring videos of boring games I like, i.e CK2, EU4 that kind of thing, or just reading bad verbose unedited fiction, that also knocks me out pretty quick, and by that I mean sleep on my chair, wake up because I dropped my mouse fast (which means I fell asleep holding it).

​

Edit* Also use f.lux and other similar programs, you can google what they do and why they are important.
