If you look at the dice quote, Einstein pretty clearly indicates a sort of God.

  Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. Quantum theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that He (God) does not throw dice.

(Albert Einstein, On Quantum Physics, Letter to Max Born, December 12, 1926)

It doesn't matter whether things are elegant or not. There are some physicists today who believe in string theory because the math is beautiful, that doesn't mean we should take them seriously.
