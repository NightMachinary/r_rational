I'm not defending atheists, I'm attacking Einstein. He said a lot of awful twaddle over his career.

But, hey, the atheists are more likely to be correct. And there's nothing in atheism that implies a lack a sense of wonder.

I don't know if there's a god, but I'm absolutely certain that none of the ones presented by human religions are even vaguely credible candidates.
