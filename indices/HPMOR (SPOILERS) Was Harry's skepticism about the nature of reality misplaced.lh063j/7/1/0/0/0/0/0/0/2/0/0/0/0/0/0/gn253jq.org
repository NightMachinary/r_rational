  I am 100% certain that each and every anthropomorphic fantasy god, the actual and specific jehova and ganesh and coyote and inari, is not real. P(them) is 0.

About the specifics, sure, I agree. But since this all started from Einstein's quote, I don't think he believed in any of those specifically. And in a way, if there was /any/ God, the atheist would still be more distant from the truth than the theist who believed in a God with a bit of fancy sprinkled on top.
