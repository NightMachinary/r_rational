  And in another way, the cracks are pretty small these days. If there is a god in there, it's closer to no god at all than any anthropomorphic fantasy.

This is the point I disagree on. Consider something like the simulation hypothesis, outlandish as it is - wouldn't anyone who set up the universe as a simulation be, essentially, our "God"? There's many ways in which you could have a created universe and it would just be impossible to know unless you can see how universe look like /in general/. Though what I do agree is that I don't believe it is possible for example for there to be an absolute /ethical/ paragon, but that's only mostly Christianity's claim anyway. Lots of gods in past religions weren't all-knowing and all-good.
