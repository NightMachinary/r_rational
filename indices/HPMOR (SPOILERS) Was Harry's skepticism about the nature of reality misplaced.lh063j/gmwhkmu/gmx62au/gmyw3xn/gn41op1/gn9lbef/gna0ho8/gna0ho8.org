I think you're making some valid points and some mistakes.

The ghosts from canon is pretty solid evidence of souls. I agree with that. Souls in HPMOR are rarely interacted with, and their consciousness nerfed to reduce the strength of evidence for souls, because souls clearly existing would change the story to a different one from what EY wants to tell, I think. An increased probability to the existence of an afterlife would reduce the narrative weight of Hermione's death, though as we've seen in the metafic that does open other venues for character development.

Regarding your points on Occam's razor, I don't think you're using it correctly. Just because some incredibly complicated idea has a short name "souls" that carries agreed upon meaning in society, doesn't make it more probable. If you tabboo the word "soul" (stop using it), you'd have to exchange it to quite a long description, which would make it sound less plausible. If you insist on remaining vague, your "souls" hypothesis doesn't have predictive power. If you define it carefully, you'll find it doesn't sound less complicated than Harry's supposed hypothesis of some magical artifact that serves as a emulator for sentient minds that are detached from physical brains (also, no AI necessary, just the hardware, and each magical process using it would be like connecting your phone to wifi, or your electrical appliance to the electrical network).

I suggest Imagining that you never heard about the idea of souls, specifically the concept that includes an afterlife. Would you directly jump to assuming an afterlife if you've seen animagi? Or ghosts?
