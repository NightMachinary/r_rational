I think you're ignoring his first experiments with Hermione. The whole point of that chapter was that he had a hard time updating his beliefs according to evidence when the suggested belief was too "weird". He was wrong there, and lost a lot of face over that. His flat earth atheism was wrong but expected, and he updated somewhat using that failure. Rationality doesn't mean you're always right, especially if you don't have the evidence needed to reach accurate beliefs.

So should've Harry simply thrown away everything he believed in originally because he was obviously wrong? His outdated model of reality is still useful in many ways, given that it was developed over centuries of active research. Throwing it away because MAGIC means losing predictive power. Whenever magic doesn't clearly say something different will happen, it seems clear that the outdated model of reality is accurate. That outdated model of reality found no use in the concept of souls. The new evidence for SOULS could be more concisely explained without a concept of souls that means death is not bad. Therefore the current model after updating says there are soul-like constructs that can be supported/created with magic, which either takes a single flash of magic to generate a limited copy (ghosts, paintings), or a continuous supply to generate a flawless copy (transfigurations of various kinds). However, there is a lack of evidence that there is a universal law that governs sentient minds and supplies an afterlife.

Basically, I think there's a semantic issue at fault here. Other people (mostly Dumbledore) are jumping from evidence of soul-like constructs to universal afterlife. Harry refuses to make that jump. To make his refusal clear he says he doesn't believe in souls, because that word carries expectations of an afterlife for him. A different story could have had different evidence, and Harry would've had to grapple with that worldview changing. I believe there is a metafic called Harry Potter and the philosopher's zombie that deals with these ideas.
