This might be me getting hung up on wording, but its not necessarily true that the universe has any compassion or something. There's enough knowledge from study of celestial bodies (from muggles) to understand their movements and see patterns, so they're not randomly flitting about through space. And given foreknowledge is shown to be possible through the existence of prophecies, anything gleamed from the current shape of reality could easily have been set in motion eons ago by an incredibly intelligent precursor/s, rather than an innate characteristic of the universe or what have you. There's a broad spectrum of why things could appear as they are, especially with magic involved, so chalking the meaning or intention behind reality up to a single ideal/emotion/objective/deity/etc. seems unjustifiably confident.
