Ok? So your beef is with the audience, then, not with the story. You're trying to construct this narrative where HPMOR is bad at telegraphing Harry's flaws and the mistakes he makes, but clearly a bunch of people noticed if even TVTropes was keeping up with it. HPMOR is plenty transparent and doesn't owe its audience an accounting for anything.

All aspiring rationalists make mistakes, the whole point is to learn to notice them even when it's difficult. If the story simply told you when to stop and think it wouldn't be as effective, neither as a narrative or as a didactic tool.
