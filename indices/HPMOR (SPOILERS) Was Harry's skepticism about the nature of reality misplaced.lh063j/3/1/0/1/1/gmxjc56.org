  Neither group of people are particularly good at reading comprehension, in my honest opinion.

I generally agree that this is not the author's intent, but I think an author's success when writing can be well approximated by "what percentage of the audience they had in mind for their work actually /gets/ what they were trying to convey?". If that percentage is significantly lower than you'd expect, that's a failure on the author's part. You don't get to claim "but, but, but people are actually too dumb to get what I meant!", because that's something you should have accounted for too, then. Unless of course we define EY's intended audience as "exactly the people who ended up getting what he meant perfectly", which however is suspiciously ad-hoc.
