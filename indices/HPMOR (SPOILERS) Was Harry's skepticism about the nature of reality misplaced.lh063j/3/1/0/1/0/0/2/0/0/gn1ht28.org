I'm a lot like that guy - haven't read the story in a long time, and only properly went through it once, so I don't have all the details. Forgive me if I get things wrong.

For me, I was a little annoyed with the story because it seemed like Harry's successes consistently and significantly outshone his failures. I don't mean the number or, like, the magnitude of them - it was more like his successes were just /flashier/ than his ultimately pretty mundane failures.

When he screwed up, it was like, "Harry let his temper get away from him and lost his Time Turner," or "Harry underestimated Hermione," or "Harry forgot to update his priors and so failed to call attention to Quirrell." Reasonable mistakes that a normal person could make.

But his accomplishments? "Harry is the only person alive with a patronus shaped like a human, and he can kill Dementors and control them with his mind." Or, "Harry invented partial transfiguration, which everybody on the planet insists is impossible, and it honestly didn't even take him very long." Or, "Harry subdued the villainous Snape and instituted effective rules that forever disallowed him from bullying students." Or, "Harry transfigured a rocket engine and used it to blast out of Azkaban and into the sunset." Or, "Harry is so special that the Sorting Hat came to life for the first time ever, sorted him into two houses, and started cracking jokes."

His successes were these big, bombastic, chapter-ending moments, and so many of them felt like they were pointing out how /special/ Harry was, how his unique extreme brilliance enabled him to do all these fancy special little Harry things.

I'm perfectly ready to accept that he ended up almost destroying the world because his mistakes were so significant, but to me, it really felt like the story was going out of its way to highlight how /awesome/ he was, every couple steps on the road there.
