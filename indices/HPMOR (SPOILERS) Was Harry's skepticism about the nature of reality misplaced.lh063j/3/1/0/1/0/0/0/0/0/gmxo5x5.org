No, that's basically a Disney death situation. There's no intent to kill, so it wouldn't be murder (except perhaps felony murder, but that ignores most of the rules).

On a civil standard, I don't think you could even prove liability for wrongful death. There's a legal concept called "contributory negligence", where even if another party did wrong, the victim can be found in whole or in part responsible for their own misfortune. This might be when someone whose land gets flooded sees it happening and does nothing to mitigate us, or when someone struck by a teenager drag racing was themselves drunk driving.

Getting caught in a trap you set up yourself would likely be on that level.

That said, Riddle had clearly committed robbery, forced kidnapping, terrorist threats, and several instances of mind control, so there's lots of felony equivalent crimes to go along with here that he would likely be convicted for felony murder. All felony murder requires is that a death which was reasonably foreseeable occurs during the commission of a felony.

Harry has a pretty rock solid defence of duress, as "a gun to my head" is one of the most textbook examples of that.
