Sure, but stories shouldn't be judged by "some people who read/watch them aren't as smart as others and might get the wrong message." A writer can definitely make good choices over bad ones to get their message across better (for example, in my view Wolf of Wallstreet ended up glamorizing the lifestyle it was attempting to condemn because it cared more about having fun/entertaining scenes than telling a good story, as compared to say Lord of War), but I think HPMOR did a fine job with it, and am glad it didn't sacrifice more nuance for the sake of readers who ignore things like Harry /admitting/ that he's been a massive idiot /multiple times./

He's literally responsible for Dumbledore's death/banishment. He gets stuck in an Unbreakable Vow against his will. He ends up being forced to kill people, including Draco's dad, which costs him their friendship... I don't know what people who want more consequences would be satisfied with. Hermione staying dead, probably, or Harry himself dying.
