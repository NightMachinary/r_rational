It's because a lot of that stuff came too late. Not everybody has the patience to power through a story they are beginning to dislike just to check if it gets better in the end. Everything you are saying here happened in the final chunk of the story - but this is fanfiction, not a book you spend money on and feel compelled to read. People who don't like a given piece of fanfiction, just stop reading it. And, honestly, that's fair - that's what people mean when they say this stuff came 'too little, too late'.

Take the great Hermione debacle. A bunch of people didn't like how Hermione was treated in the early/middle part of the story. This came to a head when Hermione was killed by the troll - if I remember correctly people even wrote blog posts about how much they hated her death and how the story handled her character in general. Now, of course, at the very end of the story Harry finally admits that Hermione would actually make a much better hero than he is, and gives her his invisibility cloak just to make certain the reader's know he's serious. But that's too little, too late; the kind of people who cared the most about Hermione's treatment in the story stopped reading ages ago. If a more downtuned version of that scene/realization had happened earlier in the story, maybe they would have stuck with it to the end. But it didn't. So they stopped reading. And we can't fault them for that.

Similarly, the kinds of people most annoyed by Harry's behavior and how often it gets rewarded simply stopped reading before he started facing truly serious consequences for it. The kind of people most annoyed by the 'Dumbledore bashing' stopped reading long before the story revealed Dumbledore was right all along.

And that is a legitimate flaw in a story as long as HPMOR - a flaw perfectly encapsulated by 'too little, too late'.

People like us don't see what HPMOR was trying to do more clearly because we're 'smarter' or anything like that. We see it because the flaws people complain about, for one reason or another, didn't matter to us enough to make us stop reading before we got to the end of what is a decently long piece of fanfiction nobody was ever under any obligation to finish.
