Maybe there's a nicer way to say this, but I can't think of one right now...

In my experience there's two main groups of readers we're talking about here: the first thinks Harry is super rational and right all the time because they see him as /more rational than they are/ and so fixate on all the ways he's brilliant while not being able to distinguish actual brilliance from his mistakes in the story. They see people being upset with him but take his side implicitly rather than recognizing when he's wrong on a case by case basis. The second thinks he's /presented as/ rational and right all the time because they /disagree with his choices/beliefs,/ and so when he succeeds anyway sometimes they fixate on those and ignore all the times he gets burned or admits his mistakes.

Neither group of people are particularly good at reading comprehension, in my honest opinion.

I get that at some level responsibility can rest in part with the author too, but this story really does bash you over the head with how mistaken Harry is when he messes up, and I think readers who don't pick up on it are failing to understand that Harry can both be right in his epistemics but flawed in his values, judgement, and execution.

To say the story doesn't do "enough" to show his mistakes is a judgement call; it may not have done enough /for some people,/ but, speaking for myself, I found it very obvious that the story was showcasing failure modes of an aspiring rationalist alongside his successes even the first time I read it... and I had no idea what a "rationalist" was then.

It's honestly kind of hard for me to understand how people can read the same story I did and not pick up on it when Harry is /surrounded by people who disagree with him/ and the only person who does mostly agree with him is /the main antagonist/ who /utterly fools Harry./

It's like... sure there are stories where "the only sane person in a world of idiots" is a thing, but in those stories the "sane person" doesn't fuck up nearly as much as Harry does, if at all.
