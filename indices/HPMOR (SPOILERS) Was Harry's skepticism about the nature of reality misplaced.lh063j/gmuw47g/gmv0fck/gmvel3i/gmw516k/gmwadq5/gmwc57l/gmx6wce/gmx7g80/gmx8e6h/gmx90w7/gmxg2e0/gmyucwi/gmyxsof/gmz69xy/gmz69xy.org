  HPJEV is a very polarizing character. Maybe that was intentional. Maybe not. Maybe the main character being annoying shouldn't really count as a 'flaw'. But it is a valid critique (and in my opinion the criticism that underlies most others) and it is what drives many people away from HPMOR.

"Annoying" is subjective. "Arrogant" is not. He is arrogant, and that is a legitimate flaw. That some people find him annoying is no more meaningful as a criticism of the writing than me saying the same of Hamlet would be.
