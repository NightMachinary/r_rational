We're using "responsible" differently here ;P But even under the responsibility standards of, say, Criminal Law it would be hard to argue that Voldemort killed Dumbledore... I would actually be interested in knowing if outsmarting someone who tries to kill you so that they fall into their own trap would make someone able to be tried for murder, even if the person involved was in the middle of a theft.
