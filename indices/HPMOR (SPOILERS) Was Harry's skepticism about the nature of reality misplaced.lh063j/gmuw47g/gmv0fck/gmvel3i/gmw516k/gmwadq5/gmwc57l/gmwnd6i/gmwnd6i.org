Devil's advocate (I don't have much of an opinion either way because I haven't read it in too many years to be precise about all the characterization): all the consequences you mentioned are essentially at the end of the story, when he nonetheless gets to start ending death, having still outsmarted the much older (smarter?) main antagonist. Even if the final message /is/ sufficiently "Harry fucked up," maybe those you're arguing with mean they wanted failures hundreds of chapters sooner.

(I /do/ remember that, for me, the /end/ sufficiently communicated "Harry was being an idiot". That Dumbledore moment.)
