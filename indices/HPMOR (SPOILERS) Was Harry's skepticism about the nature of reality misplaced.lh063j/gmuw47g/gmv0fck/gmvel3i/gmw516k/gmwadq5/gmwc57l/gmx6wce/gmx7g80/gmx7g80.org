I'm fine with people deciding not to keep reading if they dislike a story. People are allowed to have different tastes and preferences. I totally get why some people might not want to read HP fanfic that bashes on Ron or Dumbledore until it "gets good" and shows Harry as wrong.

But to say that the story is /flawed/ because Harry doesn't face consequences until the end is just /objectively wrong./ Reading comprehension matters: he got his time turner locked within days of getting it, he lost his first battle because he didn't take anyone but Draco seriously, he saved Neville but did it in a show-offy way that hurt him, etc, and the story /called him on it/ each time.

And even if it didn't, it is not at fault for having a character be arrogant in the first half and pay for it in the second. That's called having a character flaw and arc.
