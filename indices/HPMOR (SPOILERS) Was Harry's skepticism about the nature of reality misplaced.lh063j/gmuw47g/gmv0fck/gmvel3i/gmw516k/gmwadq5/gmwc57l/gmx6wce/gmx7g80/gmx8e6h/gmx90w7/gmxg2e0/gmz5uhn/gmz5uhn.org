  Mcgonnagal can lock his Time Turner and yell at him about being reckless all she wants
#+end_quote

To be clear you seem to be dismissing this as not being sufficient /to you/ for x, y, z reasons. I want to make sure it's acknowledged that, objectively, it was a consequence, that Harry brought on himself by being imperfect, acknowledged by the text and characters.

  he is still accompanying Quirrel to Azkaban a few arcs later, and he is still going to get away with it almost flawlessly
#+end_quote

"Getting away with it" is not the only metric of failure. Regretting it is a much more powerful one, to me, and the further alienation from those he might otherwise turn to for help and support is another. In stories with heists, "getting away with it" is often taken for granted, but there are often consequences that go beyond it that matter more to the story than them just being locked up or failing in the heist.

  His 'dark side' is portrayed as a flaw, something he has to overcome in order to not become a Dark Lord. But it never really makes him lose - instead it makes him win. He never 'fails' an Encounter because of it
#+end_quote

...obviously? If it led to failure he would stop using it. The reason it's hard to stop using is /because/ it makes him so much more effective. But that's not even true, there are times it leads him to "win" but not in an optimal way, such as...

#+begin_quote
  The only time it really becomes a serious, potentially Encounter Ending impediment is in Azkaban, and even then its pathological fear of death can't make him lose the encounter because there's simply no time in the story for Harry to get caught - instead he just shoves it aside and wins.
#+end_quote

It also causes him to fuck up with Snape in their first encounter. "Inability to lose properly" is the first lesson Voldemort tries to (literally) beat out of him, with only middling success, and part of the problem is that he HAS a dark side he can just keep using to win. The actual success condition in Azkaban once he was there was giving up and turning himself in.

#+begin_quote
  Harry doesn't win the final battle because of anything he did to combat his Dark Side. He doesn't defeat the Dark Lord because he learned to lose, or because he learned to trust and value people who aren't academic geniuses like Ron or Neville, or anything like that - he wins because he thinks of a really clever plan under time pressure and executes it flawlessly.
#+end_quote

This is the only point you've made that actually lands; a lot of people had issues with the final battle for reasons like this, myself included. But the vast, vast majority of critics of HPMOR do not get this far, and of those that do most still get many other things wrong about the story leading up to it.

See, here's the thing; I don't think we /can/ go back and forth on specifics all day :P I think if we did we would very quickly reach a conclusion that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/][I already spent a lot of time documenting]] because I was tired of hearing people say stuff like this.

Yes, HPMOR has flaws. Yes HPJEV is a divisive character. These are /not the same claim/ as the "Harry's character arc is too slow and he doesn't change enough," and those are not objective claims, they are subjective preferences from people who consistently fail to remember specifics about ways Harry failed and changed, and then say things like "well it's not about specifics" when this is pointed out to them.

Harry is a flawed character. He is flawed in a way that rubs many readers the wrong way, and the way he was written in the early chapters particularly was rough around the edges, but that does not make his flaws /poor writing/ any more than Hamlet's flaws make his character poor writing no matter how annoying some people (myself included) find him.
