Yeah, Harry definitely is presented as pretty awesome in a unique way. Personally I'm okay with that, and I think most people are in most circumstances, but are just unused to these. Most people don't bat an eye when James Bond kills a hundred dudes while dodging every bullet, or an anime protagonist turns out to be a better fighter at 12 than grown adults who spent their whole life fighting, or a single high schooler outsmarts the entire world's police force (other than a secret world detective who happens to also be around his age).

At least in HPMOR we have reasons for Harry's stupendous successes, for the most part: 1) he's got the mental patterns of Voldemort kicking around in his head, 2) he's the only wizard who learned lots about the material world and scientific thinking, 3) there's multiple prophecies about him (personally I hate prophecies as a justification for specialness, but this is a carry over from the canon in any case), 4) he's got a fairly unique value system, etc etc etc.

So sure, I understand why someone might feel like Harry comes off as too awesome even with all the mistakes he makes, but I don't find it particularly out of the norm for the genre, and much better justified than most stories.
