IMO this is a matter of personal values, not of intelligence or understanding. The movie illustrates a story which features a conflict and tension between two "characters" who really are two worldviews. Tyler Durden is fascinating for a reason. He makes the world a starkly contrasted, easily understood, somewhat more interesting place. He suggests an almost spiritual philosophy of abandonment of your body, of safety, of comfort, not unlike a bunch of religions - except instead of proposing frugality and self-flagellation he proposes to flagellate each other, because that's more fun. That's the driver of the first part. The second part of the movie shows the many ways in which that mindset can go wrong. But whether you think those sort of consequences are /bad/ is in itself a value choice. Maybe you're okay with widespread death and mayhem, maybe you really think our society is so rotten it has it coming. Maybe you're genuinely ready to face your own death if you think it has meaning, and don't care for other people's. Evil? From our viewpoint, sure. Inconsistent or irrational? Not really.

Imagine making the same movie, but about the dangers of democracy. It starts with a small group of people gathering together to live in a democratic commune. It looks fun and pleasant and they all get to decide and do their part. Their movement expands, and in the second half, they take the country by storm. There's a revolution, the king is beheaded, the aristocracy flees. Democracy becomes the law of the land. At the beginning it seems like it goes well, but then populists start emerging. Democracy eats itself and is paralyzed by indecision when it matters. The country collapses, and the protagonist, finally seeing the madness of it all, starts plotting to try and get back the rightful heir of the King.

That wouldn't be such a weird movie. In fact it could be an almost perfect historical movie about the French Revolution, save a few details. We would all consider its morals repugnant - for all of democracy's flaws, /no way/ monarchy would be a better option! - but for someone with a 17th century mindset, that would reflect their thoughts perfectly.
