You know that. I know that. TvTropes knew that. It sure seemed like a huge chunk of the audience refused to notice that because, like Harry, they were swept up in Quirrel's badassism and charisma. I also feel like people's opinions of the story and Harry wind up pretty thoroughly established in the first 10 chapters, in which it's easy to miss that Harry's flaws are intended as flaws because they keep succeeding. Like, he just walked all over MacGonogall and Hermione and it seemed like he might get away with terrifying Neville at 9.75. It takes the Sorting Hat laying out how messed up it all has been to make it abundantly clear that the author intended Harry's darkness to be bad, rather than badass.

After that, if you like Harry, it's hard to hate Quirrel because he shows up to mentor Harry like a stone-cold sensei whenever our lovable protagonist makes a mistake. It feels like he's making Harry stronger and serving as a role-model. By the time he does the really, really obvious "wtf?" thing with Azkaban, a lot of people have already decided how they feel about the character, and aren't going to go updating based on mere evidence.

I guess the tldr would be that it takes too long to get to the point, and things which feel right to the protagonist, by virtue of being convincing enough to convince someone as smart as Harry, also has a tendency to convince readers who are sufficiently similar to Harry. And since it's fanfiction, a lot of detractors assume the author must be sufficiently similar to Harry to also make the same mistakes and fail to notice.
