I always got the impression that Harry was taking a lot of his muggle baggage into the magical world, and not updating enough of his greater worldview to accommodate the new data that is the existence of magic.

It struck me the most, personally, when Harry staunchly argued that souls couldn't possibly exist, using well-reasoned arguments against a specific definition of 'soul' and using that to claim the whole concept disproven, in concurrence with what he had reasonably believed before he learned of magic. I was left thinking "Of all the magics of the world, you don't think it's even /possible/ that something that one might describe as a soul exists?" I can imagine someone like Merlin or those before him crafting a viral magical construct that copies brain-states until a person dies, or other formulations that make for a similar effect, and the possibility of something like that is something that should greatly intrigue Harry if he hadn't stayed stuck to the surety that souls can't possibly exist.
