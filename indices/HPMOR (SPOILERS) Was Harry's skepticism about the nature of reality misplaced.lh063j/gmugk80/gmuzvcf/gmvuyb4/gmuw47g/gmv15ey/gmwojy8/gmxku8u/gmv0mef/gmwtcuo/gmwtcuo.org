  I think the whole exchange between Harry and Dumbledore makes more sense if you view it as a language fluency issue. Treat different logics as different languages. Harry can't understand a whole sentence in Weird Logic, because he isn't a native speaker, like Dumbledore is.

Weird Logic isn't a thing, though. Dumbledore's mumbo-jumbo about stories is either him blinding executing prophecies to avoid the end of the world, or else cobbling together a fake explanation for something he did for prophecy. He didn't smash Harry's pet rock because he thought it would give Harry a thematically appropriate backstory, he did it so Time would follow a particular path, no different from picking how a river would fork.
