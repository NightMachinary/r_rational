  The point is we have an obligation to take the universe seriously and not impose fantasies about anthropomorphic deities on it.

Premise: I am agnostic atheist myself, just to clear any doubts on that.

Follow up: it's not that simple. If you want to be objective, discussing about what is more "likely" for a Universe to be is absolutely impossible to judge because /we have a sample of one/. Let's consider it from a Bayesian perspective. We know the universe allows us to live. This includes stuff like the fine structure constant being juuuust right for matter structures of sufficient complexity to exist. Lots of physical laws, if tweaked in one way or another, would turn the universe into a very boring place! Let's call this observation FT, for Fine Tuning, and the hypothesis of the existence of a God, G. Then

P(G | FT) = P(FT | G) P(G)/P(FT)

Now, P(FT | G) is obviously 1: if God exists, he finely tuned the universe, that's the whole /point/ of there being a God. So it's now all down to P(G) and P(FT).

What's P(FT)? Well, if every possible universe ever exists, then P(FT) is 1 by the anthropic principle: we ought to exist in a /livable/ universe, after all. But we don't know whether the multiverse really is a thing. And what's P(G)? Again, who the hell knows. The atheist says: your description is eerily reminiscent of just a Big Man in the Sky and a projection of your inner desire for protection and order from above! You just took your mental image of a father or a chief and made it one gajillion times more powerful!

And that makes sense. But the (smart) theist could respond: well, but those images exist within me /because God created me this way!/ I possess intuitive knowledge that reflects the fundamental truths that have been etched into me by the laws of the universe itself! The causal relation is the other way around, fathers and chiefs are just our pale attempts to reflect what God is to the world.

And the atheist argues, there are no fundamental truths etched into us! Empirical investigation is the only way we can access true knowledge!

And the theist can rebut, oh, yes? Then what /is/ a number, and why do you understand how to manipulate it and other symbols? Why are you so sure that if a thing happened 99 times, it will also happen the 100th? Why do you think the world ought to be regular at all?

And the atheist, because those things are the very foundation of my brain-software - they're the firmware evolution itself built into it. They're essential tools to survive, and they've evolved because they /work/!

And the theist: right, and so why wouldn't our tendency to anthropomorphize rules and see a greater human-like intelligent entity behind it all not work the same way?

In the end, it's not an argument that can be ever finally settled. All evidence is inaccessible. People have different priors, and that makes all the difference. An atheist is someone for whom P(G) << P(FT). A theist is someone for whom P(G) = P(FT). Neither can be proven right or wrong in a final sense (which is why I classify myself as agnostic). If you think the universe /obviously/ has to be regular and have laws and such, you haven't thought enough about the universe.
