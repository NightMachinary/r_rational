I mean, Occam's razor is taken as the principle that the explanation involving the least amount of entities is most likely to be correct. Funnily enough, Occam was a medieval monk, and very unlikely to think that the simplest explanation to the world was /not/ "God made it". We use simplicity as a guiding principle because it sorta works empirically - but it's hardly a proven rule, nor is it easy to objectively assess which proposed explanation is simpler. It's just a rule of thumb that could fail us at any time. If only because "most likely" does not mean "certain".
