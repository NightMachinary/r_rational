How do you figure that atheists are more likely to be correct? I would think that the existence or lack thereof of a deity would be like a schrodinger's cat situation - you can't really say that one outcome is more likely than the other. Although there are arguments to be made either way, if you don't ascribe to any established deities then there really isn't any evidence for or against the universe being created by a non-specified omnipotent(?) entity.

And for the record, I fail to see how religion prevents people from having a sense of wonder. It might sound cheesy, but I feel as though I appreciate the beauty of the universe more when I think of it as created - it's like art.
