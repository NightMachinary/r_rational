The evidence is people still suffer and die.

Unless the universe is secretly using suffering and death to achieve something of greater utility to the people who suffer and die and to the people who live in a world where others suffer and die than suffering and death is of negative utility, it cannot be said to "care". That's Harry's position, and he pretty much discounts such a thing exists because it requires a leap of logic that isn't supported by evidence.

Ghosts aren't evidence of a caring universe. They are, first of all, evidence of death and suffering. Nearly-headless Nick's existence doesn't signify a victory over oblivion, he's an unliving monument to a botched execution instead.
