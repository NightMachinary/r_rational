I think I see what you're saying now. What I meant was, if it's a lookup table at a cosmic scale, then I /would/ expect physics to break because lookup tables have inherent issues. Either you have a photocopier problem, or the lookup takes too long to be reliable as you get farther from where the data is stored, so the lookup table breaks physics. But physics don't normally break in the normal universe without the lookup table, at least as far as we can observe in this corner of the universe.
