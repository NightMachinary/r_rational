We don't "know" any of those things, but we should lend greater weight to those possibilities then before.

Occam's razor plays into this situation with this new evidence.

You're basically rephrasing the same evidence but in a different way.

We have evidence that there exists magical mind structures that contain and preserve human consciousness. Via these structures, a human mind can control and live in a nonhuman body with vastly different brains.

These magical mind structures can also exist after the physical destruction of the human brain. And these structures have self awareness since they can reflect on their death and have a culture (death day's and such)

Some sort of universal system responds to the cognition produced by these mind structures to produce effects in certain ways that violate conventional physics.

So why aren't these magical mind structures souls? What's the difference?

Just from a cursory glance,, there seems to be compelling evidence that souls exist.

Of course it can be handwaived away as some sort of temporary simulation that the magic system sets. Emulates human minds so it can respond to human mental processes. Emulations that do all of the things above. Some sort of weird esoteric computer thing. Maybe some ancient hyper advanced AI intelligence system?

That's a more complicated less probable explanation then just saying souls exist.

Souls existing is a much simpler less complex, and more elegant conclusion. Doesn't that satisfy Occam's razor more?

Why does he believe in magical AI emulations that do all sorts of bizzare things that conveniently line up with popular u derstandings of souls? And not believe in souls. Like...

It doesn't matter if souls exist in HPMOR or not.

I'm not critiquing Harry's conclusions, I'm critiquing the way he came to these conclusions.

It would be a more interesting story if Harry had to confront these things and work to update his model of reality at a fundamental level.

To me, that is fundamentally a more rational and enjoyable story to me.
