Einstein was not okay with the /Copenhagen Interpretation/ and in my opinion he was absolutely right to feel dissatisfied. It's a shit non-answer. He suggested the EPR paradox, sure, while looking for a way to "break" QM and show it couldn't possibly be the correct final theory. That did more to advance our understanding of QM than most of the work done by those who sheepishly bought into Bohr's "you're not allowed to ask that question!" nonsense. I actually studied this a bit as in, I read some of the transcripts of the Solvay Conference at which QM really got some traction, and in it already Einstein tried to bring up how QM implied nonlocality. That's the insight that eventually led to Bell's theorem. Those transcripts are frustrating because Einstein was /clearly/ saying very sensible things and everyone else didn't even understand him and went "haha you just didn't get how this works, let's move to the next topic". The EPR paradox paper was just him formalizing in a much more rigorous manner the same intuition he demonstrated already back there.
