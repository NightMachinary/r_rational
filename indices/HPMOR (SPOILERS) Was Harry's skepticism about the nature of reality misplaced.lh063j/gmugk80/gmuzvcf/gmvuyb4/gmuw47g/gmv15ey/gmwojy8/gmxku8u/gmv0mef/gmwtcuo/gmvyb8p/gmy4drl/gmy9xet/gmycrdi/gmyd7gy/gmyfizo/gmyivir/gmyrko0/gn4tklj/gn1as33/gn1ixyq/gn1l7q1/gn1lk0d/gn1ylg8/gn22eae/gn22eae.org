You're missing that I'm talking about the actual explanations offered by the actual world religions and the explanations offered by actual atheists, not including the fuzzy maybe there's a god of agnosticism because there's nothing there to actually believe in.

I am 100% certain that each and every anthropomorphic fantasy god, the actual and specific jehova and ganesh and coyote and inari, is not real. P(them) is 0.

There may be some inhuman yet benevolent god of the cracks that's responsible for the universe, but it's closer to "there is no god" than any world religion except maybe some purest of pure buddhist who has avoided all the syncretic deist nonsense that's polluted all actual buddhist groups and sects that actually exist.

Actual world religions, you know.
