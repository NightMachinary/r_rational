Yes. Both of those are possibilities. That doesn't make a soul less likely though. It is just a consequence of the relationship to consiousness.

Your double witch example kind of misses the point in where there could be evidence of souls in the Harry Potter universe. Ghosts are likely not souls, but Dumbledore seemed to have reason to believe in their existence, and he had access to Mysteries.

But yes, there could be robots who essentially control us, which arguably is another perspective on what a soul is metaphysically.
