Well the brain argument still holds up. I mean whatever explains animagus thinking must also explain that. And like most things I can come up whith to explain that don't obiously imply an afterlife, much less a nice one.

Plus Dumbledore and wizards in general aren't acting like there's obiously an afterlife(Harry thinks of how they don't just kill Neville's parents to send them to the afterlife) And there are reasons to suspect people believing in afterlife is not that correlated whith the afterlife actually existing.

So like whilke Harry definitely is not doing things 100% right and he should really be researching the topic more just in case and maybe be less confident, the conclusion he reaches is not that bad given the evidence he has.

Just because Harry is obiously biased doesn't mean he is obiously wrong.
