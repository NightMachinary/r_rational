No, what I mean is that Einstein /defined/ the fanatical atheist in the same breath as he condemned it.

If you want to make a point, it should be that no actual atheist is like Einstein described, but frankly I don't think that's right (plus, you should consider whether something changed since Einstein's time and now in culture, even within atheism).
