Something being more simple does not always mean it is so.

As for your second point, that isn't really an objection. It is just an observation for how the mechanics would work if the soul was a thing.

The alternative would be that the soul is instead a reflection of the person with that personhood coming from the brain which then leaves behind the soul after the brain stops working. Damage to the brain could either cause damage to the soul, or else not impact it at all as it is the sum of that person's history. Either way brain damage doesn't mean that the soul there doesn't exist.
