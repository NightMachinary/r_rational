Where is the CPU processing the way spacetime responds to mass-energy density? We don't know, there may be /some/ underlying architecture to the universe but all we know is it has some laws and they ALWAYS hold true no matter what. No computer is that perfect.

Similarly, you could imagine a universe whose set of laws is just a lookup table that says "from state A you always go to state B" (it's easier to imagine if you assume a universe with discrete states and discrete time steps, but ours might as well be like that too) and that's perfectly obeyed just like the laws of OUR universe are always perfectly obeyed too. Do you expect to get different values of pi or of the Planck constant in different points of space and time because of random bit flips in the registers of the machine simulating OUR universe? Obviously it doesn't seem to work that way. If there are glitches in the Matrix, we don't see them.
