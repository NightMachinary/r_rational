I think the speed of data transfer from the memory node to the local simulation node would be a massive limiting factor, unless the memory modes are just cloned over and over. In the cloning case, that does imply a high likelihood of the occurrence of corrupt bits in the memory nodes, where the laws of physics are different for no discernible reason, simply because the lookup table spits out the wrong answer.

The bits probably got flipped by cosmic rays too, since that's such a convenient excuse.
