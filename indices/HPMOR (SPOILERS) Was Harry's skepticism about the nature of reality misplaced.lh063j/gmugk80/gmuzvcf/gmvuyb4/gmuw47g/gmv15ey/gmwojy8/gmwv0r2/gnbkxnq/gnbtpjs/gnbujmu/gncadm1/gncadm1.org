Consider the following possibility: All humans are actually robots, created by a double witch conspiracy, held in cold sleep deep within the crust of the earth, connected by magic to flesh bodies. This scenario makes exactly the same level of predictions as does a soul, and has the same amount of evidence, except that people don't go around claiming a robot body conspiracy without evidence.

And again, if your soul is a reflection of you, shouldn't you still be able to think if you're brain is damaged? You shouldn't get Phineas Gage, you should get someone who can still think normally despite a whole in his head.

If doing so does have an effect, either damage to the brain somehow damages the soul, or else any soul doesn't really reflect you.
