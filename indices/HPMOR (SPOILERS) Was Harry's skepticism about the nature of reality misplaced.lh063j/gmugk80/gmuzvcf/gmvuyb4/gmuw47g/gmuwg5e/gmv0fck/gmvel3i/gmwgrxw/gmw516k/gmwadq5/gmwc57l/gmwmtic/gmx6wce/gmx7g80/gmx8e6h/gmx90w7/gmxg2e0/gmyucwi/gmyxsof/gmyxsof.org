I feel like I went out of my way to point out how a person's enjoyment of the fic (and how well they 'tolerated' its flaws) depended on their personal response to the character of HPJEV. It is literally the very first point I make in the comment you are replying to.

Everything about HPMOR hinges on HPJEV - the people who like the fic can, at the very least, tolerate him and so enjoy the stuff the fic does well. But if a person doesn't like HPJEV, then they are not going to enjoy the things HPMOR does well, and the flaws of HPMOR are going to stand out to them a lot more clearly. If someone finds HPJEV pretentious and annoying, then they are going to find the entirety of HPMOR pretentious and annoying.

That's why I made my point about the final battle - HPJEV doesn't change that much throughout the story, didn't need to change in order to win the Final Battle, and many of the critiques of HPMOR boil down to, in the end, a desire for HPJEV to change. Critics are right to focus on HPJEV's characterization. HPJEV's characterization is the biggest flaw in the story because of how omnipresent his character is - he is the main driving force of the entire story. His point of view colors almost every scene (even if the author has said HPJEV's opinion isn't always meant to be 'correct'). The other characters orbit him. The only other characters with similar agency are Quirrel (and I shouldn't have to explain why HPJEV haters also hate Quirrel) and Dumbledore (who unfortunately spends a decent amount of the story being 'bashed' - and I've already gone over how people don't stick around to finish fanfics they don't like).

HPJEV is a very polarizing character. Maybe that was intentional. Maybe not. Maybe the main character being annoying shouldn't really count as a 'flaw'. But it is a valid critique (and in my opinion the criticism that underlies most others) and it is what drives many people away from HPMOR.
