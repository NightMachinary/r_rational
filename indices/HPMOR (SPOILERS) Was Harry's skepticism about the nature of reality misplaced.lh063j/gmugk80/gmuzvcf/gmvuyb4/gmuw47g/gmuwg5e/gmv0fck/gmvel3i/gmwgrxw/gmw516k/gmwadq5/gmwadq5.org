  It's honestly kind of hard for me to understand how people can read the same story I did and not pick up on it when Harry is surrounded by people who disagree with him and the only person who does mostly agree with him is the main antagonist who utterly fools Harry.

That's very nearly a description of Fight Club (just change a few names), and people actually started literal fight clubs IRL - completely ignoring the actual text of the movie.

If you make a character engaging enough and don't sufficiently exaggerate their failures, people are more than willing to ignore what you intended to say with that character.
