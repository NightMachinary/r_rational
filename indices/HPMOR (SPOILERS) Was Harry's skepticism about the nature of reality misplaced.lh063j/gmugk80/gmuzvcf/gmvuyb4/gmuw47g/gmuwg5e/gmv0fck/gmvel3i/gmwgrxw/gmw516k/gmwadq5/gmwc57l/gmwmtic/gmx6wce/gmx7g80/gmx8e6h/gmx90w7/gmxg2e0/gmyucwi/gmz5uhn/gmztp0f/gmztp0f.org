But... we're talking about a piece of fanfiction. Almost all critique is going to be, ultimately, subjective. I even laid down a pretty comprehensive argument as to why different people react in subjectively different ways to the fic (whether or not they see HPJEV as annoying). If enough people find a character annoying, that is a legitimate flaw in the story - just because it isn't purely 'objective' does not mean we can just dismiss it. If enough people think the pacing is too slow, that is a valid critique. Almost every judgement of a given written work's quality is going to be subjective. Almost no piece of art is 'objectively' good. You find Hamlet annoying. If enough people also found Hamlet annoying, to the point where they refused to read the play because they hated him so much, people would not think that play is good. The play would be badly written, because it failed at the most fundamental goal of any written work - getting people to read it.

What would a purely objective criticism of a story even look like? The only one I could think off the top of my head (pointing out flaws in basic plot construction) you already agree with me on. I guess inconsistent characterization could be another? I'm more than willing admit it; if there is one thing HPMOR has, its consistent characterization. But Art is all about how something makes us feel - Shakespeare is considered good because of how it makes people feel; people aren't robots that plug all the jokes into equation and give a thumbs up if the result is positive. If all someone feels while reading HPMOR is annoyance, that is a valid critique that you can't just dismiss because it can't be mathematically proven.

I'm going to ignore your counter-arguments to my various points, because I have already explained at length why HPMOR haters don't think many of the consequences HPJEV faces in the story are 'real' consequences - and since that is entirely subjective we could go back and forth on that all day on, so lets not do that. Every single argument you could possible make for why those consequences 'count' would be subjective, and every single argument I could make for why they don't would be subjective as well. We can debate what is a more powerful metric of failure all day till we go blue in the face - its subjective. Your opinion is just as personal as mine, and there's nothing we can do to change that.

Instead I'm going to go after what I think is our more fundamental disagreement. You seem to think that the people who critique HPMOR simply failed to understand it, and I strongly disagree. HPMOR fans are not, in my opinion, any more 'rational' in their opinion than HPMOR haters. They just had a different subjective experience while reading the fic. That's it.
