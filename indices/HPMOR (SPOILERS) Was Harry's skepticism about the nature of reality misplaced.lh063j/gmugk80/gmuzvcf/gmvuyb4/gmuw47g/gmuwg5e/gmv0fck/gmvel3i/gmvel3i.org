The story doesn't do /nearly enough/ to stress that HJPEV is limited. His failures are either irrelevant, minimized or handwaved.

I understand that Eliezer /intended/ to write a story with a rational yet flawed protagonist, but quite a few readers - including the person who initially posted this topic - *read* the story as having a protagonist who was infallibly rational.
