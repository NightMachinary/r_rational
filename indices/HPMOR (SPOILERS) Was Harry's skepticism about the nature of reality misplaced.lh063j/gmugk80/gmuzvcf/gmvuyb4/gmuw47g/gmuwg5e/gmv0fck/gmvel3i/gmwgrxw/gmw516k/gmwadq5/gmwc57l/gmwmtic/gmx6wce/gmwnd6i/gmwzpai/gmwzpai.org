I understand why the ending seems too positive for some people to sufficiently feel that Harry isn't as smart as he seems, but Harry /did/ fuck up multiple times throughout the story.

He got his time turner locked, he got tricked into helping break a dangerous criminal out of prison, he got locked in a room and got tortured, he lost a bunch of the school battles... I literally made a list of Harry's failures once, there are a lot of them.
