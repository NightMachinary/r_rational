Eh. In my experience most of the critiques of HPMOR are pretty valid. While I did enjoy it when I first read it back in the day, going back over it now I can recognize that the story does have some serious flaws and the 'lack of consequences' thing is one of them, but they ultimately all boil down to main problem people have with HPMOR - HPJEV.

His character arc is too slow, and his behavior never really changes. The story relies on him getting into shenanigans in order to solve the entire plot of Harry Potter within one school year, so by necessity he can't change, and he often can't face serious consequences that would force him to change. Mcgonnagal can lock his Time Turner and yell at him about being reckless all she wants - he is still accompanying Quirrel to Azkaban a few arcs later, and he is still going to get away with it almost flawlessly, and he is still going to face almost no consequences for it (because the story ends before Bellatrix being free can really have any effect).

His 'dark side' is portrayed as a flaw, something he has to overcome in order to not become a Dark Lord. But it never really makes him lose - instead it makes him win. He never 'fails' an Encounter because of it - instead he gets lambasted for being too dedicated to 'winning' after the fact, which doesn't have nearly the same impact. It's one thing to call a character an idiot because of a flaw - its another to have a character actually fail like an idiot because of that flaw. The only time it really becomes a serious, potentially Encounter Ending impediment is in Azkaban, and even then its pathological fear of death can't make him lose the encounter because there's simply no time in the story for Harry to get caught - instead he just shoves it aside and wins.

Harry doesn't win the final battle because of anything he did to combat his Dark Side. He doesn't defeat the Dark Lord because he learned to lose, or because he learned to trust and value people who aren't academic geniuses like Ron or Neville, or anything like that - he wins because he thinks of a really clever plan under time pressure and executes it flawlessly. Large chunks of the story (and the character development they contain) could be removed and the Final Battle would barely change. For example, Harry did not need to lose that first battle to Hermione and learn a lesson about too easily discounting other people as NPCs because at the end of the day, when he faces off against the Dark Lord, the Death Eaters basically are just NPCs.

We can go back and forth on the specifics all day, but that's what most of the flaws in HPMOR boil down to in the end - things in the basic construction of the story that rub people the wrong way (like the pacing and characterization). On the micro level it can be really fun to read; but on the macro level you start running into problems. And if you never liked HPJEV in the first place, then even the micro level stuff is ruined as well.
