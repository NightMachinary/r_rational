If someone says a thing didn't happen and I can point to it happening, that is them being /objectively wrong/ in their reading of a story. Period.

You can say their subjective experience is valid or "all critique is subjective" and so on, but critiques often base their views on objective claims, and far too many critics, including those I've seen of HPMOR, do not know the difference between their objective and subjective claims.

That is my point. Someone can read something and dislike it for subjective reasons, but their criticism loses value to me if I can objectively point out factual claims they make that are incorrect... and it doesn't matter how couched in subjective opinion something is if it's basing it off a false assertion.

It's like watching a CinemaSins video and saying the movie is bad because it has 73 sins or whatever, until you actually watch the movie yourself and realize that over half their "sins" are inaccurate and the other half are subjective, leaving maybe a handful of "actual," objective sins.

"HPMOR has flaws" is fine. "Many people find HJPEV annoying" is fine. What I'm pushing against are claims that are /verifiably untrue./
