Eliezer explicitly says in multiple notes throughout the story that Harry is sometimes wrong just generally on the right path. That's further emphasised by him making the wrong conclusions throughout the story. It was very clear he wasn't meant to be 'a being of pure rationality' but someone who aspires to be more rational but is limited. The story goes out of its way to stress that.
