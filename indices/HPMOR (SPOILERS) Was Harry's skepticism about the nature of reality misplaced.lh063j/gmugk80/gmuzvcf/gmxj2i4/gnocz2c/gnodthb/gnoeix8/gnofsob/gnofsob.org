Well it's clearly not based on those giving the prophecies - they are just a conduit that doesn't even remember.

What I'm saying it's that my guess it'd that it can be something 'objective' like huge shifts in magic usage, so things like a big proportion of magic users dying would often count by default as in the quirrel case or things like the founding of hogwarts which caused magic to be streamlined in one portion of the world, or Harry deciding to abuse magic until he defeats death which would be a whole paradigm shift.
