I take your point, and certainly agree that there isn't evidence showing that it is the "stars" that care, but from our limited exposure to prophecies it sure seems like what information is transmitted from the future to the past isn't random. It seems like only things of sufficient "weight" cause the metaphorical pressure forcing prophecies out into the world, and that what is or isn't "weighty" seems to be judged by something like human values. To our uncaring universe there should be no difference in "weight" between two asteroids colliding in a distant galaxy and the destruction of Earth and its sun, and neither event more or less likely to result in a prophecy, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I suppose an answer could be that people able to read omens or produce prophecies are themselves in some way making their own judgments as to what kinds of information is worth finding, and somehow pull out the potential prophecies most relevant to themselves from an almost limitlessly larger set---but I can't say that's the impression I get reading. But who knows, it's all made up anyway!
