  HPMOR is a world where Prophecies and Time Travel exist. The stars quite explicitly DO care. There are literal prophetic "stories" that speak of the stars destruction, and the stars themselves apparently communicate future facts to Centaurs.

There is no real evidence that 'the stars care', just that there is transmission of information from the future to the past. Dumbledore abused prophecies to get to the point where there can be a chance for a good outcome but that's because he used them as a tool. There's a lot of suffering in that world which is already evidence against the stars caring.

Anyway, Harry was correct to question it but for the wrong reasons (as misanalyzing is the theme of his interactions with Dumbledore) - Dumbledore was neither crazy nor believed the world really runs on stories - he was using those masks as a pretence to abuse the prophecies and maybe have a bit of fun on top. The closest related thing he believed in was that the world is ultimately just which you touch on but we don't see evidence for that.
