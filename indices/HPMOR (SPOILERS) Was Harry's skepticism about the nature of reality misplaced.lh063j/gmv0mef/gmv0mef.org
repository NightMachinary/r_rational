This reminds me of this quote from Einstein:

#+begin_quote
  “The fanatical atheists are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who---in their grudge against traditional religion as the "opium of the masses"---cannot hear the music of the spheres.”
#+end_quote

Harry basically trades one set of chains for another. He sticks with what he knows and feels comfortable with. Magic is real? Sure thing. A person with the body mass of a human adult turns into a cat in front of his eyes? No way, Jose. The story shows us right from the start that while operating under some kind of logic (or lack there of), it doesn't operate under the kind of logic which Harry is fluent in.

He basically keeps falling into what I personally call the smart idiot's trap. His whole life he's always had an edge over people with his ridiculous education level. He was never truly shocked to his core and thus believed himself immune to logical fallacies.

I think the whole exchange between Harry and Dumbledore makes more sense if you view it as a language fluency issue. Treat different logics as different languages. Harry can't understand a whole sentence in Weird Logic, because he isn't a native speaker, like Dumbledore is.

Harry might be able to grasp a rough idea for a concept but wouldn't know what it's called without Dumbledore telling him. Dumbledore might be able to explain certain concepts like cliches to give him a basic vocabulary. But if he strung a complete sentence together, Harry would be completely lost. (I believe this is also how oracles work.)

Like take a modern physicist and put him in the Middle Ages, everybody would call him insane. Few would be willing to listen and learn his vocabulary. Of course us modern people would call them morons and laugh at them, but that's because we are already native to modern physics.

In conclusion: Harry's skepticism is misplaced (in hindsight), but you can't expect him to have a magical sense for truth either. Harry's logic 100% makes sense in context, it just so happens to be that his logic system itself is wrong. You can't blame Harry for not figuring this out himself. It's like learning a language without knowing any of the words.
