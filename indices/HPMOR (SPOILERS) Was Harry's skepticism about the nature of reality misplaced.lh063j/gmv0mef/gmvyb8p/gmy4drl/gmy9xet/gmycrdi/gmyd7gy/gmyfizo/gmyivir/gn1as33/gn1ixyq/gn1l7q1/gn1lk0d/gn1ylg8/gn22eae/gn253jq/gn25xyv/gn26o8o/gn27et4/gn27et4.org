The big problem with the simulation hypothesis is the laws of physics in our universe are unlikely to support a simulation the size of the volume we have explored detailed down to the level to which we've explored any of it. Even with massive cheating shortcuts.

So, imprimis, the universe that we're being simulated in pretty much has to have massively different laws of physics, like one of Greg Egan's alt-physics novels, so the inhabitants are not in any way anthropomorphic, and we are astronomically unlikely to be able to derive their characteristics to anything but the vaguest level.

And, secundus, they're actively hiding and trying to not have an effect on their simulation, so inside the simulation they're more like no god than any god.
