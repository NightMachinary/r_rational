But that's the thing, isn't it? We know it's either non unitary measurements, many worlds, non local hidden variables, or superdeterminism... each of these is disturbing in /some/ way, but you have to pick your poison. Personally I find any option more sensible than attributing mystical properties to “measurement” without even defining it properly.
