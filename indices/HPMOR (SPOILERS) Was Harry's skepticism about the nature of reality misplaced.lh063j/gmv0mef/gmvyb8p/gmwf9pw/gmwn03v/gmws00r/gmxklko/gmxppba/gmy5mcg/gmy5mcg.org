I don't think you should take his "God does not play dice" comment too literally, but in general, when it comes to pursuing new hypotheses in the infinite space of possibilities to explain and interpret physical reality, don't we /all/ rely to some extent on the criterion of just what makes more sense to us? Be it elegance, simplicity as per Occam's razor, or in Einstein's case, determinism. We don't have a sure reason to believe any of these things is a /rule of the rules/, so to speak, we just tend to test rules that follow whatever principles we believe apply. It's not an objective viewpoint, but it's not any /less/ objective of believing instead that QM must prescribe true, pure randomness (and it certainly wasn't at the time, before even Bell's theorem was discovered; someone had to ask those questions!).
