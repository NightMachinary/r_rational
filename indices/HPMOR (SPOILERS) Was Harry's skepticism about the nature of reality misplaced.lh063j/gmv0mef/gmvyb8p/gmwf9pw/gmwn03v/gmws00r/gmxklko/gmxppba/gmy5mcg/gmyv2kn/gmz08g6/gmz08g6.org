  It doesn't matter whether things are elegant or not. There are some physicists today who believe in string theory because the math is beautiful, that doesn't mean we should take them seriously.

I agree, insofar as evaluating the /truth/ of an hypothesis goes. But before you get to test a hypothesis, you need to formulate it. And for each phenomenon there is an infinite space of possibilities that would explain it; the idea itself of a "law" restricts them immensely, because for example it precludes the possibility that the universe has a gigantic lookup table that says "if X happens, then Y follows" without rhyme or reason. As a general rule we expect a certain amount of symmetry and simplicity in these laws. Nothing that we know of says it must be so! Similarly, God or not, Einstein was expressing a fundamental distaste with the notion that the universe could not be governed by deterministic causal relations. As far as principles go, it's not too awful; and to a point QM obeys it too, save for the weird anomaly of measurement that rightfully jumps to the eye as needing a further explanation. Of course it could be an entirely wrong gut reaction, but Einstein didn't claim "I feel it is wrong, therefore this proves it is so". He felt it was wrong, investigated, and made a testable prediction. It turned out that the test proved his expectation wrong, but we still learned a lot from it. And to this day we still don't have a final answer on whether QM is truly random or not.
