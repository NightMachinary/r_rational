You have a point in general, but I think your wishes here color your perception regarding souls. You need to more accurately note what evidence we've seen that is relevant and what simple models could support that evidence.

Ghosts, animagi, human transformations etc. tell us that it is possible to think without a physical brain, but only so long as there is a clear source of magic supporting it. We never see a muggle thinking without a brain. Draco will tell you that it's because muggles don't have souls. That may be true. It is also possible that the magic of the transformation includes a part about thinking without a brain, creating a brain construct using magic. There is no reason to jump from that to an afterlife, except for wishful thinking.

We don't know that the universe cares about human emotions, we know that something apparently "listens" for specific combinations of thoughts and actions from specific kinds of people, and also that something gives magical animals and plants their characteristics. That only points to the existence of an afterlife if you want it to point there, if you're working from the bottom line. You could also say that all of this points to "souls" being a universal fuel for magic, being burned after death to power regular spellwork and magical plants/animals' abilities in the world. This sounds horrible, so you wouldn't want it to be true, but it doesn't make (qualitatively) less sense than the afterlife. Your bottom line says what you use as evidence, and what you ignore as it doesn't fit.

I think JK wanted a story where souls and the afterlife are real, and yet there is no clear evidence for them, only hints. I think this is by design. She knows concrete evidence would've changed society drastically, and she doesn't want to write a story occurring in a society that different. I also think a rational person living in a world where god decided to mislead them is going to get misled. Rationality doesn't lead you anywhere the evidence doesn't exist for.

In general, Harry is wrong often (mostly about Quirrell), but we don't see the results of all of his mistakes untill the last ~20 chapters, so it doesn't feel like he's wrong often enough. It is also true that after his first serious mistake in the experiments (thinking spells are a crutch that can be ignored), his conclusions regarding magic are often true (patronus and dementors, the cloak, partial transfiguration) , though at least the cloak is given as a riddle that he is in a unique position to solve. I think a lot of us would like more of a story of Hermione and him making mistakes together and learning the secrets of magic, but that isn't the story we got. If you'd write something like that, I promise to read it.
