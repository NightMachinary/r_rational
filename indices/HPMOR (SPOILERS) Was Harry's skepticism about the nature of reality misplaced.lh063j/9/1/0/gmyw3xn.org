I'm more critiquing the theme and narrative of the story rather then Harry's specific thoughts process within HPMOR.

Basically regarding updating his model of reality, I don't think he was a good rationalist. And I feel instead of the narrative addressing this it basically rewards Harry with being right.

The way HPMOR handled souls is a good example. Why are afterlife souls less improbable then non afterlife magical constructs?

We know animagi exist. As well as ghosts, human to animal transfiguration etc.

This implies there is a part of the mind that exists outside the physical brain. Otherwise how could yhese things exist.

Additionally we know magic responds to the emotions, thoughts, and beliefs of human minds. So there is something special about human consciousness that the universe treats differently. So really, the likelihood of souls existing is greater then magical constructs.

But ultimately that situation doesn't matter, it's just an example. I would like there to be souls.

It would force Harry as a rationalist to fundamentally alter his worldview and confront his deeply held transhumanist beliefs. That would make a more interesting story.

Btw, that's why I liked Harry Potter and the Philosophical Zombie.

Bottom line, Harry gets rewarded for being a poor rationalist by the narrative. When he makes leaps in logic about important stuff, he is rarely wrong.
