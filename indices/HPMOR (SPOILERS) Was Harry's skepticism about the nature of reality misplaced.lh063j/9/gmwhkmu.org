It makes sense from Harry's perspective to be some sort of materialist reductionist in the beginning of the story. But as soon as he discovered that magic existed, he should have started questioning his fundamental notions on how the world worked.

Which he never really did. Instead of updating his model to fit the new evidence he basically handwaived anything that messed with his worldview.

And the narrative sort of supported him. Harry's random guesses based on his outdated model of reality turned out be true many times.

For example, in HP Canon souls exist. The existence of animagi, ghosts, the resurrection stone heavily implies this. You could argue the technicalities but the intention of JK Rowling was for those to exist.

Wouldn't it be interesting if Harry had to grapple with that fact? He would have to reevaluate his entire transhumabist worldview, as well as the fundamental tenets of the universe. It would be interesting seeing a rational secular character deal with that.

But the author basically handwaived it away as them being some sort of simulated mind state backup.

Allowing Harry to not have any real challenge to his worldview. Basically his preconceived biases were proven right. Plus it allowed him to be more knowledgeable then Dumbledore.

To answer your question, in a canon like world his skepticism would be misplaced. And he would be the equivalent of a flat earth atheist.

In HPMOR, Harry is right. He never really has to update his worldview significantly. The world is arranged conveniently to line up with Harry's biases.
