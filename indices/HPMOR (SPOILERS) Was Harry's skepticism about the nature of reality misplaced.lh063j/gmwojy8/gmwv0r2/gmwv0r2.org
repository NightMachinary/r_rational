I mean, he has a huge moment where he was clearly willing and /desiring/ to believe in souls; he was sobbing when he thought that no one had really died. When he finds out that ghosts are just magic afterimages, he's incredibly upset. If the evidence was there, his desire to see an afterlife defiantly outweighed any bias towards old beliefs.

After that, the arguments seemed sensible:

- Wizards didn't have any more solid proof of an immortal soul than paintings or ghosts, both of which couldn't learn, grow, or change, and were thus not real in any important sense.

- If the soul existed and could think, brain damage wouldn't change a person

- If there was an afterlife, you'd expect to see more from the other side than a single veil that has sounds like the voices of the dead, or a single lost artifact that people say could bring back the dead
