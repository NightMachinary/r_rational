right, harry made a wrong assumption about Dumbledore's beliefs based on his behavior (which D was being intentionally confusing with to throw people off)

However, I do think that Harry is consistently too quick to return to "scientific" explanations for things like Souls when he already knows his entire model of the world is wrong. He hasn't fully internalized the real impact of what he learned in chapter 1. He knows animagus exist, yet he still says things like "the brain is the mind, brain damage proves souls can't exist." This is clearly false given a woman can turn into a cat and keep thinking - he even notices this contradiction the first time he experiences - but he still fails to update his model and question other related assumptions.

Given that his base assumptions are fundamentally flawed at a very deep level, he should be much more willing to listen to the opinions of experienced authorities who DO know about magic. Harry is pattern matching on afterlife = religion = dumb muggles, a behavior he criticizes others for, including Dumbledore, but fails to notice in himself.
