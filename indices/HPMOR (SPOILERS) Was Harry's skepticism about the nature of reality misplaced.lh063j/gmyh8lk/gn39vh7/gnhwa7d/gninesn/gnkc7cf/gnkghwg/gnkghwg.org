  isn't really a coherent model of any logicaly posible universe.

  If you try to munchkin magic systems that work like people think you quickly realize vague verbal ideas can't possibly be a perfect model of any universe at all cause they aren't even complete

woah that's a really big claim you are making about the possibility space for all conceivable universes. we are going to have to step that back and dig in a bit because claiming that no other universe can function this way is pretty broad and I don't see how it can possibly be supported, given that we are positing worlds that work fundamentally differently from our own.

  Harry is correct when pointing out their mistakes, even if he doesn't have the clarity necessary to see his own.

I definitely agree with your final sentence here. Harry may be pointing out real flaws in wizard philosophy, and he also is blind to some of his own cultural bias.

I don't think brain damage is conclusive. You are calling souls "extra stuff" but what I'm suggesting is that you could have an entire universe where the fundamental substrate is Mental, and the Physical is just a projection. The Physical still interacts with the mental, of course, and there may be rigid rules around how this works, but the fundamental nature of this world could be wholly based on information and consciousness, not matter.

Think of it like players in a video game that has fairly realistic physics. Yes, the game has rules, and when you are hit by a car in the game the physics simulates damage to your "body" when is then translated into reduced ability to interact with the physics engine. But under it all is just code - pure information.

If Magic works like Harry suspects - that the metaphor for a computer program holds true - it's FAR more likely that the physics they experience are a restricted subset of that program, not that the "magic" program was built /within/ the physics. The magic engine is an admin layer that supersedes the physics engine and grants limited access to the code itself.

This seems like a perfectly plausible way to build a universe, and not logically incomplete or inconsistent, and it entirely throws out all notions of using physics and material interactions to understand the fundamental nature of reality. Running physical experiments in a simulated world only tells you /how the physics engine of the game you are playing was coded/, it tells you nothing about the operating system or architecture of the fundamental stratum.

This is why I think Harry is not adequately grokking how little he knows, and leans much too heavily on ideas from his prior context which are based on a fundamentally flawed model of the world. All he knows are what other players figured out about the rules of the game game through trial and error; these are all but useless when trying to hack the code of the root universe itself.
