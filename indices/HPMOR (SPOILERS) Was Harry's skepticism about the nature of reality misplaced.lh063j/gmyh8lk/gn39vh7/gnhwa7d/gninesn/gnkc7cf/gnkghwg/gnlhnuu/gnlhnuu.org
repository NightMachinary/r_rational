I agree with a lot of what you say but not some stuff like for example

>I'm suggesting is that you could have an entire universe where the fundamental substrate is Mental, and the Physical is just a projection.

So like i think that it's possible that the physics observed are a special case of whatever the actual rules of the universe are.Its in fact like a good hypothesis.Like to me the thing in eliezer's author's note makes sense.And that opens up to a lot of posibilities.

But I don't think that one posibility is that the world is fundamentally made of mental stuff.

Mental stuff is complicated, it feels simple from the inside but its necesarilly made of other stuff that isn't mental.

True there are definitely possible universes, computable universes even , that have rules that a person could look at and think of them as stuff like "justice" being part of the laws of the universe.

But like there is an infinite amount of universes like that with completely different rules and none of them completely correspond to people's intuitions.

Cause people's intuitions are vague , and the universe can't be fundamentally vague that's mixing the map and the territory so to speak. Like if I wanted to program a simulation based on the description of the typical vague concept based magic system people like to exploit in the munckinism thread there are unlimited simulations with really different rules, not just internally but in terms of actual outcomes, as the questions the people in those threads ask show.\\
It feels like there's some coherent idea of a world with fundamental justice would look like, I've seen people discussing fiction on the internet implicitly talk like that's a thing.\\
But I think that is not true, or at least not obviously true until you start explicitly trying to get more coherent philosophical views out of your intuitions, if it was it would constrain your expectations more, and DM wouldn't need to basically arbitrarily decide what the sword that can only be lifted by just people does when [insert convoluted edge case here]

And anyway rules like that are wayyy more complicated.

You need lots of evidence to actually be convinced the universe works like that, compared to simpler ways that the universe could work. Cause otherwise there's always a more complicated model that overfits to your observations, so you need some working form of Occam's razor.But obviously that doesn't mean that no evidence can convince you the world doesn't have that kind of rules, that's not how good reasoning works.\\
And in hpmor there's definitely some way what people think affects stuff like dementors, and how spells seem to work the way their inventors expect to work.

Going back to the souls thing. Human minds are affected by brain damage.Maybe like in the "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie" fic wizards don't get brain damage,and like their minds are actually running in something else than brains. But like this actually would look differently than what we observe in muggles(and well the fic actually goes whith this).

Saying brain damage affects people's minds in complicated ways and the activity of the brain mirrors the behavior of the mind but minds don't actually correspond with brains requires the thing that minds are actually made of to have really complicated rules for that correspondence.It is more likely in the world of Hpmor than our own give the evidence that Harry has seen.But it's still not the class of hypothesis I would bet on after reading the entire book. Saying that brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases and torture and obliviation affects people's minds but somehow that damage is not permanent and they are fine after "death"(which brings an insane amount of edge cases depending on the rules of when people dies happens, and like if it coincides with the ghost thing seems like would require extra rules to prevent exploits like filling the afterlife with Hermione copies by reviving and killing her, she wasn't even braindead yet) requires insanely more complicated rules and is maybe not even coherent[had a few paragraphs about the coherent part and my model of identity and stuff but post already is too long and probably shouldn't start juggling too many lines of discussion at the same time]

Anyway those are separate things that require separate evidence.

Evidence that harry doesn't really has.

And I think that if there was really obviously strong evidence people wouldn't be acting like normal about death.

Acting like normal about dead is not at all like being in the same epistemic state about the afterlife than about whether other countries exist.People acting like that are in fact some evidence against the afterlife, it discards a whole class of obvious afterlife hypothesis(plus I mean duh conservation of expected evidence).
