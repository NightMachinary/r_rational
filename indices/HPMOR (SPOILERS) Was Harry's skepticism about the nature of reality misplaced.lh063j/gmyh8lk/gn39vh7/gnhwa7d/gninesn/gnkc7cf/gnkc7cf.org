I think that while I agree what this sencence says I disagree whith what I think you mean.

Obiously in the hpmor universe there are some ways where how wizards think affects the world. Thing is minds are complicated, this mechanism will also have to be complicated. That is because minds themselves are pretty complicated and have lots of internal moving parts and can't posibly be just fundamental.

The way people intuitively think about the universe whith animism and things like justice being fundamental while does vaguely correspond to ways the universe could work it just isn't really a coherent model of any logicaly posible universe.

If you try to munchkin magic systems that work like people think you quickly realize vague verbal ideas can't possibly be a perfect model of any universe at all cause they aren't even complete, they don't actually tell you what happens if you do x or y thing , and there's lots of nuace and details that could work in very diferent ways depending on what the actual rules of the universe are. Your mind is alowed to not have all the answers but the universe isn't.

Anyway going back to the brain thing. Well if you think about how souls or whatever could work there are lots of problems.

Mainly that well affecting the brain does affect people's minds. Like you can't claim this is not the case, then your model doesn't explain why I can affect minds by messing whith brains. So like even if there's some extra soul stuff or something if I cause you brain damage you are still going to be brain damaged whith all the corresponding changes to your mind. I mean because that is what we have observed so far. Maybe not in some weird edge case that doesn't come up arround mugles(for example voldemort would probably be fine if you gave him brain damage, cause he does have something like a soul) . Hpmor is not set in a fantasy world completely unrelated to our own.

Also It seems like having anything like the usual idea of an afterlife would take a really complicated and purposely designed mechanism for this to work, and would take an insane amount of patches for it to work in a nice way, even only for the edge cases I can think of, much less the edge cases that actually happen and would be unnecessarily more complicated that a simpler approach which was more obious. I mean unless muggles don't have souls and wizards do and all of the evidence for brains = minds comes up differently when tested on wizards.

The story even touches in lots of the problems of this. Harry exploits one of the flaws of voldemort's attempts at making something like this to defeat him for example.

Neville's parents are permanently damaged, turning into a cat presumably wouldn't help then so seems weird to assume dying would. And pretty much anyone that dies in a way that slowly degrades their minds , which is most people nonadays is doomed. Maybe even going to experience a fate worse that death.

I mean maybe the whole ghost thing is a side effect of someone's attempt at making an afterlife or something like that but if so it probably only works for wizards (I mean muggles don't leave ghosts) that die in certain kinds of circumstances. Or maybe it's just a big cryonics like thing, and people are stored for future revival somewhere. Or it's a failure and it's a have no mouth and must scream kind of thing.

Or its actually just the result of whatever thing keeps track of wizard thoughts to affect other stuff breaking or something like that.

Figuring that out is pretty important, might imply some policy changes in hospitals and life in general are necessary depending on the details .

Thing is this is not obious and wizards are not acting like they really believe this or any other form of afterlife. They act exactly like mugles act about death. They are doing something wrong both if they are right about the afterlife existing and if they are wrong. Harry is correct when pointing out their mistakes, even if he doesn't have the clarity necessary to see his own.
