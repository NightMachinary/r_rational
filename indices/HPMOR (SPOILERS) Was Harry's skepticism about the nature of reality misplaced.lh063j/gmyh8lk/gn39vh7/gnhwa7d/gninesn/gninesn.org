  Well the brain argument still holds up.

I feel like a lot of people seriously missed the point of "all physics and causality as we understand it is out the window."

I totally agree that in muggle space there's no correlation between belief in afterlife and its probable reality.

However, the "brain = mind" argument implies that harry is still operating off assumptions about the base nature of reality that are fundamentally incorrect. There's not just some tidy explanation for animagus and magic in general like it's advanced technology that is consistent with prior models; the models are wrong at their core, and so you can no longer make predictions based on them.

Harry can no longer take as reliable the assumption that the physical reality he knows and observes is the base system the universe runs on, and further whatever does lie underneath magic (if there is any consistent system at all) is clearly tuned to respond to conscious minds in ways physics do not.

Elizier implied this in a post script comment once, but it's much more plausible to assume that base reality is magical and tied to sentience somehow, and that muggles and physics are a restricted subset of that reality, than that magic exists as a subset of physics.

Given this, it's not at all safe to say the physical brain = the mind based merely on brain damage as evidence, especially when there are clear counterexamples like animagi, metamorphmagi, polujuice, and mental magic like legilimancy, confundus, ghosts, etc.

Even if harry is right in being cynical that ghosts are non sentient "afterimages" they are still non corporeal minds.

Does all this mean harry should immediately jump to the conclusion that there is a happy afterlife? Of course not! But he should be slow to judge those with more magical experience, and not at all trust the modes of thought that applied when physics was the only law.
