Well "the world runs on stories" is pretty vague and not really an explanation.And not actually how the world in hpmor seems to work by what it was seen on the story even in pretty vague terms.Plus whatever model of the world is actually correct has to actually explain the muggle world and physics.So you can't just throw that out.\\
And throwing out your priors whenever you encounter surprising evidence is not how to correctly reason.\\
You certainly shouldn't throw out occams razor.\\
Harry does fail at sufficiently changing his mind in lots of things.\\
He certainly doesn't have the right attitude to the evidence sometimes.

But I feel like what you are thinking is really not what he should have done, and in fact, the conclusion he arrives to in the end is not what you are implying.He should definitely have investigated certain stuff like the veil or ghosts in more detail just in case(though the ghost thing is a bit dangerous, shouldn't ask a ghost if it's self aware in the sense of being aware of their own awareness just in case, no need to repeat the hat incident if that was actually a thing and not the hat messing with harry).But the concussion is not "the world runs on stories", or even "the universe cares".I can imagine some worlds that worked in ways that could be described like that but that's not really how the world we see in hpmor seems to work.At least not to the point Dumbledore seemed to believe , and likely also not at the level Dumbledore actually believes.Which are different, Dumbledore doesn't actually believe the world runs on cliches, he just has lots of prophecies and has a sense of how those usually work, and also believes the world is fundamentally just.

For example, he doesn't tell Harry his mentor is doomed cause it's a cliche , he says that cause there's a specific prophecy.
