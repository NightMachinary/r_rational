Right...but whether prophecies are intended to be used for "good" or "not," to determine what constitutes a "big event" for magic users (like the defeat of Tom Riddle the First) seems like it would require some sort of exercise of human-like judgment. If, that is, you go by the characters "weight" explanation, as least as best I can remember it, and don't put it down to those giving the prophecies selecting for things interesting to them.
