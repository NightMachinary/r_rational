My suggestion- have lots of oneshots.

Have him seek to gradually gain the influence he needs to escape using the loopholes in the program.

Like for now, he needs to find some way to support his colleague so they can both survive despite extra resources being used. So have him seek to manipulate the economic aspects of star trek to gain those resources on the black market.

Have him, in the meanwhile, face a series of tricky challenges in the setting that he has trouble meeting, like examinations, space aliens, monsters, crazy planets to add dramatic tension and showcase your favorite episode's silly points.
