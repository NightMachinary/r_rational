I've been trying to make this one work for a couple days, and it's just not doing it. I'd like some advice on what's wrong with it, if anyone has some advice to offer.

I really like the core idea, which is that (spoilers if you've come to the comments first) the Star Trek universe is inconsistent, and someone who is oblivious to the fact that they're in a simulation stumbles on those inconsistencies. I like the idea of a universe built by the lowest bidder with a bunch of things that were just hastily patched and not designed to survive scrutiny. And I think I also like the idea of someone living in a simulation trying to break free into the "real" world.

But I don't know that I know how to write this, and I'm not really sure that I know where I'm going with the story as yet. Originally I'd intended to just end it with him finding his twin, but I don't think that's a satisfactory conclusion, because the central conflict is that Beckham is a "realist".

Oh, and I don't know whether the story would be better or worse if it were just set on the Enterprise with Wesley as the protagonist and a bunch of extreme fans playing at being Picard/Riker/Data, etc.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks.
