Well, it's all dialogue-exposition. Maybe that's the problem. Maybe it's too much information just dumped out and needs to be eased into. Or maybe the opposite - if you don't want to fart about before hitting the punchline so you can start the story proper, you might need to drop the reader in with far less explanation and let them pick up the pieces.

For me, I would have been able to keep up with far, far less preamble. But you'd need to choose who your audience is to make that call.

EDIT: That said, I didn't actually think it was that bad. Just trying to think how it could be improved for me.
