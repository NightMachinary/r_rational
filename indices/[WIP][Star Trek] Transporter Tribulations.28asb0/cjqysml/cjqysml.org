I think I've determined what it is that I don't like about this story: It doesn't actually benefit at all from being "Star Trek" related.

In the beginning of the story, we are presented with a world that is clearly "Fan Fiction, set in the world of Star Trek". References to Star Trek are made, extrapolations about the implications of various technologies are made, and explanations for inconsistencies are derived.

Then, the story takes a sharp turn. It gives up on its premise. It decides that there is no way in which to reconcile the inconsistencies, and so it becomes an entirely different story: You have not been reading "Fan Fiction, set in the world of Star Trek", you have actually been reading "Science Fiction, set in the world full of people playing-out Star Trek Fan Fiction". There is no-longer any point to there having been Star Trek references in the beginning of the story. One can't use knowledge of Star Trek to extrapolate information about the world, so there was no point in mentioning it.
