Fair enough. I think this one is indefinitely consigned to the "not working" folder, in part for the reasons that you mention. I think that if it were longer, it could turn into a critique of Star Trek as idealistic escape during a fallen era. Or if it were shorter, the simulation aspect could be cut, and the Federation really could be hiding their immense powers for adequately explained reasons I can't think of off the top of my head. Or maybe it could be changed into someone actually making transhumanist breakthroughs that actually change the Federation on a fundamental level.

But it doesn't really work in its current form, and it's not really a complete story. So yes, it's going in the "not working" folder, and doesn't show many signs of moving out of it.
