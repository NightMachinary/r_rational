/Cloud Atlas/ was mind-bending not for the intrigue but for the way the narrative is layered and structured, up to having six parts written in six different styles and genre, set in six different time periods, including one that's literally written in a completely made up and barely comprehensible future version of English, each somehow connecting to the others.

Greg Egan's /Orthogonal/ trilogy was mind bending because it just invents a whole fucking fictional system of physics and then builds the entire plot on it. If you know enough quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and special relativity you can probably make enough sense of it to enjoy it in full.
