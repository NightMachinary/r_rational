I'd also recommend /Blindsight/ by Peter Watts, though you might've read it already. It precipitated a crisis of ------------------------, which is something that happens very, very rarely.

PS: I removed crux of the crisis, since that word in itself might constitute a spoiler and diminish the effect of /Blindsight/.
