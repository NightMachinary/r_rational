VNs:

Umineko - clever and fairly rational protagonist (although he doesn't really start to shine until the second chapter) and an equally clever (but much less rational) antagonist. Lots of meta commentary on the mystery genre. There's a lot to say about this one, but I think its best to go in knowing as little as possible. It's not perfect (although the manga addresses most of my issues with the VN's ending aside from how to two characters introduced late in the story end up being seriously underused), but it's one of my favorite works of fiction.

Raging Loop - very intelligent and rational protagonist, lots of strategy and mind games (the setting is based on Mafia/Werewolf), iterative time loops. What more could you want? I only just started the second route, but I'm really liking it so far.

Anime:

Kaguya-sama: Love is War - a romantic comedy based around absurdly over-the-top psychological battles between by the two protagonists. Nice if you're looking for a lighter take on the subject without all the MURDER.
