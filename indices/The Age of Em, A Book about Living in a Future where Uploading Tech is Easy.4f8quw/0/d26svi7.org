So here's the website for Robin Hanson's new book. I'm just letting people here know about it so they get the chance to pre-order it before May 1st.

For those of you who don't remember him, he's one of the people whose name you'd frequently hear whenever you read about Yudkowsky's professional work.

Here's a link to [[https://intelligence.org/ai-foom-debate/][The Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom Debate]].

It's not rational fiction, but it's a (text)book I think a lot of people here would be interested in checking out.
