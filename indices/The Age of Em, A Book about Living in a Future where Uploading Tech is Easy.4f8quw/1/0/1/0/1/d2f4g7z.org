Sorry, haven't been on reddit for a bit. This is one of the (many) bad failure modes in the futures Doc sees--and one of the reasons he hasn't been pushing cybernetics or uploading tech this time. In my fictional world, and plausibly in ours, profit motive + corporations + global externality evasion + uploading tech = humans lose. The Grs'thnk have strong restrictions on externalities and AI, and are still worried. DASI is just starting to put together infrastructure to sidestep the problem, while Black Swan distracts everyone with the more flamboyant and obvious task of killing off the most problematical of the existing corporations to buy time and change the incentive landscape.
