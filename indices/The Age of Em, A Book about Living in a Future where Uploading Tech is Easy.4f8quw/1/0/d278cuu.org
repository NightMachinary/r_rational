Just pointing out that I'm not the author of the book (because you using the pronoun "you're") and he's not saying that people should be behaving the same way as an em.

However he does seem to.../gloss/ over the more disturbing aspects, as if he's saying that we shouldn't judge them. So I sort of agree with you, but I'm planning on buying and reading the book to see if there's better reasons/phrasing which support his arguments.
