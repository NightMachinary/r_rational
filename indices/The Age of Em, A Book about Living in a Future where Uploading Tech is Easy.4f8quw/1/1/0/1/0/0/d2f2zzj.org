  I don't see what your analogy has to do with creating people who want to do perfectly legal and productive things.
#+end_quote

Not everything that's legal and productive is /good/. Hopefully, it's not necessarily bad, but that still leaves a lot of other stuff.

To pick a silly-but-standard analogy, if half the population became obsessed with paperclips, they'd create a bunch of paperclips for no good reason. Paperclips aren't evil, as long as you ignore people getting buried in paperclip-slides or what have you; they're just kind of pointless.

Similarly, if most of humanity was replaced with workaholics - not "normal range of human variance" workaholics, beings that can't conceive of anything else - they'd spend a lot of time doing boring, pointless work. Not for some greater goal, either - presumably, most of the economy would consist of stuff they need to do the pointless, boring work of making it.

(And, of course, they'd /make/ the laws, which means "legal and productive things" could mean "grinding up your fellow workers to make hammers", because they're all psychopaths.)

  (as Hanson argues) ...
#+end_quote

Hanson believes that everyone will become as efficient workers as possible.

He argues we should still be happy for them/they won't be that different from us, Scott Alexander argues otherwise.

Hanson argues that we currently exist in a very unusual time period; the ability to produce workers has fallen far behind the production of resources those workers require, leading to vast amounts of excess resources. (A period he poetically calls "the Dreamtime".) Computers, on the other hand, can be produced in exactly the amounts and to exactly the specifications required for any project; meaning there's an overwhelming incentive to do so for any given project, as long as the project is maximally profitable.

  That assumes scarcity. I instead assume that the ability to create infinite workers who want only to work will forever guarantee the existence of those experiences, by providing more resources than we have now, and the existing stock people will still exist.
#+end_quote

Modern workers produce much more, per person-hour, than they did before. Most people hate work. Yet working hours have not reduced. Why?

Because how much you "need" to work is based on how much other people work. That's what competition /is/.

  ...murder them for not working...
#+end_quote

Yes, Hanson believes people will be "murdered for not working" - specifically, they will run out of resources to support themselves, whether physical resources or processing power on some server rack somewhere. And then they (or their batteries) will starve.

This is a real thing that actually happens, so, you know ...

Compared to the overwhelming advantage of an organism designed specifically for producing profit, why would anyone /give/ resources to a human? They have nothing to trade.

If the answer is "altruism", consider whether altruists are likely to have higher profit margins than non-altruists.
