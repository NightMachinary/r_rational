  Even if ems invent boat-portable spaceship manufacturies, you have no money (and the speed of the economy means any money you had before is probably worthless by now), and your boat is worthless because they're vacuuming up the oceans. You have nothing to give and nothing to trade.

This seems to be predicated on the idea that a modified em is so much better than you that it is impossible for you (or your loyal fork) to design an assemble before the em hegemony takes over the world and officially declares they own all matter and vacuums up the ocean out from under that boat you likely didn't have time to buy. Which is possible, but if its true I expect the world to simply belong to the first em which was created by Chinese or Koreans or whoever cared the least about the risks and is probably a faulty upload and thus more irrational than human minds are usually. So it puts a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3swf54/short_story_on_ai_a_cognitive_discontinuity/][mystery module]] in some design its creators can't afford to not use if they can even perceive the module and that module starts assembling super UAVs and nanomachines son and you can see where this goes.

I don't necessarily believe in Eliezer-style foom but I do think that if you are running at a thousand-to-one (which is easily believable going by the brains "clockspeed" vs electronics) that, well. I could put in a month and some change sidereal and have equivalent to 100 years design work on say, that assembler.

Civilization as we know it is built on the assumption there is things you can't do yourself. Given our current progress, the extra time ems have suggests it is reasonable personal manufacturing technology was developed before ems were in any position to essentially take over the world (I'm pretty sure that's a prerequisite to vacuuming up the ocean by any name) if only because the alpha test ems were locked in a lab. +And the inventors of the technology are not Mass Effect Cerberus.+

So you don't need money because you aren't asking for permission in the first place, because most humans don't ask permission when the alternative is clearly death - this seems self evident. I also assumed you were an upload yourself otherwise you'd need food, so you do have some measure of time to design your manufacturing bootstrapping plan if not the spacecraft, and don't need meat life support with all that entails.

Anyway. I guess what I'm saying is that if we assume regulations will fail if non-regulators can do better, then the world will belong to whoever rushes out a duct taped unstable em first and blindly prints their shiny blueprints nobody understands (because any trojans have had hundreds of years of subtlety applied). And Hanson's, or any other, world will only exist insofar as that singular mind allows it.

If we can avoid /that/? I'm willing to bet we can avoid the far slower threat of ems turning the planet into manufacturing materials - certainly to the extent of unmodified human uploads finding a haven or escaping the planet, at worst.
