"Compared to the overwhelming advantage of an organism designed specifically for producing profit, why would anyone give resources to a human? They have nothing to trade."

I think the clear answer to this is that if they won't /give/, then you have to /take/. If race-to-the-bottom ems are the next big enemy of humanity, humanity needs to get back to the roots of what it does best. Hatred, war, and genocide.
