Anything other than copying volunteers of people seems unethical to me unless we start bringing utilitarianism into this. I would think brainwashing or otherwise conditioning someone (assuming this is what you meant by "naturally") in a way that effectively makes them a slave would be just as controversial as constructing someone to assume a slave role.
