Typically, when one thinks of a slave, they think of someone who is forced to do something, whether they want to or not. Someone that has no choice. I would argue that if the sentient is /allowed/ to not work, then it isn't a slave - even if it is designed to want to work, and is thus unlikely to use that right.

I think it is important to have the same rules for minds that arise without your interference as you do for those that are created.

If creating a mind designed to only want to work is wrong, it seems to me that is the same as saying that a naturally arisen person (i.e. such as a person made of meat you had nothing to do with) that only wants to work is wrong. It is only a step further into the real world and, say, BDSM is wrong. Although I guess the analogy is weak because working improves things and BDSM doesn't.

You might have some deeper reasoning behind treating creations differently. If not, let me propose an ironic analogy: "A white person who wants to work is not a slave. A black person who wants to work is a slave." Unfortunately, the analogy is a bit off-- differently colored people are actually able to be told apart. A theoretical perfect edit/creation that only wants to work and an upload of a theoretical perfect worker would not be.

Food for thought.

EDIT: The TLDR is: I don't think that a person devoted to working is wrong. (If anything, they are less wrong [heh] than people who find work painful.)

I absolutely do not think "it just is" is an acceptable argument for why creating such a person is wrong if you acknowledge their existence by other means is /not/ wrong.

If you have some other argument, of course, I would love to hear it.
