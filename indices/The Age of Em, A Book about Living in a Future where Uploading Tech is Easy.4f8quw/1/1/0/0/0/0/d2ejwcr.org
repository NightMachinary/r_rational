First, I agree with you that uploading or copying volunteers is moral. And if a volunteer agrees to be altered, I suppose I would accept that as well (although it gets questionable again if the person is unwell in some way, economic duress, etc.). So the only thing we seem to disagree on is involuntary creation/modification of minds with the intention to enslave. Practically speaking, I don't think that's a flaw in Robin Hanson's projection.

  If this is immoral then I have to ask, are created nonhuman AI workers immoral too?

Right, I think creating any sentient being with the intention of enslaving it is immoral. I'll preemptively agree that the level of sentience intelligence/self-awareness is problematic difficult to pin down, though.

  Furthermore, most people must work to achieve their terminal values, among them usually survival. If it is within your power when creating a new intelligence to make one that derives satisfaction from necessary work, but you instead make it suffer because that is human 'factory default', doesn't that make you a "malicious god"?

I'd also agree that if you're going to create a slave, it's better to make them derive satisfaction from their role, otherwise as you say, it's cruel.

  I feel compelled to mention here this is something I would be perfectly comfortable doing to a copy of myself.

I would use the exact opposite (not about being modified necessarily, but being created with a utility function that makes me a slave).
