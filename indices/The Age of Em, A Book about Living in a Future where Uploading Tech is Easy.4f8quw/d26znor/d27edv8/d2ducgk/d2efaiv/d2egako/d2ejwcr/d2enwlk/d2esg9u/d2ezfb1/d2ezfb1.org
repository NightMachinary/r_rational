  Out of curiosity, do you think these AGI or modified uploaded humans should be property?
#+end_quote

I don't think any intelligence should be property. But what I'm thinking there is probably not what you are thinking.

If you own something, you can do anything you want to it. If you don't, you can't - you need the permission of the owner, in this case the intelligence.

I do think you shouldn't change an existing intelligence against its will. You should not attempt to force it to do things that it doesn't want to do. If it will let you change its utility function, then I see nothing wrong with that.

I think that creating a new intelligence or editing a copy with a utility function and running it isn't wrong either, regardless of what that function is. It doesn't exist yet-- it is just a potential, a file - a saved copy of klassekatze.

Once you have started it running, then I consider it a person - and you don't own it. If it wants to do anything you say, though, that is fine.

The first thing that comes to mind here is what you said earlier:

  I would use the exact opposite (not about being modified necessarily, but being created with a utility function that makes me a slave).
#+end_quote

This issue doesn't come up because unless you literally give your mind away, that would be theft, to put it lightly.

I think my position works pretty well both morally and pragmatically. Unless I've missed something, it doesn't allow any of the nasty slavery that has ever come up in human history nor anything I can think of. It doesn't allow "skynet" either: in the event you do it wrong and a created AGI doesn't actually want to do whatever, it is legally protected and doesn't have that as motivation to cause problems. The same applies to edited human minds.
