Copying non-volunteers doesn't even enter the picture because there are thousands that would volunteer and you only need a few or even one to make unlimited workers.

I don't really see the difference between copying a volunteer that likes work and copying a volunteer that doesn't and then making that copy like work.

I feel compelled to mention here this is something I would be perfectly comfortable doing to a copy of myself. I don't see it in the same context as brainwashing a pre-existing person because the copy to be modified has never existed as a distinct individual and in fact would never exist if I didn't start them up post-edit. If this is immoral then I have to ask, are created nonhuman AI workers immoral too? If it is about level of sentience or humanlikeness, are you using a dartboard to pick where you are drawing your line?

Furthermore, most people must work to achieve their terminal values, among them usually survival. If it is within your power when creating a new intelligence to make one that derives satisfaction from necessary work, but you instead make it suffer because that is human 'factory default', doesn't that make you a "malicious god"?

But suppose for the sake of argument we declare that any modification of the mind is immoral, even with the consent of the mind in question. This is a world of seven billion. There is almost certainly someone who is an ideal worker who desires no recompense already in existence through no manipulation on our part. Copy them with their agreement and we're done.

If that too is immoral, then I think we have long, /long/ passed the point where it is more about forcing your terminal values, morals, and beliefs on others (by which I mean the volunteers) and not really about helping anyone at all.
