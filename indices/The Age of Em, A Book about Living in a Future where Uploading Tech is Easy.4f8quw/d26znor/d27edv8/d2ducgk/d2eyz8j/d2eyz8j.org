Consider a psychopath. They see nothing wrong with killing. Nevertheless, them killing people is wrong.

More generally, there's the issue of competition - if (as Hanson argues) regular and indeed irregular humans will be /entirely/ replaced with the most efficient version of ems, then that means experiences we view as valuable - love, art, a sense of wonder and awe, and so on - will be eradicated in favour of only actions that are economically productive.

EDIT: Scott Alexander argues this second point somewhat in /Meditations on Moloch/, while the first point is /kind/ of argued in the /Fun Theory/ sequence on LessWrong (although I believe it was removed when they were adapted to book format.)
