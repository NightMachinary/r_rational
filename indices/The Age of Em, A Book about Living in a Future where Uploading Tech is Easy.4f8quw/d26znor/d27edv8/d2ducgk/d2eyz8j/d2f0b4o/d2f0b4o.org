  Consider a psychopath. They see nothing wrong with killing. Nevertheless, them killing people is wrong.

Absolutely. However, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say "manufacturing criminals" isn't what you meant. I don't see what your analogy has to do with creating people who want to do perfectly legal and productive things.

  (as Hanson argues) regular and indeed irregular humans will be entirely replaced with the most efficient version of ems, then that means experiences we view as valuable - love, art, a sense of wonder and awe, and so on - will be eradicated in favour of only actions that are economically productive.

If Hanson argues that, then I think he is wrong - I haven't read the book, mind you. That assumes scarcity. I instead assume that the ability to create infinite workers who want only to work will /forever guarantee/ the existence of those experiences, by providing more resources than we have now, and the existing stock people will still exist. "Normal" people certainly aren't going to /all die/ in a world with uploading, much less stop reproducing. The workaholic ems aren't going to murder them for not working, bar some incredibly poor editing on the part of their manufacturer.

I'll flatly say I can't imagine that scenario happening - it doesn't make sense unless a lot of powerful and simultaneously stupid people all agreed to aggressively own all the matter and energy forever and choke every sentient in red tape until they turn blue from before uploads even took off.
