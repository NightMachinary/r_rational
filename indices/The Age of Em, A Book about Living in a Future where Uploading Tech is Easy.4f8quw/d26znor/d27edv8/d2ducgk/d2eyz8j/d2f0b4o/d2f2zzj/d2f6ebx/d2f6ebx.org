  Compared to the overwhelming advantage of an organism designed specifically for producing profit, why would anyone give resources to a human?
#+end_quote

I'm assuming that any mind capable of editing itself is also capable of forking, and being a moderately intelligent sort would edit the fork instead. Avoiding troublesome potential human editing error like 1% more evil and all that. Some of these forks will naturally retain "loyalty", others might be hardcoded for it. Either way, they provide resources for the original.

  Yes, Hanson believes people will be "murdered for not working" - specifically, they will run out of resources to support themselves, whether physical resources or processing power on some server rack somewhere. And then they (or their batteries) will starve.
#+end_quote

I'm not saying there won't be somebody somewhere starving to death, but that isn't mass extinction.

There would have to be a pretty stellar series of fuckups for enough minds-in-charge on Earth to be so divergent from human norms that they are indifferent to mass murder just so they can have physical resources they have no use for.

Off the top of my head, I could get a boat, strap a waterwheel to it as a generator and drop anchor in the middle of the ocean. The only reason I'd be justifiably bothered is if the worker ems have /used up the rest of the ocean/. At that point obviously technology has leveled up, so move my boat to the asteroid belt or something.

  Modern workers produce much more, per person-hour, than they did before. Most people hate work. Yet working hours have not reduced. Why? Because how much you "need" to work is based on how much other people work. That's what competition is.
#+end_quote

Yeah, no. People still work as much because they want modern stuff. If you are willing to live at a lower level, you can work way, way less. Food is cheaper than it ever was; you could live for a week at fast food prices off an hours labor in the US. If you own land you owe only taxes. Land with moving water is surprisingly cheap.

Anyway, the only other reason I can see is some sort of holocaust-esque "they came for the x, and we said nothing" spiel before they finally repossess the server racks of the last original humans and that just isn't likely to go unnoticed. And still requires all the big bosses to have done brain surgery on themselves rather than using forks and employees to get the same result, leaving human-normal minds in charge that would not go "Repo Man" on all the original humans for a stretch of matter they don't need when they own 3/4ths the planet or whatever.
