  I'm assuming that any mind capable of editing itself is also capable of forking, and being a moderately intelligent sort would edit the fork instead. Avoiding troublesome potential human editing error like 1% more evil and all that. Some of these forks will naturally retain "loyalty", others might be hardcoded for it. Either way, they provide resources for the original.

I'm not sure I follow. You seem to be suggesting that creating a more profitable worker would be an accident we'd prevent against, but it seems obvious to me that it would be some people's end-goal and that those people would go on to be more successful.

  There would have to be a pretty stellar series of fuckups for enough minds-in-charge on Earth to be so divergent from human norms that they are indifferent to mass murder just so they can have physical resources they have no use for.

... you literally live in the First World. /That is the world you're living in right now./

(Also, they /have/ a use for physical resources: expanding their businesses by purchasing equipment and hiring ems. Obviously, this won't appeal to everyone, but "luckily" we're dealing with simulations who have been selected to maximize exactly that trait.)

  People still work as much because they want modern stuff.

Hmm, maybe. It would certainly be surprising if that wasn't a factor, given all we've created.

On the other hand, glancing at the stats, it looks like food has steadily gotten cheaper (in terms of percentage of household income), while housing and medical care have stayed roughly the same, and transport costs have gone from nil to almost fully replacing the gains from food costs. That sounds like people working harder (via commuting) to replace any gains made while positional goods stay the same.

  I could get a boat, strap a waterwheel to it as a generator and drop anchor in the middle of the ocean. The only reason I'd be justifiably bothered is if the worker ems have used up the rest of the ocean. At that point obviously technology has leveled up, so move my boat to the asteroid belt or something.

How are you going to move to the asteroid belt if you have no money and live on a boat?
