I think Hanson (and I /know/ Scott) is basically a technological determinist - any regulations to prevent this technology will inevitably fail, because people who don't regulate will do better. I disagree with this in principle, but it's definitely concerning (see the utter failure of regulators to prevent piracy, for example.)

The "rich CEO ends up funding humanity's runtime for the next billion years outcome isn't /ideal/, but it's certainly one of the better outcomes. On the other hand, I'm /concerned/ that a CEO-em might inevitably do better than a company limited by an ethical master, especially given their improved micromanagement etc? Which I /assume/ (can't recall them addressing it) would be their counterargument.

In defence of paying ems, our current economy kind of depends on people having money to allocate resources properly (and most societies that kept slaves let them have personal property, with many allowing them to buy their own freedom if they saved up.) Still, there are other solutions. I don't think it's integral to the concept (and I think Hanson usually says "use".)

Ah, you're missing my point there. Even if ems invent boat-portable spaceship manufacturies, you have no money (and the speed of the economy means any money you had before is probably worthless by now), and your boat is worthless because they're vacuuming up the oceans. You have nothing to give and nothing to trade.

Of course, this is a highly specific and unlikely example, and the whole concept is reasonably suspect - it's not clear that applying the emulation technology to it's own designers wouldn't produce an Eliezer-style foom, for example.
