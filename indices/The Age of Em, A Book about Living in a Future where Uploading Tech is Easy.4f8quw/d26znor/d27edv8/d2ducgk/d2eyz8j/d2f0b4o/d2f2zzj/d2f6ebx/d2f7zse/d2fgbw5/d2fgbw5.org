  On the other hand, glancing at the stats, it looks like food has steadily gotten cheaper (in terms of percentage of household income), while housing and medical care have stayed roughly the same, and transport costs have gone from nil to almost fully replacing the gains from food costs. That sounds like people working harder (via commuting) to replace any gains made while positional goods stay the same.

I'll admit I see the pattern and I'm no expert in this matter.

  I'm not sure I follow. You seem to be suggesting that creating a more profitable worker would be an accident we'd prevent against, but it seems obvious to me that it would be some people's end-goal and that those people would go on to be more successful.

No. By 1% more evil, I was referring to editing your own utility function being dangerous in general, because humans make programming mistakes - as in literal "I live /only/ to count paper clips" when you meant to be a successful paper clip manufacturer in order to pay for a space yacht. Rather, you make the edit to a fork, and leave the original running indefinitely. Particularly when you are optimizing for a task but don't want to risk messing other stuff up - and human civilization is the product of avoiding work. Changing that risks fixing what isn't broke, and thus breaking it. Furthermore humans are uncomfortable with changing their minds.

  How are you going to move to the asteroid belt if you have no money and live on a boat?

This could be a problem, but a world where they actually use up the ocean is alien to our own. Human emulation obviates the need to limit ourselves to biological clockspeeds, and even the most pessimistic estimation of that multiplier allows workaholic ems to solve all design problems. (Crunching the numbers allow in excess of 1000x on the more extreme end.) It isn't unreasonable to believe that at /that/ point there would be viable designs for boat-portable assemblers, and every other technology necessary to build a spacecraft - with or without the workaholics declaring ownership of the oceans permission.

A bit more speculative than I wanted to go, but so is them coming after my boat.

  (Also, they have a use for physical resources: expanding their businesses by purchasing equipment and hiring ems. Obviously, this won't appeal to everyone, but "luckily" we're dealing with simulations who have been selected to maximize exactly that trait.)

I think we are operating from different positions here, mainly the idea that the commander-in-chief of a given power bloc must be a modified human simulation rather than a unmodified legacy of the prior era.

I also don't think anyone will hire ems at all - there is no reason not to manufacture them willing to work for no pay. Ethics of this I debated in another part of this thread, but the pragmatic aspect seems undeniable. You can't posit a world where ems can legally claim the ocean in the name of profit yet corporations failed to legally make unpaid obedient workers in the name of profit. Well you /can/, but I think it is improbable. (Also the unpaid worker corp wins the profit competition.) If you accept this position, it is no longer a competition between worker ems and originals - it is a competition between worker ems and worker ems in service to an original. Sufficiently large numbers of ems and the inefficiency of that one becomes irrelevant.

The /real/ question I have is how Hanson's book and/or this very conversation doesn't make this a self-defeating prophecy. If we can predict this /quiet eradication/ of original humanity, then surely people would do the same when it /actually starts happening./ Then we would pass possibly unfair laws ensuring original human supremacy of the matter and if they were violated would use force to maintain that control while we still had greater power that trumped their optimizations. The morality of this is debatable, but that it is typical human nature is less so. Space-Steve-Jobs or w/e isn't stupid, and he doesn't need super optimizations to skim a report from his own worker ems that says there are less original humans every year and then investigate.

As an aside on the whole only-have-a-boat. With the increasing practical power of individuals with the successors to primitive 3d printing, the ability for individuals to do things other than roll over and die also increases. Short of a draconian police state from early on in favor of the workaholics - in charge, not simply in service to original humans - this would inevitably lead to physical violence.

To repeat: the only advantage the purist workaholics have is they have 100% workaholics and the originals can have 100% - 1 mind in charge. I don't think this guarantees them victory in any battlefield, physical or economic.

I've probably circled around a few times here but eh. The important points are covered either way. Again, there may be a huge number of people getting the short stick, but I don't believe originals would be eliminated as a whole, because they had an unfair advantage from the start, and knew exactly what was happening when they invented worker ems. After all, they read Hanson's book.
