Maybe I'm missing something, but isn't it true that there are humans who legitimately enjoy a given task? If they can morally exist, then constructing or copying a human mind that shares that quality shouldn't be immoral (unless you start going into strange territories where only "naturally" achieved this or that is moral). There are also humans right now who wouldn't care about being copied, or even about dying (deletion analogue). So unless their existence is wrong, making more minds like them shouldn't be wrong either.
