  However he does seem to...gloss over the more disturbing aspects, as if he's saying that we shouldn't judge them.

That's not what he's doing. If you've ever heard him speak (especially in front of more left-leaning audiences), he always points out that he's in the predicting business, not the judging business. In other words, he lays out what he considers to be the likely consequences of ems, regardless of what people may think of their moral implications

The thing is, as far as I can tell his prediction given ems is thus: humanity being succeeded by trillions of copies of increasingly dumbed-down emulations of a few thousand previously-living humans living on subsistence wages in a hyperspeed race to the bottom.
