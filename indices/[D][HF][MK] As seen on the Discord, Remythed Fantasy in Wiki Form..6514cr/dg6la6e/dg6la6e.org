So I've been super busy with life and teaching, so I decided to just make something fun instead of my usual mega-projects.

This is that, I'm curious if anyone has particularly munchkin heavy things/ideas that would fit into it utilizing what is presented. Mostly so I can stress test and balance stuff a bit.

Particularily sensible munchkinisms I'm all for adding it and polishing off.

I also don't have 'specific' individual nations, people, or even towns, just broad categories of 'things that happen'. Fleshing out some examples of that would be nice if anyone gets inspired but no obligations. This is meant to be fun.
