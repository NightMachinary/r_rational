I'm not really sure where you left out, but when does it start feeling repetitive? I feel like all the "arcs" are very varied and different. Just in the "first season" we have Ami being an adventurer, exploring the underworld, conquering a dungeon, making a deal with the dark gods, getting a new enemy-turned-ally from her world and finally facing a horned reaper in hand-to-hand combat in an underworld stadium.

Maybe it's not the story itself but the writing style that gets repetitive for you?
