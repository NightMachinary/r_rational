The constant match of progress and realistic setbacks in magitech (not just adopting everything from the real world) is what makes it unique, compared to other tech-up type series. In that alone, it's worth reading.

Plotwise, I find it a bit rambling at times and it loses focus with the dual hero gimmick and the constant switches in viewpoints (what is the purpose of Morey's band in the overall plot, really?) The zombies also don't seem as much of an imminent threat in the latest chapters as they should. You need threats to keep the momentum going, otherwise the pacing and development will suffer as [[/u/_immute_]] mentioned.

The writer himself has said how he has difficulty planning out future plotlines, so he's aware of this flaw at least.
