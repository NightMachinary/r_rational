We'll definitely be going into individual tropes more in-depth in later episodes, once we cover most of the basics of the process :) Any in specific you'd like to talk more about? We could discuss it here, even.

Also, thanks for the cheerleading! "Shill" implies that you're getting a cut or have some clandestine relationship with either of us, which as far as I'm aware isn't the case. You could be one of my friends in a disguised account, I suppose, but if not "Chearleader" works :) Thanks to Patreon's revival of the word's meaning, "Patron" works too, even if it doesn't have quite the same context as in the ancient days. "Sponsor" could work too, though it has gained some complicating connotations thanks to the modern world's use of commercialization and advertisements.
