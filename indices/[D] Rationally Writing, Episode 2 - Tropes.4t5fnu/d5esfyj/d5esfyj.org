I enjoyed listening to this, but it has me looking forward to more in-depth discussions about particular tropes in future episodes, including things like why a particular trope is or isn't bad, why it often shows up, how it can be avoided or used well, and examples of rational fic in which the trope can be found.

/Anyway./ Hey! Everyone! Look at this new content that [[/u/DaystarEld]] and [[/u/alexanderwales]] are putting out! Isn't it pretty cool and surprising that there is a podcast explicitly about Rational Fic, something catering pretty much exclusively to this weird taste we all share? Also, doesn't it seem like kind of a bunch of work?

If you aren't already supporting these guys for their fiction, perhaps you might consider starting now? I think it's super cool that there's a RationalFic podcast, but something so niche pretty much has to be a passion project. Still, there is an easy way you can show your appreciation and incentivize future projects by these two and others in the community.

Both DaystarEld and Alexanderwales have Patreon accounts:

- [[https://www.patreon.com/daystareld][DaystarEld]]

- [[https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales][Alexanderwales]] (guys, Glimwarden is /really really good/.)

--cheerleader (maybe "shill" is more accurate? eh, whatever)

(EDIT: :'( :'( :'( No increase for either of them. Oh well, I tried.)
