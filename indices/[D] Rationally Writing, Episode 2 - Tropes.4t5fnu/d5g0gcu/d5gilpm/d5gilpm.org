I agree that it's definitely possible to have Evil characters in rationalfic, and even that there might be positives to it! The problem for me is when they're the main villain, or the only villain, because then it becomes far harder for writers to present complex moral struggles or avoid soapboxing.

A lot of my favorite stories usually include multiple antagonists, so that the protagonists have to face, say, Chaotic Evil monsters and Lawful Evil humans, or Chaotic Evil humans and True Neutral aliens, or some other more complex mix. We'll go into things like that more in a later episode, but you're right that there's a place for Evil in rationalfiction :)
