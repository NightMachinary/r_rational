Great episode guys, I look forward to more and will definitely be checking out Shadows of the Limelight. The only thing I disagree with you on is that I think it's possible to have Evil villains in a rational story, we're just the kind of people who like reading about shades of grey so we keep making the villains sympathetic.

I think the way it could be pulled off is by making the antagonist explicitly irrational. We root for the hero to defeat the villain in stories because the villain is more Wrong and the hero is more Right. The point of that villain is to show the audience what not to do, and because they made the wrong choices they are defeated.

While I see the appeal of a rationalist Luthor from Metropolitan Man, I really like the way the character is interpreted in comics like Lex Luthor: Man of Steel and All Star Superman. In those stories it's made clear that his fear for humanity is just the way he rationalizes his hatred of the personified antithesis of his worldview.

He comes across similarly to the Ice King from Adventure Time, an insane man with power who refuses to acknowledge his sickness and is doomed to repeat the same patterns over and over until he admits he's wrong. We both hate and pity him while seeing a bit of our own faults within him, and so we are warned against making the same mistakes.
