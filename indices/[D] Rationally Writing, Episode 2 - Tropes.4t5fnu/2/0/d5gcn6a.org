We'll talk about the place of Evil characters in some future episode. Right now I'm thinking that it will slot into the episode on the three (or four, or nine) types of conflict, but if not there, then in an episode on Blue and Orange morality (which will necessarily touch on Black and White morality and Grey and Gray morality).
