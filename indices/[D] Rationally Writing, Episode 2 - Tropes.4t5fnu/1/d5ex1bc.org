Great episode! What an awesome podcast, thank you guys for sharing this information, it's so valuable and useful!

If anyone is interested in learning more about Dan Harmon's story circle, I recommend to read the [[http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit][series of articles]] he wrote about it. And [[http://danharmon.tumblr.com/post/57779240046/could-you-explain-your-story-breaking-process][here]] you can read about his story breaking process.

Also it's super exciting to hear rationalfiction.io being mentioned on your podcast, made me really happy))
