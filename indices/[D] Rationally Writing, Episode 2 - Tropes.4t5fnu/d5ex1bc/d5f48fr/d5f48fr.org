If you're interested, and if you don't mind spoilers (serious, major, ending spoilers) for a thing that's only kind-sorta in publication yet, I did a story circle for part of my pre-writing on /The Dark Wizard of Donkerk/ back in 2014 (and while I'm hoping to finish that first draft in November of this year, in 2014 I thought I was going to finish it then).
