I am personally against changing the name unless someone comes up with something that works as both descriptive and a double entendre. My feeling towards names is that names are more something that sinks you than something that makes you float; a bad name can keep people away, but people aren't going to be attracted by a good name, they're going to be attracted by the all-powerful force of Word of Mouth. The name we have now is already more on the descriptive side of the descriptive/aesthetic spectrum, and while I agree that there's probably a better name out there, I don't think making the name more descriptive is the right direction to go.
