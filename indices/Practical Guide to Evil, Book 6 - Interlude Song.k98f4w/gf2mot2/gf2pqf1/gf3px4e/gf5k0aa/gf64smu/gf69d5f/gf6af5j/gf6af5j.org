If I'm a guest in someone's house and he says "Under no circumstances will Epub, PDF files, audiobooks or translation of the Guide be allowed" then as a polite guest I will respect his rules whether or not I understand or agree with his reasoning. If I find his rules intolerable I will take my leave and go elsewhere rather than arguing about my rights or whether the rules make any actual difference.
