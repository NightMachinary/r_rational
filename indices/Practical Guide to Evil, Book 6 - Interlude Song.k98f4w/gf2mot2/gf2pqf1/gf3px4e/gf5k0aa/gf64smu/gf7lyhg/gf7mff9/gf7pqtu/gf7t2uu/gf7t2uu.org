It's really not as difficult as you're making it out to be, to engage with individual content creators as real human beings. If Reese and Wernick had come out with a statement asking people not to read the leaked Deadpool script as a favor to them, I'd absolutely have respected that. If Allie Brosh posts a note saying "hey guys I really hate the 'All The Things' meme" then a decent person would stop using it. When EE says he doesn't want people converting his books to other formats, honoring that is basic courtesy.

This isn't about copyright law or any kind of formalistic analysis of entitlement. This is about two simple questions: Would I treat a friend that way? And, isn't a person who gives me such enjoyment, asking so little in return, someone I should treat as a friend?
