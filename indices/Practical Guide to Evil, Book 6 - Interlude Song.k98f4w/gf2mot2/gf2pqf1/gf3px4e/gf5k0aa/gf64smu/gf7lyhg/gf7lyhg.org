But that's not an apt analogy at all. To make it more accurate, let's say someone lays out that delicious tray of cupcakes, and says anyone can take one. I take a single cupcake, but cut off the bottom of the cupcake and make it into a weird sandwich and eat it that way. How does this hurt anything? How am I being disrespectful to him by consuming it in the way I find preferable? He handed me a cupcake and I modified its form in a way that affects no one but myself.

I am not reselling the cupcake, or distributing it in any way. I am simply taking what was given freely to anyone with no stipulations, and shifting it around to maximize my own enjoyment.

Genuine question: Are you also this vehemently against transcoding music? The artist sold it to you as a FLAC, so is it disrespectful to transcode it to opus to save space on your phone?
