  This is about two simple questions: Would I treat a friend that way?
#+end_quote

I suppose we actually boil it down to the exact same thing, just from a different side. Would I treat a friend this way? No, absolutely not. Under no circumstances. Which is why it's so baffling that ErraticErrata is treating his audience this way. Respect cuts two ways, my dude. It would be completely unreasonable if I told you that you, under no circumstances, are allowed to highlight any of the text in my post; it shows a fundamental lack of respect towards you as a fellow human being, and as such I would never make such a request.

  When EE says he doesn't want people converting his books to other formats
#+end_quote

He doesn't say that, thought. He gives specific formats that the book should not be converted to. To use the previous metaphor, the artist on bandcamp says "do not transcoded to mp3." This does not mean "do not transcode at all." Specificity of language is generally important.

That isn't strictly relevant, though. I completely understand and approve of him forbidding /distribution/ of his content. Wildbow has this policy and you'd never find me arguing against it. However, it is completely unacceptable in my mind for him to demand what I do with it once it's on my machine. If I want to change the typeface or put it all in italics or randomize the word order or any other modification to the text, I feel it's in no circumstance reasonable for him to request that I do otherwise as long as it stays on my machine. He obviously doesn't have to give his blessing for me to do it, but explicitly disallowing modifications that are never distributed is too far.
