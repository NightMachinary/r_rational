It doesn't seem to work, anyways. For me, at least; it gets stuck forever in:

=Bloxp is searching all the posts from . This process can take some minutes depending on the number of posts.=

=Please don't close this page or press any key, when the process finishes you will be automatically redirected.=

In any case, I find debatable what the power is, moral or otherwise, over the format in which the work of one is readed once the content has been uploaded in this way.

I will simply not read it if it is not in my Kindle, I just refuse to hurt my eyes. I don't feel that it is immoral to try to circumvent the author's will, since I believe that one cannot impose how to use the works that one has published.

As a published writer, I don't want people cleaning up their asses with my book, but readers have the right to do it if they wish, some may argue that they even have the moral duty to do it.
