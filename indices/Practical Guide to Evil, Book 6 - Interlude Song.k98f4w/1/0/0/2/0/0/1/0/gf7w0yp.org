I'm fine with that, which is why I stated that no distribution is happening. If someone is distributing it, that is a completely different story from me having it on my machine and only my machine. I understand the animosity towards anyone distributing someone else's intellectual property, but that's not what was presented here.

I have opinions on the subject of copyright laws, mostly relating to them overwhelmingly favoring megacorps and screwing over the actual artists, but that's not really relevant here. ErraticErrata provides his novels for free to anyone who visits his website, with no access restriction. If I copy the contents of his website onto a word document then read the story from there, that doesn't put EE in a worse situation than if I read it from his website.
