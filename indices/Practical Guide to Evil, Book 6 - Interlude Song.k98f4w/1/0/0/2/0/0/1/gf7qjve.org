I'm not going to engage in metaphor torture, but the actual reason for EE's request is that publishers are (apparently) weird and nonsensical, in that they'll be leery of you if there are epubs of your work floating around. Linking an epub generation tool in this sort of context definitely trips over the spirit of that request.

If you're an "information wants to be free and damn the consequence or lack of support network for artists" sort of person then there's not really much that this clarification will do, but if instead it seems nonsensical because of the missing context then I hope that having it helps.
