¯\_(ツ)_/¯ then I'll make an azw3 or mobi. Is our disagreement solved now because it's not an "Epub, PDF files, audiobooks or translation"? Is it acceptable if, rather than making an epub, I copy it into Microsoft Word and save that as a docx file? It doesn't go against his /explicit/ wishes, so it's fine? I'm assuming not, so I'll continue but I guess you can just ignore the rest of this if it /is/ fine for me to convert it to a non-epub ebook format.

When a script is leaked for a film, do you refuse to look at it our of principle, because the filmmaker didn't want people looking at it? Do you refuse to use or look at reaction images, because they violate the copyright of the works in question? I'm trying not to be needlessly rude, but this policy of yours feels like the kind of empty PR talk that gets used, where it's designed to sound good at first but under further inspection you realize that nobody, not even the person saying it, actually follows the policy. Perhaps you are the paragon that your stated policy would require, but I'm far too cynical to assume this is the case.
