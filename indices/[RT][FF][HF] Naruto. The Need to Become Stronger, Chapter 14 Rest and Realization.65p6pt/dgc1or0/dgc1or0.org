Hi all. Long delay since the last chapter - Mae Culpa. I'll blame the shortage of interesting and exciting reviews here on reddit for my lack of inspiration :-p

It's a more explicitly rational chapter this time around, which I know some of you have been asking for, so I hope you guys like it. I totally forgot to mention this last time, but the story is intended to be a solvable mystery in the same way as HPMOR, so it should have been possible to figure out Zabuza and Haku's real plan. Did you see it coming, or was it a huge surprise? Was the reveal satisfying? Let me know in the comments!
