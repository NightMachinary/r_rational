I'm also wondering what happens with position. Like if you turned a heavy object at position (0,0) and turned it into a long thin object lying along a line to (0,10) then turned it back, would you be able to have it end up at (0,10) without expending the energy to actually physically move it?

If the same thing works vertically (or just up a slope) you'd have yet another route to free energy by repeatedly dropping heavy things through a turnstile attached to a dynamo, unless the gain in potential energy is balanced by costs to your own personal energy reserve (whatever fuels the ability).

I'm focussing on energy generation because it seems like the quickest way to demonstrably 'break the universe'... probably need to apply more creativity for combat uses. One comes to mind... place a pit of sand as a trap, activate the trap by transforming the grains of sand into much larger spheres, say the size of a basketball. They don't need to be heavy, just rigid enough to pack around a person and lock in place against each other, and against the sides of an enclosed space.
