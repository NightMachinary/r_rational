  You can't be put in a box and henge into something larger to automatically break the box for example.

Does transforming into something larger exert /any/ appreciable outward force? I mean, it has to be at least enough to displace the air in the volume the object comes to occupy, yes?

What if you took a piston that fits exactly into a tube, transformed it into a shorter piston with the same cross section, then allowed it to turn back? It wouldn't need to push against the sides of the container, just against a fluid filling the rest of the container so as to displace it through a turbine...
