There's some optimization of Hiraishin in [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1377508][Vapors]], if you haven't read that already.

Hiraishin is very rare, though, whereas the summoning contracts with animals appear to be comparatively common. And there's no real discussion about how hard it is to make the scrolls they used in the exams.

Anyway, I was thinking less in terms of fighting battles, and more in terms of escape methods. Need to rescue a captive? No problem, just use a scroll to summon them home.
