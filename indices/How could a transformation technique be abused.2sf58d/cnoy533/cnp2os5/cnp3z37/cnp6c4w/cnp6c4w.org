Hm Chakra armor seems really weird. I might just conveniently ignore it exists in my world.

There's lots of pseudo-teleport skills in the universe, and lots of ways to fast travel. Even Hiraishin I've seen described by a fic as a tag that gives you awareness of the area for you to use a jutsu similar to kawarimi on the air next to it. I probably won't have any contracts, though. If I want something to fight my main character's battles for it, more clones.
