Yeah, but I imagine that if Magnet release was ever explored in canon, it would encompass magnetic effects. The name lends itself far too well to it.

I believe that it's mentioned that Naruto goes from the failing henge into the henge of Akamaru. Chaining henge, as opposed to layering it. Again, Naruto is a beast at henge once he learned how to wrestle his massive chakra.
