I guess I meant "control of magnetic forces it's akin to controlling metal", not only control of metal.

I have the relevant video and time linked in the post's edit, but the order is Naruto makes a seal -> looks like Kiba -> gets punched and knocked to the floor -> /poof/ and Akamaru is lying there. He's on his back spread-eagle as Kiba when he transforms to Akamaru, and Kiba never looks away from him. So, he didn't have time to make a seal. He had to make the seal before, and he isn't good enough to do any jutsu seal-less (even his favorite), so that's probably not it. Is there something else that could have happened besides a layered henge?
