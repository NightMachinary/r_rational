I've been spending time thinking about the mechanics of the chakra system in general, so I have some thoughts that might help focus some of your musings.

Most of chakra manipulation seems to fall into three big types:

- shape manipulation (forming the chakra into specific forms, be it a something to let you walk on things you can't normally walk on, a sphere of chaotic energy or a giant honkin' dragon)
- nature manipulation (the five elemental, the physical yang and the spiritual yin energies, as well combinations thereof)
- jutsu types, such as taijutsu, ninjutsu and genjutsu, which seem to cover where the chakra manipulation is happening, either inside one's own body, in the world around someone, or within someone else's chakra system,l respectively

(I've been looking largely at the category of ninjutsu, and specifically the comparison of Wind Release: Rasengan (in canon, "shape and nature manipulation to the highest degree"), and Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique, and wondering why Naruto wasn't throwing out Air Dragon Bullets. The way I've made sense of the canon system is that Naruto is just doing what works, and not making much use of the skills that he learned but due to his proficiency in Rasengan, he could be throwing out flashy jutsu. If we assume canon!Naruto is basically always carrying an idiot ball the size of, oh say, Gamabunta, it'd covereth a multitude of sins.)

Hand Seals seem to be some sort of mnemonic device to aid in chakra manipulation, but aren't strictly required. They carry some of the difficulty that manually doing chakra manipulation requires, and the better someone is at the raw manipulation, the less seals are required.

I'd go so far as to say, that with enough chakra manipulation, just about anything is possible with chakra. The limits come from the processing power, raw chakra resources and the efficiency of the chakra manipulator in question. Henge seems to be ninjutsu (operating outside a body), with strong shape manipulation and yang-natured energy manipulation. Naruto is a powerhouse at henge because he's an absolute monster at ninjutsu shape manipulation of yang energy, which the shadow clone and Rasengan techniques also appear to be (probably owing to [[#s][Ending Spoilers]]).

I'm not sure the extent to which henge actually changes the body, but it fails similarly to the shadow clone under stress, so it probably doesn't completely change the body the way that techniques like the Multi-size technique do. However, a specialized technique like Henge: Adamantine Staff, does seem to change and hold a body shape change, so it's probably a matter of how well the chakra is applied.

Something specific about the rules listed is becoming a magnet, which would likely fall under Magnet Release techniques, which are a combination of Wind and Earth natures (I don't really get that, but that's the canon explanation). I'm of the opinion that combination natures can be done with a significant amount of skill (as in the level of skill required for two A-rank shinobi pulling of a combination technique). In this model, kekkei genkai dealing with combination energy natures mean that the person in question has a combination nature affinity. Since manipulating chakra outside of one's affinity can be learned (Sarutobi Hiruzen could, and is part of the reason he was the "God of Shinobi"), I'm toying with the idea that someone who has access to multiple chakra natures, shadow clones and training in combination techniques could pull off "solo" combination nature techniques, but that should require a large investment of time and training, to explain why combination nature kekkei genkai are so prized/hated.
