No, much like henge'ing into the sun, it would use up all your chakra and you'd die and nothing would happen.

And tricking them into killing themselves this way wouldn't work either, because you'd have to explain antimatter enough to make it potent to kill them, and then they'd know that it is impossible and that you were trying to kill them. If you explained it halfway they might just turn into a black sphere of chakra stuff with no special properties.
