Obviously, infinite clean energy, but that's true with nearly all fictional magic so it's hardly worth mentioning.

  Weight was also an issue, as the form you took ended up being an average of your own weight and what you wanted - the main reason ninja's couldn't henge into a bird and fly around. It was dependent on a few things, though, including how much chakra you wanted to spend on it.

Bahahaha...You definitely want upper and lower limits to volume here! Can't have someone accidentally henging into a mega-dense dust spec...or a star, for that matter. Flying is easy, just become a really /big/ winged thing - (but if electronics do not work neither should biology), or a large hot air balloon...

Under-explored applications in density play exist, I'm sure. You might get a bit of a headache if you think too hard about how exactly would work at the atomic/molecular level though. Even at the macro level though, you're gonna have to make some choices (would you rather conserve momentum, or conserve velocity? Either way, very hackable)
