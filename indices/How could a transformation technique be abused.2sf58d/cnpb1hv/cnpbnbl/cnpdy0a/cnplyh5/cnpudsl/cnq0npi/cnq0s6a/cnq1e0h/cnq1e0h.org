I think so, but I'm not sure. Most of what I know about Naruto is from fanfic; I haven't read the manga and I only watched a few of the episodes--they were too short and slow-moving to hold my interest, and I got really tired of Naruto shouting "Believe it!" every three minutes.

Which doesn't mean there isn't some really excellent Naruto fanfic out there. It's a fantastic setting with lots of potential for awesome.
