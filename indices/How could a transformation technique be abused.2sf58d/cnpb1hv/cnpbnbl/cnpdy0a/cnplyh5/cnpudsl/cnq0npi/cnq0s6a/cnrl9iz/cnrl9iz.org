Yup, clones can create more clones (like Naruto did in chapter 561), but it's worthwhile to note the kind of cloning.

Clone is how bunshin (分身) was translated, but [[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%88%86%E8%BA%AB][it means something closer to doppelganger or avatar]] and, in the series, clones are more like temporary extentions of oneself. In the case of the basic clone technique, this avatar is intangible and is really only useful for a visual distraction.

Clones using elemental energy (such as the water or earth clones) give solidity to the avatar and can actually be used to perform other techniques. They only have a fraction of the power and chakra of the original user, however, and seem to be remote controlled. Getting them too far away from the user causes them to dispel, and the user likely needs some method of knowing what they are doing to effectively use them. They are also simplistic copies and certain abilities can easily tell these clones apart from the real body.

Shadow clones (Naruto's speciality) are similar to the elemental clones in that they are corporeal. However, they are very similar to an actual body and hard to detect as clones, the user's chakra is evenly split between the clones they create, and they are able to take independent actions. Additionally, the technique was originally a scouting technique, and experiences gained by and chakra stored within the clone are returned to the original user when dispelled.
