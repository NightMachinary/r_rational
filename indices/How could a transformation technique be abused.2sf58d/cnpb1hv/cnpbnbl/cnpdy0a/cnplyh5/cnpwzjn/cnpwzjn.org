Er...yes no maybe: it depends on how clever the engineers are. In this case there's no (from a theoretical physics standpoint) upper limit to how much energy you can get out of a single magical deviation from ordinary physics. If you know a certain magical object has to do a certain action (grow in size, change location, a certain chemical reaction, whatever) and *it must complete that action no matter what else happens*, you can set up machinery around that object to make that action /as energetically unfavorable as possible/. The magic rules do not care how energetically unfavorable the actions are, but from the physics end of things we're receiving /massive/ amounts of energy. The limitations on how much magically-sourced energy can be extracted are all from an engineering standpoint.

So think "superman powers the entire continent for a day by rotating a crank once". (Super-strength is probably one of those cases where there /is/ a theoretical upper limit of how much magically-sourced energy you can extract per unit time, so it's not the best example of this...but if we're talking about the same superman who can move entire planets, it might still work.)
