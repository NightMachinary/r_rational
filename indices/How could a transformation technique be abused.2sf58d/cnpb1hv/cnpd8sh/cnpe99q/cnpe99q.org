If momentum is conserved, you can become a very fast bullet by taking a leap forward and then dramatically reducing your mass.

Well, you don't have to be a /fire/ powered air balloon. If you are less dense than the air you can float around. If you are /slightly/ less dense than air you can fly without too much exertion. It is probably sufficient to simply be a balloon. But I get what you're saying, chakra constraints.

Sure you can! Just become an airtight container of liquid, and then increase/decrease the volume to influence the pressure. (Or, use friction, whatever. It's hard to feel out the constraints of this since you can apparently turn animals into animals, and you yourself are an animal, so...)

I wonder to what extent Chakra constraints care about conservation of energy...obviously they can't care /completely/ but maybe, if you just ignore that mass /is/ energy, Chakras care? Depending on how hard-fantasy you wanna go with this, we should probably figure out what exactly the Chakras care about.

(For example, imagine getting bigger or smaller inside a tight container. Would the Chakra care that you were inside the container and using the growth to force yourself out?/fighting against vacuum pressure?)

I think Chakra's definitely /do/ care about the energy state your actual body is in, ignoring mass...that explains the lack of temperature and velocity malleability. Generalizing from that, you might say that you can't, for example, transform /directly/ into a fully loaded spring.

But, could you for example stay at the same temperature, and keep growing, while immersed in an ice bath? (effectively you are introducing free heat). Do chakra's care about the overall energy of the universe after conveniently forgetting E=mc^{2} ?

(See [[http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2sf58d/how_could_a_transformation_technique_be_abused/cnpdy0a]] for more ways conservation is violated, try to decide which ones are legit and which ones are somehow using an "equivalent" amount of chakra energy? I don't think there is any intuitive way to dis-allow the lever one, for example..)
