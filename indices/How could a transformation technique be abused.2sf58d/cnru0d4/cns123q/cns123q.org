I agree it's super broken. To discuss your points in the context of the Naruto world:

1) The closer you can imagine something, the better the henge is to it. Also, taking damage in the henge is never established as to what happens. The frog can grapple as a fox, so it's not one-hit-dispelled like shadow clones. If you turn into a boulder and they smash the boulder (Tsunade's strength technique), what happens? I'm going to say "henge dispelled and a serious chakra spike drain on you for causing lots of stress" which can be however much the plot requires. Dragging rock onto yourself and hardening it into your own chakra-lladen armor is a very common earth technique, too, which would produce the same result as imperfect-imagining of a steel alloy, but with the henge having a huge chakra cost if it breaks while the rocks would just fall off you.

2) Yes, this would all work, and is super broken. I'll try balancing this with "chakra cost" and "lack of imagination makes it inferior to the real thing". For example, if you henge into Goku, you might only get 5-10x speed/strength/toughness from the Saiyan muscles rather than 1000x, and the cost would mean you couldn't hold it for more than a minute. Wins fights but not battles. Also, if you can do a seal-less henge (gonna say takes a year of practice for one form), you can henge into yourself with your limbs in a different position. Throw a punch, have them raise a block, henge yourself into a position ready for a kick. You can't have velocity you didn't have, so no already-fast-moving-leg jutsu, but it still cuts down a lot on time-to-next-hit.

3) Yup, this is something I'm definitely having. Requires medical knowledge to patch up wounds to the point of feeling no pain/consequences while henge'd, and at that point is like a fast heal but temporary and with a drain to it. If you lose a lung and are a noob and henge into a healed self, you would still have a lot of problems breathing for example.

4) Yea, they could. I'm thinking that the biggest reason they don't is cost. Such a henge would be useless in battle as you lose all stealth and fast maneuverability so you'd suck as a henge'd eagle warrior. To travel it would be useless too since the upkeep cost would get you more exhausted than just simply running would, and it would be a chakra exhaustion instead of physical exhaustion, which is harder to deal with and recuperate from. Short bursts of speed and climbing mountains and whatnot aren't done because they simply don't think of it - long ago someone decided battle and long term travel potential of being a giant eagle were pointless so they stopped teaching it at all and no one questioned it.

5) A smaller target with more muscles would be preferable, to avoid the AoE jutsu. Closer to human form = less chakra expenditure, too. Would you /really/ get a benefit from being a tiger and losing the ability to make more handseals? A gorilla though, which the extra flexibility, arm length, and muscles, might be worth it. Or mythical creatures like Machamp.

6) You could /easily/ do this trick, and I will be having it.
