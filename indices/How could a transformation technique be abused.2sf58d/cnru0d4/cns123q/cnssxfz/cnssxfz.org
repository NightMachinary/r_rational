1) Not every ninja have a technique to destroy boulder. Certainly only a few genins have one. On the contrary, Henging into the boulder is fast and easy. Thus, everyone should be learning and using this on every opportunity.

2) What exactly does "lack of imagination" mean? How much time do you need to study perfect athlete's body (does he needs to be dissected and preserved? Can you study this from books?) to get it working at least at 80%? If it's a year or something, it would be worth, otherwise too much of a hassle. Combat Stance Henge doesn't seem like it's worth the effort. Henging some iron spikes while blocking strike or charge, however...

3) Actually, unless Henge is heavily optimized on micro-level to only change what's need to be changed, Henging yourself with broken lung into your healthy body without extensive knowledge will give you no troubles breathing. Instead, you'll get super-weak version of yourself (like in previous section, but you're that downgraded Goku).

4) This actually makes sense. If Henge into moving form is a hassle, Eagle Henge isn't practical. Especially if you need alot of specific eagle knowledge to even make one who can fly.

5) Ninja fights are often 1vs1, and several weight category up (with all corresponding power-ups) could make alot of difference. Look at modern boxing, it's very hard to defeat someone heavier than you even if you're skilled. And i think you're underestimating how scary are martial arts optimized for tigers. Also, many taijutsu-specialists don't use more ninjutsu after getting into close-combat. And if you're strong and fast enough, enemy won't have time for hand seals,

6) Explosive Moskito Henge, heh.

Actually, another important thing - what happens to your conscience and senses while you're Henged? If your brainware continues to run on some "soulware", how does it controls your new body? How does it wire to that body sense and motor controls? Do you get grayscale vision if you morph into a cat? Do you get in trouble trying to move on 4 legs? What happens to the existing brain, panicking inside a skull while your "soulware" overtakes it? On the other hand, if you lose your conscience while Henged, it could actually be a limiting factor to this technique. Perhaps morphing into moskito makes you a moskito, and it won't fly into your enemy mouth because moskitos don't do that. Same with tigers and eagles. But in this case, you can Henge into someone/something smarter than you and make it desing something even smarter. FOOM?
