Hmm, since these are militaries in almost constant conflict, I could see most ninja using a standard "non-descript ninja" transformation. If everyone on the field appears to be the exact same mid-level jonin from no village, identifying friend or foe gets a pretty significant difficulty spike, as does being able to intelligently commit forces to appropriate battles.
