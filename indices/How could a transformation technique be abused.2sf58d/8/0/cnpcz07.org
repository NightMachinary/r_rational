Anti-henge measures could be as simple as a password or shared memory, no one would actually punch you to check.

You could get discounts (and Naruto could avoid hate), sure, but if you were caught dispelling then you'd have a serious hit to your reputation. Also, if you're someone else you might be in a situation you don't know how to react to and draw attention to yourself. For example, if you go as an attractive girl, and get hit on by a very persistent guy who you can't shake and insists on walking you home, you're left with the choice of leading him to your residence or revealing yourself as someone who likes to go cross-gender.

  I never understood why it was considered Naruto's own jutsu?

Imo shinobi /really/ don't think of jutsu outside of actual combat situations, or else there should be a better reason why shadow clones isn't taught to everyone who has chakra and is used for paperwork all the time, or a summons who is given the roll of messenger between the 5 nations and a given all the prestige they want for being such peacekeepers, or why every building isn't just a sculpted earth element jutsu because it would take a few minutes to set a building up. So yea, literally no one has ever thought of turning into a hot girl you made up for perverted reasons.

Clones as items would be straight up stealing, which would pretty much never be worth it when you're in a ninja village with the hokage having a magic orb that can look anywhere in the village at any time without you knowing, or an activated Byakugan watching you from behind the building. If you're ninja enough to use henge to do that, you probably have other ways to get money easier. The method could be used to take objects from civilians easier though.
