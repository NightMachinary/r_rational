It could even be used in a non-stealing manner: make clones, have the clones do work and bring the money they make back to you. You don't need to house them or (presumably) feed them, they disappear before they run into issues of hygiene or worn clothing, if they are ever injured they can be replaced, and they have no need to spend any of the money they make.

If you can generate ten clones, you can have ten incomes - even if they're just grunt labor. But you can also have a service company with up to ten 'staff' available at any time - and when they're not booked, they simply vanish (and of course you don't have to pay them). If you're all ninjas too, that's a team of up to ten people (assuming you don't personally participate) who could be bodyguards, injury-proof stunt doubles, X-treme sports video makers, infiltrators... or background actors, buskers, musicians, furniture movers, cleaners etc. Sufficiently physically fit ninjas could be an entire swimsuit calendar plus the camera team.
