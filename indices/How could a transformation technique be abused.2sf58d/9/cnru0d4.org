Henge is horrible game-breaking technique in Naruto. If there was anyone smart in Naruto (and, by WoG, there are plenty of smart people there, and they are getting paid for optimizing killing techniques), world (and series) would be looking much more different. There are several reasons why.

1) Henge into a boulder would be go-to defensive technique. Mby some super steel alloy or something on higher level, but anyway, this would be used everywhere. In melee, vs offensive jutsus, everywhere.

2) Henge some parts of your body/clothes preemptively of midfight would be go-to melee technique. If henging stronger body doesn't work (why it doesn't if henging into somebody else does?), you henge armor, steel skin, cutting surfaces on hands, steel bones, anything. If you need knowledge to henge stronger body, i can imagine villages dissecting talented people and making ninja study this data (gives more sense to hunter-nin, btw). You can also henge your hand into sword midswing.

3) Btw, if human henge is allowed, you can temporary fix wounds/fatigue with this - just henge into your own perfectly healthy body. Or into that tensai's perfectly healthy body, if that's allowed.

4) With Naruto's wildlife, getting a flight with henge shouldn't be a problem even with your "weight averaging" - just find a bird with human weight. Ninja army flying as a thousand giant eagles make a cool scene, tho.

5) Actually, henging into a giant tiger in melee might be a good idea. If he's iron-plated, all the better. Tigers tend to be better than humans in close ranges, and what about tiger-specific martial arts?

6) And what about Eliezer's Transmutation trick, aka "troll headburst?" You could easily do the same with henge.

I think that's enough reasons to either write Henge-based ninja world (with eagle-henge for travel, tiger-henge for melee and alot of other cool things), or make Henge some kind of illusion technique with hard limits suited only for infiltrations and such.
