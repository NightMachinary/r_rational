Good call about the Magnet Release, but reading up on it it seems like it's just super strong and effectively the control of metal. There's a huge difference between that and becoming a magnet.

How do you explain the scene from 6:00 onwards [[http://www.narutonine.com/NarutoEpisode45EnglishDubbed.html][here]], during his fight with Kiba? Naruto is under a layered henge, and his second doesn't break. The first breaking could even be excused by "he was out of chakra/fainted from the punch", as could Akamaru's actual reveal in the next forced-henge-removal. If one henge breaks per hit you could keep layering them of the same type. Does damage actually get done like that? I'd agree that it's a matter of chakra control and amount of chakra for the Adamantine Staff.
