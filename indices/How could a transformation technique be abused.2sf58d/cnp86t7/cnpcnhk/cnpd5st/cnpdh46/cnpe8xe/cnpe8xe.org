Ah, I'm mostly coming at this from the manga side. At least in [[http://www.mangapanda.com/93-82-5/naruto/chapter-77.html][this translation]], Sakura is pretty clear that it was a quick transformation. It could be that he used the smoke of the dispelling henge to make seals, or this is one of his first seal-less henge. It could really go either way, as the surprising bit is going from one henge in to another while the first is forcibly dispelled.
