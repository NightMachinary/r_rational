Conservation of momentum means you can't throw, but if you're falling above them already...

The smallest thing anyone henge's into is a small dog, and he doesn't move at all while he is the dog (doesn't mean he can't, however, he's just playing injured). I'm going to say that the smaller something is, the more dense has to be in order to store the rest of your body. Denser chakra = much harder and costly to do. So no, it wouldn't be impossible, just impractical. If the enemy is skilled enough that you need to resort to such a chakra-intensive attack like that, they're probably skilled enough to dodge it.
