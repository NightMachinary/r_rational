You mention turning a frog into a fox - that implies this can be done to people other than the caster.

What are the range limitations? Is there any sort of passive resistance to Henge in your fic?

If not, you could potentially use Henge offensively, and for example, turn an enemy into, say, jello. Or anything else you could easily scatter or destroy.

How do you survive turning yourself into something like a shuriken? Is your "real" body being held in an extra-dimensional space of some kind? If you're a shuriken, do you still have conscious thoughts? Can you deliberately force yourself to revert to your normal state at any time?

Could you transform parts of yourself into weaponry or armor without causing yourself trauma or discomfort? How about other forms, like turning parts of your body into energy (ala a logia user in One Piece, for example).

Can you use Henge to heal yourself or others by transforming injuries away?

Or, if you can't heal the body, how about transforming a target until they can get appropriate medical attention? Would their "normal" injuries still deteriorate while their body is transformed?

Can you henge a material into a material that has rare or unusual properties if you are sufficiently familiar with it? This could have huge economic ramifications if you could make it last long enough, or practical applications if you could, say, transform something into a chakra-blocking material.
