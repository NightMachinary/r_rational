Temporary healing seems like a pretty useful application, then.

In terms of the chakra blocking material, I was thinking something like the canon [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra_Armour][chakra armor]], but potentially in other shapes and sizes.

If you're thinking about other types of things to optimize in the Naruto universe, I recommend considering summoning scrolls (like the ones used in the Chunin exams) as well. [[http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Reverse_Summoning_Technique][Reverse summoning]] is another one that could probably be utilized much more heavily than they do in canon.
