Yea that probably wouldn't be the best way to get infinite energy, as chakra cost is prohibitive for a lot of transformations.

It would be more like that the center of mass of the heavy object is 0,0, so when you henge into a long thin object it's still centered around 0,0. This makes turning into a circle in the right direction (like a hula hoop) good for dodging, but you can't travel that way.

You /can/ henge into a pendulum with with all the weight raised on one end that swings to the other end and transform again, which /would/ move you. It would definitely be slower and more intensive than running, though. You could also become a coiled spring to bounce in an unpredictable fashion or a sling shot (with the bullet attached to the sling because it can't separate) ready to fire. As long as no part has different velocity than the others, you can generate potential energy via the transformation.
