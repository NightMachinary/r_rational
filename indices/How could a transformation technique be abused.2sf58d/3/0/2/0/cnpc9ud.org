I would say the way that would make sense and not power the turbine is that the air you're displacing also becomes part of your transformation, and gets released when the transformation finishes. This brings in questions of "what if the air isn't air" though, like transforming under water or in poison gas. Hmm.

You could just henge into a coiled spring and bounce against something if you wanted generation, though.
