Chakra can't be forced on something with chakra offensively - people can't "heal" their insides to mush at the first touch or use kawarimi on someone who won't accept it. Henge would be the same.

Range limitations would be dependent on chakra cost, but when Naruto makes 1k clones the furthest ones are pretty far away. Since my character isn't a jinchuuriki, i'd say a 10 feet radius to cost-effectively change something.

Yes, you're real body is being held in an extra-dimensional space, but roughly attached to the object as well. The universe has storage scrolls for the easiest example of such a space existing, but there still needs to be a reason why you can't just henge into someone else to avoid all damage, so if someone punches you-shuriken enough to bend the metal, you might come out of the henge seriously bruised. Yes you still have conscious thoughts, as a common water jutsu is turning into a puddle and they can still think in that state. Yes you can revert at any time, within reason. You can't be put in a box and henge into something larger to automatically break the box for example.

Yes you can, and that's actually the largest strength I can think of. It's not perfect, though, due to visualization problems. You can turn yourself into metal (the flexible kind, like Dr. Doom) for extra resistance but it doesn't quite have the same hardness of metal. Seeing as how turning yourself into water is a water-specific jutsu you can't do if you don't have a water element, I'd say the same holds true for other types of energy. Lava element exists, but there are no light element users.

Temporarily heal, yes. It would be a constant chakra drain depending on the severity of injury, and you'd need to be medic-level to visualize a healed injury appropriately. Injuries wouldn't deteriorate like this.

Yes, but it's still a chakra construct, and still you. You'd have to be familiar with it at the molecular level for most things, too, which is why magnets would still be fine. A wall of graphene for ultimate defense is possible though. Radioactive material would have an enormous chakra cost due to rapidly sending off bits of you everywhere. The vagueness of henge doesn't cover "turn into something to block/absorb chakra" though.
