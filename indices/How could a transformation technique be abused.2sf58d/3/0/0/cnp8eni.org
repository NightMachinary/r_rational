  Chakra can't be forced on something with chakra offensively

Well, it can, but it generally falls in the category of genjutsu when it does. Brute forcing someone else's chakra system does appear to be a cost-prohibitive attack, since it's relatively simple to reset your own chakra once you've noticed the attack. However, I suspect that Orochimaru and Kabuto both have used more than one medic technique on unwilling subjects.
