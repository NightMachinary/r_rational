Electronics work just fine, but transforming into them would requires years of practice to form the mental image. Most transformations don't require that much - even a person is only the outside image, something you can picture in detail. A circuit board is extremely difficult, though, but doable if you know it well enough. A full computer? No way. So it's not entirely "electronics don't work" such as it is "things that require every part to be transformed successfully require you to think about each part that's supposed to work". It'd be easy to be a vague circuit board, but one that's connected properly is very difficult.

  what would the world look like if all the atoms during a transformation were held stationary relative to the other transformed atoms?

I don't know what you mean by this.

  what if a ninja transformed herself into a single electron?

They can't, because there's a "more mana required" penalty for something extremely different in mass - either compressing the chakra that contains the storage for your actual body or expanding it to massive degrees require more chakra control or reserves than any ninja have. The smallest that they could get down to might be a baseball sized object (or a small dagger), because that's what makes sense, but this rule is never mentioned in the anime itself.
