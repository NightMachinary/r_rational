Yes the frog was smart enough ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esYJYwXiSfw][37:30 onwards on this video is the moment in question]]) to accept it, and actually it seems like using henge on the other living thing caused both to be in the same body. The frog even said, "You shall act upon my will to do this transformation", implying it might be the frog's knowledge that made it work at all. The frog in fox form was able to use tails, the fox body, and use it /well/, too, to be able to move around like it did, so there's some instinctual knowledge that comes with the transformation.

If you don't specifically visualize it, the remaining parts are made up of generic chakra stuff. When you henge into someone else, you don't get what's in their pockets, but the lumps that the stuff makes would be there, made out of generic chakra stuff. So no the frog wouldn't have a fox's sense of smell, automatically. If they were trying for that, like to henge into a dog for better smell or a hawk for better long distance vision, it would work. You'd need to become the full animal to get all the instincts along with it to use the sensory information, so no chimaeras allowed.
