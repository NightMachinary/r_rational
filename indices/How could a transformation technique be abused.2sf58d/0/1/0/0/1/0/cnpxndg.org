Maybe, but in the manga, chapter 135 page 17 [[http://mangasee.co/manga/?series=Naruto&chapter=135&index=1&page=17][link]] it shows only 1 tail not 9, and Sasuke said "A fox" rather than "the kyuubi". As no mention of it actually being the Kyuubi was made in the anime, it probably only had the extra tails for embellishment.
