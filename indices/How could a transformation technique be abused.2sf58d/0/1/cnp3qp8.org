I /am/ going with "because you couldn't visualize it sufficiently", so yes simple devices still work. If you could create electronics vaguely, I would henge into myself wearing a "control nanites" hat and holding a "make nanites" device, make some real nanites, have them make a real hat, then rule the world with ease and be invincible. This is also the same thing I'd do with Green Lantern's ability, as he /can/ make electronics vaguely (like a car and a helicopter).

The clothing is one of the stronger aspects of it. I think of it kind of like Mystique's power - she couldn't take off clothing either. However, henge'ing into yourself wearing skii's or with a surfboard or in a hazmat suit or with a parachute are all possible. Yes you can henge into someone without their clothes. You wouldn't copy hidden birthmarks or scars unless you've seen them on the actual person though.

Momentum is conserved, according to the shuriken thing (2:20+ [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv2QswVxf6c][here]] for reference). It's not definite in the anime, but it doesn't look like he continues on at the speed of the thrown Shuriken. He's able to throw a kunai back, too, which also implies momentum is conserved.

"Sasuke could tell instantly that the shuriken was me, so he pulled out his own ..." There's a weight difference somewhere in the middle, but it's not exactly average. It can also be changed depending on chakra use. Making something lighter or heaver is an earth jutsu (and it can be done to the extreme, including flying) so it's definitely possible. Naruto also henge'd into Akamaru to fool Kiba, but didn't move so he might've been unable to. Re-watching it, though, he /layered two henge/ (6:00 at [[http://www.narutonine.com/NarutoEpisode45EnglishDubbed.html][here]]) which I hadn't noticed before.
