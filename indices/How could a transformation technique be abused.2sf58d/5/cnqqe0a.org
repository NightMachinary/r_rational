Henge yourself into "you holding a sword" to avoid needing a friend to use the weapon you make.

If it's something like a sword, then rehenging it after creating it the first time might be a good way around the rule that says you have to visualize it clearly. Vaguely imagine something, then imagine something a little more like the thing you want than the thing you have.
