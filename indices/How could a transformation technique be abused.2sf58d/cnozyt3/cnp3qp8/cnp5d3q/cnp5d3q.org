How are you able to henge biological constructs(whatever the Fox has, that couldn't be gleaned from the frog or from the human) without being able to visualise the details? In this case would it not really be a fox- would it retain the reflexes of the frog while only bearing superficial material and proportional similarities to a Fox? For instance, neither humans nor frogs have good schematics for a fox nose, it's sense of smell would be no better than either, even if it had the nose, how would the frog brain understand its sensory input? The giant frog in question, was it smart enough to understand what was happening and facilitate the process? If not, how was it consenting(you'd mentioned offensive henging isn't possible)?
