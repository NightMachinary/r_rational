I don't think this is consistent. If you can spirit up a working hound form, where is the schematic coming from? Why then, could you not get a computer schematic from the same place? If it only requires the caster to say, lay hands on an object before they can mimic it (or laying hands on another henge user mimicking the object in question, presumably. I mean, you could write it out if you really wanted to, it's not perfectly in line with the spirit of the source material, but I'd say it's more in line with the spirit of nature. Balance things too hard and you'll need a Zion.) , then I suppose there's a realm of exploits that stem from mimicking very very expensive machinery. Though it seems like this might have limited combat applications due to the stipulated difficulty of replicating hard objects and projectile weapons?

It's possible this is underexplored territory, for we muggles. The history of technology has followed the constraints of mass-production, materials costs, and durability(you can reform an injured henge, right?). Take those concerns out of the equation and who knows what kind of technologies we might end up preferring.
