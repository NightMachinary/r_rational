Why wouldn't henged electronics work? They aren't magical (or chakra-based), they're just physics. Maybe you would need someone to add a battery after you henged into a circuit board / light bulb / whatever, but it should still work. If the answer is "because you couldn't visualize it sufficiently", then sufficient study of appropriate textbooks and confining yourself to simple devices (e.g. a taser) should still work.

Note that when ninja Henge into a person (or when they clone themselves), they get the clothing and general non-chakra-based gear that that person has as well. You said that you can't separate the parts -- does that mean that a henged person can't take their gloves / hat / whatever off? If so, that's a pretty easy way to see through a Henge -- just make them take their gloves off. Can you Henge into someone but /not/ copy their clothes? If so, I guess you could put on real clothes that were duplicates of their normal attire.

What happens to the person's momentum when they henge in your fic? Say I turn into a giant shuriken (thereby shedding most of my mass) and someone throws me. Halfway to my target, I turn back into myself. Do I slow down, or continue at the same speed? If I come back with the same speed, can I throw a regular shuriken from mid-air so that it flies faster than I would have been able to throw it on my own?

Oh, wait, let's crank it up a notch: say I make a clone and the clone Henges into a shuriken. I pick the shuriken up and then Henge into a shuriken myself. My friend throws me. In midair I turn back to a human and throw my clone-shuriken. In midair /he/ turns back and throws a regular shuriken. How fast is the regular shuriken moving? Iterate this through as many levels as I can make clones and, if momentum is not conserved, I should be able to accelerate the final shuriken to bullet-like velocities.

For that matter, what happens with mass? Say that I weigh 99 kg (to keep the math easy) and I turn into a giant shuriken (mass of ~1kg, maybe?). You said that the actual mass of the Henged form is the average, so I should be a shuriken that weighs 50 kg. Could someone actually throw that? They do it without visible effort on the show, so it should be possible -- are all ninja enormously stronger than normals, can the Henge dump more mass than you're suggesting, am I able to accelerate myself, or is something else happening?
