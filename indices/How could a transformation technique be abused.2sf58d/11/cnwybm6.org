There appears to be a fundamental problem with your physics. The quantum physics that make something a solid or a gas are the same rules that allow electron conduction. "Electronics don't work" is something that you're imposing for your own plot, but you need to decide the physics of transformation and ask what the consequences are rather than start in the middle.

I might recommend asking "what would the world look like if all the atoms during a transformation were held stationary relative to the other transformed atoms?" or "what if a ninja transformed herself into a single electron?" and proceed from there. Good luck! :-)
