I could certainly have worded all of that better. What I'm trying to convey is mapping atoms to atoms is tough from a physics perspective and leaves all kinds of room for workarounds. Are ninjas able to transform themselves into elementary particles while also changing the mass of the particle? My earlier queston was trying to get at the idea of a more massive electron. Along the same lines, it could be possible to form yourself into an equivalent amount of neutron star matter. Are ninjas allowed to visualize electrons collapsed into the nucleus of the atom? I think the crux of your idea might hinge on the physics of the ninja-to-atom mapping. What lets a ninja go on thinking human thoughts? Why should a perfectly good universe respect one ninja's conception of a circuit board but not another ninja's less-well-pictured version?
