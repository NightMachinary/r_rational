Right, the upper and lower limits are set by the person's chakra capacity. Lower limit would be super dense chakra requiring intense concentration and have steep costs. Upper limit would be spreading the chakra very thin to make up all the extra mass. Also, it's said a few times that if you try to do a jutsu you don't have the reserves for, you'll just die of immediate chakra exhaustion - it won't cancel halfway through. If you did try to become a star, nothing would happen and you'd fall over, dead.

Really big winged things actually do exist, and fly, in the series. They're pretty chakra intensive though. Definitely not a beginner move and only some are great for actual travelling.

A hot air balloon would be a chemical reaction. Temperature isn't something you can affect in the transformation, so you couldn't have the air already be hot and you'd need to install the flame (or use fire jutsu), making it either impractical or very chakra intensive.

Momentum is conserved, so if you're thrown as a 10 lb object and you dispel your henge into a 100 lb object, you'd be moving slower. This is shown in the anime, too, when he untransforms from a shuriken and can throw a kunai backwards (the throw would have gone nowhere if velocity was conserved).
