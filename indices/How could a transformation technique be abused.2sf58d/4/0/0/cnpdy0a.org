Almost all matter manipulation turns into infinite energy. In this case, we have to work around the lack of chemical/nuclear reactions, but it can still be done by purely mechanical means.

Crude example: you can make a /really/ stiff spring. And then, you can magically keep growing and growing. Eventually, the spring will be compressed. For free. You are limited only by the spring and your patience.

Another crude example: Trivial to create vacuum chambers

Another crude example: Get on the other end of a big lever and start increasing your mass. Lift arbitrarily heavy objects.

I'm sure if you get enough engineers on it you can make these processes high-yield enough to be worth your time. It's just a matter of forcing stuff into high energy configurations, and there's no theoretical upper limit to how unstable things can get.

Magical systems typically violate conservation laws unless specifically designed to not do so.
