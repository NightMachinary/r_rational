  they were too short and slow-moving to hold my interest, and I got really tired of Naruto shouting "Believe it!" every three minutes.

I much prefer the manga to either the dubbed anime (I can't get used to the English voice actors) or the subbed anime (no "Believe it", but still way too slow). Early on in the anime run, it caught up to the manga, and had to seriously pad time and even run filler (basically fanfiction by the animation studio) segments and episodes. I remember rereading the mangas from the beginning after switching from the subbed anime and being blown away by how quickly things moved.
