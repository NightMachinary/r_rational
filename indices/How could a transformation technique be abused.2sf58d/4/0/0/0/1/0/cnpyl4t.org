  superman powers the entire continent for a day by rotating a crank once

How feasible would it be to make machinery that could handle enough power for a continent in a couple of seconds? If we expand this thing to engineer lots of stuff to use the magic energy in ways we currently can't, isn't it pretty safe to say we might already have solved the energy thing anyway? I mean, if we suddenly have few extra tech levels, then it isn't just the single magical transformation that we abuse, is it?
