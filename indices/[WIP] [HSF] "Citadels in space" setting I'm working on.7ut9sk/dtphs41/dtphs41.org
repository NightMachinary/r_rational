/Possible character arc is a technically competent astronaut who is used to working on technical projects with contiunous communication with earth having to make solo tactical and leadership decisions when communications are shut off and they are attacked./

Keep in mind that since we have handheld satellite phones today, the opposite also is possible. A handheld device could be used to communicate with ground, assuming it has LoS with one of the massive ground stations any major space agency will have.

Our astronaut merely needs to shield his device from any jammers the enemy is using such that no jammer can see the phone while it can see the antenna.
