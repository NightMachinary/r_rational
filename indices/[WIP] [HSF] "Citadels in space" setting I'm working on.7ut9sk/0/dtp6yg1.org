Economic goals: 1: Types of manufacture noone sane wants anywhere near the biosphere. - that is, experimental self-replicants, solvents and acids that are extremely useful and also just ridiculously toxic, raw material extraction and refining in bulk. : Generally speaking earthside takes externalities /very seriously/ which means a lot of heavy industry is automated off world. Workers on the space station are obsessively safety conscious because if anything they worked with was in any way shape or form safe, it would be happening on a ground side installation in Germany or something. This also makes soldiers very nervous because breaking a vat of goo has a very good chance of dissolving you. All of this type of activity is mostly near earth, to keep the supply chains and inevitable evacuations short. Space stations that go grey goo are focused with mirrors until they reach temperature equilibrium with the sun, which is a very reliable solution.

The mining is not near earth. Melting down asteroids happens where the asteroids are.

2: Big Science. Further out, mostly because most of these projects need very empty space. Huge telescope arrays, probes shot out to do gravity lens work from beyond Pluto, LISA...
