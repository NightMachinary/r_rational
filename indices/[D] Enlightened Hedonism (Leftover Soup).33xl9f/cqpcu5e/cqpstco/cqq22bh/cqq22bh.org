It seems to me that either you have some other implicit assumption or something is wrong with what you are describing..

#+begin_quote
  maximum physical pleasure possible for a human
#+end_quote

What other kind of pleasure is there? In the end any kind of positive feeling a creature can experience is physical, be it "simple" fun, such as eating something tasty, or "complex fun, such as the fulfillment of a person seeing their child succeeding and enjoying his life. That is unless one of your assumptions is the existence of "souls" and you decide that they do not fit the the definition of "physical

So why wouldn't such a theoretical machine supply the person with those kind of enjoyment as well?
