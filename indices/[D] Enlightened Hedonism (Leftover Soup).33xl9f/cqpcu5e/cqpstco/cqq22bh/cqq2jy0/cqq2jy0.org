  What other kind of pleasure is there?
#+end_quote

There is physical pleasure (e.g orgasm) and mental pleasure (e.g. having a great time with your friends, or succeeding at a difficult task).

Wireheading, according to my definition, provides only physical pleasure. It's basically super-heroin.

  So why wouldn't such a theoretical machine supply the person with those kind of enjoyment as well?
#+end_quote

I'm discussing machines that could reasonably be created with existing or foreseeable technology. I'm not discussing theoretical machines with computational engines so powerful that they can completely simulate my brain state, determine what brain states correspond to pleasure-at-difficult-job-well-done, pleasure-at-seeing-my-loved-ones-succeed, schadenfreude, etc and then find some way to overlay all of those various brain states on me at the same time without them interfering with one another.
