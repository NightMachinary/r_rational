Let me start with my definition of wireheading so we're all on the same page:

"Artificially stimulating the pleasure center of the brain so that the individual continuously experiences the maximum physical pleasure possible for a human."

Further, I have the following assumptions about wireheading:

1. The recipient will resist, to the best of their limited ability, having the wire removed.
2. The recipient is not capable of other actions while wireheading.
3. Because of 1. and 2. the recipient will starve / thirst to death unless bodily maintenance methods have been put in place ahead of time.

Assuming the above is what we're talking about, I've never understood why conversations about wireheading as a dangerous thing happen...or, at least, why they are dangerous for a randomly selected individual.

On [[http://capitalistexploits.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.png][Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] physical pleasure falls somewhere around level 2.5 -- it's something you look for after security of body etc, but probably before you look for friendship and sexual intimacy (/intimacy/, not just release).

There are three full levels above that! Once you start wireheading you can't seek pleasure from family, friendship, respect of others, creativity, etc. Sure, once you're actually under the wire you won't care about any of that, but before you go under the wire you will. It is my belief that most people will say "I'm sure this would be fun, but I'd rather have these other things." As evidence of this belief I submit that the vast majority of humans are not heroin addicts.
