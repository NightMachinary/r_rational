That's exactly what I said; once you're in the machine you don't care about anything else and will attempt to keep yourself from being disconnected.

I believe that the vast majority of people will not choose to get into the machine of their own free will.

"well-meaning hedonist utilitarians [forcing everybody] into those chairs" is a different conversation. That's not about the dangers of wireheading, that's about the dangers of people imposing their utility function on others.
