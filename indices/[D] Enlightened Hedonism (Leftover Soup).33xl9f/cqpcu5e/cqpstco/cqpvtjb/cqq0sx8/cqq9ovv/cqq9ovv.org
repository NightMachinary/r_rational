Yup. And it's only a slight difference: direct stimulation of the brain so as to provide positive/desirable feelings.

However, that difference allows for the possibility of feeling whichever level of Maslow's hierarchy one can feel via such stimulation, thus making wireheading a lot more potentially desirable.

Still, whatever level of wireheading we've achieved so far has produced the following: - Animals basically become immediate addicts - Humans generally report varied levels of enjoyment, mostly very high, but don't seem to show addiction - And in addition, regular wireheading has been shown, when done correctly, to help mitigate depression

Note that I'm using a loose definition of addiction here...extreme compulsion might be a better phrase as pertains to accuracy.
