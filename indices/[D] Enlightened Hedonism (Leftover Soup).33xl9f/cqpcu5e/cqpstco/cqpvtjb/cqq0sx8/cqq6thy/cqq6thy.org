Going mostly off likely flawed memory here: Standard real life "wire-heading" used things like a button to activate the pleasure (in the possession of the wire-headed person), so it wasn't absolutely on all the time.

Still though, in some animal trials mice were known to press the button instead of eating till they died. I think Tomas is saying, that human ability to manage survival and the pleasure button is better, but I haven't actually seen the studies myself.
