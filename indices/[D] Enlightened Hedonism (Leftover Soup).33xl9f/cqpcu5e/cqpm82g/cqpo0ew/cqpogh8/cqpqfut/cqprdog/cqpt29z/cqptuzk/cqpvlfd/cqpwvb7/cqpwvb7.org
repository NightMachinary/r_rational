Ahh, ok. Thanks for clarifying!

I do still disagree a bit: while we're agreed that, say, giving an irrationally suicidal person instructions for a homemade painless death machine is indeed bad, I think discussing such machines, and even their instructions is good. Even beyond any inherent value--and actually, I'd argue that knowledge doesn't have any inherent value, but rather that all knowledge has at least a chance of being useful, and thus has at least some degree of extrinsic value. Rather, I'd say that such discussions address the important question, "should life always be lived, and if not, is there a best method for ending it?"

Similarly, while I wouldn't excite anyone's phobia intentionally/directly, I'd disagree that spreading potentially-triggering info is bad, no matter how likely the trigger. Rather, not prefacing it with trigger warnings is bad, as is allowing anyone who is oversensitive to information free access to it. Myself and many of my friends suffer from depression as well--and let me take a sec to extend my sympathies to you and yours. It's a hell of a disease, and you and they have my admiration for your efforts in the face of it, and my sincere sympathy for having to bear with it to any degree.

Still: having been suicidal, I do not think the existence of, say, noose tying tutorials, nor their existence at the other end of an easy internet search, was a bad thing, even for me, even at that time. Though I'm probably quite lucky I didn't find one--or rope, for that matter--the problem as I see it is that I was neglected to the point of having free access to such information while in an emergency-level state. Though my depression is much more manageable now, I still have to avoid certain stories or bits of info, especially the news--and occasionally need to recruit a friend to help keep me away from even Disney movies. (I do /not/ recommend watching the first ten minutes of Up while contemplating the possibility that life is just a prolonged torture concocted by cosmic accidents and bad feedback loops.)

So I do agree that looking after what information people take in, and when, is immensely important. However, I /really/ recommend against doing it on the generation end of things, and believe strongly that censoring the receiving end is key/ideal. That, and paying close attention to our own/each others' sensitive areas.

Most importantly: even in such a small thing as changing your initial position to your reflected-upon one, you do me an honor. This subreddit and my general principles both value earnest discussion quite highly; if I had any to give, you'd be receiving some gold, but as it is I'll just upvote your post and ask that anyone who reads these words do the same.
