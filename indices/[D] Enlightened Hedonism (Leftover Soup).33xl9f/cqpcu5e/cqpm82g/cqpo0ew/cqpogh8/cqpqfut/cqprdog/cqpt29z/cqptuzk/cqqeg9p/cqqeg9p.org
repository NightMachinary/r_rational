  I mean no disrespect by this, but... I think your downvote and response reflect kind of a scary idea, which is that people shouldn't be trusted with information.

There is a kind of information people shouldn't be trusted with: secrets, which are only valuable while they remain secret.

But yeah, you're much less likely to act in a reflectively-correct manner if someone is deliberately depriving you of useful information. Propaganda, brainwashing, all the old canards.
