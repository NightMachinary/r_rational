But life /isn't/ a prolonged torture concocted by cosmic accidents and bad feedback loops. In fact, it's very non-prolonged, and quite definitively not tortuous (that is, the world isn't /trying hard/ to make you suffer).

So far in history, it sucks being confined to a tiny portion of life-possibility space that is eventually going to be labelled "survivalist shithole full of nutters raving on about how biodecay is good for your moral character." But, well, hey, we're working to break out of that corner, so you can cheer up!
