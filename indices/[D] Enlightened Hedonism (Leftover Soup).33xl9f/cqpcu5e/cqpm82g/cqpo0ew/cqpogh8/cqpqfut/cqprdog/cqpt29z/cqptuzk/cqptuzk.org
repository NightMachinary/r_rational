Hm. I think that's true of a lot of things--off the top of my head, drugs are a good example--but I think the possibility of obsession is an excellent reason to /demystify/ something. If all that's known of weed were "marijuana is prized for its high, and has few if any adverse physiological effects," I think that'd definitely encourage its (ab)use. But add the fact, "this high does not translate to the feeling of fulfillment, and can often impede one from seeking it due to the temporary impairment that coincides with the pleasurable high," and it becomes kinda scary--clearly the sort of thing that, while not as bad as alcohol or cigarettes, can be dangerous and doesn't provide what one really wants.

On the flipside, if TMS actually does provide a shortcut to happiness--complete, fulfilling happiness--and granted, I don't think that's possible; but if it did, it'd be arguably the best possible thing to build enough TMS machines for the whole race, and then find a way to power them and sustain our lives indefinitely.

In short: if it really isn't good, then we should talk about it. If it really is good, we should talk about it.

I mean no disrespect by this, but... I think your downvote and response reflect kind of a scary idea, which is that people shouldn't be trusted with information. And not only that, but that talking about certain things is so negative as to actually detract from a conversation in a way that should be penalized. Absolutely, abuses of knowledge occur. But I don't believe limiting knowledge is actually the solution--rather, I'd argue that only a person's desire to ignore information/to act on only partial knowledge is the problem. And I think saying we shouldn't use TMS might well be accurate, though I actually suspect it's not--it sounds like an excellent treatment for depression, from the research I've read, and not addictive. Still...while not in any way wanting to force my beliefs on you, I do really worry about the implications of encouraging actual censorship.

Please do let me know if I've misunderstood your position, or else if you have a counterargument you think I'm failing to consider, though.
