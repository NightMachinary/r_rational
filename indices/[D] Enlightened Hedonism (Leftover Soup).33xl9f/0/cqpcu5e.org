Similar though this is to my own philosophy, and much though I love Leftover Soup, I am now going to do a point-by-point rebuttal for my own amusement. I am large, I contain multitudes, etc etc.

  It is self-evident that the purpose of life is the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.

  Note that "pleasure", here, denotes enjoyable sensations and the fulfillment of desire at any and all levels of the consciousness - the existence of masochism does not invalidate this precept.
#+end_quote

This is either wrong or tautological; either "pleasure" just means a being's utility function, in which case it is tautological, or it means the usual meaning of "pleasure" ... in which case it is self-admittedly wrong. In practise, this is clearly an attempt at what some people call the motte-and-bailey fallacy; definibg your terms one way and then using them another.

  It is equally self-evident that the most powerful and effective tool possessed by human beings for the achievement of this purpose is the ability to think.
#+end_quote

How about hands? Or speech? If you find a way to safely wirehead, will /that/ be the new Most Important Thing?

#+begin_quote
  An enlightened person seeks higher-level pleasures over lower-level ones, and long-term pleasurable lifestyles over short-term harmful thrills.
#+end_quote

Long-term pleasurability versus short-term is just basic utilitarianism, obviously; but I think using it this way brushes the possibility of long-term wireheading under the carpet.

The phrase "higher-level metapleasures" is, as far as I can tell, gibberish. It's clearly being used as code for "obviously I /actually/ value lots of things other than pleasure, and when it becomes important enough I will ignore my stated principles".

#+begin_quote
  The definition of "good" behaviour is the practice of empathy - the belief that one's own pleasure and pain are no more and no less important than the pleasure and pain of another.

  Enlightened hedonists attempt to expand their empathy as far as possible - not only to other humans who are physically or psychologically dissimilar, but to any entity capable of experiencing sensations analogous to human pleasure and pain.
#+end_quote

As is, in fact, clear in the strip, this has led Max to value literally every sentient being equally; up to and including insects. The only reason this is tenable is because she apparently can't multiply.

Still, there's not much else I can argue with here.

#+begin_quote
  The enlightened hedonist embraces the alteration of her own consciousness in the pursuit of greater pleasure.

  Enlightened hedonists seek out pleasure in all its forms - they embrace every taste, explore every thrill and test out every sensation available within the bounds of reason and empathy. She utilizes discipline and willpower to surmount any and all instincts, prejudices and limitations that stand between her and pleasure.
#+end_quote

"I will self-modify away anything that prevents me wireheading, including elements of my utility function that make wireheading less valuable to me!"

Nobody must ever tell Max that "wireheading" isn't a metaphor, it's an actual medical procedure we've been able to do for decades :(

#+begin_quote
  Enlightened hedonists accept the validity of choice in other entities in direct proportion to that entity's intelligence.

  It should be noted, here, that "intelligence" means exactly that - the ability to think. It does not in any way refer to an entity's actual thinking, nor to their adherence to enlightened hedonism. Followers of other philosophies should be free to follow their philosophies.

  Enlightened hedonists may advocate the benefits of their worldview, but they should in no way impose these beliefs on anyone capable of dissenting, except in such cases where their beliefs result in the causing of pain to others. While an enlightened hedonist's empathy may twinge in response to another entity's self-inflicted pain, she has no right to force decisions on that party, except in such cases where said self-inflicted pain is the result of ignorance or mental impairment.
#+end_quote

Huh, that's a pretty interesting point. I'd forgotten that was there.

Anyway, since this only permits "self-inflicted pain", you're still trying to force literally everyone into complying with your beliefs. It sounds tolerant and open-minded, but it really, really isn't.
