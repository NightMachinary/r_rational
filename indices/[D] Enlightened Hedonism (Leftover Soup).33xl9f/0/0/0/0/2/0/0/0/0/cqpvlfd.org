Knowledge tends to have an inherent value, it's worth attaining for its own sake. And indeed, the best way to move forward is to gain a greater understanding of how to reach our goals. It's worthwhile to try to move forward by promoting further study, even if some people can use knowledge in a bad way.

I wasn't censoring you. I wasn't even saying that you should be censored. I just thought it was a bad idea to spread that particular piece of information around. Kind of like how you don't go out of your way to show your antisocial arachnophobic friend the news article about how in some places it can rain spiders, since you know it might make them ever more reluctant to leave the house.

Only it's far worse than that, since wireheading as it is generally discussed has several hugely negative effects on its participants. Making them withdraw from the world, and stop caring about anything else. Having spent some time around people whom suffer from depression, the type of people who might go in for that sort of thing just to escape, I was hit rather strongly with the feeling that I would not want them to get the chance to consider that option. Much like how, in a hypothetical world where suicide is some obscure facet of reality rather than being widely known about, you wouldn't want to tell your depressed friend about it. You might gather some well learned colleagues and discuss the matter in private, but bringing it up in public seems unlikely to do any good.

I should be clear that that was just my gut reaction. I hadn't taken the time to read the posted article, and once I did it was clear that things weren't remotely so bad as I'd thought. The wireheading you suggest is quite distinct from the nightmarish thought experiments I've read.
