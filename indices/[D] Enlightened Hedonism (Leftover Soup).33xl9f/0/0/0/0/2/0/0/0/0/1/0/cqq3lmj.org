I did not threaten or coerce, nor did I say that he should be threatened or coerced (he shouldn't). I simply stated, not even particularly rudely, that I thought it was a bad idea for him to bring that information up at a later point (a statement I'm not currently standing behind).

Isn't expressing dislike for an idea almost identical to saying that you would prefer that the idea not become more widespread?
