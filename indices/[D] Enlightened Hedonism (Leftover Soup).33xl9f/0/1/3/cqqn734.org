According to Wikipedia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure%20center]["More recent research has shown that the so-called pleasure electrodes lead only a form of wanting or motivation to obtain the stimulation, rather than pleasure."]] (Berridge, K.C., Kringelbach, M.L. (2008) Affective neuroscience of pleasure: Reward in humans and other animals. Psychopharmacology 199, 457-80.)

At the very least that should make it something to be approached cautiously by would-be hedonists.
