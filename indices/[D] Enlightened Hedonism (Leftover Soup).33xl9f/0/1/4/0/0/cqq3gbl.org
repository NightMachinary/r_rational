I might not have been clear, to my understanding what you feel corresponds to the physical state of your brain. Thus these "complex" types of enjoyment are just the result of different hormones being released in different parts of the brain.

i.e. you don't really need a virtual reality or anything such as that to push the pleasure centers that these actions push.
