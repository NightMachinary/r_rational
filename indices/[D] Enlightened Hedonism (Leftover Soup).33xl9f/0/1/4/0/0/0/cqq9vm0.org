It looks like we're all agreed that all forms of pleasure are functions of the brain--I'm not making a spiritual argument, nor does anyone else seem to be.

Rather, I think [[/u/eaglejarl]] meant to say that as he understands it, wireheading can at present only effect certain kinds of pleasure, with others not yet being achievable though direct stimulation. Indeed, part of the question here seems to be what extent of the brain's functioning is replicatable via direct stimulation. Does that clear things up?
