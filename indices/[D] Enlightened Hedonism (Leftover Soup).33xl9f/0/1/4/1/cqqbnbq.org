An optimized reward system? Hopefully it won't be so crude as simply stimulating "pleasure" forever.

From Greg Egan's "Schild's Ladder":

  /Tchicaya is a posthuman with a quantum processor for a brain, Yann is a fully software entity currently occupying a similar posthuman body. They have been attempting to have sex, and it's not working out:/

  Yann lay on the floor, watching him. "I think I'm getting all the signals you talked about," he mused. "But they're so crude, even now. And before, it was just a single message, repeating itself endlessly: 'Be happy, be happy, be happy!' Do you think there's something wrong with this body?"

  "I doubt it." Tchicaya sat cross-legged on the floor beside him. "You expected more?"

  "I was already happy, so it was a bit redundant."

  "How happy?"

  "As happy as it's possible to be, for no particular reason."

Wireheading is meaningless for Yann, because his reward system is already optimized. He's already as happy as it's possible to be for no particular reason. Why not?

  "But when you have a malleable mental structure, intensifying pleasure for its own sake is a very uninteresting cul-de-sac. We worked that out a long time ago."
