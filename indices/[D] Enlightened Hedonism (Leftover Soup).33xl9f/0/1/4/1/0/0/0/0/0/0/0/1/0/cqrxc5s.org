Could you link to any kind of information regarding that? because i couldn't find anything regarding that separation..

Also i still don't see how that would change anything.. sure you might still have motivation to do this or that, but it wont effect your enjoyment(by definition) so your preference to do things in one way or another will have effectively no impact on your experience(i am assuming here that wireheading is disabling negative feelings and not just pushing the positive, because otherwise motivation could just be negative based, but these negative feelings would be counterproductive to the wireheading purpose so it stands to reason they will be inhibited just the same)..
