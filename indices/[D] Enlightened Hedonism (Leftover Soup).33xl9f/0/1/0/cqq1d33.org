I have to say, I am not nearly so worried about the likelihood of my, say, tripping headfirst into a wireheading chair as I am about the possibility of well-meaning hedonist utilitarians deciding that the best thing is to force everybody into those chairs.

Because I may not endorse the fact that my mind reacts in certain ways to pleasure over pain, but that doesn't change the fact that such a machine as you describe would still be incredibly addictive and hard to kick, much as meth and heroin are hard to kick (but less so than the wireheading, I would imagine).
