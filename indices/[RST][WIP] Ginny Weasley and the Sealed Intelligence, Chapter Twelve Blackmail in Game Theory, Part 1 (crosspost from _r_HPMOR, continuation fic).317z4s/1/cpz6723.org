Almost surprised Ginny didn't draw a Tower-of-Babel connection to Atlantis. In any case, the Bible study bit presents a believable picture of the wizarding take on Christianity. It seems to have a lot of support from Atlantis and the history of magic, which of course makes sense.

Still no idea how this whole religion plotline is gonna wrap up, though -- with all the time devoted to studying the Bible, it seems more likely to be Christian; whereas relying on fictional justification for it would suggest an atheistic slant. Or maybe, in MoR-verse, Christianity is just /true/. Yknow, with the souls and all. That would be interesting.

Seems like Ginny didn't carve the words into the wall? Note that the spells are so ancient, they'd be blocked by the Interdict, so Tim either learned them from the Basilisk or he's a Horcrux of someone much, much older.

Or Ginny did carve them into the wall, and she was possessed and mind-wiped after, and she seriously needs to end that contract like /yesterday/

In any case, I'm glad everyone's decisively anti-Interdict.

I thought Quirrell killed the Basilisk? Huh.

It seems somewhat anti-[[/r/rational]] that Chrissy figured out that Slytherin's Monster was a basilisk in about 5 minutes, and yet Dumbledore-and-Co still concluded it was an Acromantula during Riddle's day. Whatever.

But the most important question of all: *Which Cedric Diggory got petrified?*
