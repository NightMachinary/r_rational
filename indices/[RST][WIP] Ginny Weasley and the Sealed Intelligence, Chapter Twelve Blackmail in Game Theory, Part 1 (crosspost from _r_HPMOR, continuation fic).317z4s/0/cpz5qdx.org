I have to say, having the narrative simply go "Ginny would totally be okay with sacrificing all of her classmates to break the Interdict, except her moral sensibilities disagreed" is certainly not convincing me that Ginny cares about any of her classmates at all, as a classic example of telling rather than showing.

In fact, I've never really gotten the impression that Ginny is a good person, at all. Regardless of whether horcruxes or lingering remnants of Voldemorts or whatever are involved, it seems that Ginny's base-state is just Not Very Nice. The narration keeps /telling/ us that she's a normal person, but all the actual events that we see indicate that Ginny has an appreciation of the inherent value of other people somewhere between Quirrell and Lucius Malfoy.
