I personally think not wearing his armor was a more poor choice. Mostly because of protection reasons but also branding. The people trust Lord Night Cleaner not Rain the Ragman.

I'll admit he's probably less intimidating without it and that probably contributed to the Watch not being more on edge and that it's a good thing to try and deal with his issues but time and place are freaking key!

I imagine the note was a summons with a date for later so that was why Carten wasn't insistent on Rain reading it ASAP. It still was a suboptimal choice given it's speculation on my part and on Rain's with his reasoning being Carten didn't burst through the door but it's arguably understandable.
