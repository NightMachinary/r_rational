Right, and "if someone steals my armor I'll just search the city" is incredibly dumb. His detection radius isn't that large and an angry person could throw it into the river or a deep hole. He could always just wear it and carry the helmet so people can see his face.

Taking a hot bath to relax? Great. Ditching your armor while in a civil war zone? No.
