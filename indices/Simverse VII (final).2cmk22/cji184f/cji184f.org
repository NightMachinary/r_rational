I agree with [[/u/VorpalAuroch]] that I see a lot of politic/utopia wish fulfillment here, but to couch it in more useful criticism you seem to have invalidating economies of scale based on a hack that large organizations would find a way to utilize, and seem to have entirely forgotten [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor][Hanlon's razor]], unless this is the ultimate end state at the end of the stories. If you want your story in this idealized state, and for people to not use those labels/criticisms, then I'd say spend a lot pages in your intro or several history chapters to show, and not tell, why this happened with more fidelity in the expliation to each event that seems like the obvious moral outcome to you. I'll be glad to read this and see if I pop a credibility button, but this end state seems to assume far too much sanity in humanity. I'd recommend reading some Heinlein, to learn a more pragmatic/cynical view.
