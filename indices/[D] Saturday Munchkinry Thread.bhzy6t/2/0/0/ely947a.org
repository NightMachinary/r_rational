To answer your questions.

The will dies if the rock breaks.

No, anyone can inscribe it. It doesn't need your blood. You could even inscribe the will of animals as long as they have blood.

By touching the rock for the first time, all information about the rock gets sent to your mind.

Hmmmm. Didn't think about that one. The more harm the rock takes the less coherent the will becomes.

Yes, if it isn't being interacted with it can choose to hibernate.

Edit: spell check and a little bit more detailed info
