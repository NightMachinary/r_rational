You have the ability to grow and retract extra heads at will.

- You can grow up to four extras at a time, for five total.
- Each head is fully conscious. When reabsorbed, your memories are combined (unless the brain was destroyed).
- The one in the middle is your 'main' head. It never gets reabsorbed.
- You need to sleep for eight hours for every sixteen hours of consciousness you remember. (ex: reabsorbing four heads with eight hours of memories each instantly makes you feel like you haven't slept in two days).
- When an extra head sleeps, it doesn't reduce your need for sleep.
- When your main head loses consciousness, the others are reabsorbed automatically.
- Extra heads can speak, breathe, and eat.
- The heads are made of your own mass, magically converted. If the mass of one of the heads decreases (ex: you cut off an ear) you don't get that back.
- Extras are duplicates of your main head. If your main head is missing an ear, the extras will be missing it as well.
- Growing all four extras at once emaciates your body.
- Artificial material doesn't duplicate. You'll need five pairs of sunglasses if you want them.
- Contests of will can happen, making your body move erratically.

How would you use this power?
