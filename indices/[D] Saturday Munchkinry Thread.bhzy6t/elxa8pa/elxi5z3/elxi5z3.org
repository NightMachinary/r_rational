Is this the "one weird weight loss trick" I keep seeing ads for?

Anyway imo this is not a particularly useful power for you personally (unless you wanna lose weight real fast thru suicide).

The extra thinking isn't going to be very useful, because it sounds like the new heads all fork off your current state, which means that they're going to spend most of their time thinking the same thoughts as the main head. You could probably train yourself out of that habit, but it would be hard.

Fundamentally though, there's few problems that suddenly become tractable if you think about them for 4x longer - even just getting four other people's opinions would probably work better, because they're /other people/.

Probably the optimal use of this power would be to execute the world's best brain science. You've got disposable heads that can be created at will (biomass permitting), so the research proposals nearly write themselves. You can train neurosurgeons without danger, and generate brains that can be ethically turned into Swiss cheese as long as they're chopped off afterwards. You can test every form of brain imaging known to man for consistency, since now there's a universally standard brain. Probably you'll be the first person uploaded to the cloud, just because it's suddenly feasible to test all sorts of new, destructive scans on you.
