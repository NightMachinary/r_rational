Make sure everyone or almost everyone lives in extremely isolated communities so that they only interact with around 100 people over the course of their life, and meet these people early on in life.

If destiny guarantees that you meet your soulmate eventually, but you never meet anyone outside your home town, then destiny will guarantee that your soulmate is born in your home town.
