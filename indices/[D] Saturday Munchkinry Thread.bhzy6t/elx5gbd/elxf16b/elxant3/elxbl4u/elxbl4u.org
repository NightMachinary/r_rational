The problem I see is that more specific rituals regarding the words reduces their selection power. If everyone greets everyone the same way, all the tattoos match and you won't find your soulmate. If all greetings are not predetermined, you can't use the tattoo to search for your match.

At any rate, I'd make a database of the tattoos for people to use when trying to find soulmates.

Without cultural norms and commitment to using phrases upon meeting people, the words are going to be a random mish-mash of greetings and trite phrases. A cultural norm with a specific greeting for potential mates is a good idea.

What about this: the norm upon meeting a potential mate is to use the first four words for 'first name, last name, month and day of birth'. You can put that into a database and use it to find potential matches.

Then, when you meet, both parties use random word generators to choose the next three words they say. If the 'randomly chosen' words happen to match your tattoos, you are pretty certain you've found the right one.

Some people meet their soulmates outside such a service. To the extent that it is successful, however, many people can be expected to have tattoos that match the protocol.

In fact, a good place to start might be to just build the database and analyze it for patterns. Maybe the most effective strategy will 'fall out' of the data--because if it works, it is more likely to retroactively affect what tattoos people will have.
