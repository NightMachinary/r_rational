  Just collect all the tattoos from newborns every year, assign those people messages they have to say upon greeting every single person they meet, and exploit the closed timelike curves that result.

Could you elaborate on how to do this?

For example, what do you do to minimize rebellion and mistakes?

And how do you match current newborns' answers with their future soulmate's assigned questions, without already knowing who their soulmate is?
