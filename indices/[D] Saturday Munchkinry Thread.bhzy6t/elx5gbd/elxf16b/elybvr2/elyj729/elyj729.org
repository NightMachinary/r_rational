  Which ironically, means the world will be looking for shut-in NEETs: people who willingly shut themselves in a room and never ever go out. Just carry their room around and periodically throw in supplies without meeting the NEET inside. You don't need them to do work or anything, you just need them to sit there and be your good luck charm.

... unfortunately for this strategy, once people reach about age 30 without meeting their soulmate, they begin to develop insight into the workings of time, space and fate. These so-called "wizards" tend to develop the ability to accurately predict theoretically random events (the roll of a fair die, the order of a shuffled deck of cards), which has obvious national security implications.

Wizards often describe this with reference to translucent "strings of fate", which also allow them to locate their soulmates. Few wizards develop their abilities beyond this point, because finding their soulmate is generally both trivial and their highest priority.

In rare cases wizards are either unable or unwilling to find their soulmate, which can lead to strange and destabilizing occurrences. Possibly the best-known of these events was the 1982 "mass-marriage" in New York, wherein several thousand people suddenly realized that their soulmate was, in fact, the person closest to them at the time, despite documented evidence to the contrary (including birth certificates and prison records). This event is believed to be related to the asteroid strike on Times Square, which happened a few moments later.
