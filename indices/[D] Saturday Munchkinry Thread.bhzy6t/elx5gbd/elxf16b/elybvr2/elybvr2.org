Forget the time loop, there's something even crazier you can do:

#+begin_quote
  Yes, destiny is a thing and everyone is guaranteed to meet their soulmates someday.
#+end_quote

GUARANTEED.

In other words, as long as you haven't met your soulmate, *YOU CANNOT DIE.*

You take all kinds of crazy risks without fear of death. Conduct all kinds of mad science experiments, explore all dangerous areas, etc. People who haven't met their soulmates would have incredible value because they provide guarantees that nothing will go horribly wrong. Stick one in a rocket and it can't explode. Stick one on a plane and it can't crash. Stick one in a city and it can't be nuked. Stick one in a nuclear power plant and it can't meltdown. The possibilities are ENDLESS. You can even deliberately engineer elaborate deathtraps where unless the outcome you wish for happens, a bunch of people who have never met their soulmates will die, thus bending the universe to your will.

The only problem would be making sure these people never meet anyone who could be their soulmate and thus cause them to lose their immortality. Which ironically, means the world will be looking for shut-in NEETs: people who willingly shut themselves in a room and never ever go out. Just carry their room around and periodically throw in supplies without meeting the NEET inside. You don't need them to do work or anything, you just need them to sit there and be your good luck charm.
