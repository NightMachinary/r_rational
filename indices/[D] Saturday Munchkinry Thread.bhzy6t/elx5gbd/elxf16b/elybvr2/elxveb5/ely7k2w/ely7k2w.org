First, create the message you want to send into the past. With the technique I describe below, it can be any length up to about 184,530 words long, though shorter will be less work for you.

Next, choose three words that would be rare, not grammatically correct, and unthinkable to use as first words when meeting someone. Something like Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan Petrichor. This clearly flags a tattoo as being a message from the future because there's no way it would occur randomly. It also allows you to cluster messages so that multiple tattoos with these three initial words can be associated together.

Next, add a word to act as a numeral, since you'll need many tattoos and have to be able to rearrange them in order. For this, use the 20-volume 2nd Ed. Oxford English Dictionary (with 615,100 words in it). If you pick the 50,000th word from it for example, the numeral word would equate in value to 50,000.

Now break your original message up into three-word chunks. You'll take the first chunk and combine it with the flag and numeral to get something like "Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan petrichor a cold fusion requires", and the second chunk would end up something like "Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan petrichor A&E magnetoinertial confinement via." Once you've chunked it up like that, repeat the message to a total of 10 times while continuing to use new sequential numeral words. You now have multiple redundant messages that will say the same thing to help ensure reliability against human error.

Next, get a large group of volunteers who are single, interested in finding their soulmate, and 12-16 years old (old enough to follow directions, young enough to probably not have met their soulmate yet). Assign your messages among them. Tell them that if they promise to always say their own unique set of seven words first to every person they meet, it will be possible to locate their soulmate via tattoo registry and match them up, and then do so.

You have now introduced information about a decade into the past. 10 years earlier, younger you would be able to pull up data from the tattoo registry and filter the tattoos to the ones that start with Immunodeficiency Tenochtitlan Petrichor (which you previously selected as a planned flag in case you wish to deliver information to yourself). You could then sort them based on numerical order and reconstruct the message, allowing you access to technology that won't be developed for 10 more years. You can also choose to push this information even further into the past using recursion, allowing access to technology from hundreds or thousands of years in the future.

Edit: Fixed a math error at the top. Previously said it work for up to 61,510 words, but neglected that each message is actually a three-word chunk.
