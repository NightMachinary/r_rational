There's actually a rather significant difference here from normal outcome pumping scenarios. Usually we are given some kind of destiny to personally munchkin, which could prompt the universe to destroy us if we push it towards too improbable scenarios.

But in this case its the entirety of humanity that is given a destiny. Every time anyone does anything that goes against increasing their odds of meeting their soul mate (like going towards increasing their odds of death before meeting their soulmate), they are effectively outcome pumping. That means every soldier, every police officer, every firefighter, every doctor, and pretty much every human is outcome pumping because they all take dangerous actions from time to time. So the universe is being outcome pumped not just by you, but pretty much every human on earth. And while sure, the outcome pumping you do is probably greater than the average because you are deliberately trying to do that, the combined outcome pumping of the other 7 billion people will dwarf yours by far provided you're not pumping something crazy like winning all lotteries or wanting something that goes against the very laws of physics.

Effectively, if the universe would destroy you for outcome pumping, it would also destroy the existence of the rest of humanity to stop their soul mate destiny shenanigans. Which, err, would explain why this is merely a hypothetical scenario that doesn't exist instead of the world we live in.
