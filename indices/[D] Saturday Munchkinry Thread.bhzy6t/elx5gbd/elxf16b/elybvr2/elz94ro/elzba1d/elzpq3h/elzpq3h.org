Well yeah you are right , I guess that if humanity still exists it can't be that bad . You can probably increase your probabilities of survival without much problem , its just that you should be careful and not go around taking crazy risks, and you aren't guaranteed to survive stuff that would be really unlikely for you to survive(although thinking abut it you would be less likely to end up in those kinds of situations so dunno , this kind of destiny causal loop thing is very complicated and hard to have a good mental model of ).

It might be a bad idea for civilization as a whole to start exploiting it massively though , in fact it would be a good idea to ensure people meets their soulmates asap (as op intended) to avoid weirdness happening to get them together( or in fact the weirdness can cause people deciding to ensure everyone meets their soulmates) or even being retroactively erased from existence( well is more of an acausal trade kind of thing instead of retroactively I think ). I mean its not imposible to do it right and be careful , but our civilization or something like it isn't competent enough for that yet.
