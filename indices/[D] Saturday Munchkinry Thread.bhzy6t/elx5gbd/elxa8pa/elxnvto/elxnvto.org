Somehow you acquire a seemingly ordinary rock in which you can "inscribe" your will. The will is a clone of the inscribed and can't move by itself. The inscription works by letting a drop of blood fall on the surface of the rock and only works once. If the rock breaks.

The will can speak to anyone touching the rock telepathically. It also cannot sense anything (apart from you speaking back to it). This rock easily fits in your hand and will probably live on longer than you. What would you do with it?
