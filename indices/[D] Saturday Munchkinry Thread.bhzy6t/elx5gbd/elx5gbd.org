You live in a world where soulmates exist and everyone is born with a tattoo-like birthmark somewhere on their bodies which reads out the first seven words of what your soulmate will say when you first meet them (assuming the individual in question isn't mute for some reason).

Yes, destiny is a thing and everyone is guaranteed to meet their soulmates someday.

What can you or society do to speed up this process to ensure everyone meets their soulmates as early as possible in life?
