Hmm, there are a lot of drawbacks here... for example if I am reading this right I will need ~18.75 hours of sleep every day (my normal 8 plus 2*5.25) if I have 4 extra heads since they are automatically reabsorbed when I fall asleep. Pretty inconvenient.

My strategies would first be on minimizing drawbacks. I am assuming since the heads are perfect duplicates they will share my personality, so I will focus on trying to maximize my ability to work with like-minded people and learn everything I can about how to work in teams. Minimizing my sleep needs and maximizing my ability to work while sleepy will be key to success. Studying meditation so that my main head can rest while conscious would be a good strategy, and the rules say nothing of the extra heads needing rest. Also it should help me be mindful and ignore distractions which will be key to the 'contests of wills' drawback. One head would be assigned to physically improving our body, eating and exercising as much as possible. Physical exertion will not be much of a danger for increasing tiredness when we are getting somewhere in the range of 12 hours of sleep a day at the very least even operating at minimum sleep.

Still, this will allow us a potential for 8-10 hours of exercise a day (with some hours dedicated to helping the other heads setup the things they need to do other activities, as well as eat and take care of other bodily needs), 36 hours of studying (mostly by listening to audiobooks or possibily by using vr goggles of some kind) and 12 hours of meditation and focusing on growing my abilities to ignore external stimulus and become comfortable in my new shared body. That's a lot of extra hours to dedicate to self improvement. Obviously it will become important to actually get stuff done and I am ignoring all of that - this would be the schedule for self improvement days. Trying to obtain or set up some system, hopefully utilizing vr goggles, similar to the one Hawkings used to communicate and interact with computers through eye and facial movement would be important to allow the heads autonomy without calling on the main body too much.

But definitely a lot of drawbacks here that are hard to work around.

Of course, the actual ability, in this world, would make me a really fantastic ventriloquist, magician, or circus act. Could definitely make a fair amount of money utilizing my powers in this way.
