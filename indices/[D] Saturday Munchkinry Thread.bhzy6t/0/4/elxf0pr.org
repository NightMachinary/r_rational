The obvious thing is that you get a very strong norm that all first greetings be unique. The easiest is, as per tjhance, insisting on globally unique names, and leading all introductions with them.

This should be doable with first, middle, last, but requires a data base of everyone to arrange meetups, and avoid name space collisions. Since the norms for this will probably long predate states with the bureaucratic power to do this, the full greeting ritual will likely be name, middle-name, kin-name, village or neighbourhood, town or city name, nation then vocation.
