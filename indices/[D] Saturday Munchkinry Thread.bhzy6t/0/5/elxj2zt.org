Every morning people should agree to say an important 6 word phrase localized to districts of ~1000 people - the seventh word would be the name of the district. Some of the words could be maybe an important chemical name, either because investigating the chemical would yield scientific breakthroughs or just as a method of encoding information in long words. Dividing the world into a 100 million districts with unique names shouldn't be too difficult.

World leaders and scientists could confer to figure out the best possible method to express the most important information from the previous day and split that message up over the districts so that information could be transmitted back in time to greatly accelerate humanities progress. You also would know the approximate location of where you would meet your sig other because you would share the district name and there would only be about 1000 people to search through to find the one that shared your tattoo.

Edit: Honestly, it might be too easy to find your significant other if we used this method, giving us a shorter view into the future. People who held back from going to their 'district' to find their future love would be valuable towards seeing further into the future. Maybe the district name shouldn't be used at all but I was trying to work within the boundaries of trying to accelerate finding your significant other.
