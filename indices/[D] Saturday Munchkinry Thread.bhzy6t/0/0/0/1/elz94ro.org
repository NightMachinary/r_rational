You are basically using an outcome pump tht ensures you met someone to try to get something you want in a nice way , it will end badly.

The more you do risky stuff the more optimization pressure there is to destroy your efforts to avoid meeting your soulmate.

That's if you get to exist, you probably won't, the same way people that are going to kill their grandparents whith a time machine don't get to exist, depending on how things work you might be making yourself less likely by eliminating most posible futures where your crazy risks don't have consecuences.
