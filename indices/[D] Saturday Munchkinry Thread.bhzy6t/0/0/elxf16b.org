Wait, no. Hold on. I question the premise. We have seven words per person of /reliable communication from the future/ and we're using it to try to optimize online dating?

Messages from the future can be used to solve computational problems: see, e.g., [[https://www.scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec19.html]] or [[https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/17]]. Just collect all the tattoos from newborns every year, assign those people messages they have to say upon greeting every single person they meet, and exploit the closed timelike curves that result.
