[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work][Doing God's Work]] has /similar/ themes.

Basically, the Judeochristian God won out against the other cults. Instead of eradicating them, he set them to work in his global corporation, Providence, where most of them are helpdesk staff, fulfilling prayers.

The work follows female Loki, who had most of her powers sealed away, and is plotting to get them back again.

The twist is that Providence is a despotical corporate hellhole, with office politicks, backstabbing, and tyrannical management that doesn't actually care about humanity in the slightest. It's a pretty neat take on corporate culture, as well.
