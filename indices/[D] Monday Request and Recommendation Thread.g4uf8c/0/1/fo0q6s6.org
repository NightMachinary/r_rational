Definitely not rational, but there is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar][The Salvation War series]].

I /really/ can't recommend you actually read it, but the tvtropes page might give you some ideas.

Seriously, this is not actually a recommendation for this fic. It just happens to have some ideas that might be interesting buried in it.
