So I'm playing with the rough draft of a rational take on the Judeo-Christian Heaven / Hell / Earth conflict. Urban Fantasy for the most part, with some of the Cthulhu mythos thrown in to create an external threat to the classical conflict.

Has anyone seen something similar in the Rational Realm? Not necessarily Urban Fantasy or the like, but a rational stab at the Heaven / Hell conflict? I'd like to compare what I've got to others and see if anything pops up that would bug me down the road.
