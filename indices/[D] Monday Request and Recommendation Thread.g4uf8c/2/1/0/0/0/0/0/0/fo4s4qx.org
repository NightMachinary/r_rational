okay cool! I'll do some reading this week and then work out how quickly I read it and then calibrate [[http://www.beeminder.com/mad/reading][www.beeminder.com/mad/reading]] and let you know how long I expect it to take. If you'll read it faster or slower I'll calibrate my beeminder goal accordingly with the note that I am working full time so if you're going to be reading 2 hours a day I'm not going to keep up :)

anyway I think that's way too much detail in planning so i'lll stop this post now.
