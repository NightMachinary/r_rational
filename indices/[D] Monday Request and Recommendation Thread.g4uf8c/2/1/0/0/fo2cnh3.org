I love Luminosity and agree that it's rational but I don't find the romance rational, specifically. The way vampire romance works in the novel is... the vampires see each other and fall immediately and irretrievably in love, and pretty much the same thing happens with wolves. The "hard yards" of romance don't really appear in the novel, and aren't really the focus - the focus is on the power stuff which is cool don't get me wrong. (I am going to re-read it I think. I loved it so).
