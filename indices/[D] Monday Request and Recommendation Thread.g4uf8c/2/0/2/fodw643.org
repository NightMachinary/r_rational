I don't think there's any need to have boring romance dynamics, you just need to have the characters be reasonable in how they approach things. I think of crucial importance would be an attempt to showcase responsible relationships.

Rat fantasy still has magic. If there's no melodrama, it's not a soap, it's just a different story. I'll point out that there are directions you can go in the romance genre beyond soaps: see romcoms, and also genuinely smut.
