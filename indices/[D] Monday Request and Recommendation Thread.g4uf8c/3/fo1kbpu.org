I have a lot of time to listen to audiobooks, and am constantly running out of them.

The good news is that I found one in podcast form. Apparently it started out as a reddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7asz8x/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1/][thread]]? It's called the [[https://www.podcastrepublic.net/podcast/1498806952][Left Right Game]], and despite the stupid title, the story so far isn't bad. It isn't rational, but I wasn't expecting it to be.

They are currently on episode 5, and update religiously once a week. Each chapter is about 30-40 minutes long. (Meanwhile [[https://www.podcastrepublic.net/podcast/1448857756][Pact]] updates sporadically, kind of near once a month-ish).

Really the best part of it is the sound quality. The sounds are realistic and you /will/ occasional turn your head to see if that skidding car sound was real. I think it's even edited for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_audio_effect][3d audio]]. That's to be expected (they are recording these in hopes of selling you high-quality speakers), but if you ignore the ads, it can be pretty good.

Also, as I write this comment, I learn that they have [[https://player.fm/podcasts/QCODE][more]] of these, which I will probably be checking out.

Also also, there's a sub for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/top/][these things]]?

Conclusion, I should write more reddit comments because it forces me to research things.
