Since you mention Dichronauts I'll assume you're already aware of Permutation City.

It may be a slight spoiler to say so, but Trudi Canavan's Age of the Five trilogy does some of this. Peter F Hamilton also plays with adjacent concepts in the Night's Dawn trilogy (zombies in spaaace!...) and in the Void trilogy. Max Harms' Crystal Society trilogy is also adjacent. Oh, and again may be a slight spoiler to say so but check out Nick Harkaway's "Gnomon".

Those are all still grounded in the recognisable, though. For closer blending of the abstract, metaphor and reality you might like to check out Jeff Noon, for instance; I quite enjoy his work but others have described the experience of reading it as comparable to having little grains of salt flicked at your eyeballs, so YMMV I guess.

EDIT: oh, I'll also take a moment to plug Marina and Sergey Dyachenko's [[https://www.toothycat.net/%7Esham/Access_History.html]["Access History"]] again; [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D461PYF][Vita Nostra]] also fits the bill somewhat; the other two books in that series are much closer to what you're after, but haven't been translated yet, sadly.
