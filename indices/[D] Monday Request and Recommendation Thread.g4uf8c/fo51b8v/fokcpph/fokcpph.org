You might be better off looking at published work, since a lot of those will have far more effort put into editing and polish, which a lot of webnovels lack due to their weekly updates. I can give a bunch of recs if you want them.

Other than that, the few webnovels I see that fulfill your requirements are these:

- Zombie Knight Saga: Fulfills all of them. Really satisfying power system to boot. My only gripe is that some characters seem sorta cartoonishly evil/sociopathic, which clashes with the serious nature of the story. But it's easily forgivable with how good everything else is.

- He Who Fights With Monsters, Delve, Ar'Kendrythist. Also fulfills all of them. Of these I like Ar'Kendrithyst the most due to its characters. You'll see the first two recommended a lot in this subreddit. I've also recommended Ar'Kendrithyst [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fw0ar9/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fmm5n0a/][here]].

- Coeur'Al'Aran is a prolific rwby fanfic writer who has really consistent weekly updates. The majority of his work has Jaune as a protagonist, although he's done one or two with other characters as well. Tbh, it reads a bit like shounen manga, although his work in Forged Destiny and Relic of the Future is good. Just take a look at his completed work.
