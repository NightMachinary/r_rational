I've been wanting to get into reading more in general, but I get really turned off by poor or amateur writing. Even if the story's good and has potential, it's really hard for me to turn the critiquing part of my brain off. Does anyone have any suggestions for a rational fiction that is a well written, professional quality story? A few things I'm looking for:

1) Satisfying narrative arc (follows three act structure)

2) Realistic, well written characters

3) Decently paced (don't want to read chapters and chapters of them just talking, unless it's really, really well written)

4) Focus is on story and characters first, rationality/other themes second

5) Completed and/or regularly posted fic

Also, while it's not strictly necessary, I like reading humor fics. Anyways, if anyone has any recs, I'd be happy to take a look. :) I realize some of these points are harder to find in serialized fiction because the medium lends itself to wordiness, but I'd still like to see what's out there. And since I know you guys are going to rec them, I've already read some of Wildbow and Alexander Wales' work. XD
