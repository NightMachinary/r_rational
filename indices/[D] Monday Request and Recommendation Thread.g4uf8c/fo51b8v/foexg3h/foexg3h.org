I'd never recommend Wildbow's stuff to someone looking for books with something approximating a three-act structure. It's a sprawling webserial with arcs that sometimes span multiple books' worth of content.

--------------

Tentatively, I'd recommend the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079][Alexandra Quick]] series. It's Harry Potter fanfic, set in Wizarding America of the 2000s, and follows Alexandra who grew up with muggles being brought into the wizarding world, and discovering there are people who want to kill her because of who her real father was.

It /sounds/ really similar to canon Harry Potter, and the first book sort of is, but after that it takes a /really/ interesting direction and explores not just the many cultures that make up Magical America, but also sides of magic that aren't shown in HP.

It has a large cast of characters from all backgrounds, and it doesn't shy away from some of the more... unfortunate parallels between house elves and slavery, for example.

Alexandra herself can drive a reader to frustration; she's so fucking /bright/ but sometimes makes the most muleheaded mistakes. What's important, the world around her /acknowledges/ this; when she does something bad, it drives people away from her, strains friendships, or gets her punished academically.

Technical writing is better than most fanfics and original webserials, but I'm not the best at judging the quality of writing beyond SPAG and prose. I can say that I was rarely bored or exhausted by its pacing.

There's five books so far, ranging from 160k to 250k words. Each of those books has complete plot and character development arcs, as well as driving forward the overall conflict in the magical world.\\
Quite frankly, if the author hadn't started this as a Harry Potter fanfic, there aren't many alterations he'd have had to make to publish it as an original work.
