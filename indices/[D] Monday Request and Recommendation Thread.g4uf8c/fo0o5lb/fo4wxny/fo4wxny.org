As far as rational-ish stories with somewhat mature romance goes:

Trails in the Sky (video game) is one of the best told games I've had the pleasure of playing. Innocent, athletic/boisterous and social female main, and a pragmatic, kind, and yet sometimes uncomfortably cold male companion. Something of a jRPG blend of fantasy and steampunk-ish. Superb ending (though a cliffhanger) of the first game, haven't played the other two. The tension of the relationship is mainly around said open innocence and hidden coldness.

I'll recommend Looseboy's two great erotic visual novels with the caveats that they could use an editor and you should prepare for the quirks of Japanese ero-games:

The Devil on G-String's third route in particular (Shiratori Mizuha) is good enough that its worth playing the game just for it. Its a combination of intellectual thriller and surprisingly mature romance of two people trying to find a second chance, the romance more so at the very last part of her route, the good end (you have to specifically go there or you'll miss it). The interesting aspects of this romance itself were fairly short, however, though I think its well worth it given the quality of its writing and the fact that it is a satisfying conclusion to the thriller aspect of the route. The game is set between a cat-and-mouse battle of the main heroine and the enigmatic criminal who calls himself the Devil/Maou based on the classical Der Erlk√∂nig, the protagonist being an amoral student with Yakuza ties who becomes a suspect for Maou's identity. (Also Maou is voiced by Lelouch's voice actor.)

Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo (translation: The Wheel Country and the Girl of the Sunflowers?), Looseboy's other minor masterpiece (earlier and probably the better story overall), is much less mature on the romance front (too anime-ish at times), but it does indeed center around the criminal (by dystopian standards) girls and the Special High Class Individual Candidate protagonist in charge of their supervision. Morita Kenichi, the protagonist, is simply cool- friendly, tough, intelligent and with wide experience. The antagonist Houzuki, Kenichi's SHCI mentor, is a pedagogically minded economist/politician who is also a charismatic and violent authoritarian.
