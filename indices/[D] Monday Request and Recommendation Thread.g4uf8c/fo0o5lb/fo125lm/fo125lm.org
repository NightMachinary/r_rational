Well, here's my thought process.

If we assume soap operas are on the irrational end of romantic fiction, then the opposite of that could be considered to be "rational".

Soap Operas have ridiculous love geometries, crazy plots, and over the top melodrama. So the opposite is a slice-of-life between a monogamous couple working through their issues together?
