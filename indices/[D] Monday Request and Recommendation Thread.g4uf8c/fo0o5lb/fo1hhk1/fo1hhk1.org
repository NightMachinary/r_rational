[[http://www.archiveofourown.org/works/14984261/chapters/34726769][*cough cough* It looks like this]]

I think there's maybe three rational romances I've seen posted here. The thing is, to write a romance you can't just make it rational, it also has to invest you emotionally. So it has to be a good work of fiction first, but the characters are also smart and just happen to love each other. (Also the story is probably really witty and has things to say about society, but it's not a requirement.)

Anyways, here's one that I think might be worth a shot: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18738010/chapters/44446768][Marriage and Monsters: An Eschatological Romance]]. I haven't read it though so can't rec it based on how good it is, but it seems to check the boxes.

Also, like, anything by Jane Austen. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice][Pride and Prejudice]] comes to mind. She also wrote an entire book that was a parody of gothic romance called [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey][Northanger Abbey]]. It's basically like Luminosity but written two centuries ago.
