Rational respondses to romantic interpersonal conflicts are communication, introspection, working on identifying needs, wants and boundaries, and on recognizing that love doesn't conquer all incompatibilities.

Rational romance could include:

- Negotiating different wants/needs/lifestyles
- Overcoming personal insecurities/insecurities/trauma and growing with someone else.
- Facing societal challenges with the specific kind of romance involved, including facing job loss or family pressure.
