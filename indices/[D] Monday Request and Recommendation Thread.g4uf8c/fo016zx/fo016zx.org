So I've been reading a number of Royal Road fictions from the best rated / trending list. When I tried this out a year or two ago Everyone Likes Big Chests was the highest rated work, which really made me doubt the quality of their rating system. Fortunately things have improved. Here's a very basic rating / random comments.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30131/seaborn][Seaborn]] Good stuff. Initially the litrpg aspect seemed too heavy handed, but gets a lot better. Nice theme / niche. Quite well written. Short. Definitely read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30737/the-humble-life-of-a-skill-trainer][Humble Life of a Skill Trainer]] Good start. Interesting premise, and good execution. Short. Read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26317/queen-in-the-mud][Queen in the Mud]] Surprisingly good. Short. MC is lucky in everything, but its not grating. Read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30029/summoners-journey][Summoners Journey]] Decent. Readable, and okay execution. Short, kinda cliche. Read it if it sounds interesting to you.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30623/cant-cure-deceit][Can't Cure Deceit]] Premise is a bit red flag, but pretty good page turner so far. Worth reading it if it sounds interesting to you.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager][Wake of the Ravager]] Not exactly rational, but has some munchkinry (only from the main character). Popcorn fic. Read it if it doesn't annoy you.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl][Dungeon Crawler Carl]] Decent writing. Funny. Cliche premise with enough new to make it refreshing. Read it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters][He Who Fights with Monsters]] Enjoyable. Long. Cliche premise, but decently thought through. Pretty good use of abilities. Worth reading if it catches your attention.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26581/rebirth-in-a-magical-world][Rebirth in a Magical World]] Harry potter fanfic, but does a good job of keeping canon stuff present but to the side. Has its own existence and characters. Worth reading.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red][A Journey of Black and Red]] Surprisingly good. Long. Worth reading.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30400/unto-the-breach][Unto the Breach]] Kinda cringy. Seems better than the description would indicate. Short. Hard to tell if this is worth reading yet.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29729/jumpspark][Jumpspark]] Decent original planes-walker imitation. Lucky / super high potential MC, but seems pretty grounded in having real threats, and reasonably growth rate. Gets Gengis Khan as a mentor, and he's pretty chill.
