Serial Transmigrator isn't just genre-savvy, he's straight up a chunni edgelord loser referring to regular everyday things by made up xianxiaesque technique names, in an IRL setting. I'm not sure I want to continue if this is the way he thinks and navigates through life, even if it does give him some advantage in an actual xianxia setting. Does this improve?

EDIT: A verbatim line from chapter 3: Oh, poor misguided Kaner. What he didn't know, that I'm taking the liberty to tell you, /Minor spoiler alert/ is that his healing ability and understanding of languages would both cause him immense pain... Sucks to be him am I right?

The author breaking the fourth wall in the middle of the chapter? Nope, dropped.
