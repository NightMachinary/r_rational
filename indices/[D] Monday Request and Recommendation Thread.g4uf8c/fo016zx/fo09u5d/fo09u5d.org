I have done similar, getting through a good chunk of the top 25. ELLC is still one of the best though, unless you really dislike the sexual stuff I'm not sure why that would put you off. Since you and lo4952 have already reviewed a bunch, I'll just review what isn't on either list or already well discussed here.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon][Vainqueur the Dragon]] A comedy lit-rpg in which a dragon learns of levels and becomes an adventurer. Comedy is pretty broad, hit and miss but not too bad, a light and entertaining read in general.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re:Trailer Trash]] An unhappy middle aged woman in 2045 is sent back to when she was 13 in 1998, and so tries to turn around her life. From there it's just a generic high school drama. Tbh I have no idea why this is so highly rated, it's fine but that's it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15935/there-is-no-epic-loot-here-only-puns][There is no epic loot here, only puns]] An isekai in which a girl becomes a dungeon core. Since she dislikes violence, she instead tries to create a happy tourism dungeon. A silly, comedy story, very 'wholesome' in the sickly sweet wholesomemes style, the only interesting aspect is the world building outside of the dungeon.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21374/epilogue][Epilogue]] A short story about a group of teens who are sent back to earth many years after being isekai'd. Pretty solid and won't take too long.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/4293/the-iron-teeth-a-goblins-tale][The iron's teeth a goblins tale]] A monster POV story in which a goblin is rescued by a bandit ranger and taught his ways. Excruciatingly slow at first, but it starts to pay off around 50% of the way in. Unfortunately, the author has stopped the story, though the stopping point is fairly natural.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4][Arrogant Young Master Template]] A xianxia parody, guys gets isekai'd but realises he's not a main character, but the titular master destined to be swept aside. He thus begins desperate attempts to avert his fate and stay alive. By far the best comedy on RR, even if you're unfamiliar with xianxia, though the author has disappeared recently. Be aware also that the grammar is quite poor and it can be confusing to read.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny][Forge of Destiny]] A regular xianxia, which I understand is a rewrite of a completed quest. It's decent enough.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare][Threadbare]] Litrpg in which a teddy bear gains the golem class and fights to defend his owner. Mercifully short, neat world and generally well done.
