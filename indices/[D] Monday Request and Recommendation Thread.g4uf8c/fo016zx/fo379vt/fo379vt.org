One RR fic that doesn't get posted here enough IMO is [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24396/digital-marine][Digital Marine]]

The setting is pretty great from a rational deconstruction standpoint. If we had a perfectly physically accurate MMO with time compression, nobody would waste it on consumers playing around with swords; it'd get immediately turned in to the world's greatest military boot camp. There's also no magical skill injections here - if you buy Advanced Hacking, you go through the coursework for a Master's in Computer Science in time compression.

The main character is relatively rational too - she makes informed decisions about her "build", and is exceptional but not too overpowered. The things she comes up with or invents as part of her career are all fairly reasonable in the scheme of things; there's no "oh you're somehow the first person to treat NPCs like people!" nonsense here.
