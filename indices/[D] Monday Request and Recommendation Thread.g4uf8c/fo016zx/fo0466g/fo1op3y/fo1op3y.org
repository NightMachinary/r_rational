I'm surprised no one mentions that *Blue Core* is seriously pornographic, and that the sex stuff is absolutely central to its theme, in that it's pretty clear that the plot is tangential to the lovingly described hardcore sex stuff, rather than the other way around.

The entire setting is actually built around it being desirable to get fucked by the protagonist, to the point where he heals their actual soul with his black jizz (I wish I was kidding). In typical fashion, all the interesting and explored POV characters are females, and you guessed it: either have been fucked, will be fucked, or want desperately to be fucked by the dungeon core. Which will then be described in lurid detail, let me tell you.

It's not even that weird as webnovels go, but I do find it strange that everyone recommending it neglect to mention its... raison d'etre, if you will.
