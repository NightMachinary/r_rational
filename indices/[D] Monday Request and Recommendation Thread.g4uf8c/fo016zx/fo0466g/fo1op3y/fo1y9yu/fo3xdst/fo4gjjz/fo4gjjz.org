I believe it's a matter of detail and how in depth stories go into those parts and if you should expect that going into it. You don't need sex or violence warnings for "They kissed then headed back to the bed room" or "He held a hand over a red stain on his shirt" since these aren't unusually detailed compared to the majority of media. Violence can even get up to people dying, but with a lack of focus or detail it's not particularly disturbing. The same goes for sex scenes and romance, the level of detail and focus determines if the story warrants warning.

You can make a cultural argument about where we should draw these lines but that's very messy. Most people can agree when stories should have warnings, be it in depth descriptions of orgasms or realistic depictions of violence.

I don't have a issue with sex scenes in general, just some of Blue Core's and I think that's important information to add to a recommendation of it. Not mentioning it at all is a absolute negative in my opinion, it's a notably different part of the story compared to other dungeon core stories unless I'm mistaken. (I'm not hugely familiar with the genre outside of DKA and Bunkercore)
