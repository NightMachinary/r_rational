  Then wouldn't that explain your concerns? That a community focused on rationality wouldn't adhere or let itself be influenced by cultural standards they don't necessarily agree with?

Language is about communicating clearly. If someone says "SFW", it will likely be understood to mean something like "might have violence, probably not super detailed, doesn't have explicit sex".

It's certainly reasonable to debate which topics are worth warning about and whether our current expectations are reasonable in that way, but just using a word the way you think it should be used rather than the way everyone uses it isn't going to convince anyone of anything, it's just going to cause your attempted communication to fail.
