The author can't seem to write anything involving risk or tension. The war is a curbstomp in humanity's favor from the beginning. Their enemies use outdated information, are extremely slow to adapt when they adapt at all, and have glaring weaknesses that seem to exist only to make the foes even less of a threat than they otherwise would be.

Their poor decision is usually consistent and well-explained enough not to fall fully under the 'idiot ball' trope, but that doesn't help to add any tension.

On top of that, a lot of it drags on and many people's reactions feel pretty darn unrealistic.
