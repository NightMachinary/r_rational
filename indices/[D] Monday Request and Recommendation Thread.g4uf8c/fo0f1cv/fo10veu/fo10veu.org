/Unsong/ is largely about the Judeo-Christian Heaven / Hell / Earth conflict, in its own meandering way, and includes [[https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/][probably the best answer to theodicy I've ever read]].

The /Dresden Files/ is urban fantasy, a fun read, and has that conflict as a subplot in some books. Not super rational though, and that part of the setting in particular is largely shrouded in mystery (i.e. bullshit).

/Good Omens/ is also urban fantasy and fun. The setting is played as comedy though, and not even munchkined comedy like Discworld.
