Unsong is not a classic take on that conflict, but might give you some ideas if you missed it (afaic it is a common rec here). Not strictly speaking rational, a bit like a crack/ratfic combination. Has a version of the heaven/hell/earth conflict as the background and part of the premise of the story.
