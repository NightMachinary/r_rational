Aye that's what I'm looking for.

I've noticed the lack of it, and I've got a decent enough framework (I think) to allow for rational character progression after the initial buy in.

I'm looking to find holes while also not diverging wildly from common understanding of Heaven / Hell to make them unrecognizable. TVtropes will work!
