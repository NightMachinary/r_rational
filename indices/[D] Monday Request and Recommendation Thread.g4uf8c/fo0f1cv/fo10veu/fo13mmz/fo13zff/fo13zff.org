[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593][Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach]] is the recommended fanfic for people who enjoyed /Good Omens/.

(Technically it's a fanfic of the TV adaptation, but the differences are minor except in that the David Tennant personality really shines through.)
