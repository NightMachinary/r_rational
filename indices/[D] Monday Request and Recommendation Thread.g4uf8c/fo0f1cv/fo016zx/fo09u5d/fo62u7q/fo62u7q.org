Stories that have been shared on [[/r/rational][r/rational]] before, but haven't been listed here by others yet. I'd say that in all these stories, almost all characters (visible or background) are lvl 1 intelligent, so consider that on top of the sparse description I give. Key: [wordcount status]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve][Delve]] Nerdy MC does math on his litrpg stats. Good worldbuilding and characters too, it's implied that there are others that munchkin as well. [400k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29286/the-gilded-hero][The Gilded Hero]] Dark (but not grim) isekai, where MC is a throwaway hero. Don't actually know why this appeals to [[/r/rational][r/rational]], but it's good anyways. [80k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25361/dungeon-engineer][Dungeon Engineer]] Nerdy MC becomes a dungeon core, excellent magicbuilding, heavy exposition. [100k hiatus]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena][The Elemental Arena]] Haven't read this. [150k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war][A Hero's War]] Nerdy isekai MC uplifts society. [550k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced][Displaced]] A multi-POV, 6-fold isekai. Conflict comes from clashing personalities and cultures. [550k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20101/the-law-of-averages][The Law of Averages]] Isekai into parallel world with superpowers. Story of searching for self-fulfillment. Good worldbuilding. [250k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10286/the-good-student][The Good Student]] Pure fantasy with a smart MC. [450k, hiatus]

Stories that may not be on your radar, but have interesting traits that might make them worth your while:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/twilight-kingdom][Twilight Kingdom]] Excellent world and magic system. Set in a fantasy land besieged by, iirc, a post-industrial civilisation. While it doesn't feel like a rationalfic, it isn't irrational either. To me, it's essentially novel quality. [150k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25182/wood-and-iron][Wood and Iron]] Pure fantasy. Dead. Nice magic system. Divination, in particular, stood out to me: it works by querying a sort of collective consciousness of everyone in the area, so it only collects what people already know, and only gives you a decent signal if a lot of people know what you're looking for. [35k dead]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28356/carlfire][carl@fire]] A satire of royal road stories, but a coherent world nonetheless. It really goes the full mile with some of the themes, so there's a lot of disturbing content as well. [250k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27875/lament-of-the-determined][Lament of the Determined]] A crackfic, also a satire of stories on royal road, but no attempt at coherence was made. Much shorter and crunchier. Very crude humor. [10k ongoing]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report][The Snake Report]] Comedic isekai as a snake. Same author as The Gilded Hero, but not as rationally themed. [300k complete]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11930/the-worldforge-warlock-rising][The Worldforge: Warlock Rising]] Pure fantasy. Dead. though the first book can be thought of as a (dissatisfying, yet) complete story. The main character is a likable type for this subreddit. It's very good at a number of things, worth reading despite the truncation. [100k dead]

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/6356/rewrite][RE:WRITE]] Game creator isekais into his game. An interesting piece with philosophical quandaries and notable worldbuilding, despite the basis of hero vs demon lord. It is a little confusing at times, which detracts from its enjoyability as a story. [250k complete]
