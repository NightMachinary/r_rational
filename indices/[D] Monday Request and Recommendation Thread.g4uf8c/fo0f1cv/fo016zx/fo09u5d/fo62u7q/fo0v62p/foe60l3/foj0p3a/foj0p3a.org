It /does/ get better - I agree that the edgy delusions were a bit weird, but it doesn't really carry over into the rest of the story, nor does the fourth-wall stuff. Considering that this is the author's first work of fiction - and considering that they didn't even /read fiction/ until relatively recently before writing it - the relative quality is really quite high.
