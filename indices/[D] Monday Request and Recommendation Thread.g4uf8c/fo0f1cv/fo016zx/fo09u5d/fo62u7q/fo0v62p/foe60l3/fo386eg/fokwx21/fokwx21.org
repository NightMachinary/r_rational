My thoughts: Serial Transmigrator - Some good ideas and a couple of good chapters, but also lots of bad ideas, and takes an nosedive around the 60s with all the Zhu stuff.

Isekai Speedrun - Starts really good, novel concept, worldbuilding is fantastic with a unique perspective. Though gets less interesting as it goes on, and MC becomes gradually more annoying.
