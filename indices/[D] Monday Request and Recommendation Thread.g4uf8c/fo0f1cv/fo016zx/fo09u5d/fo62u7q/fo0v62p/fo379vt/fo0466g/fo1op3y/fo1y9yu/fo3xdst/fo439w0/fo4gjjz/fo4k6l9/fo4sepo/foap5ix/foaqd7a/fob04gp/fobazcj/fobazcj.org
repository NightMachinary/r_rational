Yeah, but it's a bit hard to argue about what does and what doesn't belong in a story, after all how skillful a writer is at handling certain controversial topics can make all of the difference. Then there's the fact that for some people that kind of thing is nsfw and worth mentioning, while for others not so much.

I'm not from the US, so I tend to notice these kind of things. My country tends to look down upon violence because of the amount of insecurity out in the streets, [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPN9DPryZZU][meanwhile some would consider our TV shows to be pretty much softcore porn]] and our magazines and newspapers aren't much better in that regard. But we're also a 'modern western society influenced by conservative christian themes' I mean, the actual pope is from our country, and yet we're not as prudish as the US seems to be.

Rape, murder, gore, body horror, that kind of stuff stands out to us, but no one bats an eye to consensual fucking and other displays of affection. So (like that other redditor said) what is and isn't worth warning doesn't always match with what is written.

Sorry for the rant, this cultural stuff is kinda hard to wrap my head around. Probably doesn't help that I'm not the biggest fan of trigger warnings. Bottom text.
