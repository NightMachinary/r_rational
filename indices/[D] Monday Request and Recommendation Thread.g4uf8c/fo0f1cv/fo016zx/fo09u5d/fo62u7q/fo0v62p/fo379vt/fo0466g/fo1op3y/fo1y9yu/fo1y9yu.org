Agreed, the amount of recommendations for Blue Core not mentioning the NSFW parts are a bit concerning. I actually think it's a pretty decent dungeon core story but I think you have to like or at least be able to ignore the NSFW parts. There's some weird coercive themes and nightmarish world mechanics that I found off putting.
