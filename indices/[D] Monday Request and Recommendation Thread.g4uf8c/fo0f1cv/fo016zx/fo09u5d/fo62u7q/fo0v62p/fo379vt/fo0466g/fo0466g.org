Thanks for the recommendations, always interested in picking up good RR series. I've got a few as well that Ive found interwsting enough to keep reading, in no particular order:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core][Blue Core]] A multi-pov dungeon core story, focusing on a sentient, relatively peaceful dungeon core named Blue. The story focuses much less on hard power, with Blue having near omniscience and omnipotence within his domain. Instead the story has a nice look at what kinds of indirect threats could be posed, usually through interactions with well-developed supporting characters and Blue. If you're looking for an xp-grinding litRPG this might not be for you, but otherwise I'd highly recommend it.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer][Azarinth Healer]] This one pops up a lot, so I won't say too much about it. The writing in the first handful of chapters put me off for a few months till I gave it another shot, and since then I've enjoyed it a lot. The story tries to avoid politics and big save-the-world plots (sometimes more successfully than others) and focuses on a girl and her simple goal of trying to punch everything to death.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall][Defiance of the Fall]] Another relatively popular one, an interesting blend of western and eastern setting. The premise is roughly the modern world getting shoved into a Wuxia cultivation multiverse, and the changes that accompany it. Another solid read, would recommend checkin it out.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion][Super Minion]] Sadly not updated nearly enough, this one is a great story about a "The Thing"-esque lab experiment escaping into the public. The setting reminds me of a more upbeat "Worm" universe, with public heroes and villains, unspoken cooperarion, and fun superpowers. Highly recommend, just be prepared to reach the end and despair at the upload schedule.
