That's a whole other discussion that's been debated a lot. The fact of the matter is that modern Western society is significantly influenced by conservative Christian themes and as such, our society is more comfortable with violence than sex. Not much more than that.

Feel free to google around if you want more thoughts regarding this topic. I think there was a significant revival of the debate when Game of Thrones started airing and a bunch of "thinkers", philosophers, historians and sociologists weighed in so it would be a good place to start.
