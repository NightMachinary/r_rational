  Not mentioning it at all is a absolute negative in my opinion

Why do you think people don't mention it? I really want to understand this because as I said in the other comment it also happens with Time Braid and to a lesser extent with WtC (among other fics, probably), but it's not like this sub has some sort of bias or prejudice against nsfw fics (e.g. Erogamer gets recommended all of the time)

Again, sorry if this should be obvious, I'm not from the US so these kind of cultural differences tend to fly over my head a bit. I'm not even sure if this is an issue that is at a society level or some quirk specific of this sub.
