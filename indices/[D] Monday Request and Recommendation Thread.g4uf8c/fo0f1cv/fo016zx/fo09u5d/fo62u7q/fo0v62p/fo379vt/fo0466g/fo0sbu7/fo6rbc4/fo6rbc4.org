When does Rebirth in a Magical World pick up pace? I've read 18 or so chapters and the MC doesn't really do anything of impact. While future impactful storylines might have been set up I don't trust RR authors enough to just assume that they'll deliver.

Case of point: Chapter 17 was entirely spend on learning about the animaugs transformation just to conclude that it wasn't going to happen which felt really anticlimactic.
