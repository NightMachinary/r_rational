I think in general it's a selection bias: the people that recommend those stories tend to overlook those parts of it as opposed to people who don't like the stories in part because of those parts seeing more of the themes that lead into them. I don't think anyone is being deceptive on purpose, they just don't realize how important those parts might be to others.

Blue Core fans might see it as just 1/15ish of the story limited to certain chapters while people who don't like that focus more on the theme of it throughout the story and those parts in particular.

Time Braid is more of a reframing issue I think. You can totally read it and think "yeah there's some sex in it but there's a lot more torture, and that's just part of it" until someone reminds you how young the characters are and other issues. Also a lot of people read it when they are younger, it was their first time loop etc.

WtC selection bias probably, I haven't paid too much attention to recs of it since I kind of assume everyone here is reading it. I'm probably a bit blind to it because I think it's so great, and the writing is top quality.

Erogamer is what it says it is and gets NSFW mentioned when I see it?
