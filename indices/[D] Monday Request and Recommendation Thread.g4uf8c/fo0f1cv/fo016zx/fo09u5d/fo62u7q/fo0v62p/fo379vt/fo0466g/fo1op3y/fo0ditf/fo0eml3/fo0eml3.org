Yeah I don't blame you for dropping Azarinth Healer if you don't like the grinding, cause thats basically the story. I intentionally picked it up again specifically to get away from the end-of-the-world stakes a lot of other novels have, so it doesn't bother me as much. However there have been some solid arcs recently, so you might enjoy them.
