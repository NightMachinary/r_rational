I've read that one (it's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499401/chapters/35981172][also on Ao3]]). Thus far it's my favorite Death Note fanfic; I love the author's deconstruction of the SI genre.

I suppose it's... sort of rational adjacent(?) in a 'crack scenario treated seriously' way. Like many of the author's fics, the story's strength lies in its portrayal of the inner lives of characters experiencing existential horror. It touches on some of the same philosophical topics as "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", because those are themes that the author likes to explore in most of her stories.

The fic is unfinished and the current chapter ends on a rather awkward note, but I enjoyed it enough that I'd still recommend giving it a try. But then, I'm a huge fan of the author's works and would recommend reading almost all of them regardless of completion status.
