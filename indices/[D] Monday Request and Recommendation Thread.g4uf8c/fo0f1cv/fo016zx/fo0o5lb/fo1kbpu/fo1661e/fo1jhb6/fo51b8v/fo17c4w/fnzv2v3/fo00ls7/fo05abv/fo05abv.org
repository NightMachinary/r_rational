[[https://katalepsis.net/][Katalepsis]] has some of that, but only short segments. Most of it takes place in contemporary England.

This segment from one of the latest chapters (minimal spoilers, only setting stuff) is pretty much the best fit for what I think you're looking for:

  /The abyss between the spheres of reality is endless and dark, a place of horrible hungry things that hunt forever in pitch blackness, of predator and prey hiding and slinking, of silent filter-feeding giants and the echoes of alien thought carried on the currents. Small darting mouths of bottomless starvation, formless crab-hounds that seep through the angles of time, hunters of morsels of stray unwise thought and sensation across the gaps in creation, all of them catching my scent in the water and turning to stalk. Fleeing wisps, lost on the tides, desperate for the warmth and sanctuary of physical form, clutching at my ankles and moaning for help. Things vast and slow, thinking vast slow thoughts in trailing tendrils to entrap the unwary, eating, eating, always eating, growing bigger and thinking harder and trying to make themselves real./

The prose is not normally this... abstract and flowery, but usually really good compared to most of the stuff that usually gets recommended around here.

Elevator pitch: Girl who always believed the monsters she sees because of her psychosis finds out they're actually real - for a certain value of "real" - and is drawn into a parallel world of cults and magic and zombies.
