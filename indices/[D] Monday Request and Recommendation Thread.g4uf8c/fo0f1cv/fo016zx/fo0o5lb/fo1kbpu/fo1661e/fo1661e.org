I'm looking for some return to/reborn in the past fiction, in the vein of Stephen King's [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10644930-11-22-63?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=SMvQ04mwOC&rank=1][11/22/63]] or more recently, FortySixtyFour's [[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21322/re-trailer-trash][Re: Trailer Trash]]. I understand that that these stories may not be strictly rational but given the shared taste in stories on this sub, I hope that someone here may be able to recommend something similar.
