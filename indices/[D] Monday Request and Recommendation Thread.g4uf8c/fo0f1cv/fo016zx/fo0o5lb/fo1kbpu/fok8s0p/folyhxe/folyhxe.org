Nice list.

I'd highly recommend also [[https://thewhitevault.com/][The White Vault]] if you liked those. It's a found audio/document/video horror podcast reconstructing the events which befell a repair team at an arctic outpost on Svalbard. Production quality is high (though not as audioally pleasing as Black Tapes) and it captures the arctic horror ambience perfectly.
