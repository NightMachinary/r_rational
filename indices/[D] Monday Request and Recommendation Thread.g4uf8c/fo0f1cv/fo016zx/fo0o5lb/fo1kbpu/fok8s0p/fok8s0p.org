Hey, I had a phase where I listened to a bunch of audio dramas. It's an interesting way to consume media no doubt. Here's a few I remember being good.

- [[https://www.wolf359.fm/][Wolf 359]] does a good job of starting as a comedy and slowly turning serious. The main character has a wonderful voice and is fun to listen to.

- [[https://www.wolf359.fm/][We're Alive]] is a completed zombie apocalypse drama. I never got too far into it but it has good production value and starts off in a somewhat cliche but still enjoyable way.

- [[https://theblacktapespodcast.com/][The Black Tapes]] is a horror drama with a somewhat cliche plot, but the production value is high and execution is good.

Other than that I also listened to Edict Zero FIS (which is a scifi crime drama), Welcome to the Night Vale, and Tanis, which are all good but weren't things that hooked me straight from the get go. I'm sure there are many more dramas now, maybe I should get back into it.
