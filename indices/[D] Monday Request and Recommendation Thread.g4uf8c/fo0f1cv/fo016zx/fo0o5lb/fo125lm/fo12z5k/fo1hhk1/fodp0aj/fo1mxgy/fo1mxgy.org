I'm not 100% sure these qualify as rational and/or romance, but here you go:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Man_(film)][/Bicentennial Man/]] [[#s][spoiler \ disclaimer:]] though the pro-natalist and pro-immortality members would probably disagree with the ending

- [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/DocFuture][/Doc Future:/]] the story itself doesn't feature romance as its main genre, but Flicker's romantic life seemed rather rationally organised to me.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7423061/1/Let-Me-In-2][/Let Me In 2/]]

- that one short story about every person having their pre-determined other half somewhere out there, and if they were to ever see that other person, their personality would instantly change.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)][/Groundhog Day/]]

  - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY][One-Minute Time Machine]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_(film)][Paycheck]] (maybe)

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_Color][Upstream Color]] (maybe)

- something from GRR Martin's short stories perhaps? E.g. [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11348958-a-song-for-lya][/A Song for Lya/]]
