Ugh I feel almost dirty agreeing with you in that Luminosity is an example of a rational romance. It's about /Twilight/ though! Still we've both obviously read it.

It's not 'rational' unless held up in comparison to the original Twilight though. The Munchkining around the mental abilities of others is well done, but the vampires still ignore technological avenues of attacking one another. Sure, a hundred and twenty years ago Human tech was weak compared to them.

Without even approaching the destructiveness of nukes though, modern weapons can easily destroy 'stone'. Some Anti-tank rifles, a few pounds of plastic explosives, chemical weapons, hell nerve agents might have still been effective.
