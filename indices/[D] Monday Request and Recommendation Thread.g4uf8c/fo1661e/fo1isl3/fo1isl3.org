Don't expect munchkinry, this is more of a lit-fic. It's about a man using his rebirth to try to untangle all the emotional baggage he's been carrying from childhood.

If you happen to speak French, I recommend the official French translation, as it's more professional.

It also has a film adaptation (set in France rather than Japan) that has good reviews, though I can't vouch for it.
