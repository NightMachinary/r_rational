Read 5 chapters of the first one. Sort of enjoying it, but the weakest part is definitely the premise of there being a spell that sends your mind back in time. How does Dumbledore know about it? If it was common knowledge among some secret subset of wizards, why hasn't it been used more often? Why isn't the world ruled by an immortal wizard-king?

You can justify all this, but I almost feel like it would be better to just say 'a miracle did it'. The actual mechanism of time travel isn't central to the story (it's a story based on a the rewind premise, but presumably it will never come up again- there'll be no time war, and the characters aren't ambitious enough to exploit time travel properly) so the same story setup could have been achieved without all the annoyance by just having some random unexplained event/accident do it.\\
It wouldn't be satisfying, but it would be less aggravating. As it is, the characters could and should ascend to godhood with the tools available to them, but they won't because that's not what the story's about. Poor writing, most of all because it's so easily fixable. Just have the time travel be a magic space bats event outside of character control.
