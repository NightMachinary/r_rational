Anyone have any stories (or stories containing significant scenes) that take place in abstract space, rather than the usual physical universe?

I'm only mildly interested in universes with wonky geometry (e.g. [[https://www.gregegan.net/DICHRONAUTS/DICHRONAUTS.html][Dichronauts]], flatland). I want stuff more like [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926][Onward To Providence]]'s souls/spirits/resonance/infosphere, or WtC's P-space (though WtC doesn't currently have any scenes set in P-space). Where metaphor /is/ reality, or where any sort of "life" is totally information-based.
