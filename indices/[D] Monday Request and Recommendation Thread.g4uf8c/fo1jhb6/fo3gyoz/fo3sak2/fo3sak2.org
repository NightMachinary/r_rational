Ha ha, no RWBY is not rational fic, and I think the first few seasons were enjoyable just because they were fun. Interesting characters, cool fight scenes, intriguing mythos, etc. Around season 4-5 it stopped being fun and started being really annoying (at least for me) because of the glaringly obvious plot holes you could drive a truck through. But Season 7 turned out to be surprisingly good, and it's one of those things that makes me really happy to see. It's a cool, fun show that somehow also pulled off being really smart. :)
