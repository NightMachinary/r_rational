Huh, I've been with RWBY since the beginning, and I'm part of the community over on [[/r/RWBY]]

For anyone getting into it, the Rule of Cool and not Rationality is the primary rule of the universe. Looking back on it though, I would have to agree with the sentiment, but more along the lines of the show becoming more Rational. It starts off very much not.

I wouldn't give it the Rational label quite yet, it's getting there but only for low stakes scenarios. 'Hero' characters for the most part are still operating on Saturday Morning Cartoon morals, with most villains suffering Disney deaths if at all.

Considering the mythos setup and the cliff hanger / last episode of the latest season though I suppose it is becoming more rational.
