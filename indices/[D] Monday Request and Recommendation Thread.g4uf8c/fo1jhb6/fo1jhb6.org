I just finished [[https://roosterteeth.com/series/rwby][RWBY]] season 7, and I really, really liked it. The entire plotline this season was about political intrigue, and how different people respond to a difficult situation. It was funny, intelligent, and packed with a ton of great character moments. Also like...logical plot points that influence how the characters act and are internally consistent. :D I'm fangirling so hard.

I'm not gonna lie, RWBY has irritated me in the past with some of their irrational plot points and characters doing dumb crap for no reason. But if you dropped RWBY because of it, this might be the season to pick it back up. I don't know if they added a writer or what, but they definitely took it up a notch. I actually had to stop and rewind a few times because the characters were analyzing so fast I missed something, and I NEVER have to do that with this show, so...

10/10 highly recommend
