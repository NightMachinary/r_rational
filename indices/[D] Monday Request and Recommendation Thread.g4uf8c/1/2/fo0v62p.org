I'll add some as well:

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21844/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension][I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)]] A group of people is transported to a litrpg world with different fundamental physics and is forced to complete various challenges. Worldbuilding is interesting, plot is okay.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21803/serial-transmigrator][Serial Transmigrator]] Isekai into a xianxia world. The MC is very genre-savvy and exploits genre conventions. Recommended for those tired of regular idiot xianxia protagonists.

[[https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun][Isekai Speedrun]] A speedrunner of a game is isekai'd into said game. Protagonist is quite realistic and plans and strategises heavily. World is post-apocalyptic and has quite interesting elements and lore. Complete.
