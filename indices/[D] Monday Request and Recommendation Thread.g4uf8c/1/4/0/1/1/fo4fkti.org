  it's doing the other characters a disservice to say they only exist to bang the dungeon

I read about half what's there right now, so 150k words. If my memory serves, there's only 1 or 2 brief male POVs besides Blue, which are snippets purely for exposition. The only females that have non-snippet POVs are: the queen(has been), the fox girl(has been), the lesbian couple(will be, i'm sure), and the dragon lady(desperately wants to be).

It's good writing to only expand on characters that will come to feature in the plot([[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail][conservation of detail tvtropes]]), so no complaints there. What's not good writing--IMHO, obviously-- is when all the well characterized females in a story are attractive and willing to join the protagonist's harem.

And to be clear, I would object to this even if there was no graphic carrot top sex prominently featuring black jizz.
