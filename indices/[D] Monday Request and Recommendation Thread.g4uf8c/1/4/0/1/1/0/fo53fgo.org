I don't know if you've read this far, but the author does actually resolve the relationship between the lesbian couple and Blue in a purely non-sexual manner, having the character not wanting to compromise herself to get rid of the depletion. It doesn't invalidate your point about all the other characters that do lay with the dungeon, but it is a change of pace.
