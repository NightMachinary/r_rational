You're absolutely right in that there is a decent sexual theme to the series, with both the more carnal red dungeons and Blue's contrasting softer(?) NSFW scenes. However I think it's doing the other characters a disservice to say they only exist to bang the dungeon, considering that they are all well developed characters in their own right. Plus the NSFW scenes are like, 4 chapters total. While its certainly an aspect of their characters, it's not like the characters that bang the dungeon exist solely to bang the dungeon.
