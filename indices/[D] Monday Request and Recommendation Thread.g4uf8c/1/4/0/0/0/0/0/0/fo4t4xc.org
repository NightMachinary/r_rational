NSFW literally means "Not Safe For Work". As such, it's entirely based on how society will perceive your reading of it, and whether it would be considered acceptable to be looking at at work.

Regardless of your personal views, you are far more likely to get into trouble at work and jeopardise your social standing by looking at pornographic material in a public setting or at work than you are to be reading about violence.
