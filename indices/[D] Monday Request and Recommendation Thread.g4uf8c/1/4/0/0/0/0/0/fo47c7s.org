  The fact of the matter is that modern Western society is significantly influenced by conservative Christian themes and as such, society is more comfortable with violence than sex.

Then wouldn't that explain your concerns? That a community focused on rationality wouldn't adhere or let itself be influenced by cultural standards they don't necessarily agree with?

I've noticed the same thing happening with Time Braid, which is a much older rational-adjacent naturo fanfic that also features sex, yet most recommendations don't mention the sex in it either. Worth the Candle is popular too and yet no one mentions the rape.

I don't think this is the kind of community that purposely leaves those kind of things out because of shame, political bias, or any kind of malice.

Maybe letting NSFW be dictated by lines on the sand isn't rational, and thus not followed. Or perhaps the demographic that frequents this sub happens to be one that is not bothered by sexual elements in fiction. Maybe the rational/rationalist component is recommendation enough and so other elements (like sex, drug use or violence) aren't worth nothing.

Sorry if this is uncomfortable to discuss, I too am curious about what is happening and want to actually understand without jumping to conclusions.
