I actually had read several of these before, but its been a while. Thanks!

Blue Core - pretty good.

Azarinth Healer -- dropped after figuring she was never going to stop just grinding in the wilderness. It didn't really seem to have a point beyond big numbers go up. Maybe I should revisit, since its progressed a lot after this.

Defiance - haven't read this one. I'll try it out, thanks!

Super Minion - don't recall. Think I gave up on this one till it advanced more.
