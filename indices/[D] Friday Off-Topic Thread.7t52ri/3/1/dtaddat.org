With some tweaking this probably could be turned it into a [[/r/makeyourchoice/]] post.

Functional immortality would be useless in case of nuclear war, a gamma ray burst, artificial nano- \ bioviruses, etc.

The Forking \ Merging wouldn't be very effective in the setting of our universe because all your copies would still continue to age; and there's just not enough resources an individual can acquire on Earth to make the total sum (and quality) of lifespan generated through this skill be comparable to what both the functional immortality and arbitrary time loops can provide.

  should you die suddenly, you'll auto-loop back far enough that you have time to decide on a longer loop.

This seems to indicate that the third option is not a single-use skill, but, rather, an activator for controlled [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]] events. So the time-looping choice seems to be vastly superiour compared to the other two --- to the extent of being capable of eventually simulating what both of them were offering out of the box.

You could live your first life just to gain as much knowledge about the future as possible, then after the first reset quickly acquire wealth and start unlocking the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree][Tech Tree,]] one reset at a time. After that you could just brute-force your way to the Endings you prefer.
