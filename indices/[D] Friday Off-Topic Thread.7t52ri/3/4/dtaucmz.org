Yeah arbitrary time loop beats the other two by a massive margin, especially since it auto-activates on death. The only reason you wouldn't pick arbitrary time loop is if there is only one timeline: in which case every time you loop back in time, you kill everyone in the universe and replace them with their younger selves.
