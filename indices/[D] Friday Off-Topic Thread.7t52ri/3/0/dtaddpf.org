Arbitrary Time Loops seems like a tool specifically helpful for maximizing my own life's happiness in a very limited way, BUT indispensable for tackling an incredibly difficult goal in a timeframe that my life is critically positioned to tackle. Like if I'm among the oldest generation to exist before a nuclear war wipes everyone out, my "second chance" would be spent almost entirely on building myself anew to tackle that threat directly rather than just thinking it's outside my control, and future loops would be spent trying different strategies for that.

Functional immortality, on the other hand, seems generally superior for myself and the world if multiple tries at the same cataclysm isn't required. I may screw up and makes mistakes that have permanent costs, but ideally I would be able to help a lot more people on a longer timeline, and while I can't maximize my own happiness within my own generically natural lifespan, I get to have a whole lot more of a lifespan to enjoy.

Fork + Merge seems less attractive than both. Not particularly worried about value drift or anything, it just feels like a less optimal version of both alternatives, outside of some edge cases, like me needing to coordinate specifically with other people who have to be me as well to solve some major problem. Obviously I'd still take it if offered without the others as alternatives.
