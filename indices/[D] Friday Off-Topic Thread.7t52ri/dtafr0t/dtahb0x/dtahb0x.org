I wasn't bothered by it at all, but at the time I did not believe in rape culture. Now I do and as much as I know EY is not a proponent of rape culture, reading it still takes me out of the story even if I don't think the story works without it.

I love the message it has behind it, but the way it's delivered is problematic when sexual harassment and abuse is so common and a male author considers it an acceptable subject for social satire, and it's not even it the main subject.
