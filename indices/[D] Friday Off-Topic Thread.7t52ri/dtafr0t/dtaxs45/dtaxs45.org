It never bothered me at the time, and I think in a perfect world it wouldn't bother anyone. I think that it had to be something we would viscerally disagree with. The point was that future generations allowed something we consider abhorrent, which doesn't work unless the thing in question actually is considered abhorrent. It basically has to be a crime, and while I suppose he could've gone with, say, theft, I think making it sexual neatly parallels the legalization of things like gay marriage, and the rise of modern sexual norms.
