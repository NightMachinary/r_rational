It bothered me, but I never felt that EY was advocating rape. It just seemed like it was /meant to be/ weird, rather than viscerally unpleasant, like a weirdtopia rather than a dystopia. I found it to be a viscerally unpleasant dystopia, which would be fine, but is not (from how the story frames it) what I thought EY was going for.

The problem is that overt acceptance of rape is already a thing that exists in the real world. When you have public figures /in the first world/ saying that a husband can't possibly rape his wife, that's what at least a portion of the readers will immediately think about -- it's what /I/ thought about. It's not weird enough, or at least, it's not /presented as/ weird enough, even if the governing logic behind what we saw was weird enough, because we didn't see enough of the governing logic.

(I might have to come back and refine this later, not sure I'm getting it across right.)
