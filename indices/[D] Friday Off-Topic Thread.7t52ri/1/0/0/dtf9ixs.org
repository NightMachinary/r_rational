So sorry I didn't respond last week; I put it off until I was at a computer and then completely forgot.

  Will it be possible to display art beside each pokemon, at least in the pokedex section?

As in, within the editor? I suppose that's something it will indeed have to support; I had given thought to how that's going to work within the game client, but hadn't considered that of course the (potentially remote) game file editor will need it as well. I'll have to think on the best way to do this, but I'll throw it on the pile.

  It's Magical Dog Fighting, after all, so you can't legitimately confront that fact and retain audience escapism, just like an action film stops being a popcorn escapade and turns into sick horror if you acknowledge the violence for what it is.

Yeah, it's just frustrating to watch a medium refuse to grow as its fan base does. There's no outlet for us and we're trapped in a never-ending appeal to nostalgia, which is I suppose the roundabout reason that I'm in this whole mess to begin with, so I ought to thank them for it.
