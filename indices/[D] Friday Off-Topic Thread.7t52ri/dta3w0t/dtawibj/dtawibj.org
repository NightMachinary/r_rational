Your game is looking fantastic, and my girlfriend and I are both looking forward to seeing more progress.

Will it be possible to display art beside each pokemon, at least in the pokedex section?

  so the whole team apparently has not a single person who actually believes the team's stated purpose. What a farce.

That's very disappointing, but not shocking. If Nintendo made a /serious/ case that Pokemon battling/ownership was wrong, even if that case was intentionally flawed in some ways in order to make the argument easier to defeat, then you run the risk of some people being convinced anyway, or building on that argument to make an improved one for themselves, and suddenly getting uncomfortable with the game.

It's Magical Dog Fighting, after all, so you can't legitimately confront that fact and retain audience escapism, just like an action film stops being a popcorn escapade and turns into sick horror if you acknowledge the violence for what it is.
