Huh, I guess I'm more than a billion seconds old. I'm kind of sad to have missed that milestone. But I do turn 32 on Groundhog's Day!

Arbitrary time loops are somewhat lesser-value for me, because I've got a two-year-old son that I wouldn't want to obliterate by going back in time to before his conception. With no attachments, I think it's the superior choice, but I have lots of attachments. Plus I've written a lot of stuff that I wouldn't want to have to rewrite. It's still probably the best choice, because it's the best option for making lots of money and steering the course of history ... but I also find it kind of boring. Not that you shouldn't go for the high-utility but boring things.

Fork + Merge though? That seems /amazing/. Less utility than arbitrary loops, but I would have /so much time/ to do things, I could make /so much money/, I could gain skills /so fast/, I could write hundreds of novels a years, pick up loads of new skills, space out time with my son a bit more while also not having to worry about losing out on time with him -- it would give me a lot of the things that I want, rather than giving me intermediaries that give me the things that I want. But I probably wouldn't pick it, because it does probably lose out on strict utility (maybe not for me personally, but definitely as far as social good goes).
