On Friday, Feb 2nd, I turn a billion seconds old (~11:28PM).

As this is also groundhog day, got me thinking, and here's a question:

Would you rather have:

- Functional immortality

- Fork + Merge

- Arbitrary Time Loops

All powers are reasonably safe and without curse-side-effects (aka, you won't be an immortal shriveled ancient), but aren't fool-proof / absolute.

Functional Immortality, as far as I've explored it, would work like this: You are lucky and never receive injuries beyond what medical science can repair in a reasonable amount of time; such treatments will always work completely; and you'll stop aging before you would start accumulating age-related ailments. If there's no possibility of survival (say, fly a spaceship into the sun), welp.

Fork + Merge, as far as I've explored it, would work like this: You (and any copies) can duplicate, with little fanfare. I'm undecided as far as what gets duplicated with you; "incidentals" seems reasonable (aka, clothing, ID cards...?), other does not (a laptop) but I don't know how to define that line. You (and any copies) can merge, with the best possible combination of git-style rebase/merge; any issues you have wont be a result of the merge, but of now having been a person who did thing you may find reprehensible. Of course, you can always plan to have the fork write a report and then suicide....

Arbitrary time loop, as far as I've explored it, is that you can send your mind back to yourself at any prior point in your personal history. You can't bring anything else with you, and there's graceful degradation; if you send yourself as an adult to you as a baby, you'll 'grow into' your adult memories/self - you won't be a talking baby. Also, should you die suddenly, you'll auto-loop back far enough that you have time to decide on a longer loop.

Thoughts/answers?
