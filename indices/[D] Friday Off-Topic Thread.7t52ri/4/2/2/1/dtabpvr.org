First, if you're worried about all the suffering going on in the world, I have news for you. It's not going away anytime soon, and there's nothing you can do about it. /However/, you can reduce the suffering of those around you that you personally interact with. I recommend doing this, and it will probably make you feel better.

Second, systemic racism is not a thing. A quick look at a dictionary defines racism as "prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior." On the other hand, I can't even find a definition of "systemic racism." The closest I can find is "anything that accounts for observed disparities between races." Again, I have news for you: as long as people group themselves by race (or any other factor), outcome disparities will exist between the different groups. The ensuing discussion is admittedly long and complex, but the short of it is that there is nothing that can be done about inequality of outcome. As long as policies are focused on giving everyone equal opportunities, we can let the rest work itself out.
