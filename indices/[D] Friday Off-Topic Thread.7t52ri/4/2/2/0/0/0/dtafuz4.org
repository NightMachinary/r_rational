It sounds like you have above average susceptibility to anxiety, which is part of why you are aware of this issue (systemic racism) to the degree that you are. The problem from a moral/practical standpoint is that you get caught up in these kinds of anxiety threads too frequently, it will put you at a selective disadvantage to others whose skulls and skins are thicker. So for example, you might lose a job due to missing work too much, or lose friendships with influential people due to being unable to generate good atmosphere, in arenas where someone with less awareness of these issues (perhaps due to less innate sensitivity or more defensive political positioning, susceptibility to optimistic/self-serving delusions, etc.) is able to take your place. It ends up being the same result (jerks in power) but with bad effects for you personally (you've been sidelined) and the people you are hoping to help (fewer potential allies with power to do much about it).
