I...agree with you, surprisingly. That sounds very similar to what happened when I started having depressive episodes, it felt like my brain was attempting to destroy me and I get through it is by remembering that the voice of despair isn't really me.

I've known I have depression and anxiety for a while now and have developed strategies to deal with them, but this doesn't feel like the existential dread or panic attacks I'm used to. It's more like a constant sense of tension.

My depressive episodes are usually about feeling like I've failed, while this is more “success is impossible”. The former was caused by my own insecurities, but this is something I rationalize with all the ways I've been proven wrong about social injustice.
