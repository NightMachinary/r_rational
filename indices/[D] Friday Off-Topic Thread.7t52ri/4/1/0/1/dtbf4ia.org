I don't think I've had extreme depressive episode or high anxiety, so I'm not sure I'm qualified to give any advice.

But some times when I'm sick or tired, my brain just fixates on stupid random things, and I feel like I have an engine stuck in my head that keeps turning whether I want it to or not. Like, one on level I feel like I /HAVE/ to keep thinking about this thing until I figure it out; on another level, I know what I'm thinking makes no sense and I'm going in circles.

The way I see it, at these times my brain is like a broken factory line that's dumping its product directly into a fire. I have some instinct that tells me "We're not meeting production quotas! We have to accelerate production!", even though logically I know I should do the exact opposite and wait for it to pass (or in your case, seek medical help, I guess).
