You sound /exactly/ like me when I was at my lowest. What is happening to you has nothing to do with how shitty reality is or with justice, and everything to do with the artificial cognitive bias being dropped over your thoughts by what is very clearly some kind of anxiety or obsessive disorder.

If your concern is that fixing this disorder will reduce your will to do something about the injustices you note, that is also the disorder talking. As others have pointed out, you are currently incapable of even attempting to fix any of these problems because you are spending all of your time and energy obsessively ruminating over them and your role in them. This helps nobody, least of all you, and therefore continuing down this path is the least just option on the table.

It is my opinion that you should trust /none/ of your thoughts right now. All of them are subject to corruption and twisting by your brain, and your brain /is objectively lying to you./ For one, there is nothing you, as a single individual, can do about systemic racism over the course of generations. You can improve the lives of those around you, but the ills caused by past injustices will persist. Because you cannot personally fix the problem, worrying about it to the point of physical illness only makes the universe a /worse/ place, not a better one. Likewise, there is nothing you can do about the 'unfair advantage' of being born into what I am assuming is a white middle-class family with a history of education and stable employment. Your brain is forcing you to keep coming back to the topic, not because of any conception of justice, but because it is /fundamentally broken./

Fortunately, we live in the modern era, where things like anxiolytics exist. Going to a professional and seeking medical treatment is not an admission of failure, nor is it a betrayal of the people you wish to protect and uplift. Indeed, since you are incapable of actually doing anything to accomplish any goal right now, it is the only just option both for them and yourself. If leaving your home to get to a professional sounds insurmountable, I highly recommend [[https://www.doctorondemand.com/][Doctor on Demand.]] It's how I get my antidepressants and sleeping pill, they accept most insurance, and if you are uninsured their rates are lower than seeing a physical psychologist because of the resource savings in not needing a professional office. Do it. You deserve to give yourself that much.

As always, if you EVER find yourself planning to harm yourself or end your life, your first and only move should be to immediately go to a hospital. No ifs , ands, or buts, your values as you have put them here demand nothing less than ensuring that you remain alive so you can actually accomplish some progress against systematic injustice. No other reasonable options exist in that case.
