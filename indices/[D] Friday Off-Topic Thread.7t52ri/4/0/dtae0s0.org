As I've mentioned to you elsewhere, as introspective and efficient at analyzing yourself as you are, this does sound like something you should seek professional help with. Your empathy and sense of responsibility have swung past any useful zone and into one where they are just causing you harm, and in case this helps motivate you, causing /others/ harm as well, since you cannot effectively do anything on a long term basis about the problem while you are literally worrying yourself sick about it.

Because this has been observed as a compulsion within you, I think you need to acknowledge that it is in fact outside your ability to control right now, and seek help in getting better tools for dealing with compulsions so that you can regain that control.
