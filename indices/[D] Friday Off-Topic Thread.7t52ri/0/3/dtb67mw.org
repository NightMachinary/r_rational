I dislike author notes or the equivalent. The author giving some additional worldbuilding hints or Word of God outside the fic is one thing, but author notes within the fic always struck me as a sign that you're not good enough at writing to convey what you want to convey precisely.

In this case I remember being squicked out by that part of the story a bit and thinking it was clumsily done. The added note doesn't help. It's just worldbuilding that wasn't adequately explained in-story because it was supposed to be a vague background detail-- but the story wasn't long enough or maybe written written well enough for that kind of hint dropping to work well.
