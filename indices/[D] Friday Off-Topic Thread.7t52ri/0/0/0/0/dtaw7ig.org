Yudkowsky doesn't really define weirdtopia in [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/][Building Weirdtopia]]; I think that this is as close as he gets:

#+begin_quote
  invent a world that went outside my pre-existing sensibilities
#+end_quote

The problem is that the /plain reading/ of the actual text of the story is that rape as-we-know-it has been legalized, and to the average reader that's /not/ a world that goes outside their pre-existing sensibilities, it's simply regressive. In fact, it's already /been/ a feature of several dystopias written by other authors, as well as in the real world. It's not (or shouldn't be) outside the existing sensibilities of readers, it's well within them.

And that's the crux of my problem with the role of rape within the story; it takes a fair amount of legwork on the part of the reader to construct a society where plain reading is not a regression to previous standards. In fact, in the comments to the story, Yudkowsky gives his own version of what a "weird" society might be like, and [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y8/interlude_with_the_confessor_48/qso][ends with this:]]

#+begin_quote
  But as I didn't actually write any of this into the story, feel free to exercise the reader's right of interpretation here.
#+end_quote

/And even then/ I wouldn't have a problem with it, because people are free to write about whatever horrible dystopias they want, but the problem is that if your personal interpretation is "oh, so not that much different from how human societies are now", then the story doesn't work as well. [[/u/DaystarEld]] even says above that it /should/ be a Weirdtopia or Alien Morality in order to fit in with the rest of the story, rather than simply dystopia ... but the story doesn't do the legwork necessary to make that the only reading. This detracts from the story.

All that is irrespective of Yudkowsky's personal beliefs. The "legalized rape" bit of the story doesn't do the legwork it needed to in order to send the message that it wanted to send, and so to a certain subset of readers, it sent a different message instead (which is the problem with being that vague).

In a sense, it's the same problem as creating a villain that looks one-dimensional to the reader and then saying, outside the story, "here's one way that they could have had depth".
