It is worth noting that this whole thing is limited to a few lines in a single conversation, it's not the main point of the setting (that is why I think it's such a shame non-consensual sex was used as an example, it makes the story a lot less enjoyable for a lot of readers (myself included) for almost no pay off)

If you're not too squicked out by it, I would recommend reading the story and just skipping the conversation this comes up in. The main story does have some very interesting things to say about meta-ethics and how morality works in far future societies.
