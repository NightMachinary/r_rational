I haven't read Three Worlds Collide, but this description of it makes me uninterested. The whole point of writing up a weirdtopia is to explore what might actually be better than utopian and we just don't realize it yet (see [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y0/31_laws_of_fun/][31 laws of fun]]). One of the important reasons for this is to better understand how to design an appropriate and adaptable moral code for a friendly AI (see EY's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_4fCIoUnNs&t=6m19s][lecture on the challenge of FAI]]).

I get that he wanted to write up something that challenges our current morality, but there are so many good and plausible options that settling for "legalized rape" just seems lazy at best. For some good examples of weirdtopia elements:

- In an effort to control overpopulation, the government offers a significant universal basic income, but only to people who choose to be sterilized. Many would argue this is a form of economic coercion which encroaches upon reproductive rights. Is the prevention of overpopulation valuable enough to justify it?

- The government legalizes all drugs, allowing anyone 18+ years old to choose to get a permit to buy opiates, stimulants, steroids, hallucinogenics, alcohol, cigarettes, whatever narcotics your heart desires. The government also implements universal health care but only for people who choose not to get a drug usage permit. Government-run health services are forbidden from knowingly providing anything more than palliative care for people with drug use permits. Is this a reasonable, ethical policy, or is it a dystopian hell?

- The Fairness Doctrine is reimplemented with a vengeance. Websites are required to implement the policy as well. For example, if your friends on Facebook post left-leaning content, Facebook would be required to send an equal amount of right-leaning content that you would need to look at for the same amount of time (and vice versa). For every topic, informational websites must offer an equal amount of the contrary point of view. Does this fix the sharp political divide created by internet filter bubbles? Do people just use the internet less because it's annoying?

- In an effort to fix government corruption and reduce corporate influence, a constitutional convention implements an ammendment requiring all currently elected government officials to be selected at random and appointed indefinitely unless they are recalled. To prevent incompetence, officials must pass a test which is equivalent to being able to pass introductory-level college courses in a variety of subjects including English, math, chemistry, biology, physics, constitutional law, macroeconomics, and sociology. New applicants are selected daily for each vacancy until one passes the tests. Elections are now held only when citizens file a petition with at least 100K signatures, and the elections are only votes on whether or not to remove politicians from office. Is this the end of democracy? Will the system still be corrupted by different means?

- Copyright and patents are abolished and DRM is banned. How much does this harm the music, art, film, software, and engineering industries? Is the value gained from freely copying and sharing things worth more than the harm?
