Recently did a reread of [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/][Three Worlds Collide]], and chapter 4 had this disclaimer at the bottom, which I do not remember seeing before:

#+begin_quote
  A reminder: This is a work of fiction. In real life, continuing to attempt to have sex with someone after they say 'no' and before they say 'yes', whether or not they offer forceful resistance and whether or not any visible injury occurs, is (in the USA) defined as rape and considered a federal felony. I agree with and support that this is the correct place for society to draw the line. Some people have worked out a safeword system in which they explicitly and verbally agree, with each other or on a signed form, that 'no' doesn't mean stop but e.g. 'red' or 'safeword' does mean stop. I agree with and support this as carving out a safe exception whose existence does not endanger innocent bystanders. If either of these statements come to you as a surprise then you should look stuff up. Thank you and remember, your safeword should be at least 10 characters and contain a mixture of letters and numbers. We now return you to your regularly scheduled reading. Yours, the author.

(For those that don't know, TWC is set in the far future and one of the minor things mentioned is that "rape" has been legalized, and how people in the far future are literally incapable of understanding why someone from our time would find this horrifying, either because of a value drift or a semantic one. Also TWC is amazing and you should read it right now)

The Internet Archive tells me this was added sometime within the past few years, and I'm glad EY added it, because people arguing that the story "advocates rape" is irritating. But I'm not sure what % of people who would have believed that upon reading it will not with this addition. It seems like a clear proclamation that Rape Is Bad, but it also adds a quick education on BDSM-culture that seems like it's trying to make an additional point, perhaps by way of explanation for what's said in the story, and I don't know quite how to parse that part.

I'm not here to discuss what exactly is meant by "legalized rape" in the story, since I see it as having been purposefully left vague and have my own interpretations that fit the Weirdtopia and Alien Morality themes of the setting very well, without leading me to believe that this world actually allows anything like what we think of when we hear or say "rape." What I'm more interested in is whether anyone here /was/ bothered by that part feels that this disclaimer helps with it, and if not, why not. This kind of annotation of works by authors to prevent people misinterpreting their words/intentions interests me a lot, and seeing it happen more-or-less in front of me with a small community I can ask about it seems interesting.

(Fair warning: being bothered by that part of the story is fine, and I'm interested to hear your perspective, but please try and be thoughtful about this. If you just accuse the story of advocating rape, I'm likely to come down hard on your reading comprehension and general ability to understand the value of sci-fi)
