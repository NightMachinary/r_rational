  One potentially interesting thing to note: The inclusion of this detail has prevented me from recommending the story to some of my friends (which is a shame, because it is otherwise a very good story). The disclaimer as written doesn't change this, though I feel that it might if it had been worded differently.

Oh I definitely hear this: I've had friends who found that part really offputting to the point where they couldn't concentrate on the story or just stopped reading at that point, and now it's something I'm wary of going forward. I have trouble grokking that level of being bothered by it, personally, but I've been reading Stephen King since I was like 13, so I guess my threshold is unusually high.
