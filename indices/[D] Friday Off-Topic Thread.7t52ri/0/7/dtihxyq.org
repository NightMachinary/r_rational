Count me amongst those who didn't believe that it was advocating rape but were nevertheless bothered by the way this was handled in the story.

I don't remember whether the disclaimer was there when I first read it, but I doubt it would have made a difference. The way it is worded makes it sounds too much like a [[https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/6MogqPoyYyiDz3eRh/an-apology-is-a-surrender][non-apology]] or some legal ass-covering and it does more to make the problem stand out than to alleviate it.

One potentially interesting thing to note: The inclusion of this detail has prevented me from recommending the story to some of my friends (which is a shame, because it is otherwise a very good story). The disclaimer as written doesn't change this, though I feel that it might if it had been worded differently.
