I've been dealing with a lot of anxiety and self loathing related to the current state of the world, to the point where I haven't been sleeping, so on a whim I decided to take a look at [[/r/slatestarcodex][r/slatestarcodex]] and see if there was anything that could help me out.

[[http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/21/against-murderism/][Against Murderism]] turned out to be highly relevant to me because I have come to define racism by consequence rather than motive, but went the extra mile by deciding to hate myself along with everyone else I think enables racism-as-consequence.

So I've got a really big problem here that I don't know how to solve. I'm not a stereotypical SJW who thinks they're above prejudice towards minorities, I absolutely believe I am prejudiced and contribute to racism-as-consequence solely because I was raised in privilege.

I've called in sick to work 4 times in the past week because my constant anxiety over this meant I couldn't get any sleep and felt lethargic all day. I eventually forced myself to stop thinking about it for 10 minutes and got some rest, but I still feel this way and am worried it will happen again.

This isn't born of a desire to [[http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/][pay back a social debt I feel I owe]], I don't have the time or money to Do Something and don't feel guilt over it, I just think racism-as-consequence is omnipresent and feel morally compelled to loathe it in all forms, even if it means believing in racism-as-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughtcrime][thoughtcrime]].

Note: I say racism since that's what the article talks about, but I'm also freaking out about sexism, rape culture, and LGBTQ-phobia.
