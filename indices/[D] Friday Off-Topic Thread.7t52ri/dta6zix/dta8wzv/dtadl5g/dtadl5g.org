Just on general principles, thought it's worth mentioning that telling someone to "just stop" having obsessive anxiety-inducing thoughts about a topic of any sort doesn't tend to have any effect if they're reasonably in control of themselves enough in the first place to recognize the problem, since if they could, they would have. I know your heart is in the right place, but it's akin to telling someone with a phobia or depression to "just stop."
