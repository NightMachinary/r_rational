The version of you that is most qualified to do moral reasoning is probably not the version of you that is sleep deprived, sick, missing work, and so on.

So your first priority right now probably should be self care. To that end, it could be good to go through a checklist of the things that usually work the best against insomnia and anxiety for you. (You may already have such a list, since you have been at this for a while, just need to remember to use it.)

For me, it would be writing down the anxiety triggers for later processing (pen on paper, not text), taking melatonin, moderate exercise, venting (verbally) to a trusted friend, eating a balanced meal if needed.

Writing about the issue on paper merits some emphasis, I think. Paper instead of electronics is probably more optimal because it is more soothing and has a different effect on the brain than typing. Also you probably avoid most of the Pavlovian triggers having to do with online discussions that way.

The nice thing about writing it down is that you can read it later and be reminded of your current train of thought. That helps address the moral concern that you don't /want/ to stop caring about the genuine problems, you really just want to be less powerless about it. If you can think of anything actionable, your better-rested future self can then act on it; otherwise, the main thing you are communicating is the depth of your intent and how and why it is important to you right now.

Not only that, but the act of writing things down before bed helps internalize new concepts due to the role of sleep in memory consolidation. That increases the chance that next time you have a similar conversation with yourself there will be objectively less to freak out over because your attitude will have already shifted to a more acceptable one. Basically all kinds of attitudes, including racism, homophobia, transphobia, laziness, and so on are just another kind of memory-skill-thing and are fundamentally malleable.

I also have a list of things that sometimes help me sleep after I lie down: Closing one eye at a time, imaginary backwards somersault, mental math (even just picturing numbers/symbols with my eyes closed is sleep-inducing).
