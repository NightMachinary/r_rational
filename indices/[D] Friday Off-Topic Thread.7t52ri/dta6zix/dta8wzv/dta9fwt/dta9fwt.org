I believe choosing not to worry about politics will contribute to systemic injustice, and even if I didn't I would still think it's immoral to not care about preventing suffering.

I agree that I'm acting like a fool, but I also believe I was a fool before for realizing how much the victims of racism are suffering and will always be fool for not being able to comprehend what that does to a person.

I believe being foolish then hurt others and being foolish now hurts myself, without actually changing my behavior that caused harm, but either way I loathe myself for my foolishness and need a way to stop.
