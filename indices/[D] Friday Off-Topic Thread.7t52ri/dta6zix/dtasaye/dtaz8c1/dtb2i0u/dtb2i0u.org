Constant tension is absolutely a symptom of chronic anxiety, and I know this from personal experience. What you are going through should not be rationalized because it is not the product of rationality, but of your brain being imbalanced. That is the problem you can fix here. You can't even try to fix any of the other problems out in the world until you yourself are healthy and have your head screwed on right.

Your observations are not reliable because the tool you are using to make them is currently not reliable. You need to fix that first before you can do anything else. Do not attempt to rationalize this away, you already know of your capacity for brain dysfunction. Most critically, though, you already know how to /fix/ it as well.
