well i am an avid anime watcher. Watching a couple of series every season (not as many as i would like because exams) and i thought that [[/r/rational][r/rational]] would rather enjoy [[https://myanimelist.net/anime/21185/Baby_Steps][baby steps]]

I dont know if it belongs in this thread since its offtopic and not recommendations but if anythings wrong just please say.

so to add, if some of you are watching anime, which ones are your favourites and what do you enjoy ? this season theres quite a couple contenders for bets of the season.
