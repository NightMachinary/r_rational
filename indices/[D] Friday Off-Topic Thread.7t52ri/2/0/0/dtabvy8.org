ahh i have been told saiki is quite a fine comedy and i must agree from the clips of it i have seen but i havent seen s1 and i dont want to start s2 (the same goes for overlord which i will need to get around)

for me personally i am more into kokkoku. An interesting mystery show about a dysfunctional familly

also fate cuz its interesting seeing it regardless if its good or bad
