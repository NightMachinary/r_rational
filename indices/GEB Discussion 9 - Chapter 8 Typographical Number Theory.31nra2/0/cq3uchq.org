#+begin_quote
  There is no natural number which equals its own square. <=> ~∀a:(a • a)=a (Note that zero is a counter-example)
#+end_quote

I think it should be

#+begin_example
   ∀a:~(a • a)=a
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
   ~∃a:(a • a)=a
#+end_example

I believe, your version is saying 'not all natural numbers equal their own squares' which is factually true, but does not correspond to the sentence.
