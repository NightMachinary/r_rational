Just remembered another point, leaving this here as a memo.

--------------

I am sure there is some hidden message in the MU Offering dialogue when on p. 237 it says:

#+begin_quote
  /Achilles/: Do you suppose that "Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment" stands for "EYE"

  /Tortoise/: In my opinion, it's rather doubtful that it stands for you, Achilles. More likely, it stands for "Meta-Enlightenment" -- "ME" that is.

  /Achilles/: For you? Why would it stand for you? [...]
#+end_quote

The tortoise understands "EYE" as "I" and Achilles thinks the "ME" is a "me" as if the tortoise is referencing itself.
