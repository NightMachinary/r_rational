- I think you're doing great :), I appreciate the work you invest to keep this going. A *minor* nitpick is that sometimes the post is a little hard to read on reddit due to missing formatting.

- I think you forgot something there: =If 1 equals 0, then every number is odd. <=> (0=S0) Va:()= :)

- on p. 220 the illegal shortcut is that the =transitivity= rule is used for *formulas* while the rule says that the variables on both side of === must be *terms*. The right derivation is

  #+begin_example
    (1) ∀a:(a+0)=a  axiom 2
    (2) (a+0)=a     specification
    (3) a=(a+0)     symmetry
    (4) a=a         transitivity (lines 2,3)
    (5) ∀a:a=a      generalization
  #+end_example

- As foreseen by xamueljones, I found the dialog rather hard to read
- When Jõshũ unasked the question via MU this triggered some associations for me to the part in the /little harmonic labyrinth/ dialog (p. 115) when Achilles "unwishes" the wish.
