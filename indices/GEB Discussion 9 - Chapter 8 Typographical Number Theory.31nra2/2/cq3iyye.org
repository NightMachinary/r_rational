You can write "b is a power of 2" a bit more concisely: ∀x:∃y:(SSx • y = b) => ∃z:(SS0 • z=SSx))

In the dialogue, I thought DNA => RNA => Protein mapped to Koan => Phonetic Symbols => Folded String and Meaning => English Sentence => TNT String. The phonetic symbols are simplified diagrams of the RNA bases, and the string is then folded according to the sequence, much like a protein. Achilles calls strings that sound like koans well-formed strings, just like strings that look like theorems in TNT.

Two knots cancel each other... just like two nots.
