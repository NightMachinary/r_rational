Over on [[/r/geb]], we've been stumped by the challenge of expressing "/b/ is a power of 10" in TNT. And Hofstadter supplies an appropriate warning there.

Prime powers let you make simple statements about all factors of /b/, and these statements just don't work on composite powers. Does anyone have any idea of how to start?
