Okay, wow. I was probably not going to come up from my own knowledge of number theory.

[[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/312891/how-is-exponentiation-defined-in-peano-arithmetic]] seems like it outlines the approach, although translating it into TNT will still take some effort.

We already have to use a trick of Godel's, to use numbers to represent encoded values with more structure than numbers. Perhaps this means I should wait for tomorrow's discussion.
