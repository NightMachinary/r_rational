I suspect that sphere packing isn't the right approach for that problem.

But perhaps you could have a stage where your spheres grow? Throw some spheres in, grow them until they're filling the space. Obviously your grow them on each axis independently.

Then pack in more spheres. Repeat. You probably actually want to be using capsuleShape if you're using bullet.

I'd be inclined towards trying to segment the mesh into convex-hull-able shapes, generally.
