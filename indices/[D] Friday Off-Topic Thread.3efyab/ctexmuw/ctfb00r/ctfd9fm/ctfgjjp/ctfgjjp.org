Plastic filament is a commodity - anyone who deals with plastic can make it, and there's not much profit there at all. Worth setting up a product line if you have the plant already (well, maybe - small sales volume is an issue), but there's too few buyers and too much competition for much of a margin.

All this is excellent news for consumers though - or small 3D printing consultancies.
