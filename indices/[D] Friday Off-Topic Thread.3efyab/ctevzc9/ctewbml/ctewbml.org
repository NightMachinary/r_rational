That depends, what are your qualifications and how far are you willing to move? I got a bachelor's degree in CS, three jobs later I gave up on it and went to grad school for data science/machine learning. Definitely can recommend - most of your CS knowledge is still useful, but your job nominally doesn't revolve around programming.
