Started playing Terraria again since the 1.3 Update, and I never noticed before how the game subtly encourages the transiston from a scorched-earth extraction policy to careful conservation. Acorns and seeds are plentiful, and but wood and herbs are scare enough (compared to how much you need) that you are incentivized to replant forests after cutting them down and to cultivate gardens of dayblooms, glowing mushrooms, etc. in their respective biomes.

I also like the truly fantastical nature of the game, which has absolutely no compunctions about giving Magic Missile and a handgun as loot from the same area, and how there's just enough lore to seed a nice fanfic but no real story whatsoever.

I want to say it's an excellent little game, except for the fact that it isn't little at all. I'm currently working on a grand castle with an underground apartment and biome complex, and probably won't be finished till after summer is over.
