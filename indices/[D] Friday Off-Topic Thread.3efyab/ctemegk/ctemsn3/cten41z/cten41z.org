Do you avoid the announcements or consume everything? I can't imagine you watch Reynad or Forsen for their thoughts on the cards though.

Priest seems to be the flavour for this, easily the most common, which I'm happy with since Priest has been the worst class in the game since its inception and I used to play it in beta.

I don't know if I agree that people are front loading their decks with big ones . Two sw:d, two bgh, two light bomb is already 20% and I imagine all priests are running that. Mage has it even easier with fireball and pyro being burn and removal. My deck runs 8 secrets too which might be too much as coining away my counterspell seems to happen a lot. How many wins do you have with priest?

Do you have a large collection? It is a very p2w brawl though I won on na and asia with heros that weren't even level 10.

That's a good point regarding late game. Warrior versus priest in a control match up used to be a disaster for priest since end game hero power pass was normal. If warrior could gain 10 from that it would be no surprise to see them dominating even more.
