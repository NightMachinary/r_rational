No hype about the new Hearthstone expansion? I thought you would have commented about that considering how much I've seen you in the subreddit.

This tavern brawl has been really fun for me. I play mage and make the terrible choice of when second to mulligan entirely for chromag and arcane intellect just for the joy.

I also wondered how they decided hero powers should only get one use a turn, and how the game would be different if they hadn't designed it like that. Also I wonder if classes had no hero powers and it was only class cards that made heros different.

Does anyone else feel that Hearthstone design seems to encourage less and less skill and more on random chance. Obviously card games will have chance elements but it seems like they are too impactful.
