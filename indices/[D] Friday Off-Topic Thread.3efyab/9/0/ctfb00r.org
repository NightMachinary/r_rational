(as owner of a 3D printer) I think the RepRap project means that manufacturing 3D printers is never going to be a high-margin business - imagine the OS market if Microsoft didn't get an early monopoly; anyone can sell a clone of the latest Free hardware, but making money is harder. Feedstock has to be standard to be useful, so no big profit there.

Exceptions will likely exist but are very hard to pick in advance. A better bet would be the Red Hat model; support contracts for Free stuff.
