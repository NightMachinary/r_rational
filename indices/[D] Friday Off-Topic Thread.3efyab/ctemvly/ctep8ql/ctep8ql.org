VR (like a lot of platforms) is going to live and die by the apps that run on it. Right now, the use case seems to mostly be novelty and immersion, roughly in that order. I have two friends who have the Oculus Rift, and I've played it quite a bit, but ... what's the killer app for VR? An exercise program combined with a videogame?

Without a killer app, early adopters are the only ones that buy in, which means that development resources aren't put towards building with the platform in mind, which means that new apps aren't made, which in turn slows adoption. I've seen this happen quite a bit with other platforms, and it's part of why I'm of a "content first" mindset.

This is part of why I think AR is the one that's going to change things. I can imagine lots of virtual things that you'd want to tack onto the real world.
