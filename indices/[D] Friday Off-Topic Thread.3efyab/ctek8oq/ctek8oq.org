If you could chose to research absolutely anything and get unlimited funding for precisely one research, what would you research?

P.S. Does anyone know how common it is for someone applying to grad school to have had research papers published?

EDIT: You have a lot of money to burn, so you can use it to pay other people to help/do-it-for-you with your research. However you're still required to be the leader and to direct the progress of the project. Thanks [[/u/alexanderwales]] for pointing that possibility out.
