Do I have to research it myself, or can I just throw money at the problem? Will I have people working with me?

I guess if I don't personally have to do it, I would say self-sustaining systems, though I don't know if that violates "precisely one". In other words, I want to research how to attain small-scale homeostasis for an environment, preferably one that has humans in it. This would be useful in space, but also useful in creating sustainable cities, as well as creating pockets of civilization which can exist independently of each other (ensuring long-term species survival).

If I have to do it all by my lonesome ... natural-language processing, I guess. Automated text generation is going to be one of the big new fields; you already see some of it for simple business news articles and sports reports. Some day (probably sooner than we think) it's going to be possible to have a computer write a book that people would actually want to read, and not just for the novelty of it.
