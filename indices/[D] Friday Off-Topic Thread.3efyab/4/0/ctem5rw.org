Self replicating robotic machinery in space.

Reason:

1. The energy and materials available in space are abundant, so replication rates of greater than once per year are almost certainly feasible. The abundant vacuum lets us use vacuum deposition of ions in place of current electrolytic methods, and the negligible gravity reduces the material costs for supporting structures, while permitting fine structures to be formed with less distortion.

2. Exponential doubling at an annual rate or better is fast enough to reach megascale engineering levels within a matter of decades. Megascale engineering allows for the creation of trillions of parallel robotic laboratories for running experiments which can improve efficiencies and resolve nagging human problems like aging.
