If I'd been born in a different world I would have loved to get a job designing closed ecosystems and parks and things for spacecraft and space colonies. Something about the challenge of making it self-sustaining and balanced but also aesthetically pleasing, and merging technological and biological systems. Playing around with a biosphere would be a good second best option, though.
