Communication isn't very good on either side. I'm not even sure what legitimate complaints there are against my position. With feminism co-opting LGBT issues, I feel like discussion of the T is being both diluted and radicalized between feminism and anti-feminism. My position, which I think is more moderate and medically-based, isn't ever addressed due to the polarization.
