Honestly I have no idea how to put it into words satisfactorily. The thing is that it's sort of a slow burn, it just keeps getting worse over time. I don't mean to be insulting, but have you considered that not feeling it is what rightness feels like? Or you might not have a strong attachment to your gender, I don't know.

Okay, so imagine something about yourself that's important to you. Imagine that you see depictions of this everywhere, and constantly see people that embody this. Now imagine that you just aren't that no matter how much you want to be, and if you tell people how much you admire this trait they only think you're strange. This is the closest I can think of, and it's still pretty vague.

Look, give me some time and I'll try and write something up about this.
