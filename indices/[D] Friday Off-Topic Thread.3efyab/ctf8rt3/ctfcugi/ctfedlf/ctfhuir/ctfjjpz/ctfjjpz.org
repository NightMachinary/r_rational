This seems like the common problem that if you are white, the idea that cops would casually shoot your dog seems kind of weird. It indicates mostly that there are questions which you have lucked out of having to wonder about... The universe just seems consistent. Values are orthogonal to logic, and gender may contribute a great deal toward those values... I value competition and self sacrifice, but I honestly don't know if those are instrumental values or terminal values that come from me being male. I can certainly see how being defined in terms of implicit values that don't all apply to my innate utility function can seem alienating.
