I've noticed that it's been a long time since a book or movie has elicited any strong emotional response from me (I do enjoy them greatly, but don't cry or laugh as before) . Is it normal to stop empathizing as you grow older or do I need to find better books? When was the last time a work of fiction really /moved/ you?
