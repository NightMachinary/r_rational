Find better books. Try to read them more deeply as well; it might be that you're just going through the motions of reading without making an attempt at investment. (Edit: I will say that I had some temporary setbacks in this regard; once you've read enough fiction, you can eventually get to the point where you say, "Oh, powerful mentor figure, he's either going to turn bad or die at the end of the first act." If that's your problem, the solution is mostly to stop caring.)

The last work of fiction that really moved me was /Inside Out/, which I saw about two weeks ago, but there are a few works that have personal resonance that I can continually get an emotional response from. (For reference, I'm nearly thirty.)
