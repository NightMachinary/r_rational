I did. I keep meaning to set this up to be posted by AutoModerator, but it seems like a poorly documented and poorly maintained feature. And that means that whenever I think about doing it, it seems like the sort of thing that I should just put off until later. (As with most automation tasks, it's better in terms of time saved to do it early in order to get the most payoff, and I know that ... but it feels like less work to just manually post it.)

Edit: Alright, created a schedule and added the Off-Topic Thread to it, hopefully that works next week.
