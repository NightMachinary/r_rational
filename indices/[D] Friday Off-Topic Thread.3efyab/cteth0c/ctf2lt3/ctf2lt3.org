I'm mostly just not worrying about it, given my lack of domain knowledge on the subject. I have investments through a fairly conservative 401K run through my company, but that's about it. Finances are one of those things where I worry about the Dunning--Kruger effect quite a bit. The market preys on unwise investors.

If the global economy /does/ melt down, I have marketable skills and live a fairly spartan lifestyle, meaning that I can probably weather whatever comes better than most other people, short of civilizational collapse (which is a whole different topic).
