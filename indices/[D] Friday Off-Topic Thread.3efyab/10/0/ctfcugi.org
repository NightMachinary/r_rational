  So what do the rest of you think about things like gender X feeling like gender Y or vice versa?
#+end_quote

I'm trans, so I have a fairly personal view on it...

#+begin_quote
  And about all the controversy something like it has started, both now and in past times?
#+end_quote

I consider gender dysphoria to be necessary and sufficient. If that's not the controversy you're talking about (the one leaking out of tumblr), I'm not sure.

#+begin_quote
  But I just find it fairly irrelevant, despite the fact that I'm a fairly standard straight guy.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure what you're saying you find irrelevant. Dysphoria may be irrelevant to those unaffected by it, but those who have it also have disproportionately high suicide rates. Since gender conversion works about as well as sexuality conversion, I think it's a fairly obvious position to say that society should move towards accepting transitioning individuals. We're not going to be transcending biology any time soon.
