  YOUR gender and sexuality can be important to you, if you choose
#+end_quote

The problem is that gender is /not/ a choice. There are physical differences in the dysphoric mind that we can detect, and I'd bet a whole bunch that we can't yet, and those cause a disconnect between the physical characteristics of a body and those that the brain feels should be there. Those who are trans have this disconnect; those who aren't don't, and don't understand the problem. The disconnect causes great amounts of suffering to those who have it, and a good deal of it is exacerbated by society's current state of acceptance when trans people try to do something about it.

When I say that gender conversion works about as well as sexuality conversion, I'm saying it doesn't work, because neither "conversion" actually /does/ anything. The difference is all in the brain, in ways that we cannot change, which is why those who decry acceptance of transition because dysphoria is a "mental illness" and should be treated in the brain are themselves utterly mental. The only option we have to decrease suicide rates and suffering of trans people in general is to accept transition as a society. We cannot change the brain, so we must allow changes in the body. All of us, as individuals. The culture needs to change.
