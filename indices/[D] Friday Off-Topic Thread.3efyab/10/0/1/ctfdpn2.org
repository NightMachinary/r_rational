I find biology, gender, sexuality etc. to be fairly irrelevant, in the context of judging people for it. YOUR gender and sexuality can be important to you, if you choose, but considering how I view biology and the fact that we are a bigender species as more circumstance than anything designed or fated, I personally do not care that much about it.

I won't try and pretend I'm a champion for transrights or anything of the sort, but I am a champion for personal choice being the main factor in your decision making, so I do count myself as an LGBT supporter. And when you say "gender conversion works about as well as sexuality conversion", what exactly are you saying? That it doesn't work that well? And, if that is what you're saying, how does that statement support what you say after the comma?

Not disagreeing, I'm just honestly unclear on what you meant there.
