  I don't mean to be insulting, but have you considered that not feeling it is what rightness feels like? Or you might not have a strong attachment to your gender, I don't know.

  Okay, so imagine something about yourself that's important to you. Imagine that you see depictions of this everywhere, and constantly see people that embody this. Now imagine that you just aren't that no matter how much you want to be, and if you tell people how much you admire this trait they only think you're strange. This is the closest I can think of, and it's still pretty vague.

I think it must be that I have no strong attachment to my gender. That's probably where the disconnect is coming from. My gender /isn't/ important to me, and it's hard to see (on an empathic level) how gender is important to others. Like ... when I imagine myself getting turned into a woman, I don't imagine that making any particular difference to me? My life doesn't have gendered activities in it right now. None of my friendships are contingent on gender. Even my sexuality would remain pretty much unchanged. And I guess I also don't really understand admiring one gender over the other, if that's what you're saying.

Like I said, I'm more than willing to accept that gender dysphoria is something that other people experience, but I'm starting to think that it must come from some experience of gender as integral to self that I don't have.

(Edit: My wife informs me that she is not a lesbian. So that would be a problem. But that's more one of sexual preference than gender identity.)
