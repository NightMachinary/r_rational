I just don't really /get/ gender dysphoria.

I'm aware that this is something that people experience, and willing to take them at their word on this. But I have no idea what it's supposed to feel like from the inside. I've heard people compare it to the trauma of waking up as the opposite gender and being stuck that way, but that doesn't seem traumatic to me. I immediately start thinking about the differences in utility associated with gender, rather than any emotional component. Being transgendered has been described to me as feeling a "wrongness" associated with gender ... but I don't feel a "rightness" associated with gender right now. I don't feel any particular attachment to maleness over femaleness, beyond arguments of utility.

So I'm all for transrights, but the part I find confusing is the internal psychological aspect of it. Mostly because I don't have an attachment to my gender (or feel that it matters too much). Whenever I read someone trying to describe what being transgender feels like, they always start with this assumption that people feel like they have a gender that they're supposed to be? Which doesn't square with my personal experience, and makes it hard to relate.
