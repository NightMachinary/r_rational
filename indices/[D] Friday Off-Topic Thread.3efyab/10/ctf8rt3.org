So people are up in arms over this Caitlyn (Bruce?) Jenner thing. Now, I don't have much of an opinion either way, but I do find it an interesting topic because, as someone who's read and thought about certain transhumanist things, I find biology to be largely immaterial. Yes, we are governed by it. And we're miles away from being able to seperate ourselves (what we call consciousness, I'm going to say our "brains" for simplicity) from it. But I just find it fairly irrelevant, despite the fact that I'm a fairly standard straight guy. So what do the rest of you think about things like gender X feeling like gender Y or vice versa? And about all the controversy something like it has started, both now and in past times?
