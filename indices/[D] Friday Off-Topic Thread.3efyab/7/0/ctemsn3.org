I'll be more hyped when the expansion actually drops; this slow roll of card reveals is killing me.

I've been running priest for the current brawl. It's really surprising to me how many people are just going around with big stompy decks. The ideal distribution of cards seems to be roughly half utility and removal, with the other half being huge threats. That already basically described the priest deck that I've been using to ladder with (Burn Priest). I've been playing around with other classes, but priest is still my favorite, both for this brawl and in the general sense.

Historically speaking, before there was Hearthstone there was the World of Warcraft TCG, which came out in 2005. I played that quite a bit with my friends; almost all of the artwork (and a few of the mechanics) came to Hearthstone by way of that game. In the WoW TCG, you had a hero power that you could use once per game, and I think the idea for per-turn hero powers probably comes from a similar place. As for restricting it to once per turn, I think the worry was that hero powers would come to dominate the late game; there are already hero power "match-ups" where some heroes have a worse time than others strictly on the basis of what their hero power can do. Without being able to spam the hero power, it's possible to "run out of gas", which is a desirable result.
