I consume everything as it comes out, but don't really pay too much attention to "pro" reviews (partly because they have a bad track record, partly because it's impossible to evaluate cards outside their context -- which explains the bad track record).

I have 20 wins with priest this brawl, though some of those are early-game concedes. I think my winrate for actual games is about 70%, which is quite good. Part of the reason that priest is good in this brawl is that it's got so many ways to respond to threats, which (if the game doesn't just open with big stompy creatures on my side that aren't contested) means that I can usually regain the board.

I have a large enough collection that I find myself surprised when I don't have a card in it. I'm missing a good chunk of (bad) legendaries, along with a few epics, but have most of the rest. This brawl is far more p2w than the others have been, though I think it's still feasible with certain builds of basic/common cards (and I tried it for a bit before deciding that was less fun).
