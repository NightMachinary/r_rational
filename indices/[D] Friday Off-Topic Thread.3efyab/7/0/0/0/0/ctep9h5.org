  I consume everything as it comes out, but don't really pay too much attention to "pro" reviews (partly because they have a bad track record, partly because it's impossible to evaluate cards outside their context -- which explains the bad track record).

Sure enough, but the idea is that the guys who are winning tournaments are best likely to gauge the impact of a card, they weren't all so bad for GvG.

  I have 20 wins with priest this brawl, though some of those are early-game concedes.
#+end_quote

I haven't been getting concedes as soon as you join in this brawl (unlike say the nef-rag one). I've only gotten 15 wins and I'd definitely say that I have played this tavern brawl the most, though the games are a lot shorter so I might have put more time in the spell one. Plus I've played a fair bit with friends.

I also don't use any tracking tools so I have no idea about my winrate.

  Part of the reason that priest is good in this brawl is that it's got so many ways to respond to threats, which (if the game doesn't just open with big stompy creatures on my side that aren't contested) means that I can usually regain the board.

Turn 1 Alex op op (who I don't have sadly), I feel that people are overvaluing priest however. It's not that much better than mage (if at all). Though even stranger I see warriors with weapons and I have to take a step back.

#+begin_quote
  This brawl is far more p2w than the others have been, though I think it's still feasible with certain builds of basic/common cards (and I tried it for a bit before deciding that was less fun).
#+end_quote

Well you can definitely win a game with that combo priest that wins on turn 1 and is mostly basic cards.
