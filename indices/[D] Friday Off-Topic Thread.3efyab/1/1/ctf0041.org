Hmm, I've definitely experienced less empathy for characters as time goes on. But I have found a method of sort of meditating myself into an equivalent state of sorrow. It mostly just requires slow breathing, and focusing on your core and the feeling of the negative emotion until it expands.

It doesn't quite get to the level I've experienced when people I know have died, but I haven't really practiced it that much because I prefer psyching myself into joy than sorrow.

Sorrow is my second favorite emotion though. I wonder if that's unhealthy...

Edit: Come to think of it, the fact that I tend to psyche myself into joy regardless of circumstance might be the reason I have less empathy. Hard to feel the suffering of others as much when your own lever is glued to happy. Maybe I should practice sorrow more after all.
