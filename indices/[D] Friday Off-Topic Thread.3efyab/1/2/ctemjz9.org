I've actually had the opposite experience. When I was first reading very few of the characters mattered to me, and I didn't really care about events that weren't related to the plot. Now, if I care about a character and, say, their wife dies, I at least understand why that is a big deal.

The last time I watched K-19 I wept. I recommend it as a test.
