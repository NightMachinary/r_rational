The only stories I can remember to have brought tears to my eyes are /[[http://www.hulu.com/death-note][Death Note]]/ ([[#s][spoiler]]) and /[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662][Atlas Shrugged]]/ ([[#s][spoiler]]). (There was also /Inspector Gadget 2/ ([[#s][spoiler]]), but that's long enough ago that it probably doesn't count.)

I'm pretty sure several fanfiction stories have made me /literally/ gasp in utter amazement at their sheer awesomeness since then, on my first readings of them--/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/ and /[[http://hpmor.com/][Methods of Rationality]]/ are the obvious candidates, but /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099][People Lie]]/, /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8440324][Little Moments]]/, and even /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411][Chunin Exam Day]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771][Partially Kissed Hero]]/ may have done it as well.
