Really, I'm less sympathetic to the /ideas/ than I am inspired by the /people./ Sure, if you think about it, it's rather ridiculous that Light could control six or seven billion people with /at most/ half a dozen artifacts spread among his most devoted followers--but I'm still moved to tears every time I see the incredible conviction and devotion to righteousness (defined however suspectly) that Light displays in the first episode of /Death Note/, and the final episode brought similar feelings to my mind. Likewise, it's not the objectivist ideas themselves that allows /Atlas Shrugged/ to move me--rather, I get teary-eyed at the incredible descriptions of how the corrupt politicians and businessmen slowly destroy the USA from the inside over the course of the book, plus some extra stabs of pity for the eternal tribulations of Dagny's brother.

On the alignment test [[http://easydamus.com/alignmenttest.html][here]], I'm evenly split between lawful neutral and lawful evil ([[http://i.imgur.com/htQnbLU.jpg][image]])--as of two months ago, at least.

(The given name of /Death Note/'s protagonist is literally "Light" (or "Raito", depending on the translator or fanfiction writer), not "Hikari"--though the kanji is some kind of weirdness...)

(Oh, I forgot to mention that the ending of /Angel Beats!/ also made me tear up a little.)
