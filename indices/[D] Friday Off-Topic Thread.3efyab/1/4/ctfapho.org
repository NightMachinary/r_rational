I would say that there is a certain degree of desensitization that comes with both growing older and becoming more rationalist, so I'm not surprised that that is happening.

However, I'm willing to wager that there is media out there that could pluck at your heartstrings. I'm not the most compassionate of individuals, but here's a few things I've played/seen/read that really got me:

Shadow of the Colossus (PS2 video game)[[#s][]]

I Am Sam (Movie)[[#s][]]

Final Fantasy VII (PS1 game)[[#s][]]

Game of Thrones (Show)[[#s][]]

Scrubs (Show) - [[#s][]]

The Prestige (Movie) - [[#s][]]

The Metropolitan Man (fanfiction) - [[#s][]]

There's a lot more, but I've ingested so much fiction over the years, I honestly can't remember.
