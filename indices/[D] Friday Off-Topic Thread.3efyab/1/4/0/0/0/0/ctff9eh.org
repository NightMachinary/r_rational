I guess, for me, a villain is a villain because of his choices. Superman was a huge risk, undeniably, but he was a good person. Extremely so. It's his strong moral adhesion that makes him unstable in the first place.

It's like this for me. If you kill Darth Vader in Episode 5, you've slain a villain. If you go back in time and kill Anakin on Tatooine, you've /prevented/ the rise of Darth Vader but you didn't kill a villain. You killed a little boy. [[#s][]]
