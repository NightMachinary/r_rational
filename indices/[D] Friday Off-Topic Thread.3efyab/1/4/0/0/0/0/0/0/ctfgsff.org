EDIT: I did NOT notice the spoiler tagged, as I read that out of my inbox, and I would disagree. While I can't promise it wasn't going to happen at some point in the future, I don't think Superman was setting out to become some sort of dictator. He just wanted to help humanity. And he'd finally realized that his heroics were paltry compared to what he could actually accomplish.
