As far as that goes, video games aren't terrible either. It is, in some ways, easier to find yourself invested into them.

The Mother series in particular is poignant for me; just hearing some of their songs is enough to make me cry, much less in association with the recently deceased Satoru Iwata. But even that aside, Mother 3 is an utterly heartbreaking game.
