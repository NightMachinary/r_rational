Great chapter as usual! Always sad to see the characters go through trauma, but I guess it helps them grow. I highly doubt Blue, for example, would have been able to survive the encounter if he hadn't already dealt with similar situations before. Shame about him losing such an ace though. Did you perhaps allow him to lose Kermui because it was so powerful and Blue was still relatively early in his journey, forcing him to adapt? Maybe I'm just overanalyzing things.

Oh, and this has nothing to do with this chapter in particular, but I was wondering something about the world of your story. Do Mega Evolution and Z Moves exist in this world and if so, how do they function? I imagine they would work much differently in your rational story as opposed to running on the power of friendship and dancing like in the games.
