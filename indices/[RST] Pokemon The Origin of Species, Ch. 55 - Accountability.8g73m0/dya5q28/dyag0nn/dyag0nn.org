Yeah thats a cool idea. The gym leaders set encounters based on your progression rather than having set "encounters" based on whether you having pokemon that know cut :p

So you can strategically takle the gyms in the order you want based on how difficult their theoretical best would be for you to beat. Whether that be to make it easier for your team or to get more renown as a trainer.
