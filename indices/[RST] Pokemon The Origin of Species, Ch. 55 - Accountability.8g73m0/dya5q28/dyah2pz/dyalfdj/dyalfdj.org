Erika is plausible, she's a younger leader with a counterable type focus. Blaine and Surge are more experienced, but they have similarly iffy monotypes (Amy's brother did pick Surge as his 8th). On the other hand, the gym leaders are holding back even on 8th badge/membership challenges; perhaps those three just play a bit more seriously, closer to their full potential, to compensate for their weaker monotypings/skills.

And of course Brock was the pushover [[https://images2.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED34/5198cd964677b.jpeg][Bubble the Onix]] gym on paper, and he ended up with rock snake godzilla. Lord knows what nonsense the other gym leaders get (Contrary Serperior for Erika?).
