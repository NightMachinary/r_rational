Janine's Arbok was pretty frickin scary when it was just slithering around. I'd hate to put any of my pokemon in front of that thing's fangs. I can only imagine Koga's pokemon would ramp that up another notch or two for the 8th badge. He'll also probably become an E4 member as well, attributing to his battling skill (probably second to Giovanni in Kanto).

My money would be on Blaine, Misty, or Erika. Blaine as I see him spending more of his energies doing research rather than improving as a trainer, Misty is quite young and possibly quite green in relation to the rest of the leaders, and Erika for what ManyCookies already stated. (Although a Vileplume with full access to Effect Spore AoE's, Chlorophyll's quickness, Strength Sap's longevity and debilitation, and Solar Beams bright enough to blind people as well as burn them up Kamehameha style would be frickin terrifying too.)
