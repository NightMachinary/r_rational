What about Koga, I don't remember him having anything particularly impressive pokemon and poison is probably one of the weakest types in general, anyone who can handle getting poisoned can probably deal well with him. Of course poison might be a lot scarier than I'm thinking in this setting, since you have a much harder time judging it's effects on your pokemon.
