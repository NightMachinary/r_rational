  Of course poison might be a lot scarier than I'm thinking in this setting, since you have a much harder time judging it's effects on your pokemon.

Also, in the games Poison is one of the status effects without a secondary effect, the way Paralyze cuts Speed or Burn cuts Attack. I always thought Poison should reduce Evasion or increase PP use or something to reflect that the pokemon is not just losing generic "hit points" that don't mean anything until they're at 0, but actually feeling the effects of the poison as they fight.
