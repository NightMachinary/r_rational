Running purely off what we know from the games, the leaders just got harder and harder. As Blue mentions, even eight-badge isn't the Leader's Best, just them actually trying. I suspect that'd keep scaling at one point. I suspect skill plateaus quicker than a sixteen-badge run, so at that point it'd be just fighting everyone at their best and it being a solid challenge.
