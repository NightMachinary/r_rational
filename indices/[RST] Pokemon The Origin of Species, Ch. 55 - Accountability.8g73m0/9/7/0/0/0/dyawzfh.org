  So why's dune gendered and an Onix is not? Then that in and of itself is stylistically weird.
#+end_quote

Probably because Dune matters to Aiko as a person, whereas the onix - while technically having a gender - matters as a threat, an obstacle.

Both pokemon have genders, so could use "s/he", and both, as non-humans, could validly be referred to as "it" - in general. In this case, though, using a personal pronoun for one and non-personal for the other makes sense in context and removes the ambiguity.

  Maybe "her fear for her pokemon" would sound better?

I don't see any advantage in adding the word. It's unambiguous as it stands.
