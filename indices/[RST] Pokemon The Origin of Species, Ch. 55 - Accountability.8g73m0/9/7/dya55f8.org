#+begin_quote
  use distraction to reach it.
#+end_quote

*use the distraction

Though that'd be a pretty OP pokemon move.

Nitpicks:

#+begin_quote
  Dune digs his claws into a boulder segment about halfway along the onix's body just before it rolls to the side to
#+end_quote

"It" is ambiguous here.

#+begin_quote
  It displaces both... along with four thin wedges
#+end_quote

Here too. It'd understandable when the entire sentence is read but the reading process is made unnecessarily more difficult.

#+begin_quote
  fear for her pokemon suddenly suffocating her,
#+end_quote

I'm nitpicking more and more here but this could be interpreted as fear that her pokemon will suffocate and kill her.

#+begin_quote
  Aiko spends another moment paralyzed with indecision, trying to decide what to do.
#+end_quote

Again, nitpicking but "trying to decide what to do" is redundant with "indecision."

#+begin_quote
  and it staggers under the blows, body rolling
#+end_quote

Ambiguous it.

#+begin_quote
  she thrashes in bed a moment, then realizes where she is and collapses back onto the hospital bed,
#+end_quote

Redundant bed.
