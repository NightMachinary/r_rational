#+begin_quote
  Not really; Dune is male, and referred to as such in this sentence.
#+end_quote

So why's dune gendered and an Onix is not? Then that in and of itself is stylistically weird.

#+begin_quote
  No, that would be worded as "fear of her pokemon", not "fear for her pokemon".
#+end_quote

Maybe "her fear for her pokemon" would sound better? Also now that I've read the sentence like 5 more times, it looks pretty run-on to me.
