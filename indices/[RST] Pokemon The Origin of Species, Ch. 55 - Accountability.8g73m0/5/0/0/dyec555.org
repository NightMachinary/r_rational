I can't tell which part of my speculation you're hinting is on track. Now I'm just sitting here starting to wonder if the pokeball containing Absol's going to glitch and spontaneously release it at the worst possible moment.

This is just my imagination, right? An Absol can't actually do anything once it's digitized into a pokeball...right?
