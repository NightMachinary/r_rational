Hello there! As always, the story is awesome. I'm still working in a table rpg adaptation, and I have stumbled upom the aura topic. I don't know how you will deal with it, so I thought I would both ask you your ideas and share mines too (probably not compatible with yours as I take the types as connected to actual elemental powers)

My idea is to take the mind-soul/aura-heart dynamic, based on the eastern concepts. Well, mind actually is your version, the thoughts linked to some physical phenomenom. The types related to it are psychic (duh), dark (I guess) and ghost (you have yet to explain that one)

Then we have the aura, the eastern concept of spirit (very different to plato's) which is heavilly conected to "physicall vitaliy", hence fighting as its main type. Every living being has an aura, but I consider types able to "pulse" as able to harness their aura in a lesser way. Those are water, dragon, phychic (heal pulse, that might be hard to explain) and dark (that will make cool stories. Mind blocked, but able to burst their auras)

Lastly, "heart". IIRC, in eastern cultures the organ hosts the feelings and life of the individual. With the modern science, it had been dismised... like the fairy type. I will leave it that way for now ;)

Also, I pretend to use those concepts to explain legendary pok√©mon, with their legendary hearts and auras (need a cooler name tho)

Well, what do you think? Sounds cool? Potential? And how are you going to do it? I'm specially interested in your version of ghost types

Have a nice day!
