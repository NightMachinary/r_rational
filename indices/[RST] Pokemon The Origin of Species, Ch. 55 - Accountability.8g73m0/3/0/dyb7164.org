Sort of: it's kind of a rough amalgamation of what I've seen and facilitated within the rationality community (CFAR workshops and ESPR camp), specifically things like pair debugging and circling, filtered through a Heroic Responsibility lens. I think it's definitely a valuable mentality to cultivate and establish among friends and in communities that you trust to help hold each other accountable and build each other up.

Glad you liked the chapter!
