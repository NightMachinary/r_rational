Nah, it's not as bad as the inevitable interlude chapter that is going to be coming up next month. We're about due, and this seems like the perfect place to put an update on what's going on with Delia's murder mysteries (especially if they end up affecting the events on the boat). Personally, I'd like to see what Mewtwo's been up to; he must be getting lonely going on 15 chapters without our company.
