I usually go with EPUB and MOBI (well, technically an AZW3 these days) with the EPUB being the working file and finished product, and then converting the EPUB to MOBI for the convenience of Kindle users (although I suspect that most people who want to read third-party ebooks on their Kindles are using Calibre anyway, and probably have an ePub reader installed on the Kindle.

So mainly, EPUB, plus MOBI/AZW3 if you feel like saving Kindle users some time. Using Sigil, or Calibre's book editor, it's pretty simple to make an EPUB file from a word processor document, or from a collection of HTML files (which you presumably have since you are already publishing a web serial).
