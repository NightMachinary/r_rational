I'm going to add to the chorus of "EPUB" here, with a couple additions: many people appreciate the ability to read EPUBs in whatever color scheme they choose. The typical mechanisms of this are twofold: either their reader simply ignores the bundled CSS, or the reader overrides the colors manually. The former is meaningfully more common. What this means to you, is that someone trying to avoid the glowy pink & grey will also likely lose the part of the stylesheet that right-aligns Lyra's text and left-aligns the nameless narrator. You may wish to have an array of EPUBs matching the available display options.
