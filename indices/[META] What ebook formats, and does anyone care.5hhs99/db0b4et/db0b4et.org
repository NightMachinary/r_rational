[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats][Wikipedia says:]]

#+begin_quote
  The EPUB format is the most widely supported vendor-independent XML-based (as opposed to PDF) e-book format; that is, it is supported by the largest number of e-Readers, including Amazon Kindle Fire (but not standard Kindle).

[[http://archiveofourown.org/][ArchiveOfOurOwn]] allows users to download stories in the MOBI, EPUB, PDF, and HTML formats.

[[http://www.fimfiction.net][FIMFiction]] allows users to download stories in the TXT, HTML, and EPUB formats.

When necessary, I use [[https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases][Sigil]] to convert HTML files to EPUB files. When possible, I use [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/crengine][Cool Reader]] to read EPUB files on my computer, phone, and (rarely) Nook device.

Note that PDF is /totally different/ from HTML/EPUB and MOBI. For most literature, the fixed layout of PDF is inferior to the dynamic layout of the other formats.
