I'd say I qualify as one of the aforementioned "serious ebook users", and I absolutely /hate/ having to turn PDFs into EPUBs (though Calibre is indeed the tool to use for this). Going from non-reflowable text (pdfs) to reflowable text (ebooks) is much more difficult that changing reflowable text formats, so I'm always very appreciative when content producers put out ebooks instead of just PDFs.

I'd say go with EPUB because it's the open standard for ebooks. The only reason ebooks ever come in other formats is when platforms like amazon have their own proprietary format or for DRM purposes which still wont stop anyone who knows what they're doing.

That said, some people really like pdfs for whatever reason, even when the content is just text without any fancy formatting, so though I personally stay away from pdfs when possible, it wouldn't do to ignore the pdf-people.
