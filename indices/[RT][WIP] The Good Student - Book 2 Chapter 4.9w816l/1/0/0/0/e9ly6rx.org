At first I thought Nic's whole "I'm an unperson" shtick was a mentality Nic was "brought up" to be by Dizzy's father or some other character. Preparing him for a possession like his current mind-sharing with Roke, or something similar.

While I do generally enjoy how calm he is in crazy situations, lack of obvious personal growth for the main character of a story does make it less interesting to read.
