I have to ask this, because maybe I'm just forgetting or not realizing it.

Can anyone please give me some examples of character growth from the MC? SO much has happened in the story - major world changing, and life changing events that our MC is at the center of, and yet, I can't for the life of me see anything different from his iteration in the beginning of book 1 right after he arrived at the school. He still comes across as the bumbling introvert who can't seem to stand up for himself. Maybe I'm being too harsh or overlooking things, but that's what I'm hoping to fix by asking.
