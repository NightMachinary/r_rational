It's rather subtle but I believe it is there.

He started off being an off-handed "my opinion doesn't matter, it's what the scorers believe that counts" and then he gets dumped and starts actually getting emotional and letting himself be personally invested in things. He's turning from an emotionless husk to an actual character with his own opinions and values.

He's a very repressed boy. Reminds me of the protagonist of the Johnny Maxwell series by Pratchett.
