Huh, hadn't really considered that carnism would be an issue. I'll put that on my radar for consideration on rewrite as well.

I've been intentionally avoiding having a pet/familiar, both because of the age limitations on types and because it seems like almost every author wants to hand out dire wolves and giant cats like candy.

I was considering something for arc two, so I'll sketch it in that in as a definitive addition to the second arc.

Thanks for the feedback, too! Can't improve if no one points stuff out lol.
