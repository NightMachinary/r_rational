Absolutely!

I actually found this subreddit recently by searching for mentions of my story (as I imagine most authors do to ensure no one is stealing their work) and found that a member here had already recommended it once.

Then I started reading through the forum and was amazed at so many like-minded folks in one place. I'm not normally a person who explores reddit, or visits it much, so it makes sense why I hadn't come across it before, but I feel like I fit in already.

Wizard's Tower meets four out of five of the requirements in the about section of this /rational, with the fifth only not being met because the climax of the story (or first arc of the story in this case) hasn't yet been posted.

The story is told from a first person POV with a heavy emphasis on world building and internal thought processes. I have tried to subtly (and sometimes blatently) describe those thought processes in a way that demonstrates both his internal conflicts between logic and emotion AND just how often he lies to himself.

The main character is a centuries old half-elf wizard raised in a human kingdom where he has outlived everyone he's known. He's determined to build a tower in the middle of nowhere to escape the chains of social obligation so that he can focus on creating a longevity spell to remedy that.

And, of course, fate conspires against him.

If that's not sufficient grounds to convince you that Wizard's Tower is worth checking out, then I have only one other method I would like to use at this time: Please?
