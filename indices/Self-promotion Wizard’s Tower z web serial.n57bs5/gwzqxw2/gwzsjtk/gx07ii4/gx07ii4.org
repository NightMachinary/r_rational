I am liking the story so far but I am confused about the [Class] system. So once you level up to 100 you can advanced your class tier and obtain a myriad of benefits. It was talked about how very beneficial that a tier 2 mage picked a third tier geomancer class since they are very useful and not typically held in the front lines. But from what I read so far the magic system is not directly tied with the [Class] system. People can learn different Magic's not tied to a [Class].

So what are the benefits of a [Class]? Do they even provide skills or it is just a label system from the Elven goddess of knowledge? When someone becomes a [Mage] and learns the ice manipulation skill did they learn it from the [Mage] class granting it or did they read a tome and learned the ice manipulation skill the hard way? Is the [Mage] class simply a label?

We have seen many different classes such as [Wagoneers], [Logger], [Administrator], [Guard], [Bandit], and [Ranger]. But not once have we seen any of these people with these classes use any skills. If I was a [Wagoneer] pitching my services to a 200 year old grumpy half-elven client I would probably bring up my skills saying I have the [Smooth ride] skill or the like. This leads me to believe that the [Class] system is just highly advanced labler. But, we see the MC use the Analyze skill to people in order to see their class distinction. Was that actually a general class skill or was that a spell learnt from a tome?

The only class skill I saw that can't be explained being a magic spell or learnt from a tome was when the [Paladin] used a truthseeking skill. It was actually the first time we seen a skill being used other than spells slung by mages. But I guess it could be divine magic or a talent from his god since class skills seem to not exist.

The MC dives really deep on some philosophical aspects of the class system and even told stories of people endlessly grinding chasing levels. But I don't see the benefit of people chasing levels. Do you actually get stronger from leveling up by gaining some sort of stat? Maybe leveling up grants your body more capable of intaking ambient mana? Or once again is it just arbitrary?

I am really enjoying this novel and I hope it expands more on the [Class] system/levels and how the world generally works with it. I hope class skills are actually a thing because it would make more sense that a class system with tiers and levels should provide some sort of benefit other than showing society you are above them. Other than that some of these classes did not have the famous [Brackets] over them in earlier chapters such as [Gardener], [Servant], [Guard], and [Innkeeper]. As a fan of the novel the Wandering Inn, I felt abashed that the Innkeeper did not seem to deserve the [Class] distinction lol.
