I finally caught up to the current chapter I'm really enjoying the story so far. The main character is interesting, the base building is creative, and you have somehow avoided all the things I dislike about LitRPGs on Royalroad so far.

I thought the explanation for dungeons was a great touch. Just a few sentences of consistent backstory on why the different game like elements exist makes a huge difference for worldbuilding.
