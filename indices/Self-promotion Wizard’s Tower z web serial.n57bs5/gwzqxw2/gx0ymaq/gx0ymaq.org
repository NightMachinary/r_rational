I'm quite enjoying the story. Caught up and favorited.

I like the slow burn, and the politics are setting up to be interesting. The cantankerous wizard is a great trope and we hardly ever get their perspective. I actually also really like Lilly. She's going to have to deal with the harsh realities of her world at some point.

Thanks for the story, and I'll keep reading if you keep writing.
