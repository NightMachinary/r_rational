That's actually intentional in a lot of places throughout the draft. It's something that other authors do, as well as a common recommendation from creative writing places.

That being said, if you are still reading it and something is causing you to lose the immersion, I'd like to hear about that in the comments.

If you aren't reading it, then I'd like to thank you for taking the time out to try it.
