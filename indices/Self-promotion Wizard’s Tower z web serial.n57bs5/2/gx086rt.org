I've enjoyed catching up with this story, subscribed for future updates.

My only comment is that despite bad things happening/other people's manipulation attempts, a lot of the problems have been very easily dealt with. This makes sense for an OP wizard with his experience and history, but it leaves a slightly unscratched itch. Not sure if any of that makes sense, sorry
