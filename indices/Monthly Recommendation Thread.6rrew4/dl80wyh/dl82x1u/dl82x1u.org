I think it went downhill with the rest of Cracked.com a couple years ago, but I still love this show's analysis of pop culture and society through the lens of pop culture. The only videos I don't like are where they try to deconstruct a story, character, or genre without considering what the appeal of it is so it comes across as condescending towards the people who like it.
