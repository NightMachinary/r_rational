I recently finished reading the webcomic [[http://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/always-human/1-i-guess-thats-why-i-admire-her/viewer?title_no=557&episode_no=1][Always Human]]. It's a lesbian romance set in a (post-singularity?) future where people use nanotech to modify their appearance. The main character gets into a relationship with a girl who has an autoimmune condition that prevents her from using mods. The romance is cute, the art is beautiful, and there's also nice music accompanying each chapter.

I also found a funny Ore Gairu fic called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12596369/1/My-Tinder-Experience-is-about-as-Genuine-as-I-Expected][My Tinder Experience is about as Genuine as I Expected]]. It's about Hikki making a Tinder account.
