You didn't give Always Human enough credit. I'm four chapters in and I'm already impressed by how introspective the characters are. I loved the conversation in the park where they bare all their feelings and discuss them so matter of factly, bringing up the possible reasons why they feel the way they do and responding to them logically, it's very refreshing. I haven't fallen in love with their chemistry yet, but I'm definitely interested in seeing where the character development goes.
