Sure. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5my85i/mk_my_transdimensional_overpowered_protagonist/][Here's]] a link to a munchkin-y Oregairu/Danmachi crossover I posted here a while ago.

Also, more generally, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/3t9t7g/whats_the_best_fanfic_youve_ever_read/cx4n9u7/][here's]] a list of some of my favorite fics that I recced earlier. Sadly some of them are dead now, though.

Also, not on the list and more dark than funny (though there is still quite a lot of good humor), but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo][Fargo]] is one of the best Madoka Magica fics out there, and is set in America.
