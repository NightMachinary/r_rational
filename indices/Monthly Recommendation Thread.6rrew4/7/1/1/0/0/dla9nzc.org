Well, your response makes me like you more, even if it doesn't make me want to watch the show. :) I just feel that if he wanted to help people, and he was told he couldn't be a superhero barring some miracle, then he should have found one of the zillion ways to help people that aren't being a superhero. Of course, it's a show, so we know there will be a miracle, but in real life that doesn't happen. He should have been depicted pursuing some other dream and then getting wrenched back onto the path of being a superhero. That would have made me like him more.
