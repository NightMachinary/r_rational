  If you want a straight up action show about an underdog protagonist, My Hero Academia gives us an intelligent and big-hearted teen becoming a superhero despite not having conventional powers. It's a bit like Worm, except that every situation turns out okay and the characters have a lot more fun. People are calling it the next Naruto and it's been a blast so far so see a distinct yet familiar take on the superhero genre from a shonen.

On your recommendation, I went through the entire thing (manga, not anime, since I dislike watching things). This rules. I see why people are calling it the next Naruto; a lot of the story beats/character notes are extremely reminiscent. That said, the characters are /far/ more interesting, I get the sense that the author actually has some sort of coherent worldbuilding ideas, and I love our protagonist. He's everything Gryffindor should be.

Thank you for the rec!
