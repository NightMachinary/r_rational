I give you, anime! Btw, the English dub for all these shows are fantastic.

I recently watched /Gurren Lagaan/ and it might be just what you're looking for. It's a straightforward but totally nuts Hero's Journey epic about a kid piloting a mecha with drill-themed shapeshifting powers that's fueled by his self-confidence. It starts off as a very simple episodic adventure series, but the story goes /all the way/ with its conceits and intentionally adheres to cliches like DBZ-esque escalating power levels. It's a more than a little mindless, but it works.

If you want a straight up action show about an underdog protagonist, /My Hero Academia/ gives us an intelligent and big-hearted teen becoming a superhero despite not having conventional powers. It's a bit like Worm, except that every situation turns out okay and the characters have a lot more fun. People are calling it the next Naruto and it's been a blast so far so see a distinct yet familiar take on the superhero genre from a shonen.

If you're looking for something more subdued and relaxing, I recommend /Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid/. The protagonist is pretty damn rational, the story focuses on characters with almost familial relationships, and there's a reoccurring theme of how things could go wrong but don't. It's a slice of life show so the "rising high and crushing everything" comes in the form of achieving satisfaction in mundane life rather than from an epic adventure, but I still think it's worth checking out.
