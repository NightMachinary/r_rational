I've been watching [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5CC44F2C10A8415C]["Cracked: After Hours"]] lately, and while it's far from the obscure sort of thing you might want from a recommendation thread, I'd suggest giving it a shot. Each video is five to ten minutes of four friends/colleagues sitting around a table talking to each other about pop culture, examining weird aspects of movies and television in a way that I would think would resonate with this subreddit.

It's sort of like listening in on friends having a conversation with each other, but with more research, better writing, and better timing.
