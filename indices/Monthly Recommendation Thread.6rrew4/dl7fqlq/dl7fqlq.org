/[[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76664][A Spell for Chameleon]]/ (the first book in [[https://www.goodreads.com/series/40498][the /Xanth/ series]]) was somewhat interesting to read. It's based on the premise that, in a particular isolated part of the world (which looks suspiciously similar to Florida), every human is born with a supernatural power, whose potency may vary widely:\\
- Can create a cloud of poisonous gas\\
- Can transform a living being that he can see within six feet of himself into a different living being\\
- Can project his voice perfectly\\
- Can create and control storms and wind, large and small\\
- Can create simple holograms while concentrating\\
- Can create magnificently-detailed, semi-permanent illusions capable of fooling all the senses

I found the setting significantly more interesting than the plot, though. I definitely can see why this book was listed in [[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/bibliography.html][the bibliography]] for /[[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/powers/][GURPS Powers]]/!
