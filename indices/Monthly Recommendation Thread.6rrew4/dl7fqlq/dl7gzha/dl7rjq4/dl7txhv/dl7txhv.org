You're allowed to like it. Just because the book is unenlightened doesn't say anything about you. Or much, anyway, ha.

Still think the setting was pretty uninteresting, too, though. Not much thought of second-order effects...society didn't seem to have changed much given that everyone has magical superpowers. There's a lot better worldbuilding out there, even if you like that particular conceit.
