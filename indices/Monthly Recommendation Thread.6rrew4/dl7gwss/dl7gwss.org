I'm going to recommend the currently airing anime (and manga) [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/34599/Made_in_Abyss&ved=0ahUKEwiCmpGMycDVAhVqw4MKHWHBAZYQFgiPATAb&usg=AFQjCNFRKXw5p-pJQtEr7A6aJSyaCl9Jtw][/Made in Abyss/]]. The wordbuilding/creature designs are kickass, the characters are likeable, and the plot intruiging.

TL;DR the characters are exploring a (not quite) bottomless pit with its own bizzare flora and fauna.

It reminds me a lot of the [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_(novel][/Tunnels/]] YA novels series, which I also reccomend.
