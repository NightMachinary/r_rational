I want to recommend the [[https://www.amazon.com/Dire-Saga-Season-One-ebook/dp/B01N53O0W7/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1501976948&sr=8-6&keywords=dire+saga][Dire Saga]].

The main character is a female anti-villain Doctor Doom expy, and I for one found the series highly entertaining.

It also explores (or at least touches on) a couple of topics that I found highly unusual, and I would love to see what the [[/r/rational][r/rational]] community might make of it.

I've linked the compilation of the first three books, but the author recently published the fifth one. If he keeps up his writing speed, then the sixth one should come out early next year.
