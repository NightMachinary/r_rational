I've finished reading it, and as what the others have said, it starts out fun, but later on reaches DBZ power levels, causing the long, excruciatingly-detailed (like one paragraph per move) fight scenes to become extremely boring, because the reader already knows that everyone is effectively invincible and thus none of the attacks are actually meaningful.
