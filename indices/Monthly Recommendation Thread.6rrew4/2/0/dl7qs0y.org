I heard about this from [[http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw6UBKuaMyFAgvDW5iEhDNOPhck2i48vR][Digibro and Best Guy Ever's weekly videos/podcasts]] and am once again reconsidering my dubs only policy. I'm so worried that I'll end up having tunnel vision or read too slowly and get pulled out of the experience. I already know the show is slow-paced, but does that mean the dialogue is relatively slow and easy to follow?
