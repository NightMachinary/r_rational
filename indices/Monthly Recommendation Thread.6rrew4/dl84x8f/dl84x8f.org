I've been in kind of a shitty headspace for the last long while, and a lot of rational fiction I used to enjoy is just way too emotionally exhausting for me now, because the writers, quite justifiably, make things hard on their protagonists and force tough choices. I don't have the energy to cope.

So I'm here asking for some non-rational feel-good competence porn/protagonist rising high and crushing everything stories. To illustrate with stuff that I've seen in other rec threads: the fanfic /Seventh Horcrux/, web fiction /Everybody Loves Large Chests/ and /The Bound Dungeon/, and the xianxia novel series /Cradle/ by Will Wight.
