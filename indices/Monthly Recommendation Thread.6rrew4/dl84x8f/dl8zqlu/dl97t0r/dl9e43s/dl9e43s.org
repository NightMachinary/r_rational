I don't /love/ Midori, but I liked seeing him follow his dream because he wants to help people. Seeing him get told that he isn't cut out for it was heartbreaking, while watching him continue to try his hardest anyway and inspire others to take action felt good to watch.

This show isn't all that rational even if the powers are consistent and the characters are clever, but I find the story it tells emotionally satisfying. Superheroes are an escapist fantasy and I like the way MHA delivers on that fantasy without coming across as pandering.

After the first couple episodes we also see that Midori has more than just heart as an asset, he has the commitment to push himself physically, and the brains to perform complex problem-solving. He is capable of being a hero, he just wasn't given the chance to prove himself at first.
