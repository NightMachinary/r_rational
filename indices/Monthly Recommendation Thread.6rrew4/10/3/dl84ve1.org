I think it goes through the usual life cycle of those stories where the main character has a cheat-like ability and gets stronger rapidly. At the start it's fun, you're willing to overlook the necessary BS, but eventually it starts to collapse under the fact that the reader doesn't really care very much. If you're fine with that, then go for it.
