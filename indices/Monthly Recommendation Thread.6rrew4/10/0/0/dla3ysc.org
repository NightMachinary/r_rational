I felt the same way about TGWP. I hadn't watched more than the first season of RWBY and had read a bit of The Gamer and I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of The Games We Play. Later on it started slowing down quite a bit with the super-long fight descriptions; but I still liked it overall. It does a great job of expanding the universe.

Anecdotally, it was really interesting for me to go from reading TGWP and RWBY fan fiction from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran][Coeur Al'Aran]], to actually watching the rest of the RWBY series. As said, I only completed the first season of RWBY before I went on a binge of fan fiction based around it; so it felt really weird to see characters I "know" from the fics and what they were actually like in the real series. Led to a bit of dissonance when characters like Adam and Rowan were so completely different in the fics from the actual show!
