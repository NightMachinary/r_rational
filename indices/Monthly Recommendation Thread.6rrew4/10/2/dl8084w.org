It's a thing? Very polarizing, to stay the least. I enjoyed it, but it's not rational or anything. It's technically on hiatus, but it's been that way for a long time, and since season 3 of RWBY came out (They're working on five now so it was a while ago) it's been disconnected completely from "canon". Though I mean it kinda brought that down upon itself.
