  Is The Games We Play good? I'm a bit wary of all The Gamer crossovers.

I was thoroughly and absolutely addicted to the series, even though I hadn't watched/read any part of either source works at the time. The author is a pretty good writer and the background is explained well. I wouldn't say it's rational, because the main hook are abilities that break MC's world and sort of run on narrativium, but the MC still manages to use them creatively and they don't get too broken until the end.

  What's it current status (ongoing/dropped/finished)?
#+end_quote

Speaking of the end, the author's sig used to say "I got 99 stories but I've finished two!" but I don't agree with the change to "three" when the author took a break from this story. Throughout much of the story, some questions are brought up and when you expect to finally get some kind of answer, you really don't, you're just left with some wishy washy promise of maybe answers in the future and explanations of some side things that aren't really central to the plot. I'd say it's a decent halfway point but I don't see how it's an ending. The author did publish a one-chapter preview of the next "book" a few months ago but I didn't really think much of it and there hasn't been anything else since AFAIK.

Having said all that I do recommend it and think of it as worm's little brother when it comes to the world of crackfic that I'm familiar with. Just don't go in expecting it to be rational or expecting everything to be tied up neatly in a bow at the end and I think you'll like it.
