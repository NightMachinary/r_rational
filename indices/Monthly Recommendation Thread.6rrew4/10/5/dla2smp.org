I enjoyed it thoroughly. So much so that canon rwby was incredibly disappointing and boring and the other fics I've read of it seem far less vibrant and real.

I didn't finish it, I got to the end of where the book had gotten and the power creep was a serious thing, but it was such an excellent story. I'm considering re reading now that you've put a link together.
