Hmmm i really have a bone to pick with the wandering inn as in i completly hate the main characters. Canst stand them as a reader and they are annoying. Especially the runner girl but erin still comes fairly close.

In terms of other stories i dont know if they are rational per se but Void domain The Zombie Knight The Gods are Bastards ( i especially would like the opinion on this one as i would think it really fits here)
