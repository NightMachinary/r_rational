  Especially the new class was kinda meh for me.

Same. I like Maureen because gnomes are awesome, but the rest just left me wishing we'd focus back on the sophomores instead.

  My favourite character is the bishop guy from the thieves guild/church.

Same here. Antonio Darling is like... a moral Littlefinger from Game of Thrones, with a combination Rogue and Cleric class from D&D. He's my favorite too; and I like his party members (Joseph P. Jenkins in particular is fascinating, and Brother Ingvar is intriguing too). His story, and that of the sophomore class, is what really carries the plot for me. The other story lines can be interesting, but I don't get absorbed in them as easily.

  In terms of the zombie knight.... typical shonen problem

Yeah, that exactly describes my problem with it later on. Early on the writing just bothered me. IIRC, the writing for the first few chapters was basically just dialogue and no description. Even after that it feels like it focuses more on telling than showing (if that makes sense?).

I also had the impression that the author didn't know what he wanted to write at first, and that's why he's changing the plot. Like at the beginning, regular people didn't know servants existed. But later on we find out that there are thousands or tens or thousands around the world, some countries are run by people hundreds of years old, and they're constantly creating catastrophic events. There's NO WAY regular people wouldn't know about these folks, or not figure out that something crazy was going on. Their actions are disruptive on a transnational, if not global, scale. It's like how ridiculous Pokemon is when you start - there's no way Ash walks down the road and doesn't know what a Pidgey is. It introduces the concept to the audience through a method that makes no sense in-universe.
