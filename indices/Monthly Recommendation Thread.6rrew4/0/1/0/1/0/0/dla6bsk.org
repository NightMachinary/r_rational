funny thing you talk about when the author of "The Zombie Knight" made an announcement that he is coming out of hiatus he said himself that he didnt know how he wanted the story to go on.

On the topic of TGAB i complately agree. The conflict between the bishop and pope, the first class of kids and arachne is what carried the webnovel for me. Also the mother of the paladin girl joining the religion and all was kinda interesting but it still played in the whole religious war plotline. and please excuse me not knowing the names of the cast as i read it a loooooooooooooong time ago.
