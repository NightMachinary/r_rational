This was one comes up every once in a while. IIRC, the author didn't set out to make it rational, but it has some characteristics of it. People tend to love it or hate it - I'm in the "love it" camp, personally. It feels like a nice contrast to a sprawling web novel like Worm, where Worm is grimdark and the characters always end up having terrible things happen to them, while TGAB is lighter and though the characters go through tough times, they usually don't end up dead or maimed. Plus the characters in TGAB are just so darn likable - even the bad guys seem somewhat relatable.

But TGAB does have some things I don't like too. The first few volumes just seem "OK" to me; it takes a bit to get into them. The character list keeps growing exponentially, and since characters are hardly ever killed, this means there's an ever-expanding list to keep track of. I didn't care for the second-to-most-recent volume, since I'm primarily invested in the sophomore class and not just one member of them. And since there are so many volumes and it's still being released, it's tough to remember what happened so long ago without rereading the entire series, and that takes way too long. I've also heard some complaints from people that it's "too in-your-face about feminism," which I don't agree with, but it's cropped up a few times.

I'll admit; I read this a while back based on a number of people recommending it here and there, and I did not like it. I thought some of the issues, particularly the child abuse and depression faced by the main character, were interesting and fairly well-done; you don't usually see those issues in novels except as some background for how people overcame struggles. Whereas with Hector he was still very much facing the repercussions. So that was good. But the writing overall wasn't very good and it feels like the power system is expanded when convenient for the author. It's been a while since I caught up to the end, but last I recalled, some people could suddenly use some kind of ultra form which combined multiple powers, something that was said from the beginning to be impossible? That's kinda frustrating to me. Like, if the rule of the universe is "You only get to use one power," I'd much rather see creative uses of that one power than to suddenly introduce Super Saiyan forms. It just rubbed me the wrong way I guess.
