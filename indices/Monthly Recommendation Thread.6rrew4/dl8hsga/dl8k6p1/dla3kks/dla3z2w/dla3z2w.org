I need to say that i stopped reading both when i caught up to them and never restarted reading them as The zombie knight was on a LOOOOOOOOOOONG hiatus because author had a writers block and IRL shit to deal with. In terms of TGAB i just couldnt be bothered to see the new chapters. In terms of characters i agree the list is huge and you can forget some of them fairly quickly. Especially the new class was kinda meh for me. My favourite character is the bishop guy from the thieves guild/church.

In terms of feminism it was centairly really visible, especially so if there is a religion of feminism... but otherwise it wasnt that in your face.

In terms of the zombie knight.... typical shonen problem ...power escalation. I too would prefer if it would keep to the level of a guy in a knights armor walking down the streets. but hell...
