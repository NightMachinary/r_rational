I appreciate your compliments very much (YOU HAVE NO IDEA), but I need to clarify:

Cheela are not immortal, kind of the opposite, they live about 15 minutes. Unless they do that very risky rejuvenation that requires starvation and excessive muscle tone...

And civil engineering is pretty lady-friendly as engineering goes, not like I'm doing electrical/electronic. And I'm studying to be a dietitian, and I have not seen a single man doing the undergrad feeder degree (I'm sure they exist, but the men in my classes are all studying sports science or something else "manly"). So dietetics is probably even more womanly than engineering is manly, since my undergrad engineering courses were 20-30% women.
