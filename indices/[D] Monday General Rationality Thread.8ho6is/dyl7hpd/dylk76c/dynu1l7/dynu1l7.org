  (I also wonder what people here and adjacent communities look like -- selection bias aside, it feels like half the responses to questions about physical fitness feature off-season competitive bodybuilders, going by the stats)

I'm willing to bet that if we surveyed the fitness level of [[/r/rational]] and plotted it on a histogram, we'd have two distinct peaks:

1. Average pudgy academic/white-collar-worker
2. Bodybuilders

Group one for obvious reasons (we're jam-packed with white collar workers and academics), but group two's presence would be magnified (compared to the population as a whole) because, [[/r/rational]]'s primary userbase is males in their twenties (disproportionately likely to work out), and because we're more sensitive about health concerns as no doubt many of us hope to live to see immortality and/or the singularity (I certainly do). You can check [[/r/transhuman]] for corroboration; they're similarly concerned about health because they plan to be immortal.
