I've thought about this problem.

My take on it is that humanity is progressing and things are getting better. This is backed by some evidence, but you have to accept this as a fact before moving to my next thought.

Most of human history has not had the global knowledge that we currently do. Only until very, very, very recently have people been able to be so aware of all of the other things that are happening around the world. It is also true (again backed some evidence, but you can take this as the second assumption I am making) that Good things (up to you to define "good") are reported less than Bad things (again, you make the definition).

My conclusion is that because things have had an upward trend. And because bad things are reported more than good things. My (and maybe your) perception is pretty skewed.

So, what do we do to move forward? Well, we have history to draw upon. It turns out that by being a force of good locally, which is the main thing that humans do, because global presence is a new thing, the world gets better.

Now, there is a hidden assumption in here as well. That is my assumption that history and movements and big revolutions of any kind are not predicated on singular human beings but society reaching critical points, and then eventually there is a single human being that we tend to push, to some extent, the narrative change upon.

So, I think that if I am, generally, on a local level, a Good person, who is helpful and productive and tries, suffering is reduced.

It is even better to do more, of course, but I don't think you are necessarily correct in your perception regarding all of the suffering you are viewing and what that means.

Hopefully, even if you do not agree, this helps in some small way. Feel free to challenge anything I said, as I am still learning my own way of trying to understand what my position actually means in the world and what compulsions I should try to meet because of that.

Also, I am 29, white, live in California, and I work as a freelance contractor in live broadcast.
