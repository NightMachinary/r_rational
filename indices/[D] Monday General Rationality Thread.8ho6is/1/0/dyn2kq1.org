That was an interesting read, but it is no longer relevant to me because I have regained the privilege of not feeling constant anxiety over the constant suffering that morals, cultural norms, and biases are causing.

I have decided that I am better off simply not participating in arguments with people, regardless of how important I consider the disagreement to be, and restrict myself to associating with people who share my morals. It makes me feel more secure and self confident.

Having the privilege to not think about all the evil things that hurt people who lack my social support, economic standing, and cultural inertia of being born white has made me much happier at the expense of others who lack my privileges.

I have reduced the amount of news I consume to the bare minimum that I require to stay informed because I have chosen not to be worried about whether fascists and narcissists will kill and abuse people who I don't know personally.

Edit: I may not have made it clear enough that I do not think that I am being morally virtuous by doing this, as I have decided the best thing I can do about evil in myself and the world is “don't think about it”.
