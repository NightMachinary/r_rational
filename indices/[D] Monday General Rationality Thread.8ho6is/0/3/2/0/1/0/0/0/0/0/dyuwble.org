I try :P

Wow, time does fly! It's insane. And I got so much done in that year too. I hope you did too!

Don't worry about my boss, in a month I get my 3 months' paid leave, so if I quit I have a good amount of runway. And there's an opportunity that is at a big step up for me that I'm going to apply for. Probably won't get it, but there's always a chance, and the feeling of hope is the main thing.
