I'm not sure what the right lesson was. I had thoroughly rationalized that everyone everywhere is suffering, I was allowing others to experience more suffering than I was just by living the way I do, and there was nothing I could do about it even if I wasn't afraid of risking what I do have.

I don't know how I can hate myself less without feeling less empathy towards others, so I've decided to just act like a person who does without constantly thinking about what other people are going through. It's easier on myself if I only think about my moral actions as performative.

That's not something I want other people to do, I feel like I should be ashamed for doing it at all, but I don't see any other way to not be so self righteous that I hate myself for all the sins I've committed besides accepting that I am selfish enough to hold onto my undeserved privileges.
