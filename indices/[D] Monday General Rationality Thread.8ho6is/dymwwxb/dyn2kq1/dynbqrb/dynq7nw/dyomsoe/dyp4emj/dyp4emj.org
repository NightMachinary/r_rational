That's how I felt before events like #MeToo revealed how many ways people are suffering today that I had never realized because of my privileged position as a white man (since then I came out as genderfluid). That means that more pain exists now and has always existed throughout history than I had ever imagined, specifically because of abuse and discrimination by people very much like me.

I believe that simply having been raised in that environment has lead to me thinking prejudiced thoughts that I don't know are prejudiced and that simply thinking them is inherently harmful to others, but they have been so deeply engrained by culture that I can't stop thinking them even when I notice them. It doesn't matter how much self loathing that causes me because that pain is nothing compared to what the victims have gone and are going through.

I have not been convinced that view is inaccurate and I am not especially interested in having it dispelled because it motivates me to be vigilant against evil within myself and in others. I do not think I can understand what disadvantaged people have gone through and that means I doubt I can truly feel empathy for them, so that leaves self hatred incurred by moral debt to motivate me.

That was clearly an unhealthy state of being that resulted in crippling depression and was probably related to anxiety from my financial situation. I was afraid of becoming impoverished and losing the privileges I had, but I still had it way better than so many others who live whole lives feeling this way so I should loathe myself for ever being so privileged to not know that. Now I have regained financial security and the anxiety and depression are gone.

I still believe all the same things I did before, but now I've stopped thinking about all the sins I have and am still committing just by living this way. I believe doing this is immoral, but I'm selfish enough to care more about my personal happiness than doing the most good. I was already failing to live up to my moral code, I just don't feel constant shame and self loathing anymore for failing. I think all that self inflicted pain is completely justified, but I stopped doing it and am okay with that.
