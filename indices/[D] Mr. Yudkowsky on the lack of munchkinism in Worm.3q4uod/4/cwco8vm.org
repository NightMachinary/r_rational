Ok, so Richter, Accord, and Bonesaw explicitly have (and spend much of the story working to overcome - well, substitute Dragon for Richter) shard-induced psychological limitations.

Panacea's /whole character/ is devoted to delivering the moral that an absurdly broken power is no use if you're a twit; so yeah, obviously she could be a god /if she wasn't a twit/. (For what it's worth, I think she's unrealistically bad at using her power, but then I also subscribe to the theory that her Shard was messing with her.)

Number Man and Countessa basically do rule the world. Tattletale, the Yangban, and Teacher explicitly /made/ their own bids for power; I think it's reasonably clear that their powers aren't that great, especially when you take into consideration that there are other people with powers out there opposing attempts to take over the world.

Leets power is ... variable in strength.

Eidolon, Glastig and Dinah believe, correctly or incorrectly, that there are bigger fish to fry than ruling the world.

I don't know, I was actually quite impressed by the levels of thought displayed in Worm. Not everyone is a "munchkin", exactly, but they do seem to have devoted a level of thought to their ability that you'd expect from someone whose day job is using that power.
