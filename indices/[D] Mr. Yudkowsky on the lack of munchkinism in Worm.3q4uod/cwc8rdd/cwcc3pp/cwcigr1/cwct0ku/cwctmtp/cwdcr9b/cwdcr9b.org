In some other stuff he wrote, he made it pretty clear that HPMOR takes place in a universe where complicated plans are much more likely to work than in the real world. He doesn't think he could take over the world if he wanted to, he just thinks that a Quirrel who made the same choices he would would be more able to take over the HPMOR world. As a matter of fact, that point is made in the paragraph directly before the one quoted. He lives in a world much harder to optimize than the one Quirrel lives in.

Imagine that HPMOR was instead a story about a power struggle in a kingdom of two foot tall gnomes that grant power to the person with the most martial prowess. Quirrel is a giant, at four feet tall. Eliezer comments that if Quirrel were as large as him, he would have an easier time of it. However, Eliezer is very aware of the fact that the real world isn't populated entirely by two foot tall gnomes who grant political power to the person most capable of beating them up, so of course he can't seize power in the real world simply by virtue of being taller than Quirrel.

Quirrel exists in a world with different constraints that the one Eliezer lives in. The fact that Eliezer believes he would have advantages over Quirrel in that other environment does not mean he also believes he could do what Quirrel does in that other environment in our world. Eliezer selectively crippled Quirrel's ability to think, in order to prevent him from being too gamebreaking. So, a non crippled version of Quirrel would necessarily be more intelligent than the actual Quirrel, and Eliezer can't be less intelligent than a fictional person who exists entirely in his head, as Quirrel can't think up a clever plan or solution that Eliezer couldn't also think up.

In summary, Eliezer is correct when he says he is smarter than Quirrel. He actually expressly states that that fact doesn't mean he could do the sorts of thing that Quirrel can. You are attributing to him a belief he doesn't hold. There is actually a reason why being as smart as Quirrel doesn't mean he could take over this universe as easily as Quirrel could take over his, intelligence goes farther in the HPMOR world. And Eliezer knows that.

Sorry if this seems a little combative, I just really don't like it when people get ridiculed for beliefs they don't hold. It's also possible I drastically misread the tone of your comment, in which case I apologize.
