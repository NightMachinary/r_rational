  Y'know, most people are- via revealed preference- unhappy with their friends and relatives dying, and a lot of people are unhappy in their jobs, and a lot of people are unhappy with the amount of wealth they have.

Firstly: revealed preferences are almost always /irrational/, reflectively non-coherent "preferences". Secondly: all real agents are boundedly rational. Just because you, with your budget constraints and information, can think of something they can do that is much greater than what they actually do, doesn't mean /they/ can think of it, or that it lies within /their/ budget constraints and information.

This is why we have education instead of "Everyone just be smart now!".

And finally, yes, a lot of people don't want to be /overlords/, or even particularly (socially) powerful, and many actually feel an active discomfort with (social) power, or often with a broad class of social interactions.
