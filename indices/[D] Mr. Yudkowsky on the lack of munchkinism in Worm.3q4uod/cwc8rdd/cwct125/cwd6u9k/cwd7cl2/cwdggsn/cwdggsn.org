If you are talking about body reaction - that's just unfortunate side effect, and benefits of love usually outweigh it. So /plan/ to fall in love isn't irrational.

If they don't outweigh, that's the case of doing it wrong.

Every time I use words "rational" or "logic", first response (with one exception) is always "So, you are soulless emotionless robot without ability to love?". Sick of that.
