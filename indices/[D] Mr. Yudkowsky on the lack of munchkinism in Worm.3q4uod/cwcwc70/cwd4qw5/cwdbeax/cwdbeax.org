I disagree. I think seeing things from Taylor's perspective leads one to buy more into her character as the reason for victory.

Pretty sure she wasn't the only person doing this. In fact, her decisions in many cases didn't really help because the people who knew better weren't jumping in for a reason.

In fact,in many ways she did just really bumble about. The whole "go to jail" thing is a prime example, a complete miscalculation based on what information she did have but she doesn't see it because she wants to be a martyr.

Taylor won because Wildbow stacked the deck in such a way as to help her win while rendering all her rivals for the victory ineffectual. Attributing it to dispositional factors and leaving out the situational ones is no bueno. And I don't just mean that on a Doylist level; see how that fight went, inside the story.

Contessa or Eidolon don't have less willpower than Taylor, they don't care less about the Earth than Taylor. She doesn't win because she conceived of a sacrifice they couldn't imagine. There is no level of brutality or hardheadedness that Taylor could discover and sink to where she wouldn't already see the evidence of Cauldron's passing.

She won precisely because 1- they failed and 2- they can't do as she does (and not because they're dumb or weak either). Eidolon going Khepri is an extinction-event of its own, and it never seemed necessary or possible...until it was too late and he had already lost, precisely /because/ he is stronger etc. (Scion never felt a similar need to just precog-kill Taylor, though he did fuck with her with it) . Not to mention that Wildbow sets up a situation where necessary bits of information are only available to Taylor once that has already happened.

Maybe, on a Doylist level, that was what Wildbow was going for (self-sacrifice is worth more than sacrificing others) but I'll take a harsher stance than usual and say that he just failed, completely.
