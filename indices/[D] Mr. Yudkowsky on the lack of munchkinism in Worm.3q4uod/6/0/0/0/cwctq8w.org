Eh, EY is quite self-aware, he knows that his behavior is non-optimal. I expect his advocacy of rationalism is aspirational, not prescriptive. Just because a goal is inherently unachievable doesn't make it useless to pursue; striving towards that goal can produce enormous benefit. I appreciate that he spends his time doing what he does, it benefits the world quite well enough. I'm just making a joke that's there to be made.
