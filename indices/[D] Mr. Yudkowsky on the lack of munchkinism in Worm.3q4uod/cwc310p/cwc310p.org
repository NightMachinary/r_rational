  You should have to go that far down the cape list to find one Munchkin

You're also forgetting that Worm isn't the best universe for munchkinry, by design. There are a few that can do it, but mostly it's far more limited than it'd seem.

You know a good universe for munchkinry? Irredeemable. In that universe powers are natural and you can follow them to their conclusions. If someone can warp space, with enough know-how you can use that to crush planets and solar systems. If someone is pulling a whole bunch of Superman-style shenanigans, they're probably more than just a flying brick and can learn to go beyond that.

Worm powers are artificial, sentient and /deliberately blackboxed and limited/. That sort of 'explosion-munchkinry" is not happening. People can and do use their powers rationally (Purity picks fights where her power is strongest, Jack uses Hookwolf as a vehicle for his power) but that's mostly what you'll get. Notice that Skitter is incapable of achieving explosion-munchkinry on her own, and she would have been even more hamstrung if two unrestricted capes weren't around for her to coopt. She was stuck with vanilla competence for the longest time.

And this exists also on a societal level. New capes are coming, they have powers that you may not have accounted for, good luck taking over the world. The list of people that can do it is probably smaller than you imagine. Leet especially is someone touted too much. He is after all a natural trigger, and the whole point is that they can be threats, even massive ones,but they are there to provide conflict. He's not allowed to do anything and everything. In fact, there's absolutely no guarantee that his powers don't bottom out relatively early. That's the benefit of shards as an explanation for powers: arbitrariness is now fine.

Then you have Endbringers, who can and will kill anyone getting out of hand and are engineered to be superior to just about any cape or any group of capes.

  Characters in Worm whose powers suffice to easily take over the world: Eidolon, Glaistig Ulaine, Panacea, Contessa, Bonesaw (instantly); and then Number Man, Dinah, Accord, Tattletale, Coil, Leet, Andrew Richter, Teacher, the Yang-ban... I've probably forgotten like half of them. I wonder if a prerequisite of a work generating an enormous quantity of fic is an enormous amount of untapped potential.

Some of these aren't even worth talking about tbh. "Taking over the world" is not really that important a goal for people in the know in Worm, for good reason. Why does Eidolon want to rule the world for twelve seconds (to someone with his potential lifespan)? Others just can't do it, Tattletale especially is a massive overestimation. As if the PRT doesn't have its own whole division of Thinkers.

Worm deliberately shapes the world such that all the powers that can't be contained are more concerned with other things, or outright dead. I think it's generally quite thorough to the point of being hamfisted on this.

Contessa is, imo, the biggest break-down point, which is ironic because she holds things together a bit (why did GU go to the Birdcage? Why isn't Bonesaw creating a zombie plague? Contessa is the final line of defense). She's so strong her limits aren't as good at justifying why she doesn't do certain things, unlike other characters.

Also, you should have trouble reading Worm fanfiction about Panacea because they generally suck. Certain characters make better canon characters than fanfiction characters. See also: Coil.
