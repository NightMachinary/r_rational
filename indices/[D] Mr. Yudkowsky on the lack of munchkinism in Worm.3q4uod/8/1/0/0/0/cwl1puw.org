Bill Gates was incredibly important in the /early/ personal computer world, first as the co-author (with Allen) of BASIC for the MITS Altair 8800, and then in the early expansion stage when Microsoft sold the standard BASIC for not just the whole Altair-based S-100 ecosystem, but the TRS-80 ("Level II Basic"), Apple II series ("Applesoft Basic"), Commodore machines, and the IBM PC.

Assassinate the baby Gates, and you butterfly the first half-decade of the personal computer all out of recognition, and who knows what then happens. A world that's a lot more Datapoint 2200 and a lot less Homebrew Computer Club could have a lot of knock-on effects on the "home computer" category and the adoption of computers in K-12 education, and subsequently, for example, on uptake of the Internet in the home.
