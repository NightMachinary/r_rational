Wall Of Text warning.

I think we're talking past each other here. You are talking about individual apps and components. I am talking about the bigger picture - the actual presence of non-research machines in places of business and government.

Windows consolidated the hardware market into a (mostly) common architecture. Apple had a small market share. At about the same time that Windows 3.x emerged, it was fairly clear that Microsoft was building a stable platform, and that hardware manufacturers were falling into a common architecture.

This made computers FAR less scary to businesses and government for everyday operations. As people who were making purchasing and staffing decisions saw the computer software and hardware markets consolidating, they recognized that there was less risk that what they bought today would be useless tomorrow. As more and more software was designed to operate in the Windows environment, there was less concern about a new company creating a better program on a different operating system.

Without that quickly-growing market of companies and governments buying computers because they were looking like good investments instead of risky, strange toys, there would have been far less collaboration, because there would have simply been far fewer computers. That said, computerized collaboration would certainly have happened anyway, but I'm confident it would have happened much more slowly without Microsoft, or some other company dominating the market like Microsoft did.

You need to remember that open source software is something that geeks like. Most people who do not self-identify as a computer geek don't want anything to do with open source software. Time-consuming learning curves and fiddly code settings are not attractive.

Now, as you say, the internet is growing to become more important for day-to-day operations. I agree 100% with this part of what you are saying. For some people and businesses, the hardware in their hands is nothing more than a bridge to the hardware on the internet. We would have gotten here without Microsoft, eventually, I think, but it would have been a much longer and more painful path.

Bear with me here for a minute, I'm leading up to something. I am 44. Barely old enough to remember a world without personal computers. I used Apple IIE's in my last year of elementary school, and went to college with an Apple IIC. I can remember when hard drives were first implemented. I remember being amazed by the huge amount of data I could put on a 3.5" floppy.

I can also remember when all groceries had paper tags on them, cashiers keyed everything in by hand, and fast food restaurants were strictly cash. Businesses did NOT want early computers for everyday use. Mechanical typewriters were replaced with electronic typewriters. Mechanical cash registers were swapped with electronic cash registers. Computers existed in those days that could easily emulate both machines, but they were scary, newfangled things.

Seriously, businesses and governments were scared of computers back then, for everyday use. They were complex, confusing, and everything about them seemed to change yearly, if not more often. Microsoft brought stability, even if they broke a lot of other things, and that's what businesses and governments want. Stability. It's hard to generate a five-year plan, when you can't predict your computer hardware and software expenses reliably.

Some businesses and governments stayed scared of computers for a long time. Examples:

Waffle House, a very large chain of restaurants that has been around for many decades, only started taking card payments about ten years ago. They only started using an electronic point of sale system about four years ago.

Clayton County Georgia Department of Motor Vehicles only started taking cards for registration payments five years ago. The Clayton County landfill is still cash-only when I take my trash there.
