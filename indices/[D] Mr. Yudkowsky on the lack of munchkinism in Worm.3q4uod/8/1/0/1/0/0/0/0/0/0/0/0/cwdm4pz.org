The numbers just say "it's popular". It doesn't say it's what lets people work together.

And what mechanisms do people generally use to collaborate? Email & web, even intranet is more HTTP access than CIFS these days. That's none of it Windows specific. The Windows specific parts are the content, and the only Windows based application that's best of class is Excel... and you don't need Excel to take part in that collaboration. Word and Power Point are horrible. The HTML editing part of Netscape Composer (the extended version of Navigator) is a far better editor and supported collaboration better than Word.

Collaboration happens /despite/ Windows.

The "near universal operating system" is the Internet.
