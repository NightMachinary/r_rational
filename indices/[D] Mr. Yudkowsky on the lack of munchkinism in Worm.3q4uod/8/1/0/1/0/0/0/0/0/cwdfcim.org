I am not applauding Microsoft credit for having ideas. I give them credit for implementing them, even if the implementation was cludgy and reluctant.

The environment that Microsoft developed in was a very scary environment, business-wise. One mistake or missed opportunity early on, and Microsoft might not exist today, for better, or worse.

Very few companies are true innovators, but at the same time, most companies prefer to use their own ideas when they are of near-equivalent perceived value of other ideas. Especially when patents and money are involved. Microsoft is no exception.

The fact that Microsoft chose to reluctantly absorb outside practices by purchasing companies, taking open source ideas, and even engaging in shady bullshit is one reason why they are as big as they are. They are one of the 'last men standing' /because/ they were willing to internalize enough outside ideas to remain relevant.

It might not be pretty, and you and I would have almost certainly done it differently, but we weren't in charge. It's very possible that without Microsoft, the PC boom would have been much slower to take off. Businesses might have hesitated longer before adopting computers enthusiastically. Too many choices tends to frighten some people. A common architecture allowed the manufacturing world to build computer components for x86 machines much more cheaply.

Does that mean that something special might have been lost along the way? Yes. Undoubtedly. I liked Netscape.
