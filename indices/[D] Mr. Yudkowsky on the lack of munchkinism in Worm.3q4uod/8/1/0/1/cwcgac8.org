By creating a monoculture that requires orders of magnitude greater resources to perform the same tasks than the /already existing/ nearly-universal API that he ended up having to emulate to succeed, that's harder to develop reliable software for than the competition, that has single-handedly created a rich and vibrant viral ecosystem by blurring the lines between components, and that, it turns out, is rarely required for companies, governments, and individuals to work together.

Actually, what most makes that possible is common APIs on a variety of operating systems on a network that he initially opposed. Windows adoption of internet protocols was slow and reluctant - Gates was all about local private LANs running proprietary protocols (NetBIOS, LAN Manager) linked together via online services (Microsoft Network) using telecom style protocols. If he'd been successful there, there would be no Reddit for us to be having this discussion on.

Apple? What does Apple have to do with it? Apple only became relevant after they gave up THEIR proprietary operating system and protocols and adopted an open-source based platform.
