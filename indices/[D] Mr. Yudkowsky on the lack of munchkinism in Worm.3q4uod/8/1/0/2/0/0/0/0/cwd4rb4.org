Not to nitpick, however you did say "zealots don't change the world", and I believe that they /do/ change the world, in this way, through other people.

Even by being wrong a zealot can change the world, if their error causes opposition to their ideas to become coherent and organized.

I think there's a big difference between "change the world" and "cause their vision to become reality exactly as they wanted".
