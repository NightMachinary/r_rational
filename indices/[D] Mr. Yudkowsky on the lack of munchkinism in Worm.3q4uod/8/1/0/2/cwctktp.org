Gate's maximalist attitude to copyright (cf [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists][Open Letter to Hobbyists, 1976]]) carried along with his success has done /enormous/ damage to the general purpose computation movement. If [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman][Stallman]] had pre-dated Gates, and his attitude of open-source, peer-reviewed, user-controlled software had prevailed over the MPAA and RIAA earlier (rather than Gates and to a lesser extent Jobs making common cause with them), I suspect that we would have advanced general computation by at least 10 years.

The Jobs/Wozniak dynamic could have played out differently too; Wozniak, like most highly creative hacker types, was not interested in preventing other people from doing what he did. Quite the opposite, the early Apple computers were extremely well documented. Wozniak understood that creativity is stimulated, not held back, by sharing. He wanted to see what other people did with his devices, in order to build better devices himself.

Copyright rewards /firstness/ not /bestness/. It enforces a mindset of scarcity and criminalizes a mindset of abundance.
