Forget about Apple. Really. Apple was never a competitor in business computing. It wasn't Apple versus MS-DOS, it was CP/M versus MS-DOS.

So long as you have Apple in the equation you're completely distracted by irrelevancies.

  The fact that they killed off whole product lines was part of the reason for the overall growth of the computing industry in business and government.

Business did NOT want to go with individual personal computers on individual user's desks. It was more expensive to support, it was more expensive to buy even with the relatively higher cost of individual shared computers. And it made collaboration harder.

Virtually every /real/ alternative to Windows (again, Apple wasn't ever in the race) was better. If pretty much any other player had won, everyone would have been better off. Comparing universes in which Microsoft won and those in which /any/ open business platform won, the non-Microsoft universe would be richer and have better tools on cheaper hardware. Only the IBM Mainframe Dystopia would have been worse.
