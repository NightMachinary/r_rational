  Windows consolidated the hardware market into a (mostly) common architecture. Apple had a small market share.

People keep talking about "Windows versus Apple". Apple wasn't even in the picture until the late '90s. Mac OS was a ghetto.

If you're talking about Apple II, then that was back when the big debate wasn't Mac versus Windows, it was MS-DOS vs CP/M... or even TRS-DOS and other proprietary CP/M knockoffs versus CP/M. By the time Windows was a viable platform the Apple II was dead.

Seriously, you're not anywhere near the same page as the stuff I'm talking about.

  We would have gotten here without Microsoft, eventually, I think, but it would have been a much longer and more painful path.

Seriously, Microsoft slowed things down. They basically killed whole product lines getting Office everywhere, and most of those were already interoperable and /better products/.
