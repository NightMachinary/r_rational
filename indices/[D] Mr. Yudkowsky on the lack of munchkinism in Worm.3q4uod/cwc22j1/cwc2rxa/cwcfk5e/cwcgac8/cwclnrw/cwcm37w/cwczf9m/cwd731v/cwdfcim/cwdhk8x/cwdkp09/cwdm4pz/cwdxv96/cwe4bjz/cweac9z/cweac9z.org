  People keep talking about "Windows versus Apple". Apple wasn't even in the picture until the late '90s. Mac OS was a ghetto.

Sorry, I meant Microsoft, not Windows. Microsoft and Apple were fighting for market share long before Windows existed. I was on the Apple side until I got a PC with MS-DOS 3.11 to replace my aging Apple IIc.

And you are correct, we are not on the same page here. I'm talking about worldwide computing infrastructure and the resulting attractiveness to businesses and governments which Microsoft helped to generate while it was reducing it's competition. You are talking about individual applications and components.

The fact that they killed off whole product lines was part of the reason for the overall growth of the computing industry in business and government. Remember that business and government generally do NOT appreciate lots of options, because that means they have to constantly evaluate all the possibilities.

When offered too many different plausible options in emerging tech, businesses and governments will sit tight and wait for the mergers and patent battles to start settling themselves before making a decision.
