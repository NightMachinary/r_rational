It's certainly possible that Apple will go mad, yes, but the point is that it took open systems to make them relevant. Microsoft uses open systems a lot more widely than is generally known, they've had a full UNIX implementation available since about 2000 and included in their enterprise platforms by default since Windows 7... you just have to know where to enable it.

People give Microsoft credit for all kinds of things they opposed and only reluctantly embraced. The current Microsoft ecosystem happened /despite/ their best efforts, and the equivalent would have happened with or without them... and it would be more efficient and cost effective without their monopoly.
