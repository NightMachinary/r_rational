Microsoft, as a corporation, had to make an income for it's employees and stockholders. Sure, Mr. Gates was making money hand over fist too, but it seems rational to me to support the people who have invested in, or work for, your company. You can't do that without income. In every emerging market, there are always cutthroat tactics. Some examples: Railways. Automobiles. VCR's. Video cards. That was five seconds of brainstorming. I'm sure you can come up with a bunch on your own.

For a business to survive the cutthroat stage in a new industry, they have to find a niche, claim it, and defend it. Gates / Microsoft was very aggressive in doing this. Too aggressive in many cases.

In the end, there are two things that are forefront in my mind when considering Microsoft:

Failed companies to not innovate. Reluctantly embracing something is still embracing it.
