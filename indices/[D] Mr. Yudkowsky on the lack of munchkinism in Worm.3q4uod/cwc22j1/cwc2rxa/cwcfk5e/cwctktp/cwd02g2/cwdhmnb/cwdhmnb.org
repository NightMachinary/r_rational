  Stallman was never about open-source. In fact, he hates the word. Stallman has always been about free software, which has largely the same goal but isn't willing to compromise at all, or to indulge in marketing.

Stallman gets way more credit than he deserves, not just because it's other people who did the work, but also because the process he's given credit for was already happening before he had his hissy fit about someone releasing a proprietary version of Emacs.
