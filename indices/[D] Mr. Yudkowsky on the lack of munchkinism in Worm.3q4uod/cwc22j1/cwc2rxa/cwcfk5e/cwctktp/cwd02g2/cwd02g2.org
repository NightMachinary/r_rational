  and his [Stallman's] attitude of open-source, peer-reviewed, user-controlled software had prevailed over the MPAA and RIAA earlier

Stallman was never about open-source. In fact, he hates the word. Stallman has always been about /free/ software, which has largely the same goal but isn't willing to compromise at all, or to indulge in marketing. Open source is a marketing campaign for free software, and it wasn't until that marketing started that free software actually made a difference in the mainstream.

Stallman is a zealot. A man with a truly admirable dream and the courage to put it forward, a great motivator who gathered a core group of very talented people and created a lot of great software, and many other positive things...but always and finally a zealot. Zealots don't change the world, the people who take their ideas and make them palatable do.
