SPOILERS for Worm. (It's almost impossible to discuss without them.)

I don't have facebook, so I can't reply to EY directly, but:

Firstly, the shards are deliberately given to people who /won't destabilize the cycle/. Secondly, shards influence their humans to cause conflict. Thirdly, most of these can't easily take over the world because the others with equally broken powers would stop them. Fourth, the Endbringers target anyone who's doing too well at fixing things. Fifth, most of the Capes mentioned aren't doing as badly as all that:

The Number Man, Accord, Contessa and Dinah are already doing what's most important - using their Thinker powers to plan how to save the world.

Coil is taking over a city, but chooses to be cautious that is takes a long time. Tattletale did end up one of the most important people in said city.

Teacher was clearly working on taking over the world, and was reasonably clever at the attempt, but it didn't work out.

Richter - well, he was effective enough to get targeted by Leviathan. Who's to say he wouldn't have tried to fix things if he'd had the chance? Tinkers need time to work.

You overestimate Leet. When they say he can build anything, they do not mean it literally, and WoG is that by the time he figured out his limitation, he'd already burned out a lot of the best tech he could make.

Also, [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.13577/][there is Panacea fanfic in which she does that sort of thing]]. I don't actually find it particularly enjoyable to read after the first few chapters.

Edits: Added non-recommendation to my mention of /Amelia/. Fixed where I said Simurgh had killed Richter - it was Leviathan. Added futile spoiler warning.
