It's one of those things that bothers me about Worm, but I just push it to the side as one of those things that I don't really /have/ to like. I mean, there are lots of other works of fiction that just take the whole "capes and superpowers" thing as their conceit and run with it, without feeling the need to add in lots of justifications. Worm adds those justifications in, and for me it doesn't really work, but I don't find this to be too much worse than if that justification weren't there at all. Obviously YMMV.

The persistent darkness is a much bigger issue, partly because there are so few breathers.
