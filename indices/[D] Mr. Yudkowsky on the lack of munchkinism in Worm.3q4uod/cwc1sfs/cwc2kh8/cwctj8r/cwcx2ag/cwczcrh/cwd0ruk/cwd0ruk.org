Tattletale's situation is a bit odd. If Coil hadn't found and recruited her, she might well have gone for something like insider trading. But I found the story of how she ended up there believable before I knew anything about shards.

Grue needs money, the support of someone powerful (like Coil), and freedom. He doesn't trust the government, and his powers are not well-suited for business, so crime is really a good option for him.

Rachel was a homeless drifter who accidentally killed someone, and who was raised by a succession of abusers. Hard to return to ordinary society after that.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure Wildbow was working backward. But the way he did it seemed plausible to me. Early in the story, before shard stuff was on anyone's radar, it seemed plausible to me that society had been destabilized by parahumans to the point that "whatever, I'll take what I want with my powers" was a reasonable life plan.

I guess it's easy for me to accept society being destabilized. Our civilization isn't that competent/durable, if you ask me. And superpowers represent a pretty big shock to the system.
