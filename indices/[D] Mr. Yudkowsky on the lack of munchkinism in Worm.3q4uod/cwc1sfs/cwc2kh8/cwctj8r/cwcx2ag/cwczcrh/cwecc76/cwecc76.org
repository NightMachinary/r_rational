All of Tattle's extra clock time was being used taking down Coil. You know, the guy who was literally an Elder Scrolls player character, totally unafraid of death because he had savestates? Robbing banks when it gives you the opportunity to take over a criminal organization that large makes perfect sense. Also, Coil mentions in his interlude that the stock markets are protected from thinker influence, and that he could only get around it because his power went at an angle nobody thought to protect against.
