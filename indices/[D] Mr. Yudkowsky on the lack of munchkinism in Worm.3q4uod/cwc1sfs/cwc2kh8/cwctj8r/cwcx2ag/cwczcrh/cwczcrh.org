  Honestly, you don't need space magic to get the original Undersiders to be criminals.

You kinda do, for most of them.

Regent, yes. He was a bad guy, I find it completely believable that he was a criminal.

Maybe Grue goes bad...maybe. I never really understood why he chose villain, and I'm pretty sure there are more lucrative things to do with superpowers, although I'd have to think about it. Seems more like alien space worms than common sense to me.

Imp only went bad because she followed Grue.

Tattletale should have been insider trading or front running stocks. What she was doing -- highly visible street crime for comparative pennies -- was ridiculous for a smart character whose power was information.

I never got why Bitch was an active villain, other than "these people are my pack and they want to be villains."

Taylor...well, Taylor was just a bit of an idiot. If she wanted to make a difference, she chose about the least effective way to start doing it. And then she only went villain because Armsmaster was likewise an idiot. If someone tells you they're going to infiltrate the bad guys but can't tell you too much...go with it. At the worst they are a criminal who is already on your radar. At best they can actually bring down a group.

  and live in a disintegrating nation where the police have thoroughly lost control.

That's got it the wrong way around. The nation has disintegrated (if it has) because so many capes have decided that the best way to make money is to rob banks. There are so many better ways to achieve power and/or wealth, all of them either perfectly legal or illegal but white collar and not at all visible. Again, why isn't Tattletale just doing insider trading / front running stocks?

In the real world, sure, there will be some crazies and some psychopaths who actively want to commit violent, highly visible crime. (It's unlikely that they will want to do it in spandex, though; that requires alien space magic.) There will not, however, be anything like the number that we see. To the extent that society collapsed in Worm -- however much that might be -- it wouldn't do that in reality, because there would be far fewer bad guys so not as much authorization.

Skinhead groups and other cults led by evil capes? Sure, right there with you. Random capes who just want to be criminals for money and power? No.

The society in Worm seems to be the way it is because Wildbow was working backward -- he wanted a particular setting and figured out how to justify it. Unfortunately, the justification required a series of things that all involved people not acting like normal people.
