Except, barring extreme cases like Nilbog characters have clear reasons for what they do. Take Taylor's intractable issue with Tagg: you can't blame it on shards EDIT: Or rather, it's totally explicable in terms of character motivations.

In fact, I wonder how often we'd hear this complaint if Wildbow had never mentioned shards in the Nilbog WoG or had abruptly stopped the story before getting into the origin of powers.
