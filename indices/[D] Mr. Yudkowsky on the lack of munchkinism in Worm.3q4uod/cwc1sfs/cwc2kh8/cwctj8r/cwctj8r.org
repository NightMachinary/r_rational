  Shards have outright fucked with people and Wildbow cites Nilbog as an example of a shard subtly shaping behavior to achieve an end (Nilbog's shard was supposed to serve a goal beyond "end the world" so he stays put)

This right here is why I so strongly dislike Worm. It's an entire slew of interlocking narrative cheats designed to excuse absolutely anything. Villains wearing spandex and robbing banks instead of CuttingLexLuthorACheck? The shards did it! Character not living up to his potential? The shards did it! Every single person carrying the Conflict Ball? The shards...you get the idea. This is not an example of good writing. And then, of course, the entire thing is grimdark without any relief.

It frustrates me so much. The only thing that frustrates me more is that so many smart people love it; it's very unlikely that I'm the only sane man, so I wish to heck I knew what it was that all of them see that I don't.
