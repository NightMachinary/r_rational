I mean less that there's no such thing as a rationalist and more that there's no such thing as a rational person. That's something I believe mostly because I've studied an awful lot of statistics and psychology, because I know that the last thing our brains are checking for and calculating in our decision making is what's /rational/, at least from our perspective, and I know that the vast majority of people don't even get so far as studying psychology/statistics/et al.

It's easy to say /it's not rational for me to hate him because none of this.../ but no one can ignore their feelings as much as they'd like to, no one can ever make a totally rational choice.

What I'm trying to say is that I'm a distressed fanboy trying to find catharsis by arguing with strangers on the internet and the idea that fiction is bad because the characters don't act rationally seems just as absurd to me as fiction being bad because the characters don't act in line with exactly how you'd act. I read a poignant quote somewhere a few months ago about how we read stories because the characters /don't/ act like we would--we know how we act, there's no surprise, no suspense there--the enjoyable part of reading is seeing characters making a choice that seems (or feels) rational (or right) from their perspective, which is still something totally different from what we'd do.
