To be clear, I wasn't criticizing Wildbow. The original Worm does what it sets out to do as well as any story possibly could - it's trying (successfully) to be the Superhero Story To End All Superhero Stories, the category killer for its category, that doesn't let you ever look at superhero stories the same way again; the same thing I set out to do with HPMOR and Harry Potter fanfiction. Wildbow is rationalizing and therefore of necessity /preserving/ every aspect of traditional superhero stories, including Reed Richards Is Useless, excusing them and lawfulizing them as hard as he possibly can (and no harder). Even so the power balance in Worm is ludicrous but there's no way a human-level author could possibly avert that, given that they were trying to rationalize something akin to the Marvel or DC multiverse to start with; you just can't have economic balance or the weakest inexploitability given that many different superhero-level powers. Wildbow has thrown on at least four layers of inhibitors to try to rationalize why his Earth goes on spinning despite that, and that's the most he can possibly do without changing the nature of his universe.

What makes the voices start shrieking in my head is when I read a fanfic that's unaware of this, and depicts happy cheerful sane Amy not taking over the world (nor being attacked by the Simurgh or blocked by Contessa).

(Have read Amelia, check.)
