  You're also forgetting that Worm isn't the best universe for munchkinry, by design. There are a few that can do it, but mostly it's far more limited than it'd seem.

I think you're missing the point. +His Holyness+ Yodkowsky is /praising/ Wildbow for seeing the need to add all these anti-munchkin defenses in order to make a more realistic setting where everyone shouldn't have already taken over the world. And complaining about fan fiction which forgets this.
