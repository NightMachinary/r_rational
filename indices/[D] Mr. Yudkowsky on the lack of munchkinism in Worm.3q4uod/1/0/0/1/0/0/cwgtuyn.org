Her path was so long because her power doesn't work on precogs, strangers, endbringers, or Scion. Her power is absurd, but the fact that Mantellum or any other similar effect can turn her into a baseline human makes things tough. I would argue that the only reason she seems so powerful is because she avoided all conflicts where she wasn't directly needed, keeping her power and weaknesses out of public knowledge. Sure, she could take down any of the Triumvirate, but if she actually tried to replace them she would be killed within weeks, either in an endbringer attack or by someone with a grudge and a high stranger class.
