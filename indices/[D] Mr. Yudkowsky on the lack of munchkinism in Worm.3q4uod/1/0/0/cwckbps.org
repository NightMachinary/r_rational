Munchkinry is not well-suited to a world where your own effectiveness can be used to destroy everything you love. Between a rationalist non-rational (munchkin) story and a non-rationalist rational (realistic) story, I would pick the latter. EY either doesn't consider the realistic consequences of rationalist characters, or he simply doesn't acknowledge them because he prefers munchkin beatdowns. [[#s][]]

That said, Worm itself has some problems. [[#s][]]
