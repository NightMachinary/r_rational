Well, he clearly does contain Quirrell. He wrote him, after all. What he doesn't contain are the things that made Quirrell successful, namely, a story where there was always information available and things made sense, where that simulated iteration of Quirrel-conciousness was plugged into a subconcious model of the world he lived in, the HPMoR world, with access to data front-end rationalized after the fact - and where that model was able to interact with things multiple times, always doing the thing that wasn't stupid and consuming massive amounts of processing power spread over multiple iterations until it arrived at the best possible plan. The world works according to rational principles, sure, but it also contains several orders of magnitude more complexity than the setting Eliezer imagined and pitted Harry against. In the real world, you can get hit by a bus, die without meaning or cleverness, and be remembered with a funeral, a grave, and a brief but impassioned obituary. In the real world, people make mistakes.
