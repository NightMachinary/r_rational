Ok, I'm going to read that. However, statement first: 75% of the time that I make what looks like a "display of independence", it's because I actually just don't keep up with LW things, especially people's personal blogs, as often or in as much detail as they /or I/ would like. Of the remaining 25%, 15 percentage points are actual differences of opinion that could be cashed out given enough time and care, eventually.

And 10 percentage points is just being a dick on the internet for the various reasons people do that.

/In real life/, the disagreements are kept quiet whenever it comes to anything that /actually matters/, on grounds that just because I think, for instance, that FAI is reasonably probable (viz: achievable by human effort) and hard takeoffs are less so, doesn't mean those estimates are into Mugging territory where I want anyone to actually disregard potential takeoff scenarios or difficulties where doing so could actually cause real damage.

So yeah.
