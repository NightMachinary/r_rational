  Honestly, if Eliezer was that ever-so-fucking-clever, he wouldn't have any technical work left to do, and the world would already be firmly optimized. He should really try boasting about actual accomplishments.

Blasphemy! For this affront you shall be caught in the basalisk's eye in the future (when someone gets around to building it) and your simulations shall be tortured for all eternity in a lake of fire which gives no light and does not consume, but causes only /PAIN/! Cast out the heretic! For your insults to +His Holiness+ +His Magnificence+ +His Gorgeous Sweet Smelling Scrumptiousnessnessness+ Eliezer Yudkowsky all the matter in the universe will now have to be converted into computronium devoted entirely to the task of running near infinite simulations of you *IN AGONY!* (Someone get on building that paperclip basilisk already.) Think of the kittens!
