Revealed preferences: "almost always" except in the case of mortality. Many people say "I dont want to live forever" "death is good" but when questioned if they want their loved ones to die they deny.

Of course most people dont wont be "overlord" of any kind! And we dont want the people who want to be that to be in that position of power.

The whole "rational overlord of the world" is a really ugly/meant-to-be-funny term for "world optimisation". World optimisation would not be necessary if a certain number of topics were already adequately adressed.
