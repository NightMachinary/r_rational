Shards have outright fucked with people and Wildbow cites Nilbog as an example of a shard subtly shaping behavior to achieve an end (Nilbog's shard was supposed to serve a goal beyond "end the world" so he stays put)

And she's fucked in the head. You have to take a story for what it is sometimes. Panacea is just not that character, which is fine.

If this was a comic book, with a bunch of writers trying to justify dumb conceits foisted on them by the Comics Code (but-but it's more rational for Batman to not kill the Joker honest!) then I'd be infuriated too. But the narrative never acts as if there's anything noble there, in fact, it's the opposite.

It gets even worse when he says that people like Number Man aren't achieving their potential because they're not taking over the world. That's just outright dumb, given Number Man's goals.
