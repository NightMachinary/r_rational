I'm confused...you're hanging out on [[/r/rational]], and you think there is no such thing as a person who is a rationalist? Maybe we're using different meanings -- I mean 'a person who has studied psychology, statistics, et al, and uses them to make her thinking as clear and correct as possible in order to best achieve her goals'. What do you mean by it?
