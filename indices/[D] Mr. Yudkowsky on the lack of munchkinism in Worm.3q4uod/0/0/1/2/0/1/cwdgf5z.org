One thing to keep in mind is that by 2011 in worm, there had already been over a decade of PRT propaganda and media campaigns about Hero vs Villain. They /designed/ the system to work against "Rouges" (parahumans who use their powers legally but don't fight crime), it's only at the start of the story that the gov't starts to pivot and we see people like Canary and Parian. Before that, everyone who was born in 1990 or later would have grown up saturated with the idea of Hero vs Villain, and not necessarily in a way that deplored criminal activity. Outside Brockton Bay, Capes teams are viewed more like sports teams, a combination of MMA and NFL, perhaps.

So the fact that Taylor's first thoughts were of fighting crime and not joining the agricultural industry, is not surprising.
