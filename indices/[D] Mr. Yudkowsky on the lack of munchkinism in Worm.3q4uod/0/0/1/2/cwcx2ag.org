The endless shard justifications mostly show up in fan discussions. If they were all over the story, I'd like it a lot less.

Honestly, you don't need space magic to get the original Undersiders to be criminals. Robbing people is actually a sensible way to make money if you have Grue's powers and live in a disintegrating nation where the police have thoroughly lost control.

Similarly, plenty of people fail to live up to their potential in real life. And the conflicts in the story mostly feel organic. At least in my opinion.

But fans, for whatever reason, love to talk about the entities.

As for the darkness...how dark it is is a matter of opinion, and how dark it should be is a matter of taste. Maybe it's just not your thing.
