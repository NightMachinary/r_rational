Feel free to rip these of for inspiration: Some models for how a vampire might interact with their live-in minion/paramour, mostly stolen from better functioning WoD games.

"The serial romantic": This entity is 700 years old, and also stuck in a cycle of falling lin love, living happily until their paramour dies, then spending 7 years despodent with grief, only to do it all over again. They are very aware that this is how they work, but is of the very firm opinion that it is overall worth it, and that the eventual grief does not taint the present happyness. Also, /terrifyingly good/ at being a spouse. Practice. Also; has murdered at least 23 people who falsely promised a non-vampiric path to immortality. Gruesomely.

The bargainer: The world is vast, and full of tragedy. Did your entire family just die in a car crash? Murder suicide? Fire? Get sentenced to 900 years in maximum for running a epic ponsi scheme? This personage will hear, and may have a proposition for you. They never cause any of these tragedies, - there is no need, and the risk of discovery would be a ticking bomb. Hardly anyone ever says no. ... The rare ones that do, well, the sea is deep and full of secrets. One more wont matter.

"Teacher": For centuries, there have been places you can give up unwanted children for adoption with no paperwork and with no eyes on you. The mercy box at the convent, a heated drawer on the outside of a hospital. Occasionally, someone placed there never arrives at their expected destination. They always end up named Robin, and there are few beings on this earth as omni-competent as a Robin eventually becomes.
