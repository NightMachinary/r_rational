These are all wonderful concepts. Thank you!

I love the idea of the "deliberate" cycle of joy and grief: I could see there being some inciting incident, like a Sire killing a human their Childe was planning on embracing themselves, or something, with warnings about getting too attached to humans, your place in the universe, etc.

It makes me think of something a vampire couple would do: just like the unicorn hunters in polyamory, they'd find their "perfect third", have a glorious 70 years together, and then the human would die of natural causes, thus be unable to "threaten the primacy of their relationship".

Oooh, that's good. Social commentary, or something! I should put that in the short stories idea folder.
