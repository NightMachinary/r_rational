I am currently developing a puzzle game that I hope will share the reasons why I enjoy physics and learning new concepts. My project is starting with optics, which in my opinion is the easiest to translate to the visual medium of gaming. However I do not just want to have everything be super realistic as this would be boring to anyone who already understands optics, or is just not interested in it. I am going to include a system of magic in my world that players will have to discover.

My world is set sometime between 1950 and 1960, in an alternate reality which until this point is very similar to our own. The development of lasers have uncovered a system of physical laws unlike what we have in our own universe. The magic system will be based on creating polygons from the lasers intersecting. Currently the idea is for the player to discover this system while solving unrelated puzzles about making lasers go around obstacles.

Different polygons would have different magical effects and the strength of the magical effect would depend on the size of the polygon and how close it is to the ideal polygonal shape. My demo currently only has squares creating a force normal to the plane of the square.

Other ideas I have to form in the center of a polygon:

magnetic/electric fields,

making the color of the lasers change some parameter,

lights,

sound,

temperature,

pretty much anything that currently already is in physics.

I do not want to go to far afield from what is currently described in physics, like say a stable large wormhole, or effects which would represent a huge amount of energy such as fusion/fission.

While conservation of energy is not necessary, I am going to try to keep it within sight.

Now that the system has been described, and given you are limited to the size of a classroom, what would be some things you would like to try and create? I would then try and implement them into the game.
