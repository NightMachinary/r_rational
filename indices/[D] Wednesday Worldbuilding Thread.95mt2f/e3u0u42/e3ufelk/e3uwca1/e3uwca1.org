Thanks for the ideas. I have played several Zachtronics games including most recently Opus Magnum. I like them and am inspired by them, however their basic ideas and problems in the puzzles are almost entirely programming puzzles with a theme on top of them. I would like to create something that more resembles how a scientist would go about exploring some unknown natural phenomenon.

I like the alternating current idea, as you could just turn the laser system on and off in order to create the field change needed. I think I would make the power output somehow take energy from the laser, thus changing its color.

For entropy, my thought was making it so the universe actually had constant entropy. However the entropy lost from creating the magic, is made up by the entropy gained from the rest of the natural laws which are near identical to our own.
