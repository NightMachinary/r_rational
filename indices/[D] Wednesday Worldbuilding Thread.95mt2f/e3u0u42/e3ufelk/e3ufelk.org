Some things that immediately come to mind is building a kind of laser based generator. Create alternating current by moving the laser that creates magnetic/electric fields, etc. Maybe strong enough for some lightening?

If you put an object in between two identical square lasers, it would form a sort of grip, right? This could be used as a sort of levitation device, or maybe a squashing device. Plus, you could make a hover board if you could attach the lasers to an object.

Temperature is probably the easiest in a sense that you could make refrigerators. I remember my thermodynamics professor had a big hard on for proving all the laws using refrigerators and heat pumps (the old fashioned way) so it would be cool to brake these examples with laser magic. I'm sure they're floating around somewhere. This would have some interesting implications in relation to entropy and all that jazz.

On a somewhat related note, have you played any of the [[http://www.zachtronics.com/][Zachtronics]] games? I love them cause they're less "here's a puzzle; solve it" and more "here's a design doc and some tools; make this thing". It sounds like you're trying a similar approach so I would give them a look.
