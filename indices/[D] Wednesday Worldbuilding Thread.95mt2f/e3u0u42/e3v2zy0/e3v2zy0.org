I'm sick but I have a conundrum so here's a nice short summary of my issue:

- I am writing a vampire romance story, and I want the human to be able to snuggle the vampire during daytime sleeping because it's adorable

- Vampires sleep during the day and can't be woken

- Vampires will try to kill each other - not like every 5 minutes, but every few dozen years, maybe

- So you're at risk when you're asleep of a rival vampire's human servant coming and setting you on fire or just dragging you into the sun

- By the same token, if you have a favoured human servant / bodyguard, they can be threatened and thus manipulated to kill you

- So under no circumstances would you ever allow your sleeping body to be anywhere near a human, no matter how much you trusted them

- But then I, as an author, don't get to write cute snuggly sleepy vampire/human scenes?!

How do I fix this? How do we make it so a vampire is comfortable with an unhindered human being around it while it's sleeping? I had some options:

- a) Relax the "human has to be around" requirement, and just have the vampire lock itself in bed each night (or lock the human in a cage or something)

  - Problem: it makes the most sense but fucks up the "cute snuggly bedtime vibe" I was going for.

- b) Relax the "vampire can't be woken from sleep" requirement: a sleeping vampire, when moved, will wake up, but in a groggy, sleep-walk way and is likely to lash out at whatever woke it

  - Problem: a stake immobilises a vampire, so the problem is just moved from "why don't you drag the vampire outside" to "why don't you stake the vampire then drag it outside"
  - Another big problem: you can kill a vampire by cutting off its head, so the human could just straight up kill you while you're asleep?

- c) Have the vampires tell humans that b) is true, in the "if you pee in the pool it will turn the water red!" sort of way

  - Problem: surely someone has tested this at some point, or would try to test it under controlled conditions: it is worth the risk?
  - Problem: vampires tell other lies to humans, do they really want to add another to the pile?

- d) Have the vampire chain itself to the bed so it can't be dragged off; or wear armour to bed

  - Problem: a bit too 50 shades of grey for me; surely vampires have heard of bolt cutters; short of swallowing it, where could a vampire hide a key?
  - Problem: if you're wearing armour to bed, the human can just take it off you

Anyway, I think b) is the way to go, but then I still run into the problems outlined there.

I'm happy to explain this by modifying the vampire lore somehow, or by coming up with a good strategy for vampires to use to keep themselves safe.

Because I'm writing a romance story I don't want e.g. the vampire to threaten "if you kill me, my dead man's switch goes off and my vampire friends kill you and your family", or anything else that similarly puts the human in an uncomfortable position. I'm also uneasy about the vampire implicitly trusting a human after only a few months.
