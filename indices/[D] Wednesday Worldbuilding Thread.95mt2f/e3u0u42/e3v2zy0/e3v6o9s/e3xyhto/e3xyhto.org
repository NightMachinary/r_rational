  I've slept around people who have demonstrated the abability of approaching and touching me without waking me, and never felt the need to make any particular assurances that they won't set me on fire, even though I doubt they'd have much physical touble doing it without waking me prior to me being on fire.

The way I look at it, the longer you live, the more risk adverse you are (the movie /In Time/ is an example of that: the rich buy cars but for display, they never drive them for fear of accidents).

So, say there's a 0.01% chance of a friend of mine setting my house on fire while I sleep in any given year. If I live 100 years, that is 0.9999^{100} = 99% = 1% lifetime chance of a friend of mine murdering me in my lifetime. Things like my love for icecream are going to bigger factors in my chances of death, so I don't worry about arsonist friends.

Say I'm a vampire though, and I'm 1500 years old (my Main Vampire is this age, which is why I picked it). Copernican principle says that on average I'm going to be living another 1500 years (insert a bunch of caveats) - anyway, 0.9999^{1500} = 86% = a 14% chance that a friend of mine will burn me to death - and being a vampire, high triglycerides are not a concern, so there might be very few other causes of death I have to worry about.

If I had a magic crystal ball (or a supercomputer running simulations) and said that based on my predictions, there was a 14% chance of your death being caused by someone setting your house on fire while you slept, I think you'd be a lot more concerned than you are about it now.

  While your vampire would surely be cautious about enemies learning where they sleep I think "no human not even one I trust to arbitrary degrees, can ever know" is an irrational leap.

I do agree with you, though. I just wanted to talk about cumulative probabilities and why I think vampires would have different priorities.

  I'd also think that having a trusted human who can deal with any assassins sent by rival vampires on hand would be useful. To ensure loyalty treat them well, deal with anyone harassing/intimidating them harshly and have a standing offer to beat any bribe to betray you they are offered. As an added precaution have 2 or more so they can watch each other and any rival will have to turn multiple highly loyal retainers.

This is likely to be a dominant strategy. It helps that vampires can make World of Darkness style "ghouls" who are magically compelled to obey.
