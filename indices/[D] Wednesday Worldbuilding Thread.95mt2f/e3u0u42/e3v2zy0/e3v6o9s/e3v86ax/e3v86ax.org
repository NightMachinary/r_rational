.. You are thinking about this wrong. A sleeping vampire is defenseless. There are two solves for this: The first is to hide your sleeping spot, the second is to always have someone there to defend you, and the first of these ends up being highly impractical, since you have to shake any theoretical trail every single morning.

Particularly paranoid vampires might be very careful to pick paramours with few external levers, but honestly, I expect old vampires to have the social skills to notice if their lovers are being blackmailed into murder.

Not to mention that it seems like the sort of tactic which could easily get extremely taboo. - Everyone wants a companion to be there to answer the door and do daytime buisness, so everyone is far better off if targeting them is just not done, on pain of the collective displeasure of every vampire in town.
