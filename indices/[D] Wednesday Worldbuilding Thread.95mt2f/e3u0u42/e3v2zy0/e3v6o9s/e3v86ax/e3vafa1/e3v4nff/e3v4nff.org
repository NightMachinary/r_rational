I see a possible solution based off of vampire social dynamics. Given their tendencies towards compulsive behavior and complex internal politics, plus the fact that they could reproduce vastly faster than they ever seem to in practice, I'm assuming that they've got a very complex, ritualized, formal set of rules for interacting with each other, presumably enforced by ancient powerful vampires and/or social norms.

As such, what if the "rules" for killing another vampire forbid a good chunk of your threat model? I'm assuming that social status is a common reason to kill a rival vampire, so social pressure would probably be a viable defense against a good chunk of that.
