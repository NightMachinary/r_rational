Three things can kill a sleeping vampire: Bad Luck, Hostile Forces, and Betrayal. Partners can betray you. But they're helpful when it comes to random fires or opposing vampires.

I'd be tempted to go with a modified (b). A vampire, sleeping alone, is dead to the world. A vampire, sleeping next to a human, feels groggy and comfortable, like a person under a warm duvet. The human feels similarly comfortable This gives you more opportunities to write romance. Comfortable vampires talk, but don't remember their conversations the next day.

It also shifts the math a bit.

Humanity used to be really, really bad at fire safety. So, in all likelihood, there were a bunch of vampires who burned to death in random urban fires. Paranoid vampires would be especially vulnerable to this. If I don't tell my thralls where I'm sleeping, then they can't pull me out when my enemies toss a couple torches onto my roof.

If I have a human sleeping next to me, then there's someone there to wake up to the smell of smoke and drag me out of the burning building.

I wouldn't worry too much about armor and chains. Vampires could use them. And humans could sleep under a kevlar duvets. But, in practice, if the SWAT team has kicked in my door and burst into my bedroom, then I'm already doomed, regardless of the covering. The escape route + human to drag me through it would be a good trade.
