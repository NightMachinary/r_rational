How is this fundamentally different from just being a deep sleeper?

I've slept around people who have demonstrated the abability of approaching and touching me without waking me, and never felt the need to make any particular assurances that they won't set me on fire, even though I doubt they'd have much physical touble doing it without waking me prior to me being on fire. While your vampire would surely be cautious about enemies learning where they sleep I think "no human not even one I trust to arbitrary degrees, can ever know" is an irrational leap.

I'd also think that having a trusted human who can deal with any assassins sent by rival vampires on hand would be useful. To ensure loyalty treat them well, deal with anyone harassing/intimidating them harshly and have a standing offer to beat any bribe to betray you they are offered. As an added precaution have 2 or more so they can watch each other and any rival will have to turn multiple highly loyal retainers.
