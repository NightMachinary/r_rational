  the internet is very new to a vampire

ehh, some vampires probably helped /invent/ it and definitely are capable of taking humans to work this "new fangled internet" for them (I mean, there are people out there who teach old people how to use email: a vampire could hire a tutor, worst case.)

I also suspect that in-universe, Satoshi is a vampire: stands to reason. Vampires hate the inconvenience of physical currency and the traceability of bank deposits isn't much better.
