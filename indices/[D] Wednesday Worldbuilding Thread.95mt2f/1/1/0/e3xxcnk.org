  I expect old vampires to have the social skills to notice if their lovers are being blackmailed into murder.

That's something else I didn't consider. Vampires would have a lot of experience with humans in all stages of deception. Exit interviews with Survivor contestants also comes to mind (former winners coming back to play say they were at a disadvantage because they never got to see the odd behaviour others did just before voting them off).

Thanks!
