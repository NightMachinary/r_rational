Become really good at speed chess.

I doubt you'd be coordinated enough to do anything more than a quick dodge and counterattack, and getting good at self defense isn't really all that impressive anyway.

The real loophole is that your brain doesn't seem to suffer any slowdown from Bullet Time. So I suppose you'd have a decent edge in any activity that benefits from increased thinking time.
