That occurred to me as well. If you could somehow totally depopulate Earth of humans, possibly by setting up space colonies, then Earth would become a blank astrological canvas to work with. A single person, stood on Earth, could influence the entire cosmos at once.

Admittedly, this raises the worrying question of what would happen in the interim period, where Earth has no humans living on it, prior to re-introduction. Would the rest of the universe /stop moving?/
