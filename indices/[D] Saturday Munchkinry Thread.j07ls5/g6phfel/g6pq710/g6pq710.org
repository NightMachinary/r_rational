Are you able to take any items with you, or do you mean in terms of developing sufficient personal power through magic or strength?

If you can take an item with you, I think you only need one jump - consulting [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_doomsday_devices][the Wikipedia list of doomsday devices]], all you need to do is find one which can fulfill your criteria, you can take with you, and which appears in public.

Is time outside of the jump cooldowns a constraint? If not, you can presumably make a single jump to a setting with the potential for growth up to planet-destroying levels, like Gurren Lagann, Dragon Ball, or a cultivation setting, and train yourself up to those levels.

What criteria do you have for a fictional universe to be considered published? Would you include thought experiments like the efilism button to destroy the universe? Could you publish the perfect setting to fulfill your needs yourself?
