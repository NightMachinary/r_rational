  The pillow forts don't have to be deliberately made-something like a propped-up couch cushion with a blanket thrown over it works just as well, as long as there's a space defined within that contains an item from you.

Let's take this in the other direction. How deliberately made can we get while still counting as a pillow fort. Can we use internal props to increase size and stability? What happens if we make a literal building frame and pile up pillows for walls. Do they have to be general purpose pillows, or can we commission special "structural pillows" that are easier to turn into large spaces. How far can we go and have something still count as a pillow?

In theory, the more space you can create the more you can build it into a useful transport hub. Is there any way to make it large enough to literally run a rail line through? Because serving as an intercontinental rail hub could be massively lucrative.

Alternately, can you make it large enough to run pipes through? In theory, if you had the capital you could claim some barren spot of land somewhere in, say, the Western Sahara or similar then use your pillow fort to provide transportation and resources. The costs to get it up and running would be more than most have at the ready, but if you could do it you could potentially found a viable nation of your own.
