What constitutes a custom or taboo? Is "no murder" a single taboo, or are there perhaps "no premeditated killing", "no killing in moments of passion", "no hiring a murderer" etc. all different things? What about different methods of murder?

Also, will everyone warn you the first time, or just people who would otherwise oppose you? For example, if I tried to enter into a criminal conspiracy with someone who would normally be down for criminal conspiracy, would then warn me once and accept my offer the second time? Because if so, that's a rather strong limit, but if not, that plus the destruction of evidence is a pretty massive tool in your toolbox.

Also, what happens if there are multiple offenses before anyone can warn you? If you you commit tax fraud for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, then the 2021 fraud is discovered in 2022 and the IRS gently warns you not to do that, are there penalties if your 2020 fraud is later discovered?

Is the "this person has committed this offense before" record global, per person, organizational, or by word of mouth? If I rob Alice and she lets me off with a warning, can I never safely rob anyone again? Can I never rob Alice again, but rob anyone who was not a direct witness? Can I rob Bob, her next-door neighbor whom she told the funny story of this tourist who accidentally robbed her without realizing it was inappropriate? Can I rob someone else in Alice's family? Someone covered by the same local police department, or national government?
