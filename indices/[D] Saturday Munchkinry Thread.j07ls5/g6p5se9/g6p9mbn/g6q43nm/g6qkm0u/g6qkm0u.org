In that case I think financial fraud would probably be the way to go, in terms of observable gains, since money is probably the best way to unambiguously come out ahead here. Theoretically there are plenty of ways that someone unaware of specific laws could get away with some terrible malfeasance (see [[https://xkcd.com/1494/]]), and as long as ignorance (of these relatively obscure laws) is a defense, there are probably quite a few of them. Tax fraud, insider trading, etc. - until some legal entity is smart enough to recognize the pattern and, with entirely benign intentions, tell me that ignorance is not a valid legal defense, I can avoid giving away the real exploit for quite a while.
