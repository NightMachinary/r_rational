Suppose you have a magical level of Touristness about you which causes everyone you meet to be willing to let you off with a warning the first time they see you violate a particular custom or taboo. Everything from gum on the Singapore sidewalks to cutting in line at the grocery store to wandering into a staff only area. No matter what you did, the first warning is always /just/ a warning with no further consequences, blame or mistrust involved. The maitre de asks you politely to stop belching, the guard dog growls and nudges you back toward the gate, the secret service agents escort you back to the tour group and tell the guide to keep a better eye on you.

How do you adjust your behavior to take maximum advantage of this ability?
