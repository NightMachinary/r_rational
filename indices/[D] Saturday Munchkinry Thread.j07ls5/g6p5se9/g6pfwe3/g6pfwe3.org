After building a pillow fort, you discover that you are able to connect to other pillow forts as well. You can only do this because your fort contains a scrap of cloth that was originally from a couch in the Palace of Versailles-whichever fort the cloth is in becomes the center of the network. After you've established a center fort, any other fort that contains an item that once belonged to you will become connected to said center fort, though they won't connect to each other. The pillow forts don't have to be deliberately made-something like a propped-up couch cushion with a blanket thrown over it works just as well, as long as there's a space defined within that contains an item from you.

However, there is also an international organization keeping track of linked pillow forts. They are capable of entering any center fort in the world through their headquarters, and require all potential members to perform a good deed with their fort to join. Furthermore, they will monitor any future links created.

How are you going to leverage this for maximum power?
