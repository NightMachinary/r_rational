*Headscratcher* International organization that asks people to do good deeds, but refuses to share their teleportation technology? They could have used it to teleport people and resources to other planets/moons! Built pillow forts there and just sent stuff back and forth.

Can I just reveal myself to this "good" organization and propose these plans for interplanetary colonization and travel?
