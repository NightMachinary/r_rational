Space travel and shipping have been covered. Front-running HFT transactions is another perennial favorite get-rich teleportation trick.

Another one you can do is to create super high density housing. Make your primary pillow fort a suitably gigantic warehouse somewhere with cheap land. I imagine your fort is probably just a layer of pillows and blankets insulating / stapled to the inside of an actual warehouse. Then buy a commercial space somewhere expensive and fill it with closet-sized pillow forts. Build entire luxury condo complexes inside the warehouse, wherever those exit. Sell units in the expensive place with land costs from the cheap place. This is very capital-intensive, but you can bootstrap it up from enough money to rent a commercial space plus buy a home somewhere cheap. If you run out of room, you can always link new warehouses to the prime one, keeping only the connective corridors in your main pillow fort. You can also add cheap heating and cooling to this scheme by connecting to hot/cold parts of the Earth.

Speaking of heating and cooling, if you want to gather power more literally, you just need exits in Death Valley and Antarctica to power a heat engine. However this is limited, since pillow forts aren't going to survive the kind of temperature and environment extremes you really want out of a teleporter powered heat engine.

Also, your good deed can be providing housing to the homeless. It's not very far out of the way of the above scheme.
