Assuming that both that law and its corollary are true, this feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy type deal. You can't /really/ manipulate the heavens, because the heavens already reflected/were going to reflect whatever it is you're doing in an attempt to manipulate them. Unfortunately, that kinda strips everyone of free will which is mostly boring, though the degree to which it's possible to confirm that probably depends on the accuracy of your astronomical observations and models, implying that in this universe there are speculators who have fuck-off big telescopes and teams of scientists in order to build better and better models of the future in order to make more money.

If you assume that there's not a bunch of free-will stripping pre-destination nonsense going on, you probably end up in sort of the opposite situation: teams of scientists who want to study astronomical events or gravitational waves or whatever doing a bunch of social engineering in order to make those events happen.

Since the heavenly bodies you're manipulating are lightyears away this maybe also gets you FTL communication? Seems like it'd be a massive undertaking in order to actually take advantage of it though, or you'd need the receiver to have really really delicate measurements. You'd probably need something like highly engineered communication-colonies specifically structured so that you could send out messages.
