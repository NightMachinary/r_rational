You can fly with this. Move all gravity to your head and jump with your weightless legs. Your head goes down, your legs go up. When your legs are on top, move all gravity to your feet. Your head maintains its (lateral) velocity while your feet accelerate down, pushing your head up. Repeat every time you swap end over end. And... probably do this by holding your arms out and spinning instead of going end over end, to make it easier to do this without vomiting.

It's a little wonky without the effect changing your center of mass, and I'm not even sure if changing gravity without changing mass is well-defined. But regardless of how that works out, moving the effects of gravity higher on your body means increasing your potential energy, and gravity will convert that to kinetic energy, so however it works you're still accelerating.
