A modern person is reborn as a monarch in a feudal society. Ignoring specific issues caused by local politics, how should this person go about reforming the system into a democratic one?

Note, I am not asking if this is actually a good idea. This person has set out to do this and can't be persuaded. I'm just curious to know in a general sense what people think the best way to go about such an undertaking is.
