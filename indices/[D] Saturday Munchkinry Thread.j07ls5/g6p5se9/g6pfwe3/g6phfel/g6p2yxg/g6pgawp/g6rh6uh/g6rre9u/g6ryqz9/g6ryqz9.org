The obvious exploit is just using the bullet time to complete mental tasks, whether its math homework or crime solving or novel writing. So let's analyze what can be done with the 'queue'ing up power.

I suspect this can be used to be a legendary baseball batter. Hold your breath the moment the pitcher throws, analyze exactly what kind of ball is being thrown and its target location, then queue up a home run swing that hits that location and release your breath at the exact moment you need to swing. Since the strike zone for a baseball is relatively small, you should be able to heavily practice a separate home run swing for each and every location the ball could land in, and so queue up the complicated movements necessary with good accuracy. Considering how much money the really good team sports players make, this is probably the most lucrative option.

(It isn't the most lucrative sport, but the others like soccer, golf, etc. all tend to require far more complicated movements, so there is no way you can practice them all. I think it also makes more money than single-person sports like Archery, but to be honest I have not researched this in depth.)
