Every time you hold your breath you have the choice of mentally triggering a state of altered consciousness where time seems to slow down massively, to the point it almost seems still (think SuperHot). You can only sustain this state for as long as you can hold your breath, so it can be held longer if you've trained in holding your breath. Once you've hit your maximum time you lose the state and breathe out in a normal manner, so no exhaling really loudly once it's over. However, you do feel the fatigue in your lungs, so another round of Bullet Time will last a shorter period or it'll take a while to work up to another maximal length Bullet Time period.

During this state the only thing you can move is your eyeballs. You're not able to move your limbs because your nerve signals travel slowly enough as to be still during this state. You can however "queue" up actions to do after the state ends. Once the state ends, all the actions you queued up happen at the same time (since essentially all the nerve signals are getting sent at the same time). Your accuracy isn't great when doing this, but practicing the same movement a lot will let you queue up complicated movements which will happen with good accuracy (like being able to shoot an arrow close to the bullseye each time).

How do you munchkin this power?
