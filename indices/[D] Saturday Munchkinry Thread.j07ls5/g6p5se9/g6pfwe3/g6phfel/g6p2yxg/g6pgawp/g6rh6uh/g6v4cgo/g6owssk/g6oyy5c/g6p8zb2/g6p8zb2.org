This would make you an amazing fighter if you get a lot of practice. A whole lot of combat is about your center of gravity. It influences how you can move and dodge, and how opponents could pin or throw you about. Your power lets you literally shift your center of gravity wherever you wish, which is just plain crazy.

That's not so useful in a modern society with guns though.

​

So let's check something else! Which gravity does your power affect, exactly? We feel the gravity of the Earth most strongly, but the Moon's gravity also affects us since that's how it makes tides. So... when the moon is in the sky, can you transfer all Earth gravity to one part of your body, and transfer all moon gravity to another part, and watch the second part just float upwards towards the moon?

​

But now, what happens if your body is split in two? For less gore, imagine its just you cutting your hair. You shift Earth gravity away from your hair, and moon gravity towards it, then cut it off. Does your hair now continue to ignore Earth gravity and fly towards the Moon? Can you repeatedly grow and cut your hair in the same manner to generate a lot of pseudo-anti-gravity material that floats upwards towards the moon, allowing you to make hovercraft-esque objects or even cheaper rockets, albeit ones that only work while the moon is overhead?
