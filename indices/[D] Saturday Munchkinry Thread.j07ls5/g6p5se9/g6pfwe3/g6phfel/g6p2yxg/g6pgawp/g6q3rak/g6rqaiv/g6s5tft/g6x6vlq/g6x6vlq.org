Body parts disappear; they cannot be used to spontaneously generate or destroy matter. I think consumed items would arrive with them when they reappear, unless it were the cause of death, in which case the object would remain behind. Slow acting things might stick around a few revivals before being purged, or they may be left behind, depending on the specifics.
