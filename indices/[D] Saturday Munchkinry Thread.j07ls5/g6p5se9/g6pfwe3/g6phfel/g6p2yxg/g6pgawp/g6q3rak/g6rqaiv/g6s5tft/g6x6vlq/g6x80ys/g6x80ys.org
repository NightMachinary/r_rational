Do the body parts disappear on death, or on removal? If on removal, allows for more efficient space travel. Find the minimum amount necessary for me to count as "alive", then remove everything else to save on mass. When we reach our destination, shut off my life support and get a fully-functional if slightly traumatized person at the other end.

If removed body parts don't disappear until my death, it gives an interesting possibility for assassinations. Get a large portion of blood, donated from immortal people. Filter it into pure water, then get the target to drink it for a few days. Then, kill the immortals, causing their bodies to reclaim the water, causing massive dehydration instantly. Whether this could be done by a single dedicated immortal depends on how long the blood continues to count as a body part after leaving the body.
