Depends on the location of their reappearance. If they respawn in the same location, then its super easy for enemy forces to just imprison your superhumans. Just kill them then put a cage over the location of their death. In this case, you might be able to surprise people with their revival ability a few times, but they will soon learn the appropriate countermeasures to make your respawns moot.

Also, what kind of control do you have exactly? Can you force them to endure unimaginable pain and suffering? Because I'm thinking: renewable organ resources. Harvest their organs, they die, respawn with brand new unharmed organs, repeat. No more waiting lists for organ transplants. Everyone who needs a heart, lung, liver, kidney, etc. gets one if you have a compatible respawner.
