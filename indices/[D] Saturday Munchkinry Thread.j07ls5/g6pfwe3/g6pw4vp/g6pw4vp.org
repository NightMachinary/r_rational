The easiest method of making money, so long as it's okay with the central organization, is probably through circumventing borders in one way or another, whether that's by running drugs, running guns, ferrying over immigrants, or simply dodging taxes.

If it can be done en masse, without secrecy, then it might be better to operate within the bounds of the law and set up an expedited shipping company which can accomplish international travel in minutes rather than taking half a day. Of course, doing it out in the open has some problems, mainly that you're dependent on no one finding out about and taking your scrap of cloth, and there's a major organization that's presumably invested in stopping this (for whatever reason). Depending on what scales it's possible to work with, you could make enormous pillow forts that a semi could pull into as part of a transfer to the central fort, then transfer out to their destination, saving thousands of dollars. Similarly, you could make a massive central fort that would compete with the airlines and have only security as a cost.

Lastly, if you don't have to construct the pillow fort yourself, or if the fort can be mobile, you could spend a big chunk of capital gotten through other means and shoot a "satellite" into space, which would give you access to orbit around Earth. Similarly, with a fort landing on the Moon or Mars, you could shave billions off creating colonies and scientific expeditions there.

(As a natural part of all this, you would need to find out the minimum requirements for 'pillow' and 'pillow fort', stretching the definitions as far as they would go in order to drive down costs and figure out what solutions to problems are actually workable.)
