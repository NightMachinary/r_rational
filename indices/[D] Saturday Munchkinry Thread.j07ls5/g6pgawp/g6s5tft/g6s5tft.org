If body parts are removed prior to death, do those body parts also vanish? If no, then this is a reliable source of organ donation, skin grafts, etc. Could also be used to farm antibodies for fatal diseases (e.g. infect me with ebola, wait two days, bleed me out, filter out antibodies for use, repeat).

Do the contents of the stomach vanish as well? If yes, could be a permanent disposal of any small object. If no, provides a method of hiding objects across border searches (swallow, cross border, then be killed leaving behind the swallowed object).

What does "unharmed" mean in the context of a slow-acting poison or radioactive source? Would all damage from the poison/radiation be reverted, while the poison/radioactive source is still there, or would the poison/radioactive source be removed? If the latter, could be a disposal method for nuclear waste without needing to transport the waste to a secondary location.
