There is a specific town where they always reappear, somewhere at random within its boundaries. The town is under your control, enclosed, and its location and purpose currently unknown to any antagonistic forces.

Your method of control is whatever you want to utilize given the situation. It may be assumed you have access to fairly extensive though not unlimited resources to facilitate any construction, contracting, or other infrastructure required.

All of their body disappears when they die; they can't be used physically for creation of infinite resources.
