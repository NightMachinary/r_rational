How extensive is this effect? Can you murder someone and the police just goes haha this war orphan, doesn't realize he is in a civilized world now where murder is bad! *Slap on the wrist and lets you go free?*

What about theft? If you would only receive "a warning", does that mean you get to keep the stuff you steal? Can you break into people's houses one by one, take their stuff, and the homeowners just go "haha this little scamp, you can have all that stuff, just don't do it again!" ?
