You can only get away with things that a tourist who is four to five standard deviations above average in terms of cluelessness might plausibly think was allowed, and only if the person who would normally punish you for your transgression has no specific evidence that you knew better. Whether Bob lets you off with a warning or calls the cops depends on whether he recognizes you as being the same tourist from Alice's description of the prior incident. If he thinks you might be someone else, you get the warning instead.

It doesn't work for most murders (because even the most clueless tourist knows that you're not allowed to randomly kill people), but you /could/ get away with lethal self defense in a jurisdiction where that is not normally a defense, on the excuse that you thought that it was. Hiring a hitman is also a possibility if you do so via euphemism, so long as a sufficiently clueless person might have plausibly been trying to request the literal meaning ('surprise delivery' or what not) rather than the implied hit.

It only triggers if you find yourself in a situation where you would otherwise be punished for your actions, and covers all prior violations of the taboo, but not subsequent ones. In the IRS example, your 2020 tax fraud would be forgiven on the basis that you didn't know it was illegal back then. For the conspiracy version, fellow criminals wouldn't be compelled to warn you, since they aren't inclined to enforce the rule.
