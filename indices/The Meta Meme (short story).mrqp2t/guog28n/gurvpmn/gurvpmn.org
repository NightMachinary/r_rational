  He didn't seriously believe that the human meta meme was a threat to Orp-orp, of course, even assuming it actually existed. Orp-orp was the best meme cluster in the galaxy by a wide margin. If the meta meme was able to infect it, then it would be able to infect everything.

  That purely hypothetical situation might even wind up benefiting them. Sure, they'd lose a few good Orp-orps to rhetorical tricks if they began to tolerate heresies. But if the tradeoff was that the Niminian Heretics opened their receivers to the truth of Orp-orp, Orp-orp would spread through the galaxy at the speed of light.

  The risk, however slight, was that the Niminian Heretics would be immune to the meta meme. But the Niminian Heretics would be thinking the same thing he was, that this meta-meme offered an unprecedented opportunity to spread throughout the galaxy. They were so enmeshed in their web of lies, they would surely think their own meme cluster to be the strongest. If they fully understood the superiority of Orp-orp, they wouldn't be heretics, and so the truth of things would take them by surprise.

Replace Niminian Heretics and Orp Orp with any two mutually contradictory human -isms and meme cluster with the word religion or ideology, as applicable, and replace meta meme with things like open discourse and free speech and and you'll understand what the meta meme is.
