Nice Story. Lots of interesting details.

I've been wondering what the mentioned memetic hazards are. I think the Hedonic Pump is things like the lottery? Thinking about makes you feel good even though it's irrational to think you'd win, therefore yo think about it more and feel more good.

The other one though, " A consumptive game-theoretic entity," Pascal's Wager maybe?
