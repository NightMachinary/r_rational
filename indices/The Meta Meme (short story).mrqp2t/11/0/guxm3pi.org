I'm pretty sure it's referencing religion or god. An entity that "consumes" all of your attention via prayer.

I doubt that the Orp-Orp meme cluster would be very tolerant of any competitors for its hosts and considering the throwaway line about RKVing "surviving cultists worshiping a tangle of bad math in the ruins of their old civilization"? Religion is definitely an enemy to be eliminated.
