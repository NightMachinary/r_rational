They are certainly planning to spread the truth of Orp-Orp to the humans and have taken up human aesthetics to facilitate this goal, but I don't think they have any intention of doing it peacefully. The backup plan if things don't go their way is to kill all the humans with an RKV, and when one of the human memes starts convincing the captain they maybe he should rethink some things he responds by shooting himself in the head.

There's also the reference to the inevitable mass sterilization that all pre-uplift planets go through. I get the sense that the captain would not mind helping the humans with this if they still haven't done it when he get there, to convince the survivor that resisting the truth of Orp-Orp is pointless.
