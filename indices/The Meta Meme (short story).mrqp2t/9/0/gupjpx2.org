Hmmm.

There are roles that need to be handled in society. /Someone/ needs to grow the food, handle the sewerage, index the libraries.

At the same time, any (major) role needs, at the very least, a Master and an Apprentice. The Master understands the ins and outs of the role, and is able to teach others; the Apprentice will become the Master once the Master is no longer able to fulfill the role (and then he needs to look for his own Apprentice). Furthermore, each Master works best if he has peers; people to discuss his issues with, preferably people who understand those issues; so it seems that most roles should have multiple Masters, perhaps with different specialities, along with the relevant Apprentices.

Now, there are some parts of society that scale with the size of the society. For instance, the percentage of people involved in growing food to feed the society is, well, dependant on technology; but it's a /percentage/. The number of people doing Science and making new discoveries is different - the percentage isn't important. Only the raw number of scientists. If you have one Dunbar's Number society, then you have a maximum number of scientists; two such societies mean twice the Scientists and perhaps one-and-a-half times the Scientific Progress. Even if the other issues with going down to a Dunbar's Number society are resolved, it is going to /smash/ scientific progress.
