I also question the use of Dunbar's Number. In fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that a population of only Dunbar's Number of people (150, apparently) wouldn't even be long-term sustainable on a genetic basis.

Also, there are doubtless more than 150 different jobs. You could probably have a population of a couple of thousand and still have very minimal overlap.

At the same time... psychological uniqueness is almost guaranteed, even in our current world, to my mind. Pick any two people and you will begin to /very quickly/ find psychological differences between them, because psychology has a /lot/ of variables to mess with.
