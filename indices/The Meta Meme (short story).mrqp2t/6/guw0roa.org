Interesting story! My one question/critique (to be fair, I only read this once so I may also have misunderstood it): is the internet really the point of no return here? In my mind these aliens seem to have such a fragile view of memes/ideologies they might as well be freaking out about a German dude publishing /The Science of Logic/ in 1816.
