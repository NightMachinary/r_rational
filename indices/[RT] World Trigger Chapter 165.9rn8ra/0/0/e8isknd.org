I read World Trigger up until the hiatus and promptly forgot about it until now. I agree with pretty much everything here and would second the recommendation. My personal take on it, from what I remember, is that it's a battle manga done right. The later fights feel like there's actual thought put into the strategies and progression making it feel more like small scale warfare rather than two groups throwing powers at each other.

One thing I think should be noted is that many of the characters, save for a few, aren't particularly memorable. Part of this is the same-face syndrome that inevitably affects character design without crazy hairdos or facial structures. I didn't quite become invested in any of the characters until many chapters in which probably contributes to the general consensus that the story had a slow start.

Overall, I think if you're someone who enjoys battles and fight scenes but wants to see a deeper level of depth to them, you should give World Trigger a shot.
