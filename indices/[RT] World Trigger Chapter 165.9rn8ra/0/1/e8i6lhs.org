Oh, and, (I know there's an edit button, but I'm trying not to make that comment longer) there was an anime adaption, covering chapters 1 though 120. It was generally faithful to the plot, but poorly animated and often prone to cheap pauses and the like. Consensus is to read the manga first unless you really don't like the format, or have really low standards for anime.

Mangastream.com can be expected to produce the best fanmade scans/translations from now on, but they only recently picked the series up, (that is, two years ago, one chapter before the hiatus) so the best version of anything prior to that would be the official release, which has been conveniently uploaded to mangasee.us, which is what I linked for the first chapter.
