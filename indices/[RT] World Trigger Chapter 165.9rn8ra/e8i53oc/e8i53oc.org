Isn't it funny how the thread for recommendations is once a month, but straight up posting a link - arguably the most in-your-face recommendation there is - is whenever?

Either way, here's /World Trigger/, finally out of hiatus after almost exactly two years. The first chapter may be found [[http://mangaseeonline.us/read-online/World-Trigger-chapter-1-page-2.html][here]].

*World Trigger* - sidestepping the "is it rational" debate entirely - has significant rational-adjacent qualities. It's not as explicitly brainy as the first arc of /Neverland/, and it definitely doesn't try for anything more than the thinnest veneer of science, (here's your phlebotinium, now use it) and the exact reason I feel like suggesting it appears to change from time to time. Still, if I had to try, I would put it as a combination of a couple of obvious things, and a number of smaller things.

*The initial premise* is nothing new. We have a Japanese city, we have an alien (dimensional, technically) invasion, we have a mysterious organization that appears in order to mount a defense using exotic weaponry, we have a middle schooler with a mysterious connection to that organization, and a mysterious transfer student. The series revolves around battles fought against these invaders, and between members of this organization.

(Neither of these are the obvious or small things I was talking about. I just realized I hadn't actually said what the series is about yet.)

*The obvious things* are just that. A handful of overused tropes are quickly defied. The main protagonist is a positively sub-par combatant, and has to rely on creativity and wit. Strength of will does not overturn significant differences in power, skill, luck or strategy. Strategy typically matters. Clothing is functional and non-revealing. There's more, I think, but I honestly don't read enough in the genre to compare.

*The smaller things* aren't necessarily subtle, but don't paint the whole picture by themselves. Characters generally follow their motivations sensibly, even the superficially irrational ones in serious matters. Even when nobody's actively doing battlefield tactics, the birds-eye-view considerations (Who's where, traveling where, in the way of whom, etc.) are shown and accounted for. The wits-reliant protagonist is smart, but not a genius, the plots he manages to pull off are within that scope, and other characters are clever as well. The entire organization is generally competent, with a few caveats. In large enough battles, the entire cast is equally relevant, and that's with more named characters than chapters, at some points. Exotic technology is generally consistent.

I'd like to pause here, and say "What it all adds up to is X", except that if I could state X in a clear an concise fashion I'd have done so to begin with. I suppose it either projects or demonstrates a lot of values that we associate with rational fiction, even though it doesn't commit as clearly to them as we would expect from a (good) rationalist fanfic. One label I've been considering is /reconstruction/, with regards to battle manga, because it does remain firmly in that genre, if with a different spin than usual.

Consensus is it's a slow start, (would have been slower, if not for executive meddling) but I don't expect anyone to jump in at chapter 165, (Unless they're already a reader, of course. There may be fandom overlap.) so I'm not sure what exactly I'm trying to accomplish here. Either way, I shall be happy if it catches someone's eye.

([[/r/WorldTrigger]] is reasonably active, especially now in post-hiatus spring season.)
