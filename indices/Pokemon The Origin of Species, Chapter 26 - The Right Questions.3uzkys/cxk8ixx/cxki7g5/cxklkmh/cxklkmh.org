  Hmm, I guess I didn't write that clearly enough. He didn't cut the conversation off because it took a bad turn: he ended it because she had reached the conclusion he was aiming at (and because he had another appointment. Of course.)
#+end_quote

I think it's just that there's not much transition, so it just reads to me like, "Time's up." Even if he doesn't want the last word, it would still be polite to acknowledge that he's ending the conversation. This can be done with expression, or tone, or a sigh, or a verbal "I'd love to keep speaking with a bright young woman, but...", but I think he needs something to keep from coming across as terse, if that's not your intention. Or maybe I'm just reading it wrong.

  I wish they'd remake Conquest, or just make a new one, for next gen systems :)

I loved Conquest, and the Link system makes so much more sense than most abstract levelling systems, and it's basically how I've been thinking of levels ever since.

  In this case it might also be just more of a "I can't hit that thing flying around, but this is on the ground with me." If not in so many words, of course :)

It's impressive that Spinarak was on its threat radar at all, despite never touching it. I'd expect a naive pokemon to believe that it is being attacked by Zephyr and a mass of string, the latter of which it is capable of retaliating against. But then I guess the pokemon world would put more evolutionary pressure on understanding the concept of being shot at.

  A bit of both. I think even spending your life in a culture that sees certain behavior as normal can still require some processing when it comes time to actually do it themselves.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that makes sense.
