  I think I expected him to try to get the last word, even if it's a nonanswer, but instead the conversation just stops dead. Maybe Leaf hit a nerve? But getting caught flatfooted by a child makes him look weak too. I'm interested in this political intrigue and learning what game is being played here.

Hmm, I guess I didn't write that clearly enough. He didn't cut the conversation off because it took a bad turn: he ended it because she had reached the conclusion he was aiming at (and because he had another appointment. Of course.)

  Also, is that two references now to Pokemon Conquest, or just incidental references to the Sengoku period? The specific phrasing makes me think Conquest. I never seen anyone else who's heard of it!
#+end_quote

I wish they'd remake Conquest, or just make a new one, for next gen systems :) It was such a good concept that fit with the pokemon franchise remarkably well, I thought, and any exploration of the pre-modern age in pokemon is great to me.

  (Completely unrelated, but Kitto recounting seeing the fossils first assembled makes me imagine that the Pokemon world went through the opposite of what ours did. The first reconstructions showed Rampardos horizontal with a bird-like posture and gait, but later findings show that it actually held itself erect with its tail dragging!)

Ha! Now that you mention it, I wonder how much anthropomorphism had to do with the first mistaken concepts of how a bipedal dinosaur would have carried itself.

  I don't think most animals would be smart enough to prioritize Spinarak while they're being actively clawed at by something else.
#+end_quote

In this case it might also be just more of a "I can't hit that thing flying around, but this is on the ground with me." If not in so many words, of course :)

  I'm not quite sure what Red and Blue think is cruel about what they did, though. Isn't that basically what you'd have to do to catch it in the first place in ordinary circumstances? Or are they just opposed to kicking it when it's down?
#+end_quote

A bit of both. I think even spending your life in a culture that sees certain behavior as normal can still require some processing when it comes time to actually do it themselves. People who don't grow up on a farm are usually quite squeamish about having to personally butcher animals for food, and even if it doesn't change their behavior overtly, perspectives can adapt subtly.
