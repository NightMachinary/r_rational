I like Kitto. He reads very much like a decent politician: blatantly scheming and evasive, but seemingly principled and not necessarily evil. The ending of his conversation with Leaf felt a bit abrupt to me. I think I expected him to try to get the last word, even if it's a nonanswer, but instead the conversation just stops dead. Maybe Leaf hit a nerve? But getting caught flatfooted by a child makes him look weak too. I'm interested in this political intrigue and learning what game is being played here.

Also, is that two references now to Pokemon Conquest, or just incidental references to the Sengoku period? The specific phrasing makes me think Conquest. I never seen anyone else who's heard of it!

(Completely unrelated, but Kitto recounting seeing the fossils first assembled makes me imagine that the Pokemon world went through the opposite of what ours did. The first reconstructions showed Rampardos horizontal with a bird-like posture and gait, but later findings show that it actually held itself erect with its tail dragging!)

I wonder if the Pokemon world is sufficiently utopian to publish studies with null results, or if the world is going to keep piling on the disheartening frustration. I'm not tired of Red getting disillusioned yet, though it might be getting close.

Shiftry continues to impress me with its intelligence, and push me further into Leaf's camp. I don't think most animals would be smart enough to prioritize Spinarak while they're being actively clawed at by something else. I'm not quite sure what Red and Blue think is cruel about what they did, though. Isn't that basically what you'd have to do to catch it in the first place in ordinary circumstances? Or are they just opposed to kicking it when it's down?
