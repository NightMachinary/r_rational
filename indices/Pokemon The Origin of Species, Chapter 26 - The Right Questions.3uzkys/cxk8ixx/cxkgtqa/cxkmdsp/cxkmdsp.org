In-group? Enemies? War? What does any of that have to do with whether it is sad that someone dies or is brainwashed or whatever? Even if someone will surely kill me if I cross them, they still have moral weight.

And animals can absolutely honor treaties and codes of conduct, even without primate intelligence, as long as you keep it as simple as "Don't cross this line." I'm not pushing for shiftry suffrage, just maybe a bit of respect.
