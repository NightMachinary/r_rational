I don't find the shiftry's intelligence by itself to be enough to push me into Leaf's camp (i.e, give pokemon an equal or close to equal weight to humans).

The fundamental problem is that shiftries cannot sign peace treaties or code of conduct. Rules will be obeyed only by the human side. The shiftries will certainly try to kill you, given the chance. This means that the two sides are, by necessity, locked into an eternal war.

Can people who are trying to kill you and cannot be persuaded to change really be part of your in-group? I think it is justified to treat them as enemies.

Things get more murky once you captured the pokemon though. It is pretty clear that both the pokemon and human view each other as belonging to their in-group. You will need a really good reason/excuse to hurt the pokemon at this point.

Blue is a rather dark character because he is power hungry, and that makes him apathetic to his pokemon's well-being in the pursuit to power.
