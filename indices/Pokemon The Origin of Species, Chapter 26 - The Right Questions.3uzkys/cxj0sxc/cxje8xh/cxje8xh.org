The best part about this series for me is the whole Pokemon combined with research! I'd support the series for nothing, but some really cool rewards would be things like an Abstract for a particular article on a Pokemon subject, or an article for a more substantial donation. I'd love to see scientific articles on how Water Spout's relationship with HP was discovered, how rare pokemon get their type assigned to them, and different professional journals like Breeders' Weekly or the Journal of Typology.
