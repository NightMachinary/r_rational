This is a great idea, though I'm hesitant to offer rewards that are in any way related to more pokemon content itself, as that edges a bit too close to IP infringement. Nintendo is known to be pretty unforgiving in that, and their Great Eye is ever watchful.

It's possible I could find a less structured way of doing the same thing though, like a podcast or youtube video that fields questions from donaters, including ones like that. Thanks for the idea!
