Hey all, hope your holidays went well. I have a quick announcement to make, and with it comes the need for your feedback! I've been asked a number of times whether I have or will be setting up a patreon, and so far my answer has been no, much as I appreciated the expressions of support.

As the requests continue to grow however, I've begun to consider it as a serious endeavor, but only if I feel like there's something I can offer beyond this story, which will always be free and available here in any case. To start with, I have a collection of other writings on topics as varied as politics and tabletop RPGs, along with other stories and novels I've written or am writing. I'm currently working on a site to put it all in one place, both to make it easier for fans of my work to view them, and to improve the communication between myself and my readers, and my readers and other readers, which fanfiction is notoriously bad at facilitating. So that seems like a good goal for the kind of thing the Patreon would support.

So in addition to the above, what I'd specifically like feedback on is the topic of rewards and donations. What's the kind of thing you'd like in return, if you were willing to pay for a lunch time sandwich? Let me know here!

Thanks, and enjoy!
