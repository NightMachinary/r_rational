Regarding Patreon, I do small pledges ($1-2), and I kinda feel bad about it, because it seems on average people are pledging more, but:

- that's about how much I feel I can afford (I'm outside of what is considered the "first world").

- I think that's actually fair, for literary creators at least, considering that a typical 'mainstream' fiction ebook seems to cost in the vicinity of $10-20, so $1-2 per moth over the lifetime of a web novel would add up to about the market price.

So if you were to setup a Patreon, I'd give you $1/month, and expect nothing additional in return. And I think it's how it's ought to be: it's free, but you can pay what you like to support the creator, not pay for additional privileges.
