On the subject of Patreon, I tend to view it as supporting the sorts of things I want to see exist, regardless of whether they're then released for free for everyone else

You've made something I value, I throw some small amount of money at it in exchange... I'm not really in it for the bonuses, so much as making it easier for more of the original thing to get made.
