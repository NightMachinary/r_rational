Welp, finished binging it.

I like the feeling of realisticness in this fic, I've always felt that Pokemon canon is just too safe. Constantly fearful of Shiftry slicing Blue's head off :v The sense of irony at a tiny Pichu zapping Shiftry into submission was cute though!

My advice is don't mysteriously disappear like many other fic writers do!
