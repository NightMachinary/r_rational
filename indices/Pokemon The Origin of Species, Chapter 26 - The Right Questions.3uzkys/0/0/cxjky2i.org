Dude, don't feel bad about small pledges at all. Hell, people used to buy serial story installments for about that amount back in the old days. Considering the medium, and as someone who gives that amount myself to places like Wikipedia, I totally understand giving within what your budget allows. Rest assured that people being willing to give any amount at all is very appreciated and humbling.
