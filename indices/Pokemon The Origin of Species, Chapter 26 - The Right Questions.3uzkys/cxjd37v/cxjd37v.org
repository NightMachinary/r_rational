Hey there, I've been following this story since probably chapter 8 or 9, and I gotta say I've been hooked and eagerly await the beginning of the month for updates. The world you've slowly fleshed out is immense and nothing short of fantastic. I would definitely back you on Patreon for 10-15 dollars a month.

In regards to bonus content though, I would say the thing I really want would probably be more frequent updates, perhaps on a 3 week schedule instead of your currently monthly one or something? I think it's worth it to consider a time to profit ratio that determines how quickly you push out content. Higher levels of Patreon contribution could mean more of your attention within the month could be focused on weaving the story. You can still figure out at what point you find that the update frequency is too high for what you want to put out, and set a limit to the maximum amount of chapters you can write through the unlock limits.

I definitely would still explore interest in other content/creations, perhaps put out a chapter or sampler here to see how the community reaction is?
