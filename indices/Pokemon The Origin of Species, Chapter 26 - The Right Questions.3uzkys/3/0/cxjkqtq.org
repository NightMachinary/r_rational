  I definitely would still explore interest in other content/creations, perhaps put out a chapter or sampler here to see how the community reaction is?

Yeah, this sounds good. It would take prioritization of certain projects over others, so getting community feedback before I commit to one or the other is a great idea.

  I would say the thing I really want would probably be more frequent updates, perhaps on a 3 week schedule instead of your currently monthly one or something?
#+end_quote

You and me both: believe me when I say that as excited as readers are to see the next chapter and what comes next in the story, I'm at least as excited to get there and share it with you all. Unfortunately, my writing time is already very limited by work and other responsibilities to family, and I can barely make any time to work on other writing projects. So for now I don't know how realistic a shorter time frame on writing new chapters is.

In addition to all that though, as mentioned in another comment:

  I'm hesitant to offer rewards that are in any way related to more pokemon content itself, as that edges a bit too close to IP infringement. Nintendo is known to be pretty unforgiving in that, and their Great Eye is ever watchful.
