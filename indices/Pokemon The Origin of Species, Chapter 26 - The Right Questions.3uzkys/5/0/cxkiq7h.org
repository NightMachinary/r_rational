  I feel bad that I'm always complaining about something regarding the scientific publication, but in any scientific case, the Abstract should not be done. The abstract is pretty much the last thing to be done as it should transmit an overview of the problem and the obtained results and conclusions. For future reference[1] . It's usually the smallest piece of text where people spend more time for very good reasons.

Don't feel bad, this is the kind of feedback that's arguably more important than any other :) In this particular case I already know what an abstract is (Red is using the "do as much as you can when you can and change it later as needed" method of work) but I'm very appreciative of any feedback about scientific issues as a rule!

  Regarding Patreon, I'm not really currently available for performing that kind of investment, but supposing I would be in a few months time, what leaves me more indecisive is really not knowing what other kind of writings you are offering. Perhaps once you have your personal site up, it will be easier to evaluate if I think the investment is worthwhile.

No problem, my optimistic expectation once it starts is that maybe 1/100 readers will actually participate in the patreon (probably heavily weighted toward readers from [[/r/rational]] than FF), and I'm treating each donation as a pleasant surprise and personal incentive, not a goal.

Once my site is up, as you say, then hopefully other things I have to offer are received well too :) Any ideas in what you'd like to see? My non-fiction writing tends toward political/social commentary, reviews and critiques of books/TV shows/games, and instructional articles on tabletop game playing (as GM or as player).
