I feel bad that I'm always complaining about something regarding the scientific publication, but in any scientific case, the Abstract should not be done. The abstract is pretty much the last thing to be done as it should transmit an overview of the problem and the obtained results and conclusions. [[http://users.ece.cmu.edu/%7Ekoopman/essays/abstract.html][For future reference]]. It's usually the smallest piece of text where people spend more time for very good reasons.

Regarding the rest of the chapter, I found it well accomplished how Blue re-evaluated his priorities before he got himself too deep. I was thinking to myself that he was being too hurried in his actions and it was good enough for his mental thoughts to also reach that conclusion.

Regarding Patreon, I'm not really currently available for performing that kind of investment, but supposing I would be in a few months time, what leaves me more indecisive is really not knowing what other kind of writings you are offering. Perhaps once you have your personal site up, it will be easier to evaluate if I think the investment is worthwhile.
