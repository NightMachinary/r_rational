To an extent. The weight of that drops off sharply as the first few people confirm that it makes sense to think something strange is going on. (Because then, either I'm sane, I'm building an insane cult of a certain popularity, or I'm sufficiently detached from reality so as to hallucinate that people believe me, so convincing addition people after the first several may not help determining additional sanity. It would also be important that the particular people i convinced aren't particularly prone to believing in supernatural things and conspiracy theories, or the type prone to playing along with a crazy person's delusions to avoid upsetting them.)

But yes, if literally no one but me experiences these things or in any way confirms that there's some form of unusual phenomenon going on that can't be explained strictly by me hallucinating and confabulating explanations around it, i think insanity should be pretty high up there as a hypothesis.
