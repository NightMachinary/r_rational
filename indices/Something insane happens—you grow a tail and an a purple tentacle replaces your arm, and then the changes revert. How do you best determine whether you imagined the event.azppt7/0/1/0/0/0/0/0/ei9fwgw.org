Does the protagonist /have/ to be 100% rational and immediately check themselves into a mental institution? As a reader, having the protagonist acknowledge that they're /probably/ hallucinating but still investigating it because of a strong feeling of it being real would be enough for me to feel that their actions are plausible.

If it were me, assuming I also didn't seek help immediately, I would keep track of when it happens and what my environment is like to see if there are common threads between occurrences. I would start recording myself whenever socially appropriate. I would search internet forums for mentions of similar occurrences, and see if I can gain some sort of insight from other people discussing the phenomenon (even if I can't ever be sure that it's not just some crackpot on the other side of the screen).

If I found someone who talks about an experience with the /exact/ same thing that I was experiencing, I could use that as evidence that I'm not insane, although it certainly wouldn't be proof.

I'd try to record myself knocking something over with the tail/tentacle/other anomalous appendages. If the recording shows things moving when I couldn't have touched them, that's pretty good proof of it being real. I would ask someone else to look at the footage too to confirm.

It would be very difficult to convince anyone this was real. From an outsider's perspective, any footage could have been faked. I don't think I would even try releasing the information to the public, although I could probably manage to convince a few close friends if I was able to interact with things using the appendages in ways that are clearly supernatural.
