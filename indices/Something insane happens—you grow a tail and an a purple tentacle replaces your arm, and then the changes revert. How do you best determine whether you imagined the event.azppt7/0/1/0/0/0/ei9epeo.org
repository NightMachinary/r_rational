How does the fact that it can't it be filmed manifest? That would make me suspicious that it was a delusion. Anyway, once I somehow determined that I wasn't hallucinating which is a /very/ tall order I'd be trying to convince more people that it was real. And if I find that I can't for some reason, it would increase the probability that I was insane. I'd probably go live in an environment with lots of other people so they can observe the phenomenon. I'd also find other ways to make records if not video (E.g. put the tentacle against a mold, douse the tentacle in paint and press it against things, take a video of the tentacle's shadow, etc)

I wouldn't bother limiting the spread of the information, I see no a priori reason to assume the information is dangerous or should be kept closely guarded.
