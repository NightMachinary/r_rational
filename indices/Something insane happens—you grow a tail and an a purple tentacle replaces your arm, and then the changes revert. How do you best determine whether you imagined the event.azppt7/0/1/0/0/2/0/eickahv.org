If I become aware that weird things are happening I generally go "oh, I'm dreaming, interesting" and try to take control inside the dream. This either makes me lose conscious awareness again and fall back into a full dream state, or wake up, or (on occasion) dream that I've woken up, which is followed by my realizing that I'm dreaming again and waking up for real.
