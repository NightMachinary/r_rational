My first reactions would be assuming that I was hallucinating, assuming a workday I would probably take the rest of the day off and try to relax.

If the event repeated, I would then attempt to discover if it was actually happening or if it was all in my head. Mostly by escalating the proof, keeping it private at first. Trying to acquire video evidence and reviewing it as the first step, then physical-effects (tentacle-in-spray paint print), very small wound (paper-cut-sized) in tail/tentacle (Does it hurt? blood sample - same red blood, or a deeper affect?). Then lastly covering up most of the tail/tentacle and exposing it briefly to outside perspectives (other people) to check for reactions at some local mall/store.

If people reacted to exposed tail/tentacle then I'd know something was definitely going on and probably head to a hospital. I would give everyone some excuse if they are freaking out (Haha, cool costume/prosthetic right?).

If it was constantly fading/in out. I would probably get near a hospital (in the parking lot etc) then run in when it's visible again and try to get it professionally checked out (X-ray, MRI, Blood sample) to see if it was malignant.

Either way, also investigate possible “causes”, anything out-of-the ordinary happen lately? Exposed to something, something in the food/water? Replace food, acquire bottled water, add house-water-filtration system.
