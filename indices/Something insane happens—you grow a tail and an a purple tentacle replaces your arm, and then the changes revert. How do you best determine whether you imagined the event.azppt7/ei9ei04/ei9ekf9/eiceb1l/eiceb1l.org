While I get your point, having hallucinations is not the same as "being insane". Mentally healthy people hallucinate vividly on a daily basis, or rather on a /nightly/ basis. Of course, figuring out if you are dreaming,while awake or not, has many of the same issues as the question you are asking.

But if you want the character you're writing who is experiencing the body change to feel rational, it's important to have them go with Occam's razor to ask the better questions at an early stage. That is "How can I figure out if this is a dream or hallucination? What caused it?" and not "How should I cope with and prepare knowing that my body at any time could change to have a tail and tentacle again?"
