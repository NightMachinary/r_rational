I've thought about this approaching the age schizophrenia likes to appear, set up a dead man switch that requires a clear thinking activity taking about ten minutes daily to send a message to someone saying you might be going crazy and need checked in to a hospital, do not trust what you say after you read it. Document on paper your experience, take as many photographs videos and audio recordings of things that seem weird. If you have clear thinking for ten minutes you should have at least a chance to review evidence and notes and see if your experiences line up with reality. If they fail to be captured on film or audio then the only factor is how much of a detriment they are to you daily, versus the likelihood it goes away, and the detriment being in a psych ward would cause you. If you see little green men jumping on a roof and that's it I'd keep the switch but just go about life knowing it's probably fake if they cant be recorded or interact in a provable way. If voices start talking to me and I start believing them I'd hope to be able to let the switch go or self report myself.
