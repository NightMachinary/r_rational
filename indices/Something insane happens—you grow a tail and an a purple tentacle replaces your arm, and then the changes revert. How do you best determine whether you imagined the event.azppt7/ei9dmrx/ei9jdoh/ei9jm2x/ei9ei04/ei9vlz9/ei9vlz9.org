Firstly: being insane does not mean that the transformation wasn't real. Indeed, you only know that it happened to your arm externally, but there may have been any number of internal changes, including in your brain, and you don't know that they all turned back.

Secondly: this is clearly the domain of Tzeentch, and if the flesh change is already upon me then there may be very little time before the grip of spawndom takes me completely. Giving my soul over to the Architect of Fate will award me both the knowledge I seek regarding that transformation and the additional, more lasting alterations that I crave. With luck, service to the Changer of Ways will grant some measure of control and reserve to these fluid, unstable mutations such that I can stave off spawndom for a time in pursuit of more prestigious fates.

Rationality? Pfft. Sanity is for the weak.
