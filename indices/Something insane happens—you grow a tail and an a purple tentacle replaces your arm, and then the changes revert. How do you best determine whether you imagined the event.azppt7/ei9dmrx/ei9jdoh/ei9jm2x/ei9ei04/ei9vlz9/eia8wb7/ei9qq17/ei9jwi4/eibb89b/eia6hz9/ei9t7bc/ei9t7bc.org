I'd start out by trying to figure out if I'm the only one experiencing it. So, I'd make an oblique reference to it online and see if anyone else has done the same. I'd probably describe it as a "very vivid dream."

If it only happens once, and no one else is experiencing it, it's almost certainly a hallucination. In fact, if it happens multiple times, and each time, no one else experienced it, it's /quite/ certainly a hallucination; other than proximity to something weird, there's no way that I alone among 8,000,000,000 people am tuned into some word phenomenon.

If it goes beyond myself... Well, at that point, you just have to break it down. Look at the factors before it happens again.
