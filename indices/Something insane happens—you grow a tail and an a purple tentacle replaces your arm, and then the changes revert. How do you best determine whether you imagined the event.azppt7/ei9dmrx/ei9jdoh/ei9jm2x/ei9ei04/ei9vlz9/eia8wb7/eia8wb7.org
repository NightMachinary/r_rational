You'll probably get better answers if you just tell us what the infohazard/thing/event is.

A thing's existence is the effects it has on the world. “Joe is hallucinating a blank paper is a picture of Elvis” and “Joe really has a picture of Elvis but only he can see Elvis while everyone else sees a blank paper” are synonymous.

The answer to your question is, determine the measurable effects of the event, then verify other people observe the same effects. This can include indirect observation.\\
If you have an infohazard that makes people Not Believe In Lizardpeople, you can tell a Friend “the infohazard I have in this box will change people's views on Lizardpeople,” then expose a Believer in Lizardpeople to the infohazard. Your Friend can now verify that the Believer's views have changed following exposure. This validates the existence of the infohazard without your Friend being exposed.

Depending on the nature of the infohazard you might be able to run tests on it directly. If you take a picture and cover half the picture, does it still work? 3/4 the picture? One pixel?
