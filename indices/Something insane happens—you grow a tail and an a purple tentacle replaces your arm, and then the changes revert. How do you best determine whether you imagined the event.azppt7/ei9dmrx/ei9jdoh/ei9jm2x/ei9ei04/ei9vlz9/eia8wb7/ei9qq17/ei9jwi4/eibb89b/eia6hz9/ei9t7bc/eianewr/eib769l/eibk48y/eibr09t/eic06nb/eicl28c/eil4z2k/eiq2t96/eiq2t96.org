I would assume that I had hallucinated it and seek medical advice. Were it to happen a second time, I would make an appointment with a neurologist, in the perfectly reasonable fear that I was hallucinating due to a brain tumour. He'd presumably send me for an MRI scan and then (I imagine) if nothing turned up there, on to a psychiatrist.

If the incident only ever happened once, that would likely be the end of it; I'd end up spending a lot of money on medical opinions and get very vague results back.

On the other hand, if it happened again, and in such a way that it /couldn't/ be an illusion - for example, it a tentacle out of nowhere picked me up, transported me over the Atlantic and dropped me on the Statue of Liberty - well, then I'd start off by assuming that I was hallucinating about being anywhere /near/ the Statue of Liberty, which would probably cause the police to promptly assume that I was crazy in a completely different way to the way in which I would be presuming I was crazy.

Either way, I'd probably end up in front of a psychiatrist, who I would assume at first was a real psychiatrist that I was simply hallucinating a different face on.
