If in public people didn't react to the exposed tail/tentacle. To try and remove any doubts of my own sanity I would try to demonstrate (impossible) physical effects using the changed limbs in public to further gauge their reactions. Lifting a shopping bag with the tail and carrying it around would be a simple demonstration. Holding it in front of someone's travel path to see if it's “invisible” or if it has some sort of congito-awareness altering effect to it.

(People walk into it, or people path around it)\\
See if people can touch it/freak out if they do touch it.

Now, this is where I'd have problems with the “additions” with other people's awareness being altered one way or the other I would pretend said limbs were “normal” but I'd fake an injury to try and get an X-ray of the two areas to see if other media can pick it up. Wrapping the arm/hand up in ice packs. “I fell down the stairs doc, and my hand and tailbone hurt an awful lot, I think I landed badly on both of them”.

If I still get no reaction from anyone even from the xrays, then I'd give up on making others aware of the changes. I'd record everything I could about them myself (length, dexterity, strength, color (is it purple, exactly what shade of purple?) etc) taking copious notes and video/pictures. Continuing to live “normally” with the changed limbs (just keeping them exposed as if they were normal limbs) while checking to see if the flesh spreads, color changes, strength/dex checks, time of fading/in out changes etc. See if I can force differences by doing a wide variety of things, diet changes, weight changes, length of the tentacle/tail stretches. If no one else can perceive the changes then I wouldn't worry too much about it.

If the effects spread/got worse, I would probably freak out about it privately. Slowly turning into some sort of tentacle creature would certainly put a crimp in my mood. But as long as no-one else could perceive the changes there really isn't anything that anyone could do and I'd just look crazy by trying to draw attention to it. So I'd just try living with it and seeing how far the cognito-hazard effects extend by performing some minor criminal acts, use the tail to steal shopping bags/purses/wallets/laptops to see if people react. If not, increase criminal activity.

Why?

Several reasons, Ultimately since other people's perceptions have become warped in regards to the increasing changes, then any injury or illness would have to be tended to by myself without outside assistance.

Future (unknown) changes might cause me to become immobile or cause physical impairment or my body might require a different diet or require mobility devices (motorized wheelchair, wheel-chair access the house). Or the cognito-effect might wear off when the changes complete, rendering me as some sort of tentacle-monster which would be "ill-advised" to wander the streets and/or hold down a normal job and would require delivery service for basic needs (grocery delivery, etc).

I would use this new “mixed-bag of shitty superpowers” to slowly acquire additional funds (robbing jewelry stores) via tail sneaking into the display counter targeting 24c gold-jewelry, melting it down into bricks, tossing most of the gems (most are engraved with serial numbers) and sell the gold bricks)

Try using some makeup/hollywood-style prosthetics to alter my face/features for longer term criminal activity for the jewerly stores. Jewelry keeps dissappearing while "this guy" is standing nearby.

Use jewerly store acquisitions to fund gambling, use tail to alter roulette wheel's ball to ensure a single win on a bet. Call it quits after a single massive win. (guy comes in, puts all his money on a single number, wins big and leaves). Suspicious yes, but with only a single data point, and video-evidence which probably shows the ball behaving oddly but "me" not near it and without any electronics on me (leave the phone in the car). Cash out, pay taxes.

And purchase medical equipment (Xray, MRI, sonogram), medical books (how to do blood tests, run an xray etc) basically set up my own little lab/doc office to both track changes and see where it is all going and possibly retire from job if changes are becoming too cumbersome.
