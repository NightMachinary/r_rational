I think this is incorrect from a first-person perspective. When you have limited visibility to a phenomenon, you may only see a piece of the pattern which might cause the appearance of a temporary weirdness even though it may be consistent in a system. A few examples off the top of my head:

1. You live in a universe with multi-versal properties, but for some reason another universe starts superimposing on yours at constantly moving touchpoints; you happen to get caught in one.
2. The temporary weirdness from your perspective is the result of a being with higher power making a conscious decision to start and end the weirdness. Perhaps a wizard playing a prank; you have no way of determining this so the weirdness seems both temporary and arbitrary.
3. The universe is, in fact, permanently weird but you have no way of noticing this with your given sensory receptors.

From a first-person perspective, the universe can absolutely appear to go weird temporarily rather than permanently.
