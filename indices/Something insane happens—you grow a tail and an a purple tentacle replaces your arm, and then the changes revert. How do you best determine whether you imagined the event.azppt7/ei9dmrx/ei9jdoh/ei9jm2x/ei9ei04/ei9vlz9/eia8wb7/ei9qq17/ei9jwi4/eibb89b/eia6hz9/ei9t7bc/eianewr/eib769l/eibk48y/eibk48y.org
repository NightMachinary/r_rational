Assuming video/in person corroboration is impossible due to infohazards, I would do something that can only be done with a tentacle to create physical evidence.

E.g., arrange some letters in a Klein bottle if it's a thin tentacle. Clean the gap between my washer and drier. Make a green stuff cast of my arm/tentacle. Etc..
