Look for any physical evidence, first - tentacle slime or something? It may not be detailed enough to convince anyone else, but at least you can convince yourself you're not crazy.

Either way, write down that it happened, because it's easy to forget dreams. Do a quick online search for hallucinations, see if there's anything that matches your symptoms. (I don't /think/ hallucinations are normally one-offs, but I'm not a psychiatrist).

Then just wait for it to happen again. Whether it happened or not, you're not going to learn anything actionable from one instance. You need a pattern - what makes it happen, can you control it or stop it happening, etc. E.g., if it's a hallucination, you might notice that nobody else can see it when it happens, or that the tentacle never does anything your arms couldn't do.

If it was a one-off, then you don't have enough information to do anything, so you may as well forget about it.
