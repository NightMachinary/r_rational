You're presuming your understanding of physical laws, and the immutability of those laws, is correct.

For all we know, we might actually be living in the Gnostic Neo-Platonist reality-prison of [[https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Mage:_The_Awakening][Mage: The Awakening]]. A universe where all natural phenomena are just emanations of deeper, Supernal symbols. A universe where you, a Sleeper, cannot even perceive or recall the true nature of reality, because all Supernal truth has been hidden from you by the cosmic censorship of the Lie. A universe where [[http://gunshowcomic.com/comics/20081015.gif][asshole wizards]] who have Awakened to Supernal truth can upend the rules of reality at a moment's notice.

For instance, control over the bodies of animals, including humans, is the purview of the [[https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Life_(MTAw)][Life Arcanum]]. At level 4, a Life Mage "can alter the features of another person or give them the traits of a base or median life form", which would absolutely include turning a person's arms into tentacles, or giving them a tail. And from a Sleeper's point of view, it would absolutely seem like their body just inexplicably turned weird, before changing back equally inexplicably (in reality, the Lie overrode the spell and re-asserted itself).

That said, Life 4 is a pretty high (and rare) degree of mastery, and a Mage of such proficiency probably wouldn't be going around zapping random Sleepers with body-mod spells. Especially since using magic in front of Sleepers triggers Paradox, as the Lie asserts itself and punishes the Mage for pushing against it.

Then again, I've heard of a Mage party using magic to break someone's washing machine and flood their basement, purely out of spite. So a Life Adept might well do something like this, if only once. Just because you have access to cosmic truth doesn't mean you're going to use it responsibly.
