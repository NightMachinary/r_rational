These hypotheses are all anthropomorphic / are wrong for the same reasons that religion is wrong (they privilege a human perspective).

The universe /actually/ getting weird laws on a local level in a way that is explainable when you look at the big picture would range from "oh how interesting there was a huge peak in this spectrograph from 1990 onwards with no discernible cause" to "oops the observable universe just got destroyed because some fragile cosmic bubble somewhere just popped".

It absolutely wouldn't be "a tentacle appeared on your body". If that's the kind of weird you are experiencing, it is a product of your brain.
