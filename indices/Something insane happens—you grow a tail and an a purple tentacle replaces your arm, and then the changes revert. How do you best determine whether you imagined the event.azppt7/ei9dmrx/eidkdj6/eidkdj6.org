I agree I wouldn't assume it was real, but I'd probably look for other proximate causes for me hallucinating rather than just ignoring it and going on with my life.* Hallucinations are very rare and almost always accompanied by larger issues. not just spontaneously happening.

Hypothesises would be:

- Have I accidentally consumed a hallucinogenic substance? e.g. I think there's some kinds of mold that do it, or someone could hae spiked my food/water with lsd. If I have been at a party or group meal in the last 24 hours I would check with other people there to see if they're okay. I'd check if the supermarkets or re4staurants I'd gotten food from had any health scandals in the news, etc.

- Do I have any family history of psychosis?

- Have I suffered any other symptoms that a quick google tells me are associated with conditions that cause hallucinations, e.g. headaches, dizziness, nausea. An based on that is it likely I have a brain tumor or something else needing urgent attention?

- is there some unexpected side effect of any medication I'm on?

- Have I been sleeping enough, hydrated enough, etc
