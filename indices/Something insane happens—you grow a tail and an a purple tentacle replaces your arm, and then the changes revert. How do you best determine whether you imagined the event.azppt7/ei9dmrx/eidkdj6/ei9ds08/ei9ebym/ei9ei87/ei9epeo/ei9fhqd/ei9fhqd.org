If it can't be filmed, we could film the physical effects it can have on the world to confirm the possibility of it being real. Say you can control the tail? Take a picture or film yourself holding something at maximum distance. Said item should look like it's effectively floating in air. This would allow you to confirm for yourself that it's real, though others might assume it's simply a picture taken while the item was thrown in the air.

If you don't have control over said tail, weigh it down against something hip-high and set something on it, tissue/paper/etc and take a picture. Confirm "floating" object is in picture from friends/family after event has faded.

Same for the tentacle, but since it's replacing your arm, the ability to verify it is much more difficult. It depends upon the location/mechanics of said tentacle. If it's not filmable, then that's much more difficult because it'll just appear to be a normal arm...albeit one that could be in really contorted/weird shapes when filmed, potentially. If the physical locations/relationship of the tentacle doesn't match a picture of said arm, say, in a tight spiral shape vs the arm simply showing bent...The only way I can think of to realistically confirm that it's real would be to create an object/container shaped such that an arm is unable to contort in without destroying the arm, and place something at the end of said shape and film the removal of that object with the tentacle.
