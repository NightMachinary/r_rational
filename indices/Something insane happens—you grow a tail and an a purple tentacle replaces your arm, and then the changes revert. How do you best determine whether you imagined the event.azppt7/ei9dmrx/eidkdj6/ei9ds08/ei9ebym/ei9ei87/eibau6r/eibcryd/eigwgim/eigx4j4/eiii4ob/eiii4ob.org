I don't know what you mean by the word rationality since the way you are using it doesn't appear to make sense.

All reasoning gets based on deduction or induction which boils down to operant conditioning.

If you have an unjustified certainty in something you can determine that you are mentally ill if you retain enough of your mind to notice inconsistencies. Consider if you have an unshakeable belief that 2+2=3 without affecting the rest of your math skills. If asked to solve math problems involving it you would be able to tell that your math doesn't add up even if you won't be able to identify the specific issue.
