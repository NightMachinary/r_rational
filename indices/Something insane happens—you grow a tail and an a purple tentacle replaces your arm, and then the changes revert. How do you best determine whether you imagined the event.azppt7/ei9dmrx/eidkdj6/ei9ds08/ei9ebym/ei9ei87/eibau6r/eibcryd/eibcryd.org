I'm guessing either that I shouldn't be so certain about rationality, or that I shouldn't take feelings of certainty as evidence of cognitive bias / mental health issues... but I'm not sure which one, so I guess I don't necessarily see where you're going.

Taboo rationality, my supposed "certainty" in /what/, exactly?

(I suspect it might /also/ help to be cautious about using the word "certainty")
