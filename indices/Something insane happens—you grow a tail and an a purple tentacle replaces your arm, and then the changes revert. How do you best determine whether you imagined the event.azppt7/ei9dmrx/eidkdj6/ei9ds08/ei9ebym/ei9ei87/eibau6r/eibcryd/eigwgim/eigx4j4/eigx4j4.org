You didn't play along though, you were supposed to be tabooing the word rationality.

You're hiding a lot of concepts (and presuming things that I believe, that I might not actually believe) behind the word "rational" and tabooing the word "rationality" was supposed to reveal that the reason why it's ultimately justifiable and consistent to have an epistemology and apply it even under conditions where insanity is suspect.
