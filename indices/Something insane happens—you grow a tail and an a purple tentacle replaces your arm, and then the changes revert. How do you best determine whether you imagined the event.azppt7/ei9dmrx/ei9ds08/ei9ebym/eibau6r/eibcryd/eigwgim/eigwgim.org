You apply rationality on a meta level, to justify what belief is worth assuming of being truth. This really means you use rationality to justify belief in rationality. And yet you are sure you are not mentally sick - you even take it as an evidence that you are not. Which, by extending the example you given before, is an evidence of being mentally ill. 'if I was sure something is true it would be evidence something is wrong with me - I am sure about it!' is contradicting itself.
