If it was just that no one but me could see it in any recorded format (including molds, paint prints, pictures of the shadow, etc), I don't think it would be possible to convince me in my right mind that it isn't a delusion.

If additionally the mind influencing magic of the thing overrode that and made me believe it was real...well, I guess I'd try to see what happens if I could convince at least one person. Does anything bad seem to happen to the people I convince or do I just never convince anyone?
