if it happened i'd probably first just guess i had dreamt it and move on, if it happened again i'd probably show it to someone i know that i trust and is close, so either i'm insane or they can confirm i'm not.

if i'm not negativly affected by the change, like getting tired or anything like that i'd probably just roll with me being insane and move on with my life, might talk to my family about it but since it seem like no big deal in general and it's the only thing that happen i'd just be a bit afraid the hallucinations would escalate.

if my pants break because of the tail i at least have proof something shifty is going on, and i might be curious about what so it's a pretty important point.
