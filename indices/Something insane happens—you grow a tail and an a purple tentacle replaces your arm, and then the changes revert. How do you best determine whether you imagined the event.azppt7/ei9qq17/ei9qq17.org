I run into people all the time who describe things they dreamed about as if those dreams had some deep meaning that implies something magical about the real world. I think if you're actually honest with yourself you have to treat anything that happens in dreams or hallucinations as unreal.

However, I have never had an experience in a dream that was clearly real... where that details of it persisted for longer than I was paying attention to them, and when I returned my attention to an imagined object or place it remained the same. In a lucid dream, performing that kind of analysis either wakes me up (as if the dream itself depends on my being in a state of mind that precludes analysis), or I lose the ability to effect the dream and the awareness that I'm dreaming.

So, if a physical event happens and it's persistent and analyzable, I have to assume that it's real or that my mind is broken beyond anything I've ever heard of being possible. I don't know how long it would have to persist before I'd accept its objective reality, but I'd say an hour would be well over the threshold but a few seconds isn't.
