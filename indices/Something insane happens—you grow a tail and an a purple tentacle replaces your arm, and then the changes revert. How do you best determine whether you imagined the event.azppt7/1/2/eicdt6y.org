This is a good way of examining this question: How did rational people who've had hallucinations that were abnormal react?

I once had my home TV start showing things in 3D in my room, while I was in bed watching a twitch stream. I concluded that my sleeping meds had kicked in and I shouldn't try to fight them any longer to watch the end of the match. Easy enough decision even though I did keep watching for a while just for the slight amusement of knowing that I was having a hallucination. Knowing that didn't make the 3D effect of my TV look less real at the time. What made me certain it wasn't real was basically that me having a hallucination from taking sleeping pills was much more likely than my TV suddenly having 3D capabilities, so I turned it off an went to sleep since I clearly needed it.

In hindsight I'm a bit sad I was too tired to think of trying to set up an experiment of moving my head to see some piece of game information that was previously obscured behind something else in the 3D display, since I shouldn't be able to gain new (correct) info from my hallucination and it would have been fun to see how my mind would try to solve that dilemma; if my mind made up info to fill that spot, what would I experience if/when that info was revealed in the "real" stream? For example it the streamer commented on the new info, would my, to my knowledge, only visual hallucination turn auditory too? Would my mind, knowing I was trying to see something it couldn't really know, just make up some likely guess, or would it go with it being a blind spot somehow, or maybe some otherwise dreamlike non sequitur?
