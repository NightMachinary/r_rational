Idk. I once was so tired I saw a herd of zerglings cross the road. I assumed it was a hallucination, but just in case it was superimposed over people or animals, I slowed down and let them cross. It was extremely vivid.

I checked the news and asked friends. No one else saw anything odd. I ultimately decided if it was real, it doesnt matter with no proof or hostile actions.

I would likely do the same with your scenario. If it goes away, cannot be duplicated, and never comes back...does it matter?

As for proof, push the tentacle into something that leaves an impression. Like put paint on it and press it onto printer paper. Or a plaster cast if you have the materials. All this assumes you do not have a camera/super computer in your pocket.
