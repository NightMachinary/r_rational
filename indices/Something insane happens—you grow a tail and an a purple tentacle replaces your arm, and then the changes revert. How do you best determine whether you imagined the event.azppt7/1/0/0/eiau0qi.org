it was years ago and I had just started a new job with very long hours. This happened the first week of the job and was how I realized I was sleep deprived (I was so tired I hadnt done the math to realize how little sleep I was getting). I ended up having my mom drive me to work the next day and then slept for 2 days on my weekend.

I used it as a learning experience to make sure it never happened again...but since it worked out ok it gave me a funny story and some nerd cred.
