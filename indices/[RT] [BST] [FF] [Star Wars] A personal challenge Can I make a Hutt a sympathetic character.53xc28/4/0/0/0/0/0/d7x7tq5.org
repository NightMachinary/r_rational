True, heh, I guess the reason gendered pronouns work in this role is that gender is generally superficially apparent, if you know a person's name you probably know their gender too so the pronoun binding is obvious.

If we wanted novel pronouns to be as easy to associate with people.. the only traits I can think of that're as superficially recognizable as gender are ethnicity and maybe age. I don't like the sound of this idea any more.
