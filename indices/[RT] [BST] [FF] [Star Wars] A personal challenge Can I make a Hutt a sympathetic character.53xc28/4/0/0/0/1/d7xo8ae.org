My preferred solution is introducing pronouns that are predefined somehow based on context. Not really suitable for English, since we're not at all trained to use this sort of thing.

#+begin_quote
  Kate told Mary that <1 possessive pronoun> dress is more expensive than <2 possessive pronoun> but that <2 subjective pronoun> could look stunning in rags, whereas <1 subjective pronoun> always felt ugly no matter what <1 subjective pronoun> wore.
#+end_quote

Using hypothetical pronouns oss/om/oms, toss/tom/toms:

#+begin_quote
  Kate told Mary that /oms/ dress is more expensive than /toms/ but that /toss/ could look stunning in rags, whereas /oss/ always felt ugly no matter what /oss/ wore.
#+end_quote

I don't like that specific choice of labels for the pronouns, but hopefully it illustrates that the concept could be useful, if ungainly, for resolving ambiguity.

Although another good way to resolve it is to differentiate between the matching and non-matching cases. English already does this in some situations (e.g. "He killed him" vs. "He killed himself"), but doesn't always (e.g. "She lost her keys" for both). Making that relationship explicit goes a long way to solving the problem.

The latter is the Swedish solution: if you don't use a reflexive pronoun (sig, sitt, sin, sina), it's assumed you're referring to a different individual. So "Han dödade hans fru" means "He killed <another man's> wife", while "Han dödade sin fru" means "He killed <his own> wife". I'm not an expert in the language, but it appears to solve most of the ambiguity in the two-party case (for more than 2 it's probably going to be a nightmare in any case).
