One legitimate defense of the ubiquity of gendered pronouns is that without them pronoun bindings will be ambiguous far more often- if you're talking about two non-binary individuals, "ey took eir wallet and put eir key into it" has like 8 different interpretations, pronouns almost stop being usable, and you end up having to resort to names. Bigots should note, though, that this is not a case against novel GNPs, but a case for introducing like 20 new ones and assigning them to people at random to reduce pronoun clash rates to unprecedentedly low levels.

"they"'s absolute ambiguity is one of the reasons I like it. It doesn't just omit gender, it omits plurality as well. Are they an individual, a group, an agent of a hivemind? Not for the reader to know.
