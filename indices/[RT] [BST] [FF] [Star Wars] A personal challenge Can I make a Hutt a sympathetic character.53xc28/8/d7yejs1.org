personally I never really cared for hutts. when I play Knights of the Old Republic even when I was playing a light side character I would go out of my way to kill a Hutt and feel noguilt whatsoever. I mean a Hutt is the physical embodiment of everything wrong.

the majority of them are literally mobster kings, they are the embodiment of sexism and bad hygiene, don't even get me started on the slave trade they enable through their cartels.

are there good Hutts /somewhere/ in a galaxy far far away? sure I'm fairly certain there are. but given Hutt culture, they are few and far in-between.

in the EU before it was discontinued by Disney there was a Hutt Jedi (Beldoron) who was actually quite sympathetic as a character. even if he did go mad and become a bad guy. but he was powerful and intelligent enough to be a Jedi that means he had to have been a good person once upon a time.
