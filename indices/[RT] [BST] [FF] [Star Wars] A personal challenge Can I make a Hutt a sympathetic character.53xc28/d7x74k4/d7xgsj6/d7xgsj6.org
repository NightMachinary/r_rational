I was about to say "to an extent" but then I realised, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing. Or at least, trying to give them any /semblance/ of their own culture at all, and part of that has to come from their shape.

Legends!canon is actually kind of decent to the Hutts - not /good/, but kind of decent. (In the words of my friend: "wait, Hutts are cool?!" There are plausible reasons for why they do what they do, some attempt has been made to get into their heads, they have some semblance of a history and a culture that could be fleshed out and expanded upon...

But for some of the species I want to use (like Toydarians or Gungans or basically anything that was a dumbshit idea from the prequels) people have decided to cut their losses and move on. Which means I need to do exactly what you said.

(Honest-to-god, I'm excited about the Toydarians. They're significantly cooler than presented in canon, especially movie!canon.)

Most of what I'm interested in IS on the linguistic/cultural side of things (I'm an English major, sue me), but you can't have culture and language without it being informed by body shape and size because slapping human cultures onto aliens is just twee and bland and blehhhhh.

At the same time, you have to keep them relatable enough that a human reader can at least understand what's going on with some explication. There's a reason my protag is a bit of an odd duck by Hutt standards. xD
