Well, technically, they're still made up, just by multiple intellectuals over the course of a century and a bit. The fact that none of them have been adopted into common English usage means that they kinda fall under the same umbrella as words an author might make up to describe a phenomenon in their book with no proper word describing it in English. Intelligible to a person who only knows English and is familiar with the particular context of the words, but not intelligible to most English speakers.

Personally, I know my internal reading voice would stumble every time I read one of those pronouns, and as much as they're supposed to be gender neutral the dominance of the letter 'e' means I get a feminine image from the way they sound, so I also wind up feeling like they're not accomplishing their purpose.
