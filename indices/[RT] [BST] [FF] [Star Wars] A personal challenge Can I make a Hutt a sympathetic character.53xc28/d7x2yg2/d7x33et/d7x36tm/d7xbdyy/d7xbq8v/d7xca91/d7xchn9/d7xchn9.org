  In "they is" the multiplicity still is to be inferred from the context, but much less so, since in that case the context needed is only the verb right beside it, and not the whole previous sentence.

I consider the two versions to be approximately equal in ambiguity.

Compare:\\
- =(They are) (a cool person.)=\\
- =(They) (is a cool person.)=\\
The only difference is the location in the sentence of the change in number (and the confusion of the reader).
