Are you going to be rationalizing the aliens' evolutionary and cultural histories?

One of the reasons I havn't touched my star warsish ratfic project in a long time is that every time an alien says or does anything, if I want to do them justice, if I want to avoid anthropomorphising them, I have to descend so far into the task of fleshing out their natural and social history that I usually don't come out again.

You avoid this if you're just importing star wars' aliens and taking the superficial characterizations from canon as the word of god.. but I sense you might not want to do that. You want to get into their heads and the only way to do that is to get into their evolutionary history.
