Genuinely apologize for using such a vulgar sense of the word. What I meant was.. they'll make them maladaptively introverted, gullible, and cripplingly neurotic. Those are some really shitty connotations to bind to "autism" but, uh, I fear that this might genuinely be how the science-fantasy troposphere likes to think of the (xeno)psychology of intelligence.
