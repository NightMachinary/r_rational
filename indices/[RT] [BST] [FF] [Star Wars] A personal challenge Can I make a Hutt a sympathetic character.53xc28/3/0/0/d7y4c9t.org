D'you know if there're any aliens in the star wars universe that're significantly smarter/more agenty/more competent than humans? It seems inevitable, but also very difficult to confront, which is sort of why I'm expecting the answer to be no. Audiences do not want a story about inequality, or at least not from the perspective of someone on the bottom.

I'm remembering these long-necked scientists in one of the prequels, but I'll bet they went and made them autistic to compensate or something. Or maybe they just made them unlucky, or persecuted. Whatever it took for justice to be preserved.
