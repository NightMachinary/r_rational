Ancient Star Wars history is full of examples. The Celestials are just your bog-standard "ancient race" but there's the Kwa and the Rakata who both made great technological advances.

More recently the Givin, Verpine, Mon Calamari, and Duros are considered as the best starship engineers in the galaxy. The ones you are thinking of are the Kaminoans who were responsible for making the clone armies.
