Please remember the [[/r/rational]] rule of brainstorming posts: you have to pay for the privilege by posting a chapter you wrote. This rule is designed to keep us on-topic and encourage people to /actually write/.

[[/u/NotATem]], you can treat this as an advance - which means you'll have to post two chapters before the next brainstorming post :)
