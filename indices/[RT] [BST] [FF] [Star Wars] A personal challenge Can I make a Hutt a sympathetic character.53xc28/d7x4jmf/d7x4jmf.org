This is an excellent premise. I've always thought the Hutts were fantastic characters to write about. If you need ideas, you could give [[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/353476.Tales_from_Jabba_s_Palace][Tales from Jabba's palace]] a read. It's a compilation of shorts from the perspectives of the various alien denizens there, including the slave dancer Twi'lek and the Rancor master. To make us involved with the protagonist you could focus on the treachery and backstabbing that's business as usual in the cartel. Really looking forward to your first chapter.
