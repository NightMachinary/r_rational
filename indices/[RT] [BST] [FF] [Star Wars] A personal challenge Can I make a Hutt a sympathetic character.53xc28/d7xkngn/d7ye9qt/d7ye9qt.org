The gender neutral pronouns are going to be problematic and immersive breaking; I think Orion's arm is the only place I've seen it done well and even there is often broke what otherwise is a lot of YMMV fun and physics porn. Do what you want; if it bothers me too much that is what replace all scripts or text to speech pronunciation customization is for.

That said: write it. I look forward to reading it and hope you pull it off well. I'd challenge you to make the slavers sympathetic too, not arguing for that choice, slavery IMHO is a capital E evil, but as written Zira has been inculcated in a society (I'm not the best on the expanded universe but Hutts=Mafioso) where slavery is normal and a sign of admirable status, so there's probably some initial cached thoughts pointing along the chain slaveholder -> power -> good.
