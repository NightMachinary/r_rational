This sounds like a good premise, and yes I do think it is possible to make basically any sapient being sympathetic. I'm writing a Wormfic right now and have managed to make Sophia Hess, Emma Barnes, and freaking Ash Beast sympathetic (it's a theme of the fic). I don't doubt that doing the same with a Hutt is possible.
