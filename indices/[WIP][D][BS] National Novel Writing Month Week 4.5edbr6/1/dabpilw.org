Welp, this is the final stretch.

I keep getting Facebook "memories" from my progress in 2013, which is somewhat demoralizing since I hit 50,000 words by the 19th. I'm at 41,000 (exactly) right now, which means that I need 9,000 words in the next 9 days, a rather sedate pace.

Plotwise ... there will be some massaging needed in editing. Sister Miriam and Sister Constance, what is even the point of you? You are going to get edited out of existence, or at least out of the final stretch of the story. Or maybe I will find something for you to do when I have more time to reflect. I really liked the idea of a tiny wrinkled old lady kicking ass in complete silence, but I might have to save her for the sequel, since this seems like one of those darlings that Stephen King is always talking about killing.

There aren't many chapters to go until the story is done though, and nothing /too/ serious has fallen apart. I think I am leaning toward the fight/retreat/fight option, which will require more than my 9,000 words remaining, especially if they're as dialogue-heavy as recent chapters have been. (Though I think much of that talking gets cut in the edit.)

And in the final few scenes, I'm just going full on 'member berries. 'member that wolf made of porcelain shards? 'member that ritual that let Adrianne walk on the bottom of the bay? 'member that onyx altar from the opening scene? 'member that ritual where they were going to kill a baby? 'member? 'member Ibrahim's locked away mindscape? 'member the secret wards around the castle? 'member that lighthouse in Sofia's mind? 'member that seed Sister Marigold put in Henry? 'member how Ventor took an oath not to eat or drink?

Not entirely sure how all the pieces fit, but I think I have most of it at this point. Tonight will have time set aside for final plotting.

Edit: As of 11/26 I have 2,500 words until the NaNo deadline, but 11 scenes left in the plotting document, which probably means more like 15 scenes. Based on my current pace, the fact that I'm traveling for Thanksgiving, and the funeral I'm attending, it's probable that I finish NaNo with room to spare but don't finish the book until about a week into December.

Edit 2: Reached 50,000 words written on 11/27!
