I'm another one of the people who checks daily (and did the same last year and the year before when it was published on fiction press) :). I haven't commented much because you mentioned that you preferred not to.

I'm really enjoying this story, it's my favourite stories of the ones you've written so far (closely followed by Glimwarden). The characters are well developed and each have their motivations and their voice. I feel that everyone acts as they do because it fits with their inner motivation and the way they define themselves instead of acting to go along with the story (which is something I sometimes felt with Shadow of the Limelight). And talking about character interactions, the banter between Henry and Sofia really works well and often made me smile.
