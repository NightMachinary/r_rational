It sounds like you were absorbed in the story /because/ you didn't know how things were going to work out for your character and had fun making it up as you went. Since I doubt that you actually have the entire story in your head and only remember the majority of the plot through notes, I suggest throwing out all of your notes (just for the parts you haven't written yet) and start writing again when you think you have forgotten what your notes were.

It's a rather dramatic suggestion I admit, but it's an incredibly useful one. When someone is stuck for one reason or another, if he is forced to restart from an earlier point, then it can be very easy to push past the blocking point when one reaches the block again (as if he was building up momentum to smash it).

PS You may think of just keeping the notes and simply not look at them to be able to keep from losing them if my suggestion doesn't work. But I really recommend just either throwing them out or putting them someplace where you won't be able to read them until at least a week in the future. The reason is because whenever I had an easy way to retrieve my prior efforts, I kept falling into old patterns and couldn't be creative in doing something new. You need pressure to be innovative.
