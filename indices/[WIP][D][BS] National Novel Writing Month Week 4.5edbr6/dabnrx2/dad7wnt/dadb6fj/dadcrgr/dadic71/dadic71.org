You have a problem with endings (see: tonnes of your prior stories). The titanic amount of writing that went into S.I. suggests that you do indeed enjoy making shit up as you go along. While there's nothing wrong with that, actually finishing is something of a virtue.

- Suggestion: in the future, try writing a piece of short fiction, the entirety of which you have in your head, and muster the willpower to finish writing it in an hour or two.

- Suggestion: think about what you're trying to accomplish as an author.

- Suggestion: the deadline of November 30^{th} is ridiculous and arbitrary. Agree to finish it when you're ready, and then absolutely don't renege on that agreement.

- Suggestion: finish writing out the plot details of the story, in the bracket-style method you've already started using, then fill in those brackets at whatever pace you so desire. Put yourself in the mindset of a person reading that part for the first time, and think about a) what they want to read, and b) what you want to tell them.

- Suggestion: re-read /Extracts/ from start to where-you-are-now, and improve. This is not a good idea, but it is an idea.

- Suggestion: what other projects are you working on? Organize and/or schedule all of those (the way you would if it was part of your job), then finish /Extracts/.

*Concluding thoughts:* it's probably important for your personal development that you finish /Extracts/, however that is accomplished. I dunno. I'm not your psychologist.
