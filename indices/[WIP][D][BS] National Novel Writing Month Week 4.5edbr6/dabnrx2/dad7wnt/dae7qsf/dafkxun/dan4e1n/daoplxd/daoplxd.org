I can work on that. ;)

A related note; I finally kicked myself in the rear hard enough that I managed to add a few words of first-draft narrative, instead of a writerly note enclosed in square brackets destined for eventual deletion. It wasn't /many/ words, but some is better than none, especially for my main goal of maintaining the habit of doing some writing daily.
