Whelp, I failed miserably when it came to writing anything for this month. Only a few thousand words to make a first chapter, and a lot of notes on how the rules behind a time-travel power work. I definitely plan on writing the story, but it's going to have to be another time since this has been a terrible month for me.

However, the good news is that I think I have outlined the power well enough that I can base a scientific RPG game around it. It will be something that starts with people finding a strange device and they have to test it via the scientific method to learn how the time-travel ability works. The hardest part is figuring out how players' actions affect future events which retroactively influence the beginning of the quest.

I think I'll start in late December.
