You're fine, you're not a jerk. I just assumed you weren't interested which isn't a bad thing. And if you're not interested, I already have an accountability partner, but I can always have more!

I'm comfortable sharing my writing but I wouldn't want to force it on anyone so I'm happy just sharing word counts. I was planning on starting 1st of Jan, but starting earlier will get me a headstart on beeminder so I think that'll be good.

My story is rational (not rational/ist/) feminist glbt supernatural romance, so you know, not the genre typically most associated with [[/r/rational]] . A 1500 year old vampire and an American deserter meet in ww2 Italy, and fall in love. The soldier is a cowardly man who is scared of death. It's about adjusting to the reality of living with an immortal being you can't begin to understand, participating in Bad Occult Things, and learning to understand each other as their relationship changes as Supernatural Stuff Happens (he's made into a supernatural servant-thrall, then into a vampire, both of which create big discontinuities in their relationship, and he goes from being viewed as we might view a RealDoll to an equal).

Looks like about 50% of it will take place in ~1944-1948, 50% in "present day", and an epilogue about 100 years in the future.

Here's a little context-free 600 word taste of part of it, if you're curious: [[http://pastebin.com/w77NDT3H]] Context: broadly, William has just turned Red into a vampire, and their relationship has grown quite distant as a result. Note that Our Vampires have a thing about giving gifts and writing letters. They have a very rigid set of social norms, and if it is disrupted, the result is often rather bloody.
