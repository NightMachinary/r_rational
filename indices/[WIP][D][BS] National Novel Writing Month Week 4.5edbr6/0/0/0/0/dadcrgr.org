That seems all too plausible; for many years, my creative output took the form of participating in RPGs, particularly the collaborative storytelling kind, and my mind may have imprinted on and canalized that approach.

That's what I was trying for with NaNoWriMo in the first place, but it seems that pushing for simple word-count isn't what's holding me back. :)

Okay: possible plan: Set aside "Extracts" for a /short/ time (as opposed to letting myself procrastinate it into indefinite hiatus), and focus on something else for a week. Maybe start toying with a background for another Solar System scale setting, with the assumption that an EM-drive-like reactionless thruster is workable. And then jump back into Extracts to see if I can give it a proper wrap-up.

Sound workable? Anyone have a better suggestion?
