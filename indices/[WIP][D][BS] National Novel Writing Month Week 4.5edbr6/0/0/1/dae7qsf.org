Good news - I've gotten rid of the ugh field!

It turns out that my problem wasn't nearly as much of a personal special-snowflake issue as I'd feared, but a fairly traditional minor writer's block, and all I had to do was murder a darling. Well, it wasn't even much of a darling, but I'd written myself into a minor corner about the next fully-narrated scene, and even when I tried to focus on writing some other part of the story, my attention kept getting drawn back to that one thing. So, as it turns out, all I had to do was come up with a quick way to write that scene out of existence, and I'm once again eager to jump back into the whole story-writing thing (as soon as I clear up my daily errands and have a couple of hours I can dedicate to focusing on writing).

You may now feel free to slap me upside the head for getting bogged down in and worrying about lower-probability possible causes instead of figuring out the higher-probability obvious thing.

Oh, and I now have further confirmation that I do my best writing in the shower. :)
