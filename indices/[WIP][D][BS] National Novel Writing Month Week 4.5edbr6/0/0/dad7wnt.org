Okay, suddenly an issue.

Yesterday, after watching a cartoon with an emotional impact, I felt unsatisfied with how I've been writing Extracts, and decided to take the day off to work on putting myself into the headspace of remembering that making the reader care about the characters is at least as important as the plot. No big deal - I took another day off narrative writing earlier in the month, thought up some worldbuilding elements, and I'm still ahead of NaNoWriMo's wordcount.

But today, I've been looking at the story draft... and it's not that I'm unsatisfied with it, I just have no /desire/ to get back to writing out what happens. I've done the basic tricks - carried my laptop to various places, put on various background music and/or noises, tried thinking about other parts of the story, tried /not/ thinking about the story, and so on. I think I've got an actual ugh-field developing.

I have thought of one possibly unpleasant possibility: this extreme drop in my desire came just after I figured out the story's complete plot. That is, as soon as I knew what would happen, I ended up with a day-and-a-half(-and-counting) of not having any interest in typing it out. Not entirely sure how I'd go about testing to see if that's actually how my brain is working, or if it is, how to deal with it.

Anyone have any alternative hypothesis, or possible solutions?
