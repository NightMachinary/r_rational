Well I made it past 50,000, so I am technically a winner! Go me. I don't have a novel, or a first draft, or anything I want to revisit except the two short stories though. Things I have learned include:

1. I can still actually write every day, so I should keep doing that. I have signed up for 750words.com as an incentive to that (they have stickers!)

2. I am good at world building and conversation and mostly terrible at action and, er, plot

3. It doesn't count as planning if you don't stick to the plan or even refer to it very much. Also 1b, it's hard to find time to refer to a plan when doing that many words. Perhaps I need practice doing this at slower speeds?

4. It was good to have some other goals in mind, I had a terrible mood slump as soon as I hit 50k, but I am cheered to have hit my other goal of actually posting a thing on here and winning a not terribly hotly contested challenge :-)

5. At least a few people like the stuff that I've been prepared to share, and some have made useful suggestions. I'd like to build a bit of a beta reader group who aren't my bestest mates.

6. My spelling is terrible when typing at speed, and scrivener is largely annoyingly pointless for me at this stage
