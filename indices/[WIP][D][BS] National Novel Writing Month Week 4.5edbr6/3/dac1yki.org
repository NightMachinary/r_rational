Sitting at 45,000 right now. Ran into the first major roadblock this week, a piece of the plot that I realized I really dislike how I'd planned it. Wrote it anyway. I'll come back to it after, like I'll come back to a lot of things. First: finish the smoking book.

This is the second part of the book I was working on for last year's NaNo, but this year I decided to start doing interludes. Interludes are awesome. I get to take a step away from the single-PoV narrative for a few seconds, show something interesting happening elsewhere/elsewhen in the incredibly expansive world, sprinkle in some hints to the plot and/or introduce some character/worldbuilding that'll show up later, and then step right back over to the main character. Also helps me get back on track when I lose steam.

What are your guys' thoughts on interludes in Epic Fantasy?
