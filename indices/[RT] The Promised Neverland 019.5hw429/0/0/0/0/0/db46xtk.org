Huh. I didn't think of that.

Now that you mention it, perhaps a discrepancy between Minerva's books and Krone's story could reveal her treacherous intent, creating a situation where, uh, let's see here...

Mama knows about the kids, but not about Ray. The kids know about themselves, Ray, and that mama knows about them, and that she doesn't know about Ray. Krone knows about the kids, and about Ray, and about Mama knowing about the kids, but not about Mama not knowing about Ray. The kids know that Krone knows about Ray, and that she doesn't know about Mama not knowing about ray. Krone intends to betray the kids, the kids know she intends to betray them, but Krone doesn't know the kids know.

These knowledge-maps get longer every chapter.
