Well, this is certainly a twist.

I mean, Ray was useful, but a Mama-in-training? She's likely to have extensive knowledge of the outside world. With this in mind, what good would William Minerva be? His first warnings pertained only to things that were already known, so any help from him was going to be outside intel. With Krone in the mix... It is 2045 after all. Maybe she doesn't know much about how the world got to where it is, leaving gaps that Minerva can still fill?
