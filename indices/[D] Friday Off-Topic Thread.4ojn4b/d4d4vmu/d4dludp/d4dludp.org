I tried Piracetam but didn't do much for me. Adrafinil has been great at keeping my mind focused and my thoughts positive, the problem is that its expensive (buying 5 grams of adrafinil equals several kilograms of coffee) and I'm not too keen on abusing it.

They aren't magical drugs and while useful as tools, I can't justify the costs of acquiring them compared to the benefits they provide.
