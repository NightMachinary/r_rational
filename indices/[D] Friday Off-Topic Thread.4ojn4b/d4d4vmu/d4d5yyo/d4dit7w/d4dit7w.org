  I'd question the sources your finding claiming they don't because I suspect they could easily be biased depending on where your getting them.

Fair point, although there is extensive scientific research that has been done on many compounds. Not as extensive as we'd need to assure safety, especially at the doses that healthy people looking for enhancement are taking, but still some is available.

  I feel that if any of this worked really well the army would be using it. Goodness knows they didn't have any problems doing testing surrounding these kinds of things.

They are. Obviously officially they are denying it, but unofficially the use of PEDs in the military and in the police is very extensive. And it makes sense: if your life depended on your physical fitness level, wouldn't you take them too?

  On the other hand I haven't actually done the research. Maybe some of them should be more commonly.

Definitely. The issue with PEDs being made illegal is not as much medical as much as it is political, since the whole movement to ban it had been born after the steroids scandal in Baseball in the '90s, and it has been simply pushed along until now. Hopefully with the current movement to legalize all drugs and educate people we'll see them being legalized as well.
