So. Any tips on the best optical solution for adding infrared and ultraviolet to the visible spectrum? Currently Im considering jurry rigging something together involving an oculus rift, but I have no idea what sensors should be used to gather the infrared or ultraviolet data feeds. It would be most convinient to work with a pixel by pixel spectograph, since then it would be trivial to shift things to arbitrary visible wavelengths as desired, but Im pretty sure most cameras don't work like that.
