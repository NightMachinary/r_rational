Is your goal just to detect presence or absence of this kind of stuff, or something more fine-grained? The issue with something like a VR headset is it obstructs traditional vision, so you would no longer be able to get visible light to your eyes.

Things like thermographic cameras definitely exist, and setting something up where you have a thermographic camera that pipes the output to a video encoder that encodes the video on the fly and hands it off to an android device or a google glass like device or something. This would let you watch the video as an overlay or as a HUD in the corner of your vision in addition to being able to see as normal.

So, this is definitely possible, but would be a big project. I'm sure what I just described has all kinds of problems that we haven't even thought of yet, but "figure out how to hook up a thermographic camera to your preferred display" seems like step 1.
