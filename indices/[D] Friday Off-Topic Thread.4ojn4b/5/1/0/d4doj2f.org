Well i was thinking of something more along the lines off Nick Spiker's photography specifically the wide spectrum stuff, where visible light is represrnted just squished into fewer colors. [[https://www.nickspiker.com/photographing-invisible-light/]]

Thing is, i'm not certain of the excact process or cameras required to achieve that result. It might not be practical if it requites multiple shots with different lenses to achieve. Im considering just emailing him and asking. Or someone else really. Hes only my first pick because he was the photographer of the image i found on the wikipedia page for full spectrum photography.
