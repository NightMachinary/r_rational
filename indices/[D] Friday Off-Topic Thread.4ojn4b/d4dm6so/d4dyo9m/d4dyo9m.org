[[http://www.instructables.com/id/Infrared-IR-Webcam/?ALLSTEPS][This]] (and related things) looks like an easy and cheap way to get infrared images. I don't know what it does with respect to the three color channels that it uses (eg: normally "Red, Green, Blue" becoming "Mid-Infrared, Nonfunctional, Nonfunctional" or "Near-Infrared, Mid-Infrared, Far-Infrared" or "Mid-Infrared, Mid-Infrared, Mid-Infrared").

[[http://www.instructables.com/id/Photography-in-the-Ultraviolet-spectrum/?ALLSTEPS][This]] looks like a similar project for a UV camera, but the comments on it make me a bit skeptical to whether or not it would work.

I don't have a good idea for combining them, but a semi-silvered mirror might work to get the same image to both cameras simultaneously, and then use software to combine them into one picture.

EDIT: The commercial multispectral cameras I could find didn't look very promising. They are specialized professional products, with presumably matching prices.
