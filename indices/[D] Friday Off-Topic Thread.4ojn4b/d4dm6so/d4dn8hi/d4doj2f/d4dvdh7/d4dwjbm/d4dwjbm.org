Hmm, that's an interesting idea. You might be able to do it with as little as some infrared lenses. Yeah I have a lot of respect for the bravery of the biohackers. Mostly because they have a lot more than me. I mean I'm still squeamish about the thought of getting the magnet.

Actually, after a few more hours researching how cameras actually work, I think I know what I need. Sure enough, they aren't nearly as convenient to work with as a pixel by pixel spectrometer. Instead they just use RGB filters... specifically, most of them use a bayer filter, which appears to basically be a grid of several colored filters per pixel.

Which is certainly a simple way of doing things, but it means that I can't just constantly gather full spectrographic data and then shift it to visible in varying ways like I wanted to, not with common cheap camera technology anyway.

Rather I'll have to switch filters to change things up. Which probably means that to start my experimenting with this project I should try to find cheap disposable black/white camera sensors, which would presumably lack the color filters.
