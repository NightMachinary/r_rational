I think in North Korea's case it might be possible. But in the abstract, it can be really hard for any individual to take on the deep state. It's built from decades or centuries of habits, and people expect it to keep doing the same thing and keep getting the same payouts. That sort of economic web is hard to disrupt without getting a lot of people on board. Think about Bernie Sanders trying to undo the military industrial complex in the US, it probably wouldn't be achievable without broad support from people inside the military industrial complex.
