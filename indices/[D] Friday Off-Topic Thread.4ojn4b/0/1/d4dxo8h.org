  Obviously this depends heavily on an almost unknowable balance of power inside the country. One of the first things Kim Jung-un appears to have done is disposed with many of the political and military old guard.

- I am going to be worried losing power internally and getting tortured/executed in a military coup first and foremost.

- After that... we need foreign dollars... the current strategy of exporting workers as wage slaves seems to be working okay for that purpose? I would try to use that to build up more modern skills in the population.

- I would cut back on the military posturing bullshit. (I can't think of any negative International Politics side effects to this, but I would be worried about the internal power dynamics with my army generals and such...)

- Cut back on the death camps for my own people bullshit. Seems stupid and wasteful

- Gradually (I'm think over a decade or two) dial back the propaganda from batshit insane with supernatural claims, to only extremely patriotic.

- Gradually scale back the Potemkin villages and stop my underlings from feeding me BS about the state of everything. This is critical for my long term plans...

- I would be divided, long term, between:

  - trying to develop more factories/technologies to produce products for export for a typical modern economy (and then import food/medicine/technology and such to stop the starvation and mass death).
  - Trying to develop purely self-sufficient/"green" technology to support a society with zero environmental impact. If I just ask for this without training my people to stop showing me Potemkin villages and such, I will get BS results. I want to actually succeed at this.
  - When/if I actually get model villages that at least partially succeed (some Potemkinness is to be expected, but I want it to at least develop some real technologies), I will invite Western Celebrities and documentary makers and such to tour it and see how effective it is, then sell parts of the technology to super rich Westerners that can afford it.

- Third, crazy idea... Right now, to do testing on rats or mice there is like a bunch of ethics form to fill out and have reviewed by an oversight board or two. To use electrodes for recording neural data from humans you have to use epilepsy patients that have them implanted already for medical purposes. Genetic modification on rats and mice also has ethical limitations. I will try to create a scientific environment with a much looser set of ethical guidelines, and then attract scientists from across the world who would prefer to work with less ethics. As an added bonus, my foreign scientists get servants and a wealthy style of living, so long as they keep doing their work and publishing papers (in foreign peer-reviewed journals that I know are reputable instead of internal journals that would become echo-chambers designed to satisfy me)

  - A big goal would be developing new medical treatments or important scientific results to showcase Best Korea's scientific community and mock how the Western's ethics hold them back.
  - The major end goal is genetic modification in Primates, then in humans. The techniques are already being invented, not at a level i would want to use on a human, but soon they will be there but no one will be willing to use them. I will sell designer baby services to super rich Western couples and such. Fixing disease, and maybe a few genes strongly correlated with intelligence or good immune systems.
  - I would have the elite Koreans get education and be allowed to work as grad students for these scientists.
