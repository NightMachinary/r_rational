I think, given the situation, KJU pretty much did as well as he could. The priorities, in order:

- *Become worthy* - Other than his legitimacy as an heir, the key here is to establish yourself in the actual power structure, through getting rid of people opposed to your succession and your policies.

- *Accept power* - Establish your legitimacy in the eyes of the people, through having propaganda place you appropriately in the DPRK's pantheon, and making the appropriate amount of loud noise in external politics.

- *Rule* - This is the most ambiguous, but as far as anyone can tell, life for the average citizen of the DPRK has not changed for the worse since Kim Jong-Un's taking power. In the end, that's the only kind of legitimacy that matters.
