I'm reminded of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_Trade][Merchant Princes]] series by Charles Stross. The story is about a family that can jump back and forth between 2 universes, one of which never advanced beyond the dark ages, and the other being modern earth. Most members of the family are raised and educated in the dark ages world where the family's power base is strongest, but the main character (the long lost heir in this metaphor) was raised in our world with no knowledge of the other side. While she isn't dropped straight on the throne with no preamble, she still has influence simply by being able to swap between worlds, and attempts to affect a reformation of the way the family does business.
