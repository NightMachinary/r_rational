Also might work well for world building, but I watched a documentary yesterday about Kim Jong-un and it reminded me of a long standing thought. Kim Jong-un for those who don't know is the current leader of North Korea, but unlike some of the others he was educated in the west. In Switzerland, in particular from the age of around 10 to 18. There was some hope when this first came out that perhaps he'd be more understanding to the west as a result. He doesn't seem to have been, but my question is could he have been. Lets say your told tomorrow that you are Kim Jong-il's long lost son or daughter and will be inheriting the country. Assuming that there is no chance of anyone doubting the legitimacy of your inheritance (at least no more than there was for Kim Jong-un). What do you do? Obviously this depends heavily on an almost unknowable balance of power inside the country. One of the first things Kim Jung-un appears to have done is disposed with many of the political and military old guard.

I for one don't know. I don't think modernizing North Korea would be an easy task for anyone.
