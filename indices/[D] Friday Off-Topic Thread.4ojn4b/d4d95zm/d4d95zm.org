After hearing a lot about it, I recently started watching [[http://myanimelist.net/anime/820/Ginga_Eiyuu_Densetsu][Legend Of The Galactic Heroes]]. /Good vs Good/ and /Evil vs Evil/ are the two tropes I really like and so far this has the former. So really liking it.

What are the books/movies/anime/fanfic that you like which has any of these tropes ?
