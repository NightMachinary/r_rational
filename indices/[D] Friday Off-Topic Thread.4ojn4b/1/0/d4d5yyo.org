I don't know how much it's worth. The conventional wisdom seems to be that we haven't really found any magic bullet yet. Everything we've found seems to have some major side affects. I'd question the sources your finding claiming they don't because I suspect they could easily be biased depending on where your getting them.

I feel that if any of this worked really well the army would be using it. Goodness knows they didn't have any problems doing testing surrounding these kinds of things.

On the other hand I haven't actually done the research. Maybe some of them should be more commonly.
