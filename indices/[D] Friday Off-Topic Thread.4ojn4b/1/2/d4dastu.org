I was into [[/r/nootropics]] for a while. I did Piracetam and Choline along with some green tea, and I wasn't super impressed with the results. Piracetam definitely does something for confidence and awareness for me. However I found that diet, exercise, and sleep far outperform any substance in terms of long term cognitive health for me.

Don't underestimate sleep. I smoke weed to fall asleep now, and I can ensure I always get my 8 hours if I want them.
