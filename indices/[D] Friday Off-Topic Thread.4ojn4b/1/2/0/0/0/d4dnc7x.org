  I haven't tried modafinil. I might at some point, is it OTC?

No, either prescription (not too difficult depending on the country) or buy from India.

  As far as non-otc things go, I find that a microdose of LSD is quite amazing for mood and energy.

I also heard that a single dose of 'shrooms is also very useful to clear out your mind, refocus and put your life back on track. It's something I really really want to try in the future, as soon as I can buy it legally.
