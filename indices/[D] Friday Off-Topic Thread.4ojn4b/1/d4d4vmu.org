What do you guys think about performance enhancing drugs, physical ([[/r/steroids]] [[/r/PEDs]]) and mental ([[/r/nootropics]] [[/r/afinil]])?

I have been reading about physical PEDs for years now, but I was never willing to take the step into buying illegal material from sketchy sources. From the research it does seem that these drugs being illegal is just a matter of "sport fairness" rather than them being extremely dangerous.

For nootropics I have been reading for a decade or so, and have been using Piracetam for nearly a decade as well. It has really been a lifesaver for me. Have been using Modafinil sporadically for a year as well, but I don't like how "robotic" it makes me in my thought process. Plus it makes it hard to fall asleep on that day, which interferes with my training. Pity because aside from that the complete lack of tiredness was quite useful.

Have you guys used any of these tools?
