In [[/r/NarutoFanfiction][r/NarutoFanfiction]], I put up [[http://np.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/4oey74/did_anyone_do_a_looping_story_that_didnt_suck/d4bz8so][a vaguely-fun defense]] of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644][Time Braid]]/'s "portraying immoral choices in a neutral/positive light".

In [[/r/Gundam][r/Gundam]], someone made [[http://np.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/4nbns0/m_picks_apart_the_logic_behind_funnels/d4batpq][a very long (and very late) reply]] to [[http://i.imgur.com/ysQqZP1.png][my screenshot discussing the feasibility of funnels]]. [[http://np.reddit.com/r/Gundam/comments/4nbns0][The post's reception in r/Gundam]] was generally much more lukewarm than [[http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4nbkhm][in this subreddit]].

I really can't tell where these Critical Hits articles should go, most of the time (RT? DC? The worldbuilding thread? I dunno), so I'll just leave this one here: [[http://www.critical-hits.com/blog/2016/06/15/realism-vs-genre-emulation][Realism vs. Genre Emulation]] (or, verisimilitude vs. consistency with the stories on which this story is based).

Speaking of screenshot editing, discovering [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] led to a rather interesting journey of learning how to crop screenshots well. There are many criteria by which the quality of a crop can be measured--no wrapped lines of text; no large expanses of empty space; no interstitial comments that don't contribute to the joke--but they all boil down to how quickly and easily the image can be read on the screen of a phone. The spectrum of "good crop" runs from "minimum effort necessary"--e.g., [[http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png][reducing browser-window width and stitching multiple screenshots together]]--to "above and beyond"--e.g., [[http://i.imgur.com/ysQqZP1.png][editing the code of the source page to make the content easier to read in proper sequence]].

The issue is much more interesting than the [[/r/4chan][r/4chan]] mods' peremptory "Shitty Crop" flairs make it seem at first glance.
