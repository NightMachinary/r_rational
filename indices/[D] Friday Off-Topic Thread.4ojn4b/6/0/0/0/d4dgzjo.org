[[/u/Automoderator]] posts them and the script hasn't changed in a long time. So far as I know, our only sticky has been the challenge threads.

Edit: A quick check of the script history shows that "sticky: false" has always been there. So unless one of the other moderators was manually stickying these threads, yes, it's always been the case.

Edit 2: I just thought to check the mod log to see whether any of the other mods had been stickying things, and they have not.
