On /The Tragedy of Shere Khan/:

Intellect is, from the middle-distance, indistinguishable from villainy. Heroes don't have to think, they have to act. In fact, it's usually better they don't think and we simply forget the heroes that get themselves killed in favor of celebrating the ones that save lives in times of need.

Intelligent sorts, blessed with foresight, tend to do a lot of complaining when nothing is going seriously wrong and (worse!) demanding lots of money and effort for disasters that aren't actually happening right now. When their foretold disaster does, indeed, arrive it turns out that even if we spent money and effort in advance it's STILL awful in ways even intellect couldn't predict... so that money, effort, and complaint is essentially wasted.

Sometimes the disaster doesn't come for decades, but the costs don't seem to decrease and the intellectuals /never shut up/.

Finally, if we /didn't/ spend the money and effort, and the disaster /does/ arrive exactly as they predict... then the complainers stand around telling us "I told you so," and supervising ineffectually, instead of just throwing their lives away like proper would-be heroes.

You'll notice, in most stories, that it's the villains who command armies and plan ahead. The villains set up plots and contingency plans, build cities and fortresses, establish quasi-government organizations. The heroes fight alone or in small groups, dragged through life by the whims of the villains that surround them on all sides...

...the villains preparing for the future, innovating, and generally running the world.
