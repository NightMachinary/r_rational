Good idea -- if you point your laser at the edge of the thing you are both reducing its solid mass and putting sideways thrust on it as the material sublimates.

  Even when we have millions of people in colonies throughout the solar system, the vast majority of humanity will still be living on Earth.

In the short term (a few decades, a couple of centuries) this will certainly be true, but a few centuries / millenia after we first leave Earth, I would expect it to be a backwater. There are more colonies with collectively more resources, and colonies are likely to have higher birthrates.

  Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series

Great series. The feel of it gets different in the later books as he gets older, but it remains a lot of fun.
