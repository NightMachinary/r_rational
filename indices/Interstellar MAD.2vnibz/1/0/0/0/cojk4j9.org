Yeah the laser thing is actually an idea bouncing around right now as a way to redirect asteroids. Turns out its a surprisingly efficient way to do it, though there might be problems with the vaporized material blocking or diffusing the beam. Another popular proposal is to fly a spacecraft close to the target asteroid and use the tiny gravitational pull between them to gently nudge it off course.
