The only realistic defense I can think of against an attack like this is a super accurate, super long range, super powerful laser. The projectile is moving way too fast for anything else to work. And if it's programmed to take random evasive maneuvers as it approaches the planet, it might be impossible to knock it off course before it's too late. Maybe you could vaporize the thing just before it hits to soften the blow or something, but I really don't know how the physics would work out...

I think that in our own history, pretty much everybody objected to MAD, even the participants. Of course that didn't stop it from happening. Imagine the Ewoks in Alpha Centauri launch one of these super weapons at us. Well, what's the best way to insure that they don't forget about it a few centuries later? Launch one of our own right back at them.

Even when we have millions of people in colonies throughout the solar system, the vast majority of humanity will still be living on Earth. I think it's reasonable to assume we could have orion drives or antimatter engines long before the population of humans living off world outnumbers those on Earth. A weapon like this might not make us go extinct but it sure could make us endangered.

Thanks for the book recommendation, I'll definitely check it out. I know Stross is a good author but I haven't read much of his stuff. I'm reading Harry Harrison's /Stainless Steel Rat/ series right now. It's classic sci fi adventure, and it's hilarious.
