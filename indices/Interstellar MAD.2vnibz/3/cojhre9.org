This doesn't sound like the best idea.

Let's assume that you make radio contact with aliens, and then realize that they've launched a rock at you at .01c. Do you assume that they're preparing MAD? Or do you assume that they're trying to kill you immediately.

Let's assume they tell you they're preparing a MAD scenario. Not knowing their psychology, do you assume they're telling the truth, or lying?

Let's assume you know their psychology and they're telling the truth. Do you trust that they won't go power-mad at some point, that they don't have any biases making your death more likely, and that they're likely to keep the code to destroy the WMD safe? In short, do you trust a group of aliens several light-years away to keep your planet safe when not doing so will not harm them (as they're likely dead or off-planet when your retaliation arrives)?

Let's assume you trust them, but want to be sure. Do you stay on planet, or settle around the solar system? If you settle around the solar system, and they know you will, how can you assume that they've just sent a rock instead of self-replicating probes optimized for destroying your solar system? They've already shown that they're willing to destroy your civilization if they need to, and you might be considered a threat.
