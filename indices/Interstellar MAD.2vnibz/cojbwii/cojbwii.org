If you can see the incoming superweapon, there's a decent chance it's possible to knock it off course. Intelligent species should also object to interstellar MAD because of the chance of catastrophic failures - if someone sends a superweapon towards you and says that they'll revoke it later, you're depending on them to stick around for centuries, through revolutions and upheavals. It seems very likely that when the time to revoke the attack comes around, the people who made the code are all dead and the superweapon has mostly been forgotten.

A secondary defense is proliferation to the extent that it's not feasible to destroy the civilization like that.

If you have interest, there's a book by Charles Stross called [[http://www.amazon.com/Iron-Sunrise-Singularity-Charles-Stross/dp/0441012965][/Iron Sunrise/]] which revolves around this idea - a planet is destroyed, and their dead-man's switch activates. The plot then revolves around attempting to revoke the retaliatory attack from completing. (This is the sequel to /[[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441011799][Singularity Sky]]/, which is also worth a read, and should probably be read first.)
