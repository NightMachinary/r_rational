Well couldn't you see it coming, shoot another orion style ship to intercept it, and then turn around and match speeds with it and intercept it, or just have a laser or something to kill the guidance and put it off course. It would take a lot more energy but if you're high tech enough to see it coming it shouldn't be an issue. Then now the planet which launched the weapon is screwed.
