The problem with MAD is in black swan events. The chance of a black swan turning out to be deadly (when considering armed, planet killing missiles) is much higher than it being beneficial. So you have a small tail with hugely negative consequences, over time something is bound to come up.

I maintain that the only reason we're still here with the world's current armament is the anthropic principal. Think of the cuban missile crisis, the Norwegian rocket incident or the thought that any "rogue state" can cause the end of the world. (There was a comic linked on this sub a while back about this but I don't remember the name). When you're talking about interstellar distances, and hence times, the problem becomes worse.
