Say it with me again - wars that play with existential catastrophe and which are even vaguely symmetrical ARE NOT WINNABLE. Not at all. Not even slightly. Not even in terms of second-strike capability. You can't win if you're dead and everything you ever knew is now glassed. The best you can do is retaliation, and it is WILDLY IRRESPONSIBLE to promote that this is a good idea in any way. It is at best the least bad idea, instantiates Moloch, and allows people a feeling of smug superiority which isn't even slightly warranted.
