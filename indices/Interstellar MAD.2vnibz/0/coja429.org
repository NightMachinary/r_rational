Given equal-tech societies, MAD works far better over interstellar distances than it does on a planet. The main thing you need for MAD to work is the assurance that any attack you launch will result in in a counterstrike which you can't stop. Most Interstellar weapons are detectable /years/ in advance of any strike landing, no launch can be concealed because there is no stealth in space, and as long as you live on planets, you can't avoid incoming fire.. at all. Avenge it, yes. Dodge? No.

So, basically, either there is an iron-clad balance of peace or everyone has abandoned planets all together and are living entirely in habitats that don't have predictable trajectories centuries down the line.

Of course, equal-tech conflicts are exceedingly unlikely.

The most likely shape of any actual conflict goes like this:

Elder Society. "Behave or else" Younger (and very stupid) society: "No".

/Explosive device buried in the crust of younger society's home planet back when they were still figuring out this fire thing/: "Boom".

War over.
