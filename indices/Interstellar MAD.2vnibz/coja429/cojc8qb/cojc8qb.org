I think it's perfectly reasonable to consider two equal tech societies in this scenario. Just replace alien civilization with a human colony. After all, we don't actually know if aliens exist but we do know how humans think.

It might be that the singularity never happens because any self-improving AI we invent just immediately fucks off into hyperspace or whatever and ignores us... I mean pretty much by definition we can't predict what it's gonna do.

I know this is a ridiculous scenario I'm talking about but we're just having fun here.
