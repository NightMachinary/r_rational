It depends on other species having the same loss-aversion as we do, else they'll be willing to trade off losing a larger amount of planets just to get at us than we are to get at them.

OR we could just deem it reasonable for most civilizations capable of interstellar war to live at peace, and possibly even /trade/, rather than everyone desperately trying to work out the highly involved game-theory maths of whether they can "win" a MAD scenario and how much they're willing to sacrifice.

OR, presuming sufficiently high-level technology, you can just redundantly back yourselves up using the local asteroid belt as substrate, since it's really much harder to chuck relativistic rocks at an asteroid belt.
