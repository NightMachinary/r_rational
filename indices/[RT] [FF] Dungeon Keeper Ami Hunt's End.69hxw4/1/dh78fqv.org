Its been a while since I last reread the story so can someone remind me why the faeries are there as ambassadors and if they would have any reason to help Ami?

Seems like the spell/s they helped cast isn't disabling her equipment but blocking the screens from showing anything, think being in the ademantite box will break that effect?
