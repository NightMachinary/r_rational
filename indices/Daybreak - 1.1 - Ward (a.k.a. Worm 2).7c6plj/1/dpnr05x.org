Wow, I almost immediately like the protagonist/PoV character here.

She's such a contrast to Taylor - she seems to measure her response and deescalate whenever possible. She also appears very aware of subtext and psychology. Very analytical in general.

While I was writing the above, it occured to me that it'd be a wonderful way to show some character development, maybe of Taylor herself. And so I was only half surprised at the name drop. Damn nice.
