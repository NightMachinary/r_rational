I wouldn't judge it so thoroughly based on a single chapter. It's quite possible that we'll get some sort of a reminder as to who Victoria Dallon is next chapter, or whenever it ends up mattering.

I definitely wouldn't get any of the plotpoints here just from a single binge-read of worm a couple years ago, either - the knowledge of Worm only solidified itself for me through fanfiction later.
