Oh, I didn't mean it that way. You absolutely get the plot points from Worm, it's just that I wouldn't have /remembered/ if I hadn't gotten a refresher over and over from fanfiction.

Worm is /huge/ and I've read it once, years ago, all at once, similar to the person I'm responding to.

This is more me admitting my crappy memory.
