I had a very similar reaction; the text seemed to think that "Victoria Dallon" was going to be meaningful or impactful to me, and it wasn't, because I read Worm while it was ongoing and haven't been back to it. I'm really hoping that there aren't too many more dramatic reveals like that which are predicated on me having perfect recall of what happened in Worm. I'm sure that it works for a particular type of fan, but /I/ had to do a Google search, and there's nothing like a Google search to make a reveal fall flat.

That said, I'll give this at least an arc to show that it's not a story geared toward the superfan.

(My other problem is that I much more readily identify people by their cape names; Bonesaw is far more memorable than whatever Bonesaw's real name is. Same goes for Glory Girl.)
