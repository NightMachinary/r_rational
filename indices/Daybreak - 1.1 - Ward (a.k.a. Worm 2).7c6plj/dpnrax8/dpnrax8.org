I've read Worm, probably about three years ago now. I read it the whole way through and enjoyed it for the most part.

That said, the previous internet bits and the name drop at the end of this chapter made me realize Wildbow is expecting an absurd amount of buy-in for the various plot points to land. I had to google "Victoria Dallon" to remember, even vaguely, who she was.

So maybe following along isn't for me. I don't remember (or don't obsess over) Worm enough for that dramatic final line to mean anything for me, and I didn't like Worm enough to reread the whole thing.
