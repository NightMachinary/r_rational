I think I agree with you that refreshers, be it from rereading Worm or from reading fanfiction based on Worm, would probably have helped my comprehension immensely.

But I never did that and the original story is freaking huge. :)

The lead-up to this chapter is also part of why I think I might just not remember enough to really enjoy the sequel, all the using the first letter, vaguely mentioning what happened at the end of Worm, and so on left me cold.
