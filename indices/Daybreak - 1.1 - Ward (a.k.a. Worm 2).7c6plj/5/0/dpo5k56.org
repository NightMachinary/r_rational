  I had to google "Victoria Dallon" to remember, even vaguely, who she was.

Really? Huh. My perspective almost certainly got skewed because of all the fanfiction I've read, but the Victoria/Amy subplot was a big deal, both were memorable characters.

To be honest, I honestly should have expected this because in earlier incarnations of Worm, Amy and her /were/ the protagonists.
