Not really. As you said, there aren't many books that wait several years before coming out, and those that are do have a BIT of the same issue (looking at you, Wheel of Time). Most novels also don't swarm you with characters quite as much as Worm does, and when they do bring them up they have the same or related POV characters and mention who they are.

But the surprise reveal of the POV character, as in that first chapter, is something I've only seen attempted in serialized stories, in any event. Can you imagine that in the first chapter of a published book when the blurb on the back cover already ruined the surprise?
