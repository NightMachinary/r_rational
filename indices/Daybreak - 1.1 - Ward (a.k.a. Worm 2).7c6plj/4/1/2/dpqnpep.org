Vicky is Glory Girl is the teacher and main character of Ward, she's a former member of New Wave, the team of heroes with open secret identities, she was turned into a monster by her adopted sister Panacea (the healer) who had a crush on her because of Glory Girl's aura's side effects. She has a weak aura that inspires terror in her enemies and love in her allies, along with flight and a forcefield that shatters on impact but recharges every couple seconds. Vicky frequently used excessive force in taking down criminals and enlisted Panacea's help in covering up her misconduct. Eventually Panacea had a psychotic breakdown due to her repressed feelings and accidentally mutilated Victoria into a caricature of herself who was forced to love Panacea, the caricature was hideous so Vicky was monstrous in appearance and had to go to a parahuman asylum to deal with that and her artificial feelings, and near the very end of Worm when Taylor was done being Khepri she dropped off Panacea next to Victoria where she presumably did some healing.
