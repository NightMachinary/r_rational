I was hoping to not reread Worm until the edited version was available, mostly because I really felt/feel like it needed an edit in order to address some of the issues. I think that I'll settle for reading the Glory Girl relevant chapters and muddle through whatever else there is with the help of the wiki, which is obviously not ideal, but reading through 1.6 million words of unpolished work just in order to not have those moments of "who?" doesn't seem worth it.
