Glory Girl's real name is Victoria Dallon, so she was revealed at the end of this chapter as being the protagonist of Ward. She was part of Worm, a member of the group New Wave, notable for having their civilian identities public. Her power was projecting a forcefield a millimeter from her skin, giving her flying brick powers, as well as having an aura that radiated either terror or awe depending on whether the person looking at her was on her side. Her primary defining characteristic was the overwhelming use of force by beating a few (non-cape) criminals nearly to death.

The essential breakdown of her story as presented in Worm was that her aura unintentionally caused her (adopted) sister Amelia/Amy/Panacea to fall in love with her. Panacea then changed Glory Girl's brain so that Glory Girl would love her, which caused some drama, and later Panacea turned her into a mess of elbows and heads. She was presumably fixed by Panacea at the end of Worm, though there's only an offhand mention of this in Worm itself.
