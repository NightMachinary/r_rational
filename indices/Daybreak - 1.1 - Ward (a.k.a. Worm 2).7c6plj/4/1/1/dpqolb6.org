I didn't get a lot of useful information out of the preludes, but basically you should know that the Parahumans Online Forum is up and running (barely), Glory Girl frequents it, multi-trigger events and group trigger events for grabbag capes with similar powers were discussed, Madison the bully feels regretful for bullying Taylor, prejudice against capes due to their inability to minimize damage from Scion is high, there are geopolitical tensions across the multiverse and war might be coming, and there's a cape with multiple personalities who may have put a hit on themself. There's probably more insight to be found, but it's written in an irritatingly obfuscating way so I didn't look too closely.
