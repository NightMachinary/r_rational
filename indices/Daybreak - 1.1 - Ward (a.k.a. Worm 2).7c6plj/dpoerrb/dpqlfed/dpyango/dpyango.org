Glory girl is Victoria Dallon, a pretty blonde hero with flying brick powers and a emotional aura that can inspire fear or awe. She was a unmasked cape that loved the attention, the powers and had a all around kickass life.

Being under constant aura effect fucked up her younger sisters Amy/panacea (strongest healer) puberty, causing her to fall in love with GG. Amy was hated by her mother, suffered from depression, hated being guilted into healing people every day forever.

After the Slaugherhouse 9 invaded BB and Bonesaw forced Panacea to break her "No brains rule" she fucked up and altered victoria's brain to be in love with her. This caused more drama. Before it could be corrected Glory girl was melted by Crawler acid. Amy put her in a sacrophagus made of dead cats and tried to fix her. Jack slash interfered, fucked some more with amy's brain. Amy is then to emotionally invested to restore glory girl to her old form. and glory girl is stuck as a blob/squid/chimera monster unable to move for... some time.

Amy volunteers to go to prison. Is released prior to golden morning. Skitter and Co beats Scion. In the last chapter its aluded to that Amy goes to meet Glory girl and their Mom.

Then a few years of time skip lands us at this new story. Presumably Amy or Bonesaw (she reformed into a good girl) fixed Glory girl at some point.
